<AbstractNarration>Exposure to a natural disaster can lead individuals and families to make inefficient decisions, some of which may involve risk.   Negative shocks often lead to increases in behaviors that results in bad outcomes that may persist into the long run.   However, the mechanisms through which natural disasters affect decision making are not known.  This research will use experimental methods to study the effects of a natural disaster on household decision making in the immediate aftermath of the natural disaster.  Specifically, the research will investigate the following: (i) what are the human and economic losses due to the disaster, (ii) the effects on health decisions such as medical testing, taking medications, (iii) changes in individual choices that may reinforce or reduce the initial effects, and (iv) how household cope with the disaster.  This project's findings can reveal many consequences of natural disasters: disruption of programs to combat epidemics such as HIV/AIDS or measles.  Understanding the mechanisms through which natural disasters affect decisions with risky outcomes will help policy makers to craft more effective ways to help reduce the damaging effects of natural disasters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project seeks to answer the following questions: (i) how does a natural disaster affect the health and economic outcomes of households in the immediate aftermath? (ii) how do household make decisions about health care immediately after the disaster? (iii) how do changes in individual preferences mediate these effects (will the disaster affect household risk or time preference)? and (iv) what mechanisms do households adopted to cope with the disaster?   The researchers will leverage prior randomization at the community and individual levels in an on-going project in the area to identify the causal effects of natural disaster on these outcomes.  A major contribution of this research project is the collection of ephemeral data on household preferences and healthy behaviors in the immediate aftermath of the disaster.   The presence of the research team in the disaster area allows the team to collect the appropriate ephemeral data.   The results of this research project will provide important data sets to study household behavior in the immediate aftermath of a disaster.  The results will also provide important inputs into policies to help victims of natural disasters in the US and around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Prior to Cyclone Idai's landfall in central Mozambique in mid-March 2019, this study team was about to initiate the second round of a panel household survey of more than 4,000 households in the areas most affected by the cyclone. This survey was to provide endline data for a study of the impact of a PEPFAR-funded program,&nbsp;<em>For&ccedil;a &agrave; Comunidade e Crian&ccedil;as</em> (FCC, "Strengthening Communities and Children"), which combats the HIV/AIDS crisis with an interrelated set of interventions (Yang et al 2019). The FCC program may help to shield HIV testing and treatment from the negative effects of the cyclone, by connecting households to local community support organizations as well as via microfinance interventions that improve household risk-coping.</p> <p>This grant provided funding to expand the follow-up survey to measure: 1) cyclone-driven human and economic losses, 2) cyclone impacts on HIV testing, treatment, and risky sexual behaviors (including transactional sex), 3) individual lab-experimental measures that may mediate the above effects (risk preferences, time preferences, and motivated reasoning biases), and 4) risk-coping mechanisms (e.g., credit and savings, risk-sharing in social networks).</p> <p>For outcomes from the 2019 follow-up survey, we estimate regressions with the disaster index on the right-hand side, and control for a vector of baseline covariates (including the baseline value of the outcome variable, when available). Figure 1 plots point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the disaster index coefficient, normalizing effect sizes by the outcome's standard deviation. First, we plot estimates of losses due to disaster exposure. This is a basic test of the quality of the disaster index: does it predict reported losses? Disaster exposure leads to higher likelihood of reported deaths and injuries, evacuation from one's home, asset losses, home damage, and food insecurity. For each outcome the disaster index is statistically significant at conventional levels. Coefficients are robust to exclusion or inclusion of control variables, reducing concerns about omitted variable bias. Effect magnitudes are large (e.g., a 1-std-dev higher disaster index leads to a 0.26-std-dev increase in asset losses.)</p> <p>Our key outcome of interest is safe sexual behaviors. We construct an index of safe sexual behaviors, the fraction of the following questions indicating safe behavior (safe response indicated). Means at baseline and follow-up are 0.516 and 0.538 respectively. Running a regression with this index of safe sexual behaviors as the dependent variable, we find that disaster exposure has a <em>positive</em> impact. We examine impacts on each index component: effects are driven by increases in partner HIV testing, reductions in sex with a partner known to have HIV, and reductions in transactional sex (both being paid and paying for sex).</p> <p>Why might disasters lead to safer sexual behavior? We turn to our measures of behavioral biases and economic/psychological preferences. Higher disaster exposure leads to lower levels of impatience, willingness to take risks, and present bias. All these reductions are statistically significant at conventional levels. Increases in safe sexual behavior following disaster exposure could be due to increased patience, higher risk aversion, and lower present bias.</p> <p>Next, we test our hypothesis that the FCC program has protective post-disaster effects. We estimate regression equations that add an interaction between the disaster index and the indicator for being an FCC treatment community, as well as the main effect of being an FCC treatment community, and graph coefficients in Figure 2 (normalized by each outcome standard deviation.) For each outcome, we show the point estimate (and 95% confidence interval) of the main effect of the disaster index, the main effect of the FCC treatment, and how FCC changes the disaster index coefficient.</p> <p>The FCC program enhances household coping mechanisms in the wake of disaster. Disaster exposure by itself increases use of two key coping mechanisms: receiving help from others, and coping using household savings; and the FCC program further raises households' propensity to use these coping mechanisms in when exposed to disaster (the interaction term is positive and significant). Enhanced post-disaster help from others in FCC areas may reflect improved social network connections facilitated by the program, while the effect on coping using savings is likely due to the program's VSLA component.</p> <p>This enhanced ability to cope with disaster in FCC treatment areas also leads to more positive changes in safe sexual behavior. Disaster exposure itself causes safer sexual behavior, and the more so in FCC treatment areas. FCC creates a context in which the beneficial effect of disasters on safe sexual behavior is magnified.</p> <p>These findings provide support for our hypothesis that the FCC program helps shield communities from the consequences of disaster exposure. Coping mechanisms such as help from others and use of own savings respond more to disaster exposure in FCC-treated areas than in control areas. Improvements in safe sexual behaviors due to disaster exposure are magnified in FCC areas.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/22/2020<br>      Modified by: Dean&nbsp;C&nbsp;Yang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931049/1931049_10604275_1595340940436_cyclone_idai_path--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931049/1931049_10604275_1595340940436_cyclone_idai_path--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 1: Cyclone Idai Path"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931049/1931049_10604275_1595340940436_cyclone_idai_path--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 1: Cyclone Idai Path"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cyclone Idai's path through the study area</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dean Yang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dean&nbsp;C&nbsp;Yang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 1: Cyclone Idai Path</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931049/1931049_10604275_1595341021658_proposal_figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931049/1931049_10604275_1595341021658_proposal_figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931049/1931049_10604275_1595341021658_proposal_figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Effects of Disaster Exposure</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dean Yang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dean&nbsp;C&nbsp;Yang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931049/1931049_10604275_1595341081091_proposal_figure_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931049/1931049_10604275_1595341081091_proposal_figure_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931049/1931049_10604275_1595341081091_proposal_figure_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Protective Effect of FCC Program</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dean Yang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dean&nbsp;C&nbsp;Yang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
