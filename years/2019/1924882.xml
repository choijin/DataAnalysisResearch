<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve food and health product safety in the US.  This can reduce the economic burden associated with disease and infection caused by bacteria on surfaces.  The proposed technology can be used to determine adherence to cleaning protocols that are used to keep food and healthcare facilities safe.  It can also be used to help monitor chronic wounds, thus reducing the number of clinical visits for routine status check-ups.  The ability to conduct real time measurement of biofilms in a closed environment is currently unavailable in the market.  This technology can potentially impact food safety and also health care markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will further develop a wireless sensor platform technology that is proposed for use in monitoring growth of biofilms or fluid build-up in closed systems such as bandages or on surfaces such as food preparation areas or healthcare counters. The sensor is a platform technology that consists of a flexible sensor, a reader, and algorithm to translate the wireless signal.  The sensor is a planar, Archimedean coil that is an open circuit inductor capacitor that forms a resonant structure.  It can be placed on or in surface materials or bandages.  As cells or a biofilm grow on the surface of the resonator, this changes the local dielectric and a large shift in the resonant frequency is observed.  This can be sampled wirelessly using a vector network analyzer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This I-Corps grant provided funds for a two-student team to participate in the I-Corps curriculum program and engage in 157 voice of customer interviews (151 in person) over the period of 8 weeks to determine critical needs in chronic wound management.  The team made a key discovery that their technology, previously centered on monitoring wound size or wound closure, missed the main customer need.  They found that the unmet need, which has larger financial implications, was infection, especially post-surgical infections.  The team completed their proof of concept work for an embedded wound closure sensor (ACS Sensor publication) and have begun work on a passive device to monitor infection.  Beyond the research insight to improve technology transfer and commercial impact, this program was transformative for the students’ education.  It allowed them the unique opportunity to interact with end-users of their technology.  These customer interaction skills were critical in the entrepreneurial lead’s subsequent job interviews with successful placement in world leading healthcare materials company.  In summary, the key findings from the VOC interviews were: 1) Wound care specialists do not have a pain point with the standard methods used to measure wounds for their size and depth, 2) Wound care specialists have issues with catching wound infections in a timely manner, 3) If the infection is acquired within the hospital, the hospital will not be reimbursed for any of the costs associated with treating the patient’s infection, 4) If your product is going to be sold to a larger biomedical company who will then sell to healthcare facilities, you do not need FDA approval of your product (but the large company does), 5) In order to obtain FDA approval, animal studies must be performed before the product can be tested on people, and 6) Trade shows and in-person interactions are the most valuable interactions a company can have with potential customers.
