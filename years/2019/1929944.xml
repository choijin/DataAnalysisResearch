<AbstractNarration>This is a grant to support a Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS) workshop. The workshop is designed to facilitate interaction between urban scholars and practitioners, and reinforce a foundation for holistic urban sustainability action. This workshop is to be driven by urban practitioners, informed by urban scholars, and grounded in existing and emerging real-world urban sustainability challenges. It will bring together urban sustainability practitioner networks and research networks to build a joint actionable research agenda for urban sustainability transformation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This actionable research agenda will apply the principles of co-production to incorporate new and existing knowledge from scientific, experiential, and indigenous sources to directly confront the challenge of urban sustainability transformations, all while remaining grounded in the needs of practitioners. This co-produced agenda, and integrating its ideas into active networks, research, and teaching initiatives, is targeted to to support movement towards sustainable urban systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
