<AbstractNarration>The goal of this Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS) workshop is to identify key sustainability issues associated with megapolitan growth and promising research areas that could be harnessed to promote a more equitable and healthy urban future. By convening a diversity of expertise across an array of disciplines, sectors, and locations, this conference aims to: (1) identify the key challenges megapolitan regions and their adjacent communities and natural spaces face as urbanization continues, (2) explore the myriad approaches used in megapolitan regions to address these challenges, and (3) synthesize this information to identify priority research areas that a research network could promote for improving urban systems sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In pursuing the megapolitan-focused approach, input will be solicited from a diversity of experts through an interdisciplinary, synthesis-focused agenda. The target to converge and focus on the most critical megapolitan challenges and opportunities and outline a framework for building strong, collaborative relationships. It is anticipated that the active engagement and participation of academics and industry with local governments and non-profit groups who are tasked with implementing sustainability initiatives will lead to a number of new partnerships and outputs. The end products from this conference, shared widely across the PI and co-PIs networks, will take form as a (1) white paper to NSF, (2) peer-reviewed synthesis article journal article, (3) "Green Print" for work managers and practitioners to help them transition material from the conference into their daily work, and (4) scope of work for informing future education and outreach products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF-funded Sustainable Urban Systems workshop focused on the concept of ?urban greening? in megapolitan areas as a lens to understand change within our human and natural systems.  Over 53 participants from academia, government, industry, non-profit organizations, and community groups came together to share insights ideas about how to improve urban sustainability.  In exploring the concept of ?greening,? participants grappled with issues of displacement, environmental injustice, and cumulative impacts, and explored the role of connectivity and resilience in shaping the future of urban and megapolitan systems.  Threaded throughout these conversations were calls for tighter, more conscientious engagement between researchers and community members to pursue science that can meaningfully improve management and livelihoods. Next generation urban research should focus on 1) the wealth of emerging data and the responsibility to use these data ethically, 2) the role that communities can play in helping shape urban research by using community members as partners, and 3) using adaptive management for the path towards a sustainable urban future.  Additionally, urban research needs to embrace the dichotomous and tensioned nature of displacement. This means understanding and explicitly investigating the winners and losers of any system change.   Key themes and issues for advancing sustainable urban systems research and implementation challenges and opportunities include:  Facilitating      Data-Driven Science and Policy: New technology and computing capabilities are allowing researchers to      generate and collect data at scales, and in volumes, that are      unprecedented. Modeling efforts that can incorporate these emerging and      vast data resources will be particularly important for characterizing      urbanizing areas, such as megapolitan areas, and for exploring the      longer-term consequences or benefits of proposed sustainability policies      or goals that are broadly focused or iterative in nature Displacement: In this workshop, discussions frequently pointed      to the mounting evidence that adding green infrastructure within      disadvantaged communities leads to gentrification. Yet, displacement isn?t      inherently only a negative consequence of change. In any system that is      evolving, displacement will bring both positive and negative results that      will be context-dependent, and scale-variable. Cumulative Impacts and co-benefits: Small contributions,      deletions, and alterations to a system may have little impact locally, but      when assessed over longer time periods or larger spatial scales, can      create measurable change, or cumulative impacts, that often result in      unwanted or unintended outcomes. As many urban communities embrace the      ?act local, think global? philosophy, new research needs to focus on the      role that co-benefits from coordinated, small changes can have on      achieving a wider set of urban sustainability goals through initiatives. Connectivity: New models that can map, interpret, and      interlink information about social processes with natural processes will      be critical for expanding our understanding of how human and natural      systems function across the rural-urban continuum. Resilience-who is impacted and how: Funding opportunities must      be designed to account for the dichotomous definition of ?resilience?. New      theories, models, and empirical work that can track, quantify, and predict      biophysical and human adaptive responses to change in urban environments      need to explicitly incorporate concepts of environmental justice. Community      Engagement: Any research that      has the potential to impact a human community should secure the support of those who would be potentially affected by the study and its results. This means researchers will need to invest in relationship-building interactions well in advance of proposal development to identify and earn the trust of key contacts or representatives for the system of study, show the demonstrated relevance of the project and its outcomes to all groups affected, and, as desired, include the community in the development of the research questions, methods, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of results Building Adaptive      Capacity: Urban      systems are extremely dynamic and complex, and urban governing bodies      could benefit greatly from conscientiously cultivating a culture that      embraces greater adaptive capacity to help communities within a      megapolitan region tackle positive transformation.
