<AbstractNarration>This proposal will facilitate US participation in the international workshop "Diophantine Approximation and Value Distribution Theory at the interface of Arithmetic and Complex Hyperbolic Geometry: a research workshop with minicourse".  The event will be held at the University of Quebec at Montreal (UQAM), Montreal, QC, during the time period 13-17 May 2019.  The workshop will center around spectacular recent progress in directions that are fundamental to the classification, arithmetic, and moduli of projective varieties, including topics in Diophantine approximation, value distribution theory, and hyperbolic geometry. The workshop will bring together researchers of all levels to discuss and exchange ideas across diverse, but interrelated, fields, and allow for recent results to be disseminated and studied in detail. A highlight of the workshop is the presentation of two minicourses to be given by Professors Pietro Corvaja and Ariyan Javanpeykar.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specific topics of interest for the workshop include Diophantine approximation, rational points and holomorphic curves, hyperbolicity of moduli spaces, and direct images of pluricanonical sheaves. A primary goal is to focus on advances in and around the main conjectures of Vojta and Lang, with emphasis on results that have consequences for the arithmetic and hyperbolic geometry of orbifolds, moduli spaces and nearby geometric objects.  Discussing these topics in tandem will facilitate cross-pollination of ideas and strengthen existing interactions between these areas. More details can be found on the conference webpage:&lt;br/&gt;http://cirget.uqam.ca/Diophantine//en/index.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Hyperbolicity of moduli spaces and direct images of pluricanonical sheaves.   In particular, the proposed workshop focused on some of the frontiers that are of special importance to Diophantine geometry and Nevanlinna's value distribution theory. In addition to talks on current research, a key feature of the workshop was the presentation of two  minicourses aimed at graduate students and young researchers.  The project provided support for 13 researchers, a majority of which were graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, to participate in the workshop. Seven of the funded participants gave talks on recent research. The workshop facilitated the dissemination of current research results and provided unique opportunities for international collaborations among the participants.
