<AbstractNarration>The two-month summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program based at the University of Central Oklahoma (UCO) will engage students in a three-phase, immersive learning experience within an international setting (Lesvos, Greece). Honey bees, native to Greece and throughout Eurasia, will serve as the model study organism for the program. Honey bees pollinate billions of dollars of crops worldwide each year and impact both native and nonnative plants (including agricultural crops) throughout North America. In recent decades, environmental changes have dramatically decreased honey bees numbers in the United States. This decrease is the result of Colony Collapse Disorder as well as global pollinator decline. In addition to pesticides, parasites, and pathogens (all implicated in pollinator decline), climate change contributes to a “perfect storm” of ecosystem alterations that negatively affect pollinators. This program will engage undergraduate students in the examination of the ability of honey bees and other bee species to withstand immediate and long-term effects of temperature change and associated long-term plant community changes using behavioral, physiological, and ecological approaches. Given the economic and environmental implications of pollinator decline, student communication of these findings to both the public and the scientific community is a key objective. Students will be encouraged throughout the program to engage in public outreach using a variety of science communication resources. Arguably the birthplace of the scientific process, Greece provides an opportunity for students to learn scientific principles within a geographic region of great historical significance as well as experience collaborating on global-scale, scientific problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site award to the University of Central Oklahoma (UCO) will support and train seven students per year for a total of 21 students during the lifetime of the grant. These student participants will be recruited primarily from institutions and backgrounds that would otherwise provide limited opportunities in STEM research. Participants will be selected based upon criteria that include measures of academic performance and an essay as to why participation in the project will be important to the students’ careers. One student, with a background in communication, will be specifically recruited to serve as the lead scientific communicator. This student will use both traditional and social forms of media to disseminate student participation in and the results of the program. The program has three phases, the first of which will include a mini-course at UCO that includes Responsible Conduct in Research and mentorship training. The second phase will consist of a longer period of field and laboratory research in Greece where students will engage in a team-based investigation of one of the best documented plant-pollinator ecosystems in the world. All field research will be conducted on the island of Lesvos in collaboration with Greek scientists from the University of the Aegean at Mytilene. Hypotheses will test predictions about the role of climate change in (1) altering plant-pollinator interactions (using short-term perturbation experiments), (2) pollinator learning capacities (with proven behavioral assays), and (3) the physiological responses of pollinators to temperature change (using measurements of thermal limits). The program will conclude at UCO with student presentations. Post-program analysis will consist of surveys conducted by UCO that assess the program’s research experience impact on participants’ perceptions of their own growth in scientific aptitude and the acquisition of pertinent scientific skill sets (computation, experimental design, etc.). Research findings will inform growing concerns about the impact of climate change on plant-pollinator systems in a model Mediterranean as well as both natural and agricultural ecosystems throughout the USA where honey bees were introduced nearly four centuries ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
