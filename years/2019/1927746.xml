<AbstractNarration>This award is partial support of the 2019 Foundations of Process Analytics and Machine Learning (FOPAM) conference on August 5-9, 2019 in Raleigh, North Carolina. The aim of this conference is to bring together industry and academic researchers to discuss the current status and future directions in data analytics and machine learning relevant to the chemical process industries. The funds will provide support to junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students that may not have the financial support to attend the workshop. The conference also will include optional educational workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on the topic of data analytics tools as applied to problems encountered in the chemical process industries. The tools can be applied to processes regardless of whether the underlying phenomena are biological, physical, or chemical. The conference will address topics in data analytics and high-throughput data process for process monitoring and diagnosis; machine learning for process and control design; computational chemistry/materials analytics; reinforcement learning as applied to process operations and control; and, synergies among process, materials, business, and supply chain data analytics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
