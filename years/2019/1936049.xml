<AbstractNarration>The goal of the ComputerScienceForGeorgia (CS4GA) workshop will apply research and a variety of intervention experiences to a specific community in order to make computer science (CS) education available and accessible to all students within that community context.  While there is industry and parental support for CS in K12, the process of adding a new discipline has both systemic and community context specific nuisances. In order to effectively add a new discipline to an already packed school day without marginalizing large groups of students and whole communities, it is important to not only address the systemic processes and stimulate awareness among the various stakeholder groups but also to understand the barriers endemic to particular context, including but not limited to the location and population density of a community.  This project builds  on a current INCLUDES pilot initiative and can offer insights to a diversity of community stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
