<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the International Beacon Satellite Symposium that will be held at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland on August 18-23, 2019 (BSS2019). This meeting is an important international conference with a particular focus on communication and navigation satellites that exploit radio propagation properties of the Earth's upper atmosphere. The award provides travel support and participant expenses for US scientists and students to attend the conference as well as subsistence support for non-US scientists from developing countries. The Beacon Satellite Symposium provides a unique opportunity for US scientists and students working with global satellite constellations to meet scientists from all over the world to share knowledge on radio propagation through the upper atmosphere and implications for satellite techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium is a premiere international symposium dedicated to satellite studies. It provides unparalleled benefits for US scientists and students to develop potential collaborations and partnerships worldwide, to learn of the international advancements in their fields, and to share their knowledge on a global scale. Studies using satellites have gained new momentum and perspectives with recent developments in imaging and remote sensing techniques, data assimilation models, distributed arrays of measurements, monitoring natural hazards from space, national and international space weather activities, and satellite-based navigation and communication systems.  This symposium is a unique opportunity for US scientists and students to gain a worldwide perspective on the state of the art of these research topics. It will also present opportunities for global collaboration and data sharing. Finally, it may open opportunities for international exchange for US students to work in global laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 19th International Beacon Satellite Symposium (BSS2019) was held at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland on 19-23 August 2019.  The BSS symposia are the primary event held triennially by the Beacon Satellite Studies Group of the International Union of Radio Scientists (URSI) Commission G.  The Beacon satellite group is interdisciplinary, service science, research, application and engineering interests. These interests include all aspects of satellite signals observed on the ground and by receivers on-board satellites. These meetings provide unique opportunities for ionospheric scientists from all over the world to meet and collaborate on the ionospheric effects on radio propagation and space weather.  The most recent BSS symposium was a great success with many sessions dedicated to space weather characteristics and effects; monitoring the ionosphere and space weather with ground and space-based receivers, radio occultation techniques and measurements, advances in ionospheric modeling and much more.  The opening session included welcome remarks by Olsztyn officials, Dr. Andrzej Krankowski (Chair of the LOC) and Patricia Doherty (URSI Commission G Chair and Chair of the Beacon Satellite Studies Group). Session descriptions, abstracts and the program can be viewed on the symposium website: bss2019.uwm.edu.pl.
