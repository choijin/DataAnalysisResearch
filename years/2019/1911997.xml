<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;The Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School is committed to diversity and inclusion, and has been proactive in promoting the participation of underrepresented minorities in Quantum Materials research. Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School, also has an active public outreach effort to share learning materials with members of the public. This workshop will help ensure long-term vigor of Quantum Materials as a research enterprise to allow those activities to continue. The workshop organizers will strive to include a good range of career stages and backgrounds among the participants. This workshop will also strengthen connections within physical science communities, as well as within partners with whom the Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School collaborates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;By bringing together leading experts from the U.S. with an interdisciplinary and diverse crowd including physicists, chemists, and materials scientists, participants gain a basic functional knowledge of how to plan and carry out synthesis relevant to the study of quantum materials. In addition, this workshop facilitates a unique experience for participants to interact with some of the top researchers in the field while networking with fellow peers. The structure of the school includes mornings of pedagogical lectures by ten of the nation's top practicing quantum materials scientists, with afternoons devoted to practical demonstrations in laboratories in the University of Maryland's Center for Nanophysics and Advanced Materials. The school also includes a visit to the National Institute of Standards and Technology and a poster session attended by senior scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The FQM Winter School is aimed at providing fundamental training to our current and future generations of Quantum Materials scientists in synthesis and characterization techniques, bringing together senior and junior scientists to address topics at the forefront of current research into quantum materials, while also providing pedagogical background and practical training for junior scientists. With an interdisciplinary and diverse crowd including physicists, chemists, and materials scientists, participants gain a basic functional knowledge of how to plan and carry out synthesis relevant to the study of quantum materials, and experience a unique opportunity to interact with some of the top researchers in the field while networking with fellow peers.   The theme for this yearâ€™s Winter School was focused on Materials for Quantum Information, several world-renowned experts discussed particular challenges and techniques relevant to working with materials that are relevant to quantum information and computing  The accomplishments of the 2019 Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School and Workshop are providing 28 junior scientists with training by 14 instructors from institutions and national labs with renowned expertise in a variety of synthesis approaches, followed by a one-day workshop attended by the school participants, that would bring together a small cohort of senior and junior scientists to address topics at the forefront of current research into quantum materials.  Feedback received from the junior scientists on the school activities was very strong, indicating a well-chosen curriculum, organization of practical activities and topics, and overall logistics.
