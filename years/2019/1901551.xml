<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a multi-day workshop to be hosted by the School for Advanced Research in Santa, FE New Mexico in October 2019. Participants in the workshop will develop the concept of "biological normalcy" by using a series of case studies to understand the relationships between statistical norms for, and normative social views of, biological variation within human populations, and the broader implications of these relationships. By bringing to light the normative (and often ethno-biocentric) language used to describe human biological variation, the goal of the workshop is to expose and reduce bias in discourse about biological variation and develop new ways of describing it. The language used to describe human variation has direct relevance to clinical and public health, where treatments and policies may be aimed at "normalizing"  biological measures that are viewed as "non-normal," deviant, or pathological. To maximize the impact of this workshop, time during the final phase will be dedicated to developing dissemination plans for each participant and the group, with an emphasis on academic, applied, and public outreach that will emphasize communication and education as well as public engagement.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological normalcy serves as a conceptual framework to better understand and describe human biological variation from a biocultural perspective.  The outcomes of this workshop will advance biocultural research in anthropology by elaborating this framework, which emphasizes the bidirectional relationships between biology and culture. Over the past twenty-five years biocultural anthropologists have learned much about how social or cultural factors influence biology, but relatively little about how the distribution of biological traits in a population influence social norms.  Using the biological normalcy framework, the two meanings of normal are untangled, revealing the relationships between the two, and the ways that ethno-biocentric views may exist in discourse about human biological variation are exposed. The workshop is structured as a three day intensive session, with each day having a mix of individual presentations, group discussion, and small group research. Participants will focus on the causes and consequences of relationships between statistical norms and normative views, with each providing material on specific biological or biobehavioral traits (such as growth, body proportions, sleep, diet, among others), and investigate the ways that ethno-biocentric views may exist in discourse about these traits and their variability within and across populations. Funds support travel costs for a diverse group of participants in various career stages to and from the School for Advanced Research in Santa Fe, NM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We held a three-day workshop with ten participants at the School for Advanced Research in Santa Fe New Mexico in late October on the topic of ?Biological Normalcy: Investigating Relationships between Statistical Norms and the Normative.?  Our primary goal was to advance the concept of ?biological normalcy? as a new framework for the analysis of human biological variation in anthropology by examining the relationships between normative social views of, and statistical norms for biological variation within our species. An additional goal was to develop new ways to describe human biological variation that are non-ethno-biocentric, i.e. descriptions that do not make assumptions about what is "normal" human biology. Finally, we wanted to consider the broader implications of these relationships, particularly in relation to health policy and practice.    Each participant was responsible for a case study of a human biological characteristic (e.g. height, weight, sleep patterns, diet, etc.) and provided specific data on both the statistical distribution and normative views related to that topic on the first day.  On day two the participants discussed potential causal relationships between statistical norms and normative views, with attention paid to the directionality of such relationships. They addressed the question of the levels at which ideas about biological normalcy might be operating (global, national, local) as well as the factors driving social changes in our definitions of biological normalcy.  There was full group discussion on the ways in which biological normalcy may shape public policies with an emphasis on how pressures for easy-to-use standardization in medical and public health practice can emphasize the difference between categories of "normal" and "abnormal".  On the final day participants worked on changes in language use that might help to describe observed human biological variation in a non-ethno-biocentric way, considered how evolutionary theory could provide such vocabulary, and discussed the role of anthropology in advancing an enriched understanding of human biological variation that could be employed in policy-making.   Progress of the session was posted live on various social media platforms, using the twitter handle @BioNormalcy and the hashtags #biologicalnormalcy, #whatisnormal, and #bionormalcy.  The case studies were accepted for presentation in panels for several major conferences, including the American Anthropological Association in November 2019 (which was very well attended).  A session with a set of three case studies was accepted for the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in February 2020.  This topic with additional case studies was also accepted as the Human Biology Association plenary session in April 2020, with co-PI Wiley set to deliver the distinguished Pearl lecture on this topic. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, the latter was postponed until April 2021.  A foundational brief on biological normalcy by the co-PIs has been published in Evolution, Medicine and Public Health.  Plans are underway for publication of a special issue of American Journal of Human Biology on this topic.  We will bring in additional scholars to address other topics within the framework of biological normalcy, and anticipate a series of research projects that evaluate the relationships between statistical distributions/norms and cultural norms.
