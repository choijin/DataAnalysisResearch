<AbstractNarration>The development of sustainable technologies is crucial for the welfare of future generations in the United States and for the economic viability of manufacturers committed to sustainable production processes and materials. In order to lower the environmental impact of human activities at a national and international scale, there is a need for the development of value-added products from local biomass. It is possible to enhance some properties of biomass through the use of a controlled heat treatment in the absence of oxygen (torrefaction). Torrefaction is a thermal process to convert biomass into a coal-like material, which has better fuel characteristics than the original biomass. Torrefied biomass is more brittle, making grinding easier and less energy intensive. Heat-treated  (torrefied) biomass can be more easily processed, leading to more homogeneous products for energy applications. The goal of this project is to refine a mathematical model describing the kinetics of biomass pyrolysis to more accurately determine the best treatment conditions for different biomass. Such a model will allow manufacturers to tailor heat treatment to specific biomass sources, ensuring optimal properties in the final products and providing control over the reproducibility of those properties. This project will provide US students of a diverse background and limited research and international experience, hands-on training in cutting-edge technical skills while partnering with a world-class laboratory for wood research in France. Its advanced and specialized unique facilities put it at the forefront of technology development worldwide for the heat treatment of ligno-cellulosic materials. The US students? experience will be complemented by professional development activities that will guide them in fine-tuning their communication skills (scientific writing and presentation), making strategic plans for their careers in science, and disseminating the results of their work. Ultimately, participants in this project will gain knowledge and skills necessary for the increased economic growth and technological innovation of the United States of America.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IRES (track I) project is a ten-week annual program in which four US students conduct research projects focused on studying biomass torrefaction kinetics in a renowned laboratory at the University of Lorraine, in Epinal, France. After returning to the US, they validate their findings using local biomass at Georgia Southern University. In addition to the research component, the program includes a series of professional development activities that were proven successful by the PI and co-PI in their department?s summer undergraduate research experience program over the past several years. Therefore, this project utilizes an established, solid framework for the assessment, recruitment, and professional development of the participants. The research plan consists of four separate projects tied together by a common goal. The four proposed projects are (1) Refinement of a mathematical model describing pyrolysis of biomass by incorporation of modules associated to mineral content, reaction atmosphere, and nature of ligno-cellulosic biomass (hardwood vs softwood), (2) Data acquisition on the effect of mineral content on torrefaction of biomass, (3) Data acquisition on the effect of reaction atmosphere on torrefaction of biomass, and (4) Data acquisition on the effect of biomass nature (harwood vs softwood) on torrefaction of biomass. The data acquired in projects (2), (3), and (4) will be used in project (1) for refinement and improvement of the mathematical model. Upon continuous revision of the mathematical model over the course of the funding period, a better expression will be obtained, providing further insight about the torrefaction mechanism. Indeed, a mathematical model describing the kinetics of biomass pyrolysis will more accurately determine the best treatment conditions for different biomass, allowing manufacturers to adjust heat treatment to specific biomass sources, further ensuring property optimization in the final products while providing greater control over the process and properties? reproducibility. This can potentially eradicate two of the major impediments to widespread commercial use of biomass, namely (1) inherent variability in the results and (2) the inability to control the outcome. Overall, this project is a combination of cutting-edge research in sustainable energy and training of future U.S. workforce in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
