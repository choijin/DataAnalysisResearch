<AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support to increase the diversity of speakers and enhance student participation at the 77th Device Research Conference (DRC) to be held from June 23 to 26, 2019 at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The conference will focus on a variety of devices including those based on organic and inorganic semiconductors, as well as spin and quantum devices. The Conference will host world-renowned researchers in advanced devices as invited speakers, whose expertise range from design, to fabrication characterization and applications. In addition to technical talks, short courses on highly relevant topics presented by renowned world experts will greatly enhance the usefulness of the conference to attendees. The technical program will provide student participants with the opportunity to gain exposure to new materials and devices, their basic physics, and their engineering applications. Exposing the next generation of researchers to these important disciplines is critical to maintain the supply of STEM workers with the skillsets necessary to address emerging commercial trends. The information will be disseminated through the conference proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We received NSF support for student participation and scientific exchange at the 77th Device Research Conference (DRC).1 The DRC has a University setting (this year was held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor), and a strong tradition of involvement from researchers around the world.  Yet, the DRC?and the device research community as a whole?stands to benefit from an increase in the invited speakers at the conference and enhanced exchange. Additionally, student involvement is a hallmark of the DRC, with traditionally strong student attendance to its short courses, poster session and oral presentations; however, student participation is strictly tied to the ability of offering a discounted student registration rate.  DRC has a history of offering discounted student registration fees, for general attendance and short courses, in order to encourage student participation and attendance from additional students who are not presenting an abstract.  To these ends, $9,000 of the NSF grant was used to discount student registration to the general conference.  With 96 student registrants, we reduced the student registration by ~$90 per student, in addition to not increasing registration from the previous year. Another $1,000 of the NSF grant was used to discount registration for the short course so as to make it more affordable for students to attend.  The short course cost came out to be $60 per student attendee and there were 23 students who attended.  Overall, the 2019 meeting was outstanding, with close to 200 attendees, roughly 50% of which were students.  As mentioned above, the conference was held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor campus from June 23-26, 2019.  The technical program of the conference was composed of 3 plenary papers, 13 invited talks, 35 contributed oral papers, and 50 contributed posters. Altogether, about 76% of contributed papers were student papers, higher than in the previous year.  To capture late-breaking device developments, the program also included 9 late news with 3 being oral papers and 6 being posters.      1 http://www.deviceresearchconference.org         Last Modified: 01/08/2020       Submitted by: J.
