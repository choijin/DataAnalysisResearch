<AbstractNarration>This award will support student and postdoctoral attendance at the Annual ACM/SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms Science (SODA) 2019, in San Diego, CA on January 6  to 9, 2019.  SODA is co-sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).  SODA is the premier annual research conference in the field of discrete algorithms and one of the three premier conferences in theoretical computer science. SODA has been meeting annually since 1990 and in a typical year has approximately 4000 attendees.  It is co-located with three smaller workshops, ALENEX (Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experimentation), ANALCO (Meeting on Analysis of Algorithms), and SOSA (Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms).  SODA is attended by researchers all over the world.  The field of algorithms is a vibrant one, with high participation rates from young researchers, and many papers with student authors. For these student authors and student attendees, the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide partial support to approximately thirty students, partly defraying the cost of travel and lodging.  Efforts will be made to support students from under represented groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), cosponsored by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) and the Associate for Computing Machinery (ACM ) is the premier conference in the areas of dicrete algorithms.  It covers many areas, including combinatorial structures, discrete optimization, discrete probability, finite metric spaces, graph theory, mathematical programming, random structures, and topological problem. SODA covers core topics in discrete algorithms, such as algorithm analysis, data structures, and experimental algorithmics. It also includes algorithmic aspects of other areas of computer science, such as combinatorial scientific computing, communication networks and the Internet, computational geometry and topology, computer graphics and computer vision, computer systems, data compression,cryptography and security, databases and information retrieval, distributed and parallel computing, game theory and mechanism design, machine learning, and quantum computing.   This grant funded  30 students to attend the conference.  The majority of these students made presentations and either the SODA conference or one of its affiliated workshops.  Through attending the conference, these students were exposed to many of the leading researchers in the area and to the most recent research in discrete algorithms. The broader impacts include that the grant  willencourage and facilitate the participation of under-represented groups in a top-tier computer science conference. Second, it will contribute towards attracting more under-represented groups to computer science research giving students an opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional and social exchanges that SODA fosters. Finally, the conference itself and all conference attendees will benefit from the greater attendance and consequently higher proportion of students and under-represented groups that this travel grant will make possible.
