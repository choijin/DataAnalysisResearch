<AbstractNarration>Reducing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), a significant long-lived greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere is a major challenge. Despite efforts toward the capture and storage of CO2, its conversion to valued-added chemicals could provide an important incentive for CO2 recycling. The development of practical chemical systems that enable conversion of CO2 into fine chemicals via continuous industrial processes is a significant hurdle. Metal nanoparticles dispersed in silicates are a class of materials that may meet this challenge. Dr. Fotie at Southeastern Louisiana University is developing an understanding of how nanoparticles derived from expensive, precious metals convert CO2 to useful chemicals. This understanding is then being applied to improving the performance of less active but more earth-abundant metals. Dr. Fotie is actively engaged in outreach activities that build upon his research to promote engagement of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These activities are providing a unique opportunity to create a research environment combining three very different groups of students at different stages of their education; high school students from the Southeastern Louisiana University Math-Science Upward-Bound program, Southeastern Louisiana University undergraduate students, and Southeastern Integrated Science and Technology (ISAT) masterâ€™s students. This unique leaning environment is enabling the students to observe and interact with science professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Fotie from Southeastern Louisiana University is developing a fundamental understanding of the reactivity of very active and ligandless precious metals (Pt and Pd) and one earth-abundant metal (Fe).  These metals are nano-dispersed in a range of sol-gel-derived organically-modified silicates and their behavior toward the reductive functionalization of CO2 by organosilanes is observed. Control experiments and kinetic studies are undertaken to provide insights into the mechanisms of these catalytic systems.  The research team is investigating the reusability and recycling lifetime of these catalysts.  These studies may provide answers to fundamental questions about catalyst viability for a streamline fixation and conversion of CO2 into useful building blocks. Dr. Fotie is actively engaged in STEM outreach programs focused on the recruitment of high-school students from low-income families, minorities, and groups under-represented in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
