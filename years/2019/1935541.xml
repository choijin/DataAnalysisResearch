<AbstractNarration>Groundwater is an important resource for drinking water and food production. However, groundwater is being depleted across Earth. This conference is focused on the sustainability of heavily stressed groundwater resources. The conference provides a venue to discuss groundwater hydrology and groundwater supply and demand. The goal is to identify new pathways toward groundwater sustainability.  These pathways will incorporate water law, human-induced stresses, the protection of natural resources, and data analysis tools. The conference brings together a diverse group of researchers from the hydrology, law, economics, and social science communities. The conference emphasizes the active participation and involvement of early-career scientists and underrepresented scientists from the U.S., which is well-aligned with the NSF's goal of developing the next generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Groundwater is a critical resource for drinking water and food production, yet limited management amid intensive use has led to aquifer depletion across the globe. Efforts to address this depletion have been stymied by an incomplete understanding of aquifer dynamics, data limitations, a mismatch between law and science, along with a variety of socio-economic, cultural, and political factors. An AGU Chapman conference on aquifer depletion and the prospects for attaining more sustainable conditions in the United States and across the globe was held at the Universitat Polit&egrave;cnica de Val&egrave;ncia in Spain October 21-24, 2019. This grant provided support for students, early career professionals (pre-tenure faculty and postdoctoral fellows), and invited speakers to attend the conference. The supported participants joined a diverse group of researchers from the hydrology, law, economics, and social science communities with an interest in aquifer sustainability. Invited presentations by speakers from the developing and developed world provided the basis for wide-ranging discussions of the most critical data needs; the appropriate scale for aquifer analyses; assessments of supply and demand from the local to global scales; and proposals for paths forward that incorporate governance, the likely trajectory of anthropogenic stresses, the protection of natural processes, and the evolution of modeling and analysis tools. The conference gave the supported students an excellent opportunity to enhance their professional development and expand their research networks.

The insights from those presentations and discussions should aid in the charting of a more sustainable future for the world's heavily stressed aquifers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/20/2021<br>      Modified by: Krsna&nbsp;Powell</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
