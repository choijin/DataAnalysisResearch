<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for US-based participants in the international conference "Non-Isolated Singularities and Derived Geometry" to be held at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (Cuernavaca, Mexico), during the period July 29 - August 3, 2019. The event will bring together early-career and senior researchers as well as students. Along with research presentations intended to disseminate recent developments, it will include introductory lectures at a level accessible to graduate students. There will also be discussion sessions, to better strengthen connections among the various research groups represented and to provide accessibility for junior researchers and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focus is on the topological study of singular algebraic and analytic varieties.  The program includes the following topics, each driven by recent and fundamental advances: (1) Geometry and topology of non-isolated singularities; (2) Characteristic classes of singular varieties; (3) Perverse sheaves and mixed Hodge modules; (4) Lipschitz geometry. The proposed topics intersect a broad range of research endeavors in fields ranging from pure mathematics to more applied areas, thus conference participants will reflect a broad cross-section of mathematical disciplines. In recent decades, the basic tools involved in the study of singularities have branched out into a myriad of mathematical territories, and it increasingly becomes important to provide an opportunity such as this conference for experts in the various related specializations to interact and cross-pollinate. For more details about the conference, please see: http://www.matcuer.unam.mx/DavidMassey60th/index.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
