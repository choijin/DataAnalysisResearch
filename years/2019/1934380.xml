<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for support of student travel to the 27th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2019), Oct. 27-30, 2019. For over 50 years, SOSP has been a leading forum for innovative research in operating systems. Continuing in the SOSP tradition, SOSP 2019 will bring together leading researchers and luminaries in the field and will feature the best and brightest of the PhD candidates in computer systems. Participants present and discuss their research and experience and cover the full range of theory and practice.  The goal of SOSP and this travel grant is to advance science by bringing together researchers from across the computer systems community - including distributed systems, operating systems, and broad computer systems - to foster cross disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well suited as a target for student participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant support the attendance of at least 12 US-based graduate and undergraduate students. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of graduate students and advanced undergraduate students - school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work. This award provides a concrete opportunity to broaden participation. Funds will be dispersed with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference, paying particular attention to diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This award requested funding to support the attendance of about 12 US-based graduate students to the 27th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2019) and the co-located Diversity Workshop that was held on October 27, 2019 (http://sigops.org/sosp/sosp19/index.html).   For 50 years since 1967, SOSP has been the premier forum for innovative research in operating systems. Continuing in the SOSP tradition, SOSP 2019 brought together 589 leading researchers and luminaries in the field and featured 276 of the best and brightest of the Ph.D. candidates in computer systems. Participants presented and discussed their research and experience and covered the full range of theory and practice. In addition to such traditional topics as the performance, functionality, and security of kernels, file systems, and networks, this year’s conference placed increasing attention on such emerging topics as cloud and mobile computing, power management, and others. Particularly noteworthy papers will be forwarded to ACM Transactions on Computer Systems for possible journal publication. There was also poster and work-in-progress sessions of promising preliminary work.   For more than 10 years, the Diversity Workshop at SOSP has provided a forum for female and minority students at the graduate and advanced undergraduate levels who have interests in computer systems research.   This award funded and supported the attendance and participation of about 17 US-based graduate and undergraduate students. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of graduate students and advanced undergraduate students’ school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work. The support from this award made it possible for the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend.  Of the 589 total attendees, 276 were students students, 84 qualified student trave; applications were received and all funded, 17 of which using NSF funding.  Further, of the 589 attendees, 89 were women (15%), 8 were URM (1.4%), 116 did not specify.          Last Modified: 12/05/2020       Submitted by: Hakim Weatherspoon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
