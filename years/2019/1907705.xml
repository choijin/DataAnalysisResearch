<AbstractNarration>Dense suspensions composed of solid particles suspended in a fluid exhibit a wide range of surprising mechanical behavior, including a dramatic increase in viscosity under increasing flow rates. This phenomenon, known as shear thickening, can be exploited for important applications, including energy dissipation, shock absorption and impact resistance.  However, shear thickening can also produce undesirable effects in material transport and processing. While substantial progress has been made in understanding shear thickening in suspensions of spherical and other compact particles, much less is known about shear thickening in suspensions of rod-like particles. These systems can show dramatic shear thickening at particle concentrations much lower than the concentration required for shear thickening in suspensions of spherical particles.  This suggests the possibility that suspensions with relatively low concentrations of very long rods can take advantage of shear thickening behavior in applications, or present challenges in material transport when shear thickening is not helpful. The dynamics of the orientations of the flowing rods is a critical determinant of the properties of suspensions of rods. This work seeks to characterize and understand the orientation dynamics in the shear thickening regime to enable prediction and control of the viscosity of rapidly flowing suspensions. The research team will also participate with the Science/Policy interface, a pilot project to involve a materials science graduate student in an interdisciplinary group project in science policy, and with outreach activities aimed at economically disadvantaged high school students through hands-on soft materials modules for use in the Georgetown University College Immersion Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to characterize shear thickening in suspensions of colloidal silica rods, which can be synthesized with a range of aspect ratios, and to utilize novel techniques to determine the dynamics of rod orientations and&lt;br/&gt;directly measure stress fluctuations during shear thickening. Using a customized high resolution microscope coupled with commercial rheometers, the investigators will be able to directly measure the spatially and temporally resolved orientation dynamics of the particles. In parallel, they will use a new technique they have developed to measure boundary stresses locally. Combining these two techniques will enable the team to determine the interplay between orientation fluctuations and stress fluctuations, and therefore identify the dynamical characteristics that determine shear thickening. The researchers will then extend this approach to silica rods with controlled nanoscale roughness. Orientation plays a critical role in the behavior of anisotropic molecules and particles, and the ability to control orientation through flow, external fields, or boundary effects is central to a wide range of commercial applications. The proposed research will develop and test novel tools and methods for characterizing the role of orientation in rod suspensions, and provide the characterization necessary to identify opportunities to manipulate particle orientation to control shear thickening. More generally, the proposed research will support the development and dissemination of a powerful techniques for measuring and analyzing orientation and stress dynamics of flowing suspensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
