<AbstractNarration>The SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) International Conference on Data Mining (SDM) is one of the top-tier conferences in the field of data mining. It provides a venue for researchers who are addressing problems in data mining to present their work in a peer-reviewed forum. The doctoral forum consists of a poster session for Ph.D. candidates in data mining or closely related areas or Ph.D. students who have made significant progress towards Ph.D. candidacy. The Ph.D. student forum participants will be able to present their work, interact with their peers from other universities as well as hundreds of leading researchers in data mining from around the world. Each student participant in the Doctoral Forum will be assigned a senior researcher to serve as a mentor on a variety of career-related issues and they also can attend the technical sessions, plenary talks, and tutorials and workshops at the conference to touch the frontier of data mining research. To encourage doctoral student participation and to recognize outstanding dissertation research in data mining being conducted by Ph.D. students, SDM 2019 will have awards for the best posters presented at the SDM 2019 Doctoral Forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2019 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2019) is being organized by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in cooperation with the American Statistical Association.  SDM 2019 will be held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada from May 2 to May 4, 2019. Funds provide travel support for approximately 10 graduate students from universities in the United States to attend SDM 2019 and to provide travel support for approximately 16 Ph.D. candidate from institutions in the United States to participate in a Doctoral Forum that is to be held as part of SDM 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
