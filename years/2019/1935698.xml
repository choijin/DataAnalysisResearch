<AbstractNarration>The annual IFIP WG 11.3 Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy (DBSec) is one of the oldest conferences in cyber security and privacy research. It was established in 1986 as a working conference with the goal of developing and advancing security and privacy technologies primarily in database management systems. A unique aspect of this conference is that it is structured so that participants have ample time to discuss their work, provide comments and feedback on others' and share research ideas. The 2019 DBSec Conference will consist of approximately 20 technical papers across a wide spectrum of data and applications security and privacy domains. The conference invites leading researchers every year for keynote talks. Participation in the conference is a valuable opportunity to students and is an important part of graduate education in cyber-security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides travel support to students from universities and colleges in the South Eastern USA states, including South Carolina and Tennessee's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), to attend the 33rd Annual IFIP WG 11.3 Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field as demonstrated by statement of research, CV showing research output, coursework and/or project experience, and a statement on how participation in the conference would benefit the student's research and education.  Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[NSF Student Travel Grant for   33rd Annual IFIP WG 11.3 Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy 2019 (DBSec'19)     The NSF Student Travel Grant supported 11 students.   The grant provided registration cost for all students and variable support for lodging, per diem and transportation, as needed.  The students unanimously felt that they benefitted from participating in the conference.  The main goals of the project were to 1) provide a collaborative cybersecurity research environment for graduate students enrolled in South Eastern regional colleges, and 2) to increase enrollment of underrepresented minorities (URM) and women in graduate studies.   Both of these goals were achieved:  In addition to the 11 students funded by NSF, the PI secured funding from UofSC for additional 5 Ph.D. students.  All 16 funded students were introduced to each other and the other conference attendees. The NSF fund provided support to 7 undergraduate students, 6 of them from Claflin University and Benedict College.  Both of these institutions are HBCUs with strong computer science programs and current efforts to develop cybersecurity curriculum.  These students expressed strong interest in graduate studies in computing.  During the conference the undergraduate students interacted with the graduate students, discussed graduate education, life during Ph.D. studies, and funding options.  Attending the conference allowed the student to interact with internationally renowned researchers who are conducting creative and groundbreaking cybersecurity research.   With the lack of major cybersecurity research conferences in the state of South Carolina this conference presented a unique opportunity to for students in the South Eastern region. Our anticipation is that by reaching out to regional HBCUs will lead to increased participation of URM and women students in graduate computing programs.  Introducing these students to high quality international research will motivate these students to continue their studies in cybersecurity graduate programs.   The student programs at the conference will aid the development of a supportive community of scholars.       Last Modified: 03/29/2020       Submitted by: Csilla Farkas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
