<AbstractNarration>Acoustic waves are a powerful resource for radio frequency and photonic technologies.  Cellular phones, for example, require a number of precisely designed filters based off of acoustic waves.  In addition to traditional applications such as filters, recently emerging quantum technologies are also seeing a steady increase in tasks that benefit from acoustic waves.  However, in general, photonic devices based off of acoustic waves are limited in performance by the qualities of the acoustic waves that can be accessed.  The objective of this research is to significantly improve the performance of such devices by engineering optical access to a much wider range of acoustic waves, with properties that are particularly beneficial for applications.  By the specific design of novel waveguides and geometries for supporting the optical and acoustic waves, new physics and application performance regimes become available.  The proposed research is expected to improve the coherence, resolution, and sensitivity of optically mediated acoustic wave technologies including filters, lasers, and quantum information devices.  Beyond these technical advances, this program focuses on several advances for education, diversity, and society.  In addition to graduate student research support and mentorship, this program will enable advanced material for a research techniques course.  Finally, it will broaden access to advanced laser sources for smaller research groups and expand undergraduate research opportunities for students from first-generation college, low-income, and underrepresented minority backgrounds, in collaboration with the University of Rochester’s Kearns Center for Leadership and Diversity.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to optically control acoustic waves with frequencies and dissipation levels spanning several orders of magnitude, demonstrating new physical phenomena and enabling important performance advances for microwave and quantum photonic devices.  Current optomechanical devices are limited in coherence, resolution, transduction, and sensitivity by the restricted lifetime, frequency, and character of the participating acoustic waves.  This research focuses on engineering optical access to frequency and lifetime-agile acoustic waves for advanced optomechanical devices.  State-of-the-art optomechanical spectroscopy techniques will be developed to optically probe and control guided and bulk acoustic waves with frequencies spanning several orders of magnitude, with femtowatt sensitivity. This program expands on optomechanical interactions known as Brillouin interactions, which enable important capabilities for beam cleaning, narrowband and high-power lasers, microwave photonic filters, optical delay lines, sensors, and imaging.  The new types of interactions developed through this program are anticipated to enhance the performance of these devices as well as enable new research pathways, such as for quantum information science.  Beyond direct research impact, this proposal focuses on activities that will broaden access to advanced resources and opportunities in the optical sciences.   In addition to mentoring graduate students and developing a research skills course, this program will broaden access to advanced femtosecond laser sources for smaller research groups and expand undergraduate research opportunities for students from first-generation college, low-income, and underrepresented minority backgrounds, in collaboration with the University of Rochester’s Kearns Center for Leadership and Diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
