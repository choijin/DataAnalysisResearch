<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next-generation wearable or on-skin electronics have the potential to transform personalized biomedical care by providing non-invasive, constant biometrics monitoring. Stretchable conducting polymers, a special type of plastic that conducts electricity and deforms with body movement, have become a main class of materials for such applications. However, these polymers break more easily when deformed at a faster rate because of their intrinsic mechanical properties.  This is detrimental for electronics to be applied directly on human bodies since they are constantly undergoing dynamic movement. This CAREER project aims to develop a new class of adaptive stretchable conducting polymers with toughness that will scale with the rate of deformation. Specifically, the PI will explore and elucidate the fundamental chemical design principles for realizing and manipulating these adaptive mechanical properties. Successful execution of this project will lead to plastic electronics with enhanced stability, reliability, and practicality for next-generation wearable or on-skin electronics. These properties could also result in longer use cycles, and therefore reducing plastic waste and contributing to preservation of our environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational objective of this project is to increase the scientific literacy in Central California, a historically underserved region, and create a more diversified future STEM workforce. Specifically, the PI will develop low-cost 3D printing tools for local K-12 students to experimenting with various classes of polymers and learn the diversity, pervasiveness, and important role that polymers play in our lives. Modified versions of these experiments will be integrated into the undergraduate curriculum at UC Merced, a Hispanic Serving Institution, to expose undergraduate students to new soft materials and educate them at the forefront of polymer science. The PI also plans to publish these outreach experiments in an education journal, with the hope of disseminating this low-cost technology to increase scientific literacy and knowledge of polymers across the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key challenge in realizing practical wearable and on-skin electronics using conducting polymers is to overcome their viscoelasticity. This strain rate-dependent property is highly detrimental as wearable and on-skin electronics made using these polymers would be prone to damage when used under conditions involving sudden movements and impact, such as during sports. This CAREER project aims to develop a set of chemical design principles for creating a new class of stretchable conducting polymers that defy this classic, unfavorable strain rate behavior. This objective will be realized by creating two competing deformation mechanisms at the molecular chain and nanoscopic domain levels. In phase I of the project, the PI will design and synthesize a number of conducting polymers with chemical structures that favor the formation of interpenetrated micelles. Different secondary interactions will be incorporated at the surface and interior of the micelles to serve as functional handles for tuning the two competing deformation mechanisms. Phase II of the project will employ a full suite of chemical, mechanical, electrical and structural characterization techniques to study these polymers. In particular, in-situ resistance/tensile/small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering will be used to decipher the structure-property relationships and deformation mechanisms at the surface and interior of the micelles across various length scales. Phase III of the project is aimed at optimizing the electrical conductivity of these impact-adaptive conducting polymers by creating effective charge transport pathways on the surface of the micelles. The polymer design principles and mechanistic insights gained through this project will lead to a body of fundamental knowledge for creating polymeric conductors that have toughness adaptive towards the degree of impact.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
