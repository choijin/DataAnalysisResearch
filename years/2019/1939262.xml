<AbstractNarration>Quantum information science is revolutionizing the way we approach both computation and basic science. The U.S. and Europe both have strong quantum information science programs. Historically, the programs have been distributed with small group investigators following their own research themes. Recently, a more organized, strategic approach to quantum information science has arisen. The European Union in 2018 started the Europe-wide Quantum Flagship project. The U.S. recently adopted the National Quantum Initiative to coordinate national quantum research efforts. Both initiatives identified key research themes in quantum networking, quantum metrology and sensing, and quantum computation and simulation. They have also prioritized training and education of students to work in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leveraging the synergies of these strategic efforts, this award supports a U.S.-Europe workshop on research themes in quantum information in Washington, DC in September 2019. The workshop will bring together prominent researchers from around Europe and the U.S. to two days of intensive discussion on three key intellectual areas: quantum networking, quantum computation and simulation, and quantum sensing and metrology. The goal of the meeting is to identify common themes for cooperation, accelerating the rate of expansion in knowledge in these areas for the mutual benefit of U.S. and European societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantum technologies can revolutionize our entire information industry, from computing to communications, sensing and metrology. The second quantum revolution is happening right now, exploiting the enormous progress made in our ability to create and manipulate unique quantum objects.  The European Union and the United States of America have both launched strong programs in quantum information science. The research in quantum technologies in both regions has a long tradition of transatlantic cooperation and exchanges of researchers and students. This cooperation is based on shared values of democratic governance and the free exchange of ideas.   At the EU-US Workshop on Quantum Information Science held in Washington on September 3 and 4, scientists discussed three areas of quantum technology (Communication and Networking, Computing and Simulation, and Sensing and Metrology) as well as the transverse activities and synergies such as quantum theory and enabling technologies. The intellectual merit of the workshop was in the indentification of key challenges in quantum technologies and the discussion of how a cooperative approach could overcome these difficulties. In each of the three areas, EU and US scientists described the similarity and differences between the approaches in the two geographic areas.  The broaded impact of the workshop is the potential acceleration of the second quantum revolution.  Quantum technologies will change society by changing the way we gather, transmit, and process information.           Last Modified: 03/09/2020       Submitted by: Kenneth R Brown]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
