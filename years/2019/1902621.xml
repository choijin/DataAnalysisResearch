<AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for participants to a research conference in San Diego, California from June 17 to June 20, 2019 entitled "Future Directions in Algebraic Combinatorics". This conference will bring together leaders from related fields and a diverse group of younger researchers in order to identify and prioritize goals for future work and to inspire new collaborations for fulfilling these goals. To accomplish this, the conference will be comprised of a dozen in depth talks by experts in various fields, "lightning talks" to propose future work, discussions of priorities by all participants, and a poster session for graduate students and early career attendees.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this conference is to communicate future goals in symmetric function theory and algebraic combinatorics. Algebraic combinatorics has been at the center of new developments across several fields, including representation theory, algebraic geometry, and topology.   Confirmed speakers include leading experts in all aspects of algebraic combinatorics:  Franois Bergeron, Sara Billey, Anders Bjorner, Persi Diaconis, Ron Graham, Mark Haiman, Jim Haglund, Claudia Malvenuto, Anton Mellit, Jennifer Morse, Claudio Procesi, Richard Stanley, Dennis Stanton, Michelle Wachs, Nolan Wallach, and Greg Warrington.   Additional information is available at the conference website at https://sites.google.com/view/garsiafest/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
