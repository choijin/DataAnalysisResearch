<AbstractNarration>This project will help meet the nationâ€™s need for skilled scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians.  It will do so by providing scholarships and other supports to help undergraduate students earn a STEM degree. Over five-years, the project will award four-year scholarships to twenty-two students at Norwich University, a private military college that serves both Corps of Cadets and civilian students.  These Scholars will pursue bachelor's degrees in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, mathematics, neuroscience, or physics. The project team will also implement and study the effects of evidence-based curricular and extracurricular activities, such as peer tutoring, mentoring, and community building.  Participation in these activities is expected to support the Scholars to graduation and prepare them to enter the workforce or graduate STEM programs.  Through these efforts, the project expects to help meet the national need for qualified STEM professionals in both the military and civilian workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The project team recognizes that students who enter college with less experience in mathematics are less likely to graduate with a degree in a STEM discipline. Based on that knowledge, the research aims of this project are to: 1) measure the benefits of corequisite implementation of precalculus and calculus to help students complete the required calculus sequence by the end of their first year; 2) implement and assess a leadership training program to improve the communication and leadership skills of peer tutors in mathematics courses; and 3) measure the effect of improved academic, financial, and career support for the Scholars across their academic career at the University. Research on these practices will contribute to the knowledge base about effective supports for increasing recruitment, retention, and graduation of STEM majors, particularly among low-income students. This project is funded by the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
