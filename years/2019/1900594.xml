<AbstractNarration>With this award, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Viresh Rawal of the University of Chicago is developing new methods for the chemical synthesis of complex molecules. New synthetic methods and strategies enable the construction of compounds that are essential for advancements in many scientific disciplines, including chemical biology and materials science. Such synthesis opens access to diverse compounds that help us understand biological processes.  New synthetic methods also help chemists prepare large quantities of drugs more cheaply. The Rawal lab examines cycloaddition reactions, which are reactions wherein two molecules are brought together to form a ring. These are one of the most important families of reactions for the synthesis of intricate molecules.  The methods allow for the creation of new compounds and provide students with a rigorous training in reaction development, and the design and synthesis of molecules, thereby preparing them for careers in academics or industry. Undergraduate students and high school students from the Chicago Public School system are also gaining exposure to scientific research through this award.  They learn about the many opportunities and careers available to them in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Rawal is developing new cycloaddition methodologies for the synthesis of complex molecules. He and his students are designing novel substrates for the Diels-Alder (DA) reaction, particularly the meta-selective DA reaction, for the construction of substituted cyclohexanones that are key building blocks to many complex natural products. Given the tremendous need for single enantiomer compounds, with estimated global sales topping $1.3 trillion in 2018, the Rawal lab is examining chiral catalysts to render meta-selective DA reactions enantioselective. This work is providing ready access to important compounds, particularly compounds containing all-carbon quaternary chiral centers, that previously were difficult to synthesize. To demonstrate the unique power of the new chemistry, the Rawal lab is carrying out the chemical synthesis of selected, intricate natural products. This research program is also helping to develop human resources in science and technology through the education and training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.  Importantly, this project is exposing undergraduate students and high school students in the University of Chicago Collegiate Scholars Program to career opportunities in scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
