<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Along with the growing need for renewable energy generation and storage technologies is the need for a well-trained workforce with the skills to develop, deploy, and manage future energy technologies. Taking advantage of Binghamton University’s extensive infrastructure and faculty strength in renewable energy research, this Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site addresses scientific and training needs in materials research relating to the energy sector. The site brings together undergraduates from across the country, with a majority of participants coming from groups that are underrepresented in science and engineering, and from community colleges or small universities with limited research infrastructure. The participants engage in 10 weeks of intensive research on energy-related materials, while weekly workshops foster professional development and career planning. Building on past successes, this third phase of the REU site adds new opportunities for participants to learn about industry careers through interactions with companies at the Southern Tier Clean Energy Incubator. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This REU site’s activities center on fostering development of the undergraduate participants into highly qualified scientists and engineers who are prepared to work in the energy sector. Towards this end, a supportive environment is created for the participants to solve fundamental materials research problems with connections to renewable energy generation and storage, using both experimental and computational strategies. Mentored by faculty spanning five science and engineering departments, and research teams in the NorthEast Center for Chemical Energy Storage, the Center for Autonomous Solar Power, and the Advanced Catalysis for Energy Sustainability Center, students tackle challenges in developing materials for solar energy conversion, mechanical energy harvesting, heat transfer, battery storage, and clean fuel generation. In partnership with the Southern Tier Clean Energy Incubator, participants learn about industry careers and the steps involved in translating laboratory innovations into commercial products. Students gain further preparation for science and engineering careers through workshops on communication, collaboration, and career pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
