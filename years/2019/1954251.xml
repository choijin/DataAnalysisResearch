<AbstractNarration>This award will support participants in the Carolina Dynamics Symposium, which is a conference that has been taking place at a college or university in the Southeastern region for the past 17 years. The conference in 2020 will take place at Davidson College, NC, on April 4-5. In 2021 and 2022 it will alternate between different colleges and universities in the Carolinas and Georgia; the location is determined at the previous conference. The topics of the conference are in the modern theory of dynamical systems. This is an area of mathematics that has had applications in computer science, cryptography, data analysis, physics, and biology and uses a variety of different branches of mathematics including analysis, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, and rigorous computation. This conference is important because it is the basis of much of the dynamical systems community in the Southeast. Many attendees come each year to continue ongoing collaborations, begin new projects, and hear from experts in the field. In addition to the traditional lively interaction among mathematicians from the Southeast there have been hour talks by invited leaders in the field from outside the region. The Carolina Dynamics Symposia feature one participant who will deliver a public lecture on the Friday before the conference begins, as well as about three hour-long plenary participants giving lectures during the conference weekend. All meetings will also have twenty-minute to thirty-minute contributed talks, and invited talks. A significant number of talks are given by (graduate) students and young researchers. The conferences have led to successful research projects and publications in the past. This continues a very successful model with participants of diverse levels and backgrounds, among those a particularly large number of female participants and organizers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants of the Carolina Dynamics Symposium include mathematicians at all levels: senior and junior faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates. The range of topics is broad, including more theoretical areas such as symbolic, complex, and topological dynamics, ergodic theory, and geometry, as well as more applied areas such as celestial mechanics, differential equations, numerical methods, mathematical biology, and rigorous computation. More specifically, some recent topics include complexity of subshifts, entropy, odometers in a variety of settings, mixing properties, substitutions, Bratteli-Vershik systems, cellular automata, and 3 body problems. As a result of the variety of topics, there is extensive crossover and discussion among people working in the different fields, ranging from casual comments to extensive ongoing research projects.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Website:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.bagdala2.net/cdynsys/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
