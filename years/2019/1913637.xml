<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project develops a collaborative augmented reality (AR) learning platform to build knowledge and skills targeted by Next Generation Science Standards through early, hands-on design of scientific systems. Troubleshooting - diagnosing, explaining and fixing errors - is an element of the design process often missing from educational activities as it is difficult to execute with large groups of students, but AR can address elegantly. Furthermore, expert instructors and peers need not be in the same room to collaboratively solve problems presented as interactive three-dimensional system models. Collaborative AR, requiring only common devices, will substantially increase affordability and access to substantive and engaging science, engineering, technology and math (STEM) within formal and informal, as well as classroom and home learning environments. Without the barriers of expensive equipment, dangerous materials or trained facilitators, educational AR is poised for dramatic growth, commanding an estimated $12B globally by 2020. Earlier and more effective STEM education provides fundamental knowledge to motivate the scientists and engineers of tomorrow to aspire and contribute to leading-edge discoveries and innovations. At the highest level, this work will benefit society by increasing the supply of collaborative, STEM-proficient, critical thinkers who are poised to prosper in the workforce of the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative AR must surmount technical hurdles in image recognition, integration and pedagogy to achieve acceptance in elementary education. Capabilities of existing AR technologies suffer shortcomings in the functionality required for real-time recognition of three-dimensional space with common devices, including issues with the camera, image projection, and processing. Technical innovations are required for new methods to identify and place targets within the uniformity of learning environments. The additional challenge of implementing live collaboration in a multi-user setting requires technical innovations around the seamless integration of various devices as well as the development and testing of intuitive user interfaces from both student and instructor perspectives. These include how to measure behaviors, handle conflicting actions, and how to give, receive and respond to the dynamic instructor feedback. Understanding, measuring and reporting the educational advantages and shortcomings in motivating and developing diverse learners in distinct learning environments cannot be overlooked in implementing technology tools. Meaningful pedagogical innovations must occur to effectively leverage the new power of AR without overlooking unintended impacts on students or their educational outcomes. These specifications require novel curriculum design both to achieve the cross-disciplinary understanding through increasingly complex problems and to deliver the full impact promised by educational AR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ STEM proficiency is critical for competitiveness in the global economy. Providing STEM-focused curriculum and learning experiences not only allows students to develop STEM content knowledge and skills, but also communication, collaboration, problem solving, argumentation and reasoning skills.  In this Phase I SBIR grant, Explore Interactive addressed key technical challenges to build a collaborative augmented reality (AR) learning environment for troubleshooting scientific systems.  The first technical challenge was the limitations of current AR technologies on the mobile devices utilized in classroom implementations. The team aimed to measure the factors that impact the performance of augmented reality, such as lighting and obscurity, under controlled experiments and observe the effects on the AR digital objects.  The performance indicators studied included 3D object stability, reliability and lag of image recognition and object orientation.  From these studies, the team developed new features and guidance to improve the user experience given the constraints.  Second, because building collaboration skills is a common goal for education but developing activities that both elicit and facilitate collaboration can be difficult in classroom science and engineering activities, we developed a multi-user environment for the AR platform to foster such skills.  As a result, users can access and interact with a shared experience from their own individual devices. The team tested and resolved challenges in the consistency of the AR experience that arise in a multi-player environment when users take actions that directly conflict.  An example is when one user adds a wire to a battery that another user is simultaneously deleting.  The team also studied the hardware elements of performance, battery usage, network usage and initial usability.  Lastly, the team proposed to investigate troubleshooting and collaboration in learning environments to inform future curricula and metric collection to encourage and measure these skills. The last technical objective involved review and rework of existing content, activities and flow to integrate opportunities to learn and practice troubleshooting. Preliminary studies were conducted of users engaging with the application for evidence of troubleshooting.  The team also completed the NSF Beat-The-Odds Bootcamp program by attending the grantee workshops and interviewing over 60 stakeholders to gain insights into the elements of the business model canvas, update business assumptions and make valuable connections within the education industry.   In summary, the team completed the key technical objectives of the grant, built a viable prototype and validated commercial value propositions. The collaboration capability has a compelling use case, particularly remote collaboration in the current COVID-19 crisis and the application is slated for release in the fall of 2020.  As the nation faces monumental challenges and potential crises in areas such as climate and health, our reliance on the knowledgeable, critical thinking and creative experts of the STEM workforce cannot be more apparent. Educating and motivating the next generation of STEM innovators in times such as these must continue and must inspire even the youngest K-5 learners, to ensure the future prosperity of our society.
