<AbstractNarration>Computer simulation now encompasses most areas of scientific research.  Computer experiments conducted on these simulations are an effective way to leverage limited computation capacity. This research project will develop tools to overcome existing computational limits to solve increasingly complex problems arising in various applications where computer models play a critical role.   There is a vast potential to enable high-dimensional, large-scale experimentation using high-performance computing with smart data collection schemes that yield tractable computational analysis and accuracy that is orders of magnitude better than existing approaches on a large swath of estimation problems.   The most appealing features of this approach are that it enables parallel but flexible experimentation and computationally reasonable inference with theoretical guarantees.   This research will facilitate the transfer of computer models from exclusive users of high-performance computing environments to a broad array of scientists and engineers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general philosophy of the project will be to use experiments with underlying grid structures that are significantly more flexible and adaptive compared to basic grids.   The key to enabling fast computation are rigorous representation results for Gaussian processes that exploit the generalized grid structures.  The algorithms that exploit these representations are both fast, meaning the algorithms have small computational cost, and exact, meaning the only source of sub-optimality comes from machine error.  Because the results will be exact, these algorithms will be considerably more accurate than existing fast methods which rely on approximations. The research focuses on designing dimensional and spatial adaptivity for high-dimensional estimation to service downstream calculations like uncertainty quantification, optimization and calibration.  While the interest in this problem comes primarily from computer experiments, the approach is general enough to provide additional impacts in general machine learning, specifically in the use of Gaussian process prediction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
