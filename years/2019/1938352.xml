<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the elimination of flaring from oil and gas production. Globally, there were an estimated 150 billion cubic meters (5.3 trillion cubic feet) of flared produced gases in 2016 and around 10 billion cubic meters (353 billion cubic feet) in the U.S.  At $2 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) (wellhead natural gas price), the value of flared gases is equivalent to $10.6 B per year globally and $706 M in the U.S.  Gases are flared because processes converting them to liquids for transportation (GTL) are expensive and are difficult to execute at a smaller scale. Replacing customized process equipment with mass-produced engines enables significant cost and size reductions. An 8-liter diesel engine that costs ~$10,000 can convert 400 thousand standard cubic feet (MSCF)/day of gas to liquids, rather than a large-scale GTL plant costing ~$15,000/MSCF/day.   This project will develop a novel, ultra-compact and low-cost gas to liquids mini-plant.  The plant will process methane, ethane and propane near the wellhead (which currently would be flared and wasted) into methanol, a high value chemical that can be transported to market. If converted to methanol at a value of $432/ton, these otherwise flared gas volumes would be valued at $2 B/year for the US market and nearly $30 B/year globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to use modified automotive internal combustion engines as small scale chemical reactors and compressors. The necessary pressure and temperature for the reaction is created in-cylinder by piston compression action and partial combustion. This project will develop a staged system of engines:  The first converts methane, ethane and propane into carbon monoxide and hydrogen; subsequently, produced gases will be processed in a second engine compressing them and converting them into methanol. This will be accomplished with a high surface area metal foam impregnated with a catalyst placed inside the piston bowl of the second engine. Phase I of the project will: 1) demonstrate a proof-of-concept engine that can synthesize methanol from carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and 2) conduct the systems engineering studies describing integration of the engine reactor into a compact GTL plant to be placed near the wellhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Flaring is the wasteful practice of burning off natural gas produced from oil wells because it cannot be taken to market economically. 150 Billion Cubic meters of gas worth almost $11 Billion are wasted annually. Flaring generates 275 Million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year and other types of pollution.  Emvolon Inc.(formerly Plasma Energy Innovation), an MIT spinoff, is developing a novel mini chemical plant (the Emvolon GTM) using modified  internal combustion engines frrom cars and trucks as small scale chemical reactors and compressors to convert otherwise flared gases from oil and gas operations to methanol, a valuable liquid chemical that can be transported to market.  The technology converts a mass produced product- engines-  to replace custom made chemical process equipment, enabling significant cost reductions.  It is anticipated that two 8-liter diesel engines that cost ~ $30,000 can be modified to convert 330 MSCF/day of gas to liquids. For comparison, a large scale gas to liquids plant costs ~ $15,000 per MSCF/day.   Phase I of the NSF SBIR Project was successful in demonstrating the feasibility of the concept using a laboratory scale prototype. The experimental setup achieved world class conversion to methanol (34%) on par with the best in class conventional large scale methanol reactors.  Additionally, detailed modelling of the engine and technoeconomic analysis of the entire mini chemical plant were performed. The analysis shows that technical advantages translate into clear commercial benefits in cost and footprint and portability not possible with current systems, and certainly not possible at the distributed scale required to eliminate flaring.   Technical progress over Phase I  resulted in a USD 1.5 Million Venture Capital investment in our company as well as commercial partnerships with oil&amp;gas service companies.
