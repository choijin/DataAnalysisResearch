<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a 2-day Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) meeting at Case Western Reserve University. The meeting will enable collaborations between amateur radio operators and the science community for the purpose of advancing scientific research and understanding of the ionosphere by leveraging radio propagation experiments. It will encourage development of new technologies to support ionospheric research and provide educational opportunities for the amateur community and the general public. The conference will also provide professional development and networking opportunities for students and early career scientists and engineers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) meeting to be held March 22-23, 2019 at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH. This meeting will facilitate presentations and discussions on research advances in radio remote sensing techniques and space weather. This workshop will enable professional scientists and amateur radio operators to work together to design a new network of citizen science radio instrumentation and to allow for the discussion and presentation of results and techniques using the currently available data. The meeting will engage citizen scientists in space weather research and also provide educational opportunities for the ham operator community and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

In the United States, hams are federally licensed and identified by a station call sign, such as W8EDU, the Case ARC call. Many hams have significant amounts of practical experience using their radios to communicate under all sorts of geophysical conditions, and have developed a keen observational ability to maximize their enjoyment and communications ability. This quality provides a unique perspective and excellent citizen science potentials when asking scientific questions or even analyzing observations.

The 2019 HamSCI Workshop agenda and presentations (available in PDF and video format) at https://hamsci.org/hamsci2019.  The meeting was attended by over 60 attendees and engaged individuals from academia, industry, and the general public from all over the United States.  The workshop's broader impact also includes young people at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels who were able to contribute to and learn from the experienced people in the HamSCI community.     The 2019 HamSCI Workshop proved to be a fertile ground for the sharing and development of ideas between the amateur and professional communities.  At the workshop leading members of the academic, industry, and citizen science communities were able to share ideas on how to best make use of the observations that are already available, such as those made by large-scale observing networks such as the Reverse Beacon Network, WSPRNet, and PSKReporter, and the development of new techniques, such as those provided by the Frequency Measurement Community and the development of the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station.  As such, the goals of the workshop which include enabling collaborations between amateur radio operators and the science community for the purpose of advancing scientific research, and  empowering professional scientists and amateur radio operators to work together to design a new network of citizen science radio instrumentation, were met and exceeded.
