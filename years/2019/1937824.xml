<AbstractNarration>This award is funded by the Chemistry Division of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate through the Special Projects mechanism. The Principle Investigator is Mary Kirchhoff of the American Chemical Society. The overall goal is to host a colloquium on Nov. 20th, 2019, that highlights the chemistry breakthroughs enabled by the understanding of the periodic chart. The United Nations' General Assembly has decreed 2019 as the International Year of the Periodic Table (IYPT). This is the American Chemical Society's culminating event. This event will engage ACS members and enhance public appreciation for chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event will gather highly respected chemists to present on overarching topics in areas of current public and chemistry community interest, such as sustainable plastics, quantum computing, and batteries. By tying these topics back to the history of the periodic chart and linking them to the future research areas of chemistry, the broader community (through web access), the local higher education community (by invitation), and the general D.C. scientific community can be linked for this celebratory event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Perspectives in Chemistry:  150 Years of the Periodic Table  The American Chemical Society organized the ?Perspectives in Chemistry:  150 Years of the Periodic Table? colloquium on November 20, 2019 at the National Academy of Sciences Building in Washington, DC.  The colloquium highlighted chemistry breakthroughs enabled by our understanding of the periodic table in celebration of the International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements (IYPT), as proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly.  2019 was selected for IYPT in recognition of the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the periodic table by Dmitry Mendeleev.     The colloquium engaged the DC-based scientific community in person, as well as an online audience, and featured academic and industrial research in cutting-edge areas made possible by the predictive power of the periodic table.  The program was organized around three themes:  History and Discovery, Today?s Challenges, and Tomorrow?s Opportunities.  The colloquium featured the following presentations:     What made Mendeleev unique?  David Lewis, University of Wisconsin ? Eau Claire  Modern-day alchemy  Jacklyn Gates, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  Addressing sustainability challenges with chemistry and emerging technology in industry research  Jeannette Garcia, IBM  Sustainable polymers in a circular materials economy  Eugene Chen, Colorado State University  Harnessing the versatility of the periodic table for energy storage  Amy Prieto, Colorado State University  Making molecules  Malika Jeffries-El, Boston University  Synthesis for all  Martin Burke, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  Industrial/academic collaborations to power discoveries in chemistry   Gary Molander, University of Pennsylvania  The promise of quantum computing for chemistry  Ryan Babbush, Google  What is chemical engineering in the 21st century?                                      Eric Kaler, University of Minnesota     Eighty-three people registered to attend the colloquium in person, and an additional 74 unique IP addresses joined the livestream event.  During the lunch break, participants discussed the top challenges to diversifying the chemistry enterprise, along with strategies to overcome these challenges.  A summary of the colloquium was published in the January 20, 2020 issue of Chemical &amp; Engineering News, the weekly news magazine that is received by more than 150,000 ACS members.  The videos of the presentations are freely available at https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/periodictable/periodic-table-colloquium.html.     Few global citizens appreciate chemistry?s foundational role in daily life, and chemistry is often seen as the cause of, rather than the solution to, environmental challenges.  This IYPT colloquium featured presentations that were designed to enhance public appreciation for chemistry?s role in everyday life and increase awareness of chemistry?s contributions to a sustainable planet.  The ?Perspectives in Chemistry:  150 Years of the Periodic Table? colloquium was a unique opportunity to leverage the International Year of the Periodic Table in demonstrating chemistry?s contributions to society.
