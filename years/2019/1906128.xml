<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the increased mobility, and thereby, social integration for people with ankle control deficit. Mobility is associated with functional independence and participation in society. Sufficient ankle control plays a vital role in mobility. A significant portion of populations with neuromuscular disorders, such as children with cerebral palsy (CP) and post-stroke survivals, live with insufficient ankle control. Our design, DEAFO, is a soft mechanized brace to help these individuals to walk easier and longer. DEAFO will provide assistance and correction about the ankle while preventing discomfort, to promote mobility and improve the quality of life of the users.  The project will first focus on the CP population (~700,000 in US), which is the most common motor disorder in children. CP's total economic burden, in direct and indirect costs, is $11.5 billion per year, in the US alone. A significant portion of this cost consists of assistive devices and physical training, needed due to insufficient ankle control. Hence, DEAFO will aim to provide both ankle assistance and physical training to promote motor recovery, which potentially decreases these costs over time. The company's ultimate goal is to expand DEAFO applications to post-stroke population (~8 million in US). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will be the first light-weight, noiseless, soft, and mechanized ankle foot orthoses (AFO), that deploy dielectric elastomer (DE)-based artificial muscle. Thus, it is called DEAFO. Increased chance of falls, and inefficient walking speed, are major consequences of ankle-control deficit. Although this is a common disorder in a population of 8 to 10 million, the status of care for this pathology, usually, is a rudimentary, bulky, rigid uncomfortable AFO. Furthermore, the none-mechanized AFOs hold the ankle fixed at specific angles, and cause secondary problems, such as disuse atrophy of the muscles. DEAFO will be mechanized by dielectric elastomer (DE)-based artificial muscle. The novel DE actuators are soft, lightweight, compact, and acoustically noiseless, with muscle-like behaviors, which is benchmark tested in the company's lab. The softness and noiseless operation of these artificial muscles will substantially improve the comfort and natural feel of the device in comparison with other mechanized AFOs. Unlike most mechanized AFOs, the controller that will drive the artificial muscles in the device has been specifically developed and evaluated for pathological walking and showed 100% detection reliability in children with CP. This project can revolutionize the status of care for ankle-control deficit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Unlike conventional actuators, such as DC motors, the artificial muscles are lightweight, compact, soft, noiseless, and contract longitudinally. These features improve upon heavy and conspicuous designs of existing AFOs, and enhance the comfort and natural feel of the device.  Findings  We have successfully interviewed 176 stakeholders and experts in the AFO ecosystem, including 95 customers (48 Pysical Therapists (PTs), 20 parents of AFO users, and 27 orthotists). Job:  Through these interviews, we realized that an enhanced AFO must increase mobility and decrease the number of clinic visits. The importance of mobility has been well-established, however, reducing the number of clinic visits needs further investigation.  Children with CP visit clinical facilities as often as multiple times per week, which substantially burdens caregivers and children. Reducing the number of clinic visits is also crucial for PTs and children's hospitals that usually have a backlog of patients. The insurance companies usually reimburse the orthotists, the practitioners who manufacture and fit AFOs, per device. The time spent on fitting and adjusting, which could happen multiple times per year, is not reimbursable and adds to the cost of the AFO for the orthotists.  Thus, in DE-AFO, our goal is to improve mobility by increasing the usage time and promoting the natural ankle's motion for the mobile CP population, who do not primarily depend on a wheelchair. Through improved endurance, as a measure of mobility, and the ease of customization and scalability, our design decreases the number of clinic-visit by 20%, approximately 15 times per year.  Pains:  The conspicuousness of conventional AFOs was mentioned by 48% of customers, mostly parents. This issue is exacerbated as users enter teenage years, mainly because it attracts attention, and consequently, decreases usage time and eventually leads to abandonment; the lower the usage time, the lower the mobility and the more side effects. The bulk of the device also substantially limits subjects' shoe choice and usually bounds them with "ugly" sneakers (Fig. 4).  The rigidity of conventional AFOs, which creates pressure points, and the heat accumulation, due to their non-breathable material, can lead to extreme discomfort, and skin damage (Fig. 5), and consequently decreases the usage time of the device; 47% of customers noted these issues. Gains:  Many customers (22%), mostly PTs and parents, desire an AFO that is easy to don and doff, especially one that a child could wear independently. This feature increases the users' "independence" and device usage likelihood, thereby improving social integration.  Furthermore, 38% of the PTs express the need for a smart device that can substantially assist the subject in pushing off the ground during walking, which potentially improves walking efficiency, endurance, and speed.  Having a subject-specific device that can readily fit, scale with the child, and assist different types of foot deformities and gait deviations was also crucial for 29% of the customer, mostly orthotists and PTs. This substantially improves subjects' performance and thereby mobility, and also reduces the number of fitting and adjusting sessions for the orthotists.  Therefore, our value propositions are to reduce the number of clinic visits by 20%, increase the usage time by 1 h/day, and increase distance in the 6-minute walk test, as a measure of endurance, by approximately 50 m. Other Findings:  Through evaluating our ecosystem, we realized the critical roles of the orthotists as one of the essential components of our business model. They could act as a key partner, channel to the customer, and a customer segment.  To circumvent the reimbursement hurdle, we will initially produce a clinic-based model. Children's hospitals and physical therapy clinics routinely invest in new technologies to stay competitive and improve patient outcomes. Therefore, to enter the market safer we pivoted toward developing a clinic-based gait trianing robot. Its business model will be the focus of our ongoing customer discovery.  In summary, DE-AFO will improve mobility and reduce the number of the clinic visit, thereby, improving the quality of life of children with CP by promoting natural ankle motion and a comfortable structure.
