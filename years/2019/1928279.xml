<AbstractNarration>This I-Corps project will impact a range of healthcare industry jobs, increasing financial efficiency and reduce data-driven misdiagnosis and mistreatment.  Healthcare patient outcomes and experiences will improve with reductions in medication errors, misdiagnosis, and other inaccuracies that can cause harm to patients and create liability issues with healthcare providers.  Processes associated with acquiring electronic health data are often function slowly, incompletely, and often without the full consent of the patient or adequate metadata to track critical information required for treating a patient.  The solution developed here can potentially enable proper data correctness and address inconsistencies which can lead to better patient outcomes and improve legal liability framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project provides intellectual merits that will improve the healthcare information industry. This includes synthesis of mathematical models and algorithms that analyze data completeness and consistency. Specifically, this will lead to a hybrid machine learning approach that will utilize unsupervised learning to automatically classify various electronic health records as complete or incomplete, and supervised learning to confirm such classification and further grade the likelihood that the entered data is accurate and correct.  Furthermore, this will also lead to evolutions in applications of reinforcement learning supporting greater accuracy, and anomaly detection. Overall, this project will lead to improving the quality of healthcare delivery and innovations in supporting evolutions in data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project the team of investigators interviewed more than 150 individuals to identify if data incompleteness and data inconsistencies were problems with the United States healthcare ecosystem with the view of identifying any opportunities for commercialization. Around 147 respondents clearly indicated that either data incompleteness or data inconsistency or both were critical problems that need to be addressed within the United States healthcare ecosystem. Some key interviews also indicated that data incompleteness was a bigger issue when compared to data incompleteness. Some of the key findings of this project can be listed as follows:   a) many healthcare providers in rural areas needed a cost-effective solution that will mitigate the problem of data incompleteness since this problem was leading to problems with reimbursements   b) the problem of data incompleteness was complicated, and products can only mitigate this problem  c) there existed algorithms and software products to deal with the problem of data inconsistency   d) large healthcare providers (with more than 200 beds) lost a few million dollars every year due to the problems associated with incompleteness of electronic health records  e) from a management perspective, the problem of data incompleteness as dovetailed to problems in processes involving capture of healthcare data.  From the perspective of commercialization, the Principal Investigator will be working on the following next steps:  i) target a specific problem with a regulatory urgency for adoption within the healthcare ecosystem  ii) work towards the development of a commercializable product that will assist the healthcare provider identify areas and trends in data incompleteness within the organization  iii) investigate into the data incompleteness problem for a specific practice.     Overall, the team of investigators were able to ascertain that data incompleteness was a critical problem within the United States healthcare ecosystem and that there were opportunities for commercialization.
