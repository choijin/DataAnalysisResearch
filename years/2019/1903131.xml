<AbstractNarration>The Albany Conversations provide a venue for an intellectually challenging debate of topics of current interest in structural biology. The sessions dealing with cryo-electron microscopy and protein dynamics in the living cytoplasm will emphasize recent technological breakthroughs in structural biology. Lectures by young researchers (graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and starting faculty) will be based on selection from abstracts submitted for poster presentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Albany Conversations will include about 400 participants, over 200 posters, and ~85 oral presentations, about one third of which will be selected from the posters. Out of all the talks, at least 34-36 will be delivered by female scientists. The final program will contain a socially responsible mix of men and women with wide ethnic origin. All presenters are expected to stay during most of the conference, eat at the community tables and be available for interactions with junior and senior colleagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The Organizing Cmtte selected young scientists from the  abstracts submitted to provide short lectures during the main session; and they were sandwiched between very senior speakers to draw attention to the high quality of the work  and research being performed by the young doctral students in structural biology from across the world.   The complete Book of Abstarcts was published as one of the special issues of the Journal of Biomolecular Structure &amp; Dynamics,Volume 37 Supplement,  2019, and was freely distributed.
