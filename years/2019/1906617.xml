<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the conference travel and registration fees of seven individuals from underrepresented groups to attend the 2019 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Physical Science of Cancer to be held in Galveston, Texas, from February 10-15, 2019.  The meeting will bring together engineers, physicists, chemists, and mathematicians along with global experts in cancer biology/oncology to explore the latest advances and next challenges/opportunities for physical science and engineering to advance knowledge related to cancer.  The conference will provide significant opportunities for professional development and networking for trainees and young investigators as well as a forum for the discussion and dissemination of the latest scientific advances.  Cancer biomechanics and mechanobiology is a relatively new field, and conferences focused on this important area of research are novel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will include national and international leaders in the physical properties of cancer as well as up and coming researchers.  The presented research will include biomechanics and mechanobiology, imaging, and computational methods related to cancer cell characterization, tumor development, and metastatic processes.  The funds from this award will be used to support four invited speakers and three speakers based on submitted abstracts to allow them to participate in this GRC.  All invited speakers that will be supported through this award are early or mid-career women.  The selection of the additional three speakers for support will focus on individuals from underrepresented groups, including those with disabilities and with appointments at universities that are not classified as R1:doctoral universities - highest research activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
