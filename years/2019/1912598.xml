<AbstractNarration>The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) was formed in 1997 to directly observe gravitational waves (GW) in data collected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). This goal was realized in September 2015 with the detection of GWs originating from the Binary Black Hole (BBH) merger, GW150914. In 2017 the LSC, together with the Virgo collaboration, inaugurated the era of multi-messenger GW astronomy with the detection of the Binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger, GW170817. This is the dawn of a new and exciting era of astronomy, made possible by the organization and coherent vision of the LSC. The success of the LSC relies on a globally distributed team. Effective and efficient operations requires regular in-person meetings for planning and reviews. This project supports travel for the LSC Spokesperson and other members of the leadership team to participate in such activities and it also supports the LSC Fellows Program. This program attracts a diverse and skilled set of (mostly) junior researchers to work at each LIGO site. Participants monitor the quality of data during observation runs and work with local engineers and scientists to improve the performance of the interferometers. Participation by LSC members in on-site investigations helps improve the sensitivity of the LIGO detectors and increase their duty cycle; this extends the scientific reach of the detectors. Developing and maintaining a broad base of research scientists in the LSC that are trained in gravitational-wave science is essential for future observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports core functions of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) in order to carry out its scientific mission of using gravitational-waves to explore the fundamental physics of gravity and as a new multi-messenger astronomical tool of discovery. The grant supports the U.S. portion of the LSC Activities Fees, which amounts to about 52% (444 of 884 members) of all fees collected. The LSC levies an Activities Fee on a per-member basis to fund key programs and functions deemed essential by the membership. These include the LSC Fellows Program, publication fees associated with collaboration papers, LSC service travel associated with organizational responsibilities, and LSC spokesperson's travel. About two thirds of the Activities Fee funds the LSC Fellows Program, which attracts a diverse and skilled set of (mostly) junior researchers to work at each LIGO site. The goals of the program are to provide opportunities for LSC members to learn about and contribute to LIGO's precision interferometery at the observatories, to have on-site LSC scientists monitoring the quality of data during observation runs, and to complement the activities of local engineers and scientists in improving the performance of the interferometers. The Activities Fee assessment ensures that the publication fees for collaboration papers, including fees to make seminal detection papers open-access, and LSC Spokesperson and other members' travel associated with organizational responsibilities, are distributed evenly among collaboration members. The fee also funds reliable internet hosting and identity services, both of which are crucial for a large collaboration such as the LSC. The LSC has a substantial positive impact on research, education and public understanding of science through its activities. The LSC trains junior scientists to understand the design and operations of the cutting-edge LIGO detectors. The experience gained through the LSC Fellows program significantly and positively impacts junior scientists' abilities to understand and communicate on highly technical topics; these are important skills both inside and outside academia. Students and junior researchers from smaller institutions, some of whom are under-represented minorities, gain access to resources that would otherwise be out of reach. In the long-term, there is significant benefit from training a larger and more diverse group of experimental scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
