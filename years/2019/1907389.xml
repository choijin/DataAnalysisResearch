<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the travel of two invited speakers from underrepresented groups and twelve students and young investigators to attend the 6th International Conference on Clinical and Engineering Frontiers in Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, to be held in Philadelphia, PA, from May 9-11, 2019.  The meeting will bring together global leaders in both the clinical and engineering study of congenital heart disease along with the next generation of researchers needed to address this important challenge.  The conference will focus on disseminating the current state of the art with respect to advances in fundamental engineering and science that impact the understanding of both the pathophysiology and treatment of congenital heart disease.  In addition, significant time will be spent identifying the gaps in knowledge that require new advancements in engineering in order to develop solutions in the future.  Engineering and medical students from the region will also be encouraged to attend in order to better understand how engineers and clinicians can work together to address these challenges through advances in both fundamental engineering and clinical science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together clinical and fundamental researchers to exchange knowledge and identify areas that are key targets for future research.  Award funds will be used to support young investigators and students who will be able to present their research to an audience of leaders in the field.  This will support the professional development and career advancement of these individuals.  In addition, the award will support two underrepresented assistant professors to present invited talks.  These individuals, who are developing leaders in the field, will serve as mentors and role models to other individuals from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
