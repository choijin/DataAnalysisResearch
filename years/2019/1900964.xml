<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Houston Summer School on Dynamical Systems (HSSDS) for graduate students, held in June 2019 at the University of Houston. The 8-day 2019 HSSDS workshop will bring together approximately 40 graduate students from institutions across the country, along with 10-15 exceptional undergraduates, who will arrive several days earlier and will receive a series of background lectures giving them some of the tools they need to attend the main event.  The goal of the 2019 HSSDS workshop is to introduce students both to fundamental techniques and recent progress in dynamical systems, emphasizing a probabilistic viewpoint.  Each lecturer in the 2019 HSSDS workshop will give students an appropriate bird's-eye view of the area in which he or she is working.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expository talks will present dynamics from a broad perspective, stressing its applications and connections with other areas of science. The school will present recent results and techniques that are not available in textbooks or in a form easily accessible to graduate students. It will introduce recent developments in probabilistic dynamics, chaotic dynamics, and dynamics of quantum systems. The 2019 HSSDS workshop will also include more specialized topics such as statistical properties of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamics, quantum walks, and dynamics on flat surfaces and translation flows. Applications of dynamics to the modeling of complex physical systems will be a major theme. More information can be found at: https://www.math.uh.edu/dynamics/school/school2019/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the project was to organize a summer school on dynamical systems at the University of Houston in May 2019, spanning roughly 10 days, for graduate students in dynamics.  The lectures series was on probability and dynamical systems, with an emphasis on understanding statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems.  The summer school was held during May 28-June 6, 2019.  The lectures were given by the organizers (dynamics research group at UH) and by 3 external guest lecturers.   There were over 80 graduate and undergraduate participants, including those supported by other sources and local attendees from the University of Houston, Rice University and Sam Houston State University. The attendance of 33 of the US graduate students was made possible and funded by this NSF grant.      The summerschool gave  participants an introduction to various topics that are of current research interest in dynamical systems and related fields, but that are difficult to learn oneself from the literature due to lack of expository material that is at an appropriate level for graduate students. Participants were also expected to read and discuss research papers. Via these projects and other guided reading  the school also gave the participants a chance to engage with research literature and  to work with peers at understanding current mathematical research in probability and dynamics. In an exit survey the students gave very positive feedback to the school as a whole and to the projects in particular: typical comments were that they appreciated the broader perspective they gained by hearing lectures on different subject within dynamics and talking with mathematicians from diverse areas during the projects; that the projects provided a good perspective within which to view the lectures, and that the connections they could create with other graduate students by working on the projects were very valuable.  As a broader impact of the summer school, the participants are now better positioned to pursue research in dynamical systems and related fields. Some of the graduate student participants were working primarily in math biology, physics or applied mathematics. These other disciplines will be enriched by the techniques and training provided to these young researchers. All participants are better able to use ideas from dynamical systems and probability in any STEM field they enter.   The full intellectual merit of the project will be realized by  the participants research and other activities in STEM areas, which will have been enriched by the University of Houston Summer School in Dynamical Systems.        Videos of the summer school lectures  are available for the general public:   https://www.math.uh.edu/dynamics/school/school2019/   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4ITzyY3tPVdWgrLmPTsAqA-f2jIgZo6K       Last Modified: 05/07/2020       Submitted by: Matthew Nicol]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
