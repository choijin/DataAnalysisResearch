<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the quality and efficiency of spinal access procedures by developing a needle guidance system that attaches to ultrasound machines. Lumbar punctures (LPs) are procedures used to diagnose and treat neurological conditions such as meningitis, multiple sclerosis and others. Without prompt intervention, meningitis infections can be fatal within days. During an LP, fluid must be collected from the center of the spine for diagnosis. The procedure can be challenging, costly, and time-consuming and is subject to practitioner experience and patient body type. Practitioners must manually feel for spinal landmarks at the skin surface to position the needle, then blindly insert into the spine. Up to 42% of procedures fail to access the target. In these cases, patients are referred to the Radiology department for an x-ray guided LP, which increases the cost of care, lengthens patient stay, and exposes the patient to radiation. The proposed research aims to develop a needle guidance system that enables spinal access procedures to be performed under real-time ultrasound imaging. By allowing providers to continuously monitor the needle’s trajectory, the proposed system can significantly improve first-attempt success rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost needle guidance system that interfaces with ultrasound equipment in bedside environments. Problems associated with LPs can be attributed to two primary causes: (1) the practitioner often cannot be certain of the target’s location and the needle’s trajectory; and (2) effective use of ultrasound imaging equipment as an alternative to the traditional blind technique relies on practitioner expertise in interpreting spinal ultrasound, which is rare in bedside settings. To remedy the first deficiency, the proposed system will consist of a needle-guiding attachment for an ultrasound probe and a software overlay that displays the needle’s trajectory on top of the ultrasound image. To address the barrier of ultrasound expertise, the software will also incorporate an anatomy recognition algorithm, displaying interpretable spine renderings corresponding to the imaged region. The proposed research will evaluate the needle trajectory prediction accuracy of the system in bench, cadaver, and live tissue models, ensuring minimal prediction error so the needle can consistently be guided to the target. Anatomy recognition software will be developed using images captured from the tissue models with the aim of correctly identifying important anatomical landmarks in at least 93% of cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  During this SBIR Phase I project, Ethos Medical sought to develop a low-cost instrument guidance system that could interface with existing ultrasound imaging equipment in bedside environments. Currently, many procedures performed at the bedside do not employ image guidance; clinicians must use only manual palpation, tactile cues, and their resulting understanding of the underlying anatomy in order to achieve success. This "blind" methodology can be particularly problematic in lumbar punctures (LPs) and other spinal access procedures (e.g. epidural anesthesia), which require the clinician to navigate a needle into the center of the spinal canal without striking bony obstructions. Due to the difficulties in determining optimal insertion site and insertion angle and the inability to monitor the needle’s path throughout the procedure, up to 42% of these procedures fail to access the target. With Phase I funding, Ethos Medical successfully developed the Iris&trade;, a highly adaptable accessory system that consists of three main components:   A reusable interfacing bracket that is secured over the head of an ultrasound probe.   A disposable instrument guide that holds an instrument in a fixed, linear path. The guide can be rotated by the user within the imaging plane of the ultrasound probe in order to adjust the instrument’s angle of approach relative to the ultrasound image. This rotation is tracked in real time the reusable and disposable hardware components.   A mobile software application that communicates with the Iris&trade; hardware components to determine the instrument’s orientation relative to the ultrasound image. This application mirrors the ultrasound machine’s display and projects a line representing the instrument’s computed trajectory on top of the ultrasound image.   This system configuration allows the Iris&trade; to interface with virtually any existing ultrasound machine and probe combination, making it an extremely flexible solution for any bedside environment. In addition to these core features, Ethos Medical has successfully implemented other functionalities that maximize the usability of the system. Chief among these are: 1) automatic display calibration in response to a user changing the ultrasound machine’s imaging settings; and 2) image enhancement to maximize the visibility of spinal landmarks. Not only has Ethos succeeded in developing the proposed technology, but the team has demonstrated clinical efficacy of the Iris&trade; when compared to the blind technique in a series of cadaver studies. Emergency Medicine clinicians were enrolled as participants and performed LPs on cadaver models using both approaches. The Iris&trade; exhibited a significantly higher success rate (nearly four times higher than that of the blind approach), and it significantly reduced the number of needle redirections per procedure (a reduction by nearly 4.5x). These results suggest that the Iris&trade; is capable of significantly improving procedural outcomes, consequently saving patients from undue physical trauma and psychological stress while bolstering hospitals’ resource utilization. These accomplishments are a promising step toward making image-guided procedures the standard of care for both lumbar punctures and any other interventional procedures currently performed blindly.
