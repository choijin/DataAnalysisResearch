<AbstractNarration>Many real data sets in scientific disciplines, such as biomedical, engineering, and social sciences, contain missing, censored, or partially observed values, and this can make the task of statistical estimation and inference significantly more complicated.  Part of this research project focuses on the development of new flexible statistical methods to perform accurate prediction and inference in the presence of incomplete and missing data. Here, the data could be high-dimensional as well as functional, where each data value can be a curve. In another part of this research project, the PI considers the development of new efficient computer-intensive methods to deal with Big-data scenarios, where the data size may be too large to invoke classical approaches. Big-data has been one of the current research frontiers in recent years and there has been a growing interest in  Big-data-driven decision-making procedures in both academia and the industry.  There are still many computational and theoretical challenges in this area that require new methodologies. The PI's new approaches will solve a number of important statistical problems at the intersection of machine learning and statistical inference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research deals with three broad classes of problems related to prediction and inference in some nonstandard setups. These include the problem of functional classification when the covariate curves may be unobservable on some subsets of their domain. However, unlike some of the earlier results in the literature, the PI's approach does not impose any missing-at-random (MAR) type assumptions on the mechanisms that cause the absence or censoring of information. The approach allows for incomplete covariate to appear in the new unclassified curves as well as in the data. Given the observed covariate fragments, the aim is to construct strongly consistent nonparametric classifiers based on local-averaging methods. The second class of problems deals with uniform asymptotics for kernel regression estimators in the presence of missing response variables. This is generally acknowledged to be a difficult problem. The limiting distribution of the maximal deviation of such estimators can be used to construct asymptotically correct uniform confidence bands, or to perform goodness-of-fit tests, for an unknown regression function. Here, the PI will consider both MAR and non-ignorable missing response assumptions. The third set of problems focuses on the development of new weighted bootstrap methods for Big-data scenarios. The PI's approach aims at reducing the computational burden associated with the repeated sampling of Big-data, while still retaining the benefits of bootstrap methodology. The developed methods will be used to better approximate the sampling distribution of kernel and deconvolution density estimators, as well as their important functionals (such as sup- and Lp-norms), in the Big-data scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
