<AbstractNarration>This award partially supports the the participation of approximately 90 students, postdocs, and early-career participants without grant support in the 31st Annual Workshop on Recent Developments in Electronic Structure Theory, which will take place at Urbana, Illinois, in May 2019. The workshop will bring together approximately 150 researchers from academia, industry, and national laboratories. The workshop allows researchers in this field to network and share new developments in simulation techniques for molecules, liquids, solids, and nanomaterials. The techniques are used broadly in physics, materials science, and in chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The general assessment of the workshop was a high level of scientific presentations and deeply useful discussions, especially at the many poster presentations.   Scientific focus. The 2019 topics of invited talks were specifically selected to cover these areas: Quantum chemistry on solids - Green function techniques -   Materials data - Quantum Monte Carlo - Density functional theory  Applications of machine learning to electronic structure This workshop series travels to a different institution within the US each year. Next year's workshop will be held at University of California Merced in June 2020.  The Principal Investigators of this award maintain a permanent archive of all available programs and names of presenters for workshops since 1989 at http://mcc.illinois.edu/workshops/electronicstructure/. Award outcomes. This award resulted in wider participation and professional development opportunities for junior participants. The award also contributed to freely-accessible talk materials. a) Wider participation. At this workshop, we had participants from several research groups who had not been attended before. These participants said that several factors related to cost influenced their decision to come: 1) The modest registration fee ($100) 2) The NSF-sponsored housing 3) The drivable distance from their home institution.  Two leaders of research groups specifically said that their budgets were very limited, but with the low cost and sponsored housing, they could afford to send one graduate student to present the group's work and to learn what other groups are doing. b) Professional development opportunities. b.1) The Local Organizers strongly encouraged all participants to prepare and present posters for two reasons: 1) the Workshop is more useful for exchanging knowledge when more people present their work, and 2) it is important for researchers to develop their speaking and writing skills. There were several younger participants who prepared their first poster for this workshop.   b.2) The workshop also included a "Meet the Editor" session with Dr. Yan Li, an associate editor at the American Physical Society.

Outside of local attendance, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign maintains a permanent web archive for the workshop series, including programs, abstracts for posters and talks, and available talk slides. The website is "Recent Developments in Electronic Structure" at http://mcc.illinois.edu/workshops/electronicstructure/. This provides permanent access to talk slides for people who could not attend in person. Workshop sponsors. The sponsors of this workshop included:  the Grainger College of Engineering and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois the National Science Foundation the U.S. Department of Energy the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation  Specifically, the funding from the National Science Foundation provided dormitory housing for 64 participants during the four-day event. Other sponsors supported travel costs for students and invited speakers, and provided facilities and A/V support during the workshop. Workshop organizers. The 2019 Local Organizers were Lucas Wagner (UIUC-Physics), Andre Schleife (UIUC-MatSE) and David Ceperley (UIUC-Physics), who worked with the 16-member Steering Committee to develop a program including as much as possible the latest research findings from the US and abroad.
