<AbstractNarration>Nearly two decades ago, the Standards for Technological Literacy: Content for the Study of Technology identified what a technologically literate student should know and be able to do. When originally published in 2000, the technological literacy standards established content guidelines and benchmarks for learning across the K-12 spectrum for technology and engineering education programs in the United States and beyond. The Standards for Technological Literacy have served as the basis for decision making and educational planning across a wide spectrum of school programs, districts, state departments of education, teacher certification exams, and national curriculum development efforts. The document has been translated into Finnish, Mandarin, Japanese, and German, and has provided the basis for ITEEA's Engineering by Design (EbD) curriculum model, which is at the core of professional development efforts for K-12 technology and engineering teachers across the U.S. and in several other nations. However, the technologically designed world and the knowledge required to be productive in it continues to rapidly change. Educational leaders realized that what students should know and be able to do is different today, particularly in subjects like technology and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Technology and Engineering Education Association (ITEEA) and the Council on Technology and Engineering Teacher Education (CTETE) will convene a Standards for Technological Literacy (STL) Revision Conference to create an updated standards document, with a target publication date of early 2020. The STL Revision Conference will build upon preparatory activities initiated in 2018 by ITEEA and CTETE members to propose revisions to the Standards. A revision leadership team has been convened, and a thirty-member review team will be recruited for the conference. The review team will be comprised of classroom teachers, district or state supervisors, both two-year and four-year college faculty, and industry representatives. A Draft Executive Summary of the revised standards document will be posted on the ITEEA website for public comment, and a final version of the revised standards will be published and disseminated at the 2020 ITEEA conference and made available on the website. The revised STL document will be promoted through the Technology and Engineering Teacher publication as well as other ITEEA news sources and other STEM-focused outlets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In Summer 2019 a conference was held with 40 educators, professionals from other academic professional associations and stakeholders from the field of technology and engineering education to revise and update the 2000 Standards for Technology Literacy.  The conference resulted in a first draft of Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy (STEL) which was put through a vigorous editing process that included three rounds of review by stakeholders from the broader field.  The end result was the publication of STEL in June 2020.     Since that date, the main professional organization for the field, the International Technology and Engineering Educators Association (ITEEA), has published STEL via open access on their website, along with numerous resources to assist teachers, curriculum developers, and educators from two-year and four-year colleges. The eight standards with 142 benchmarks, eight practices, and eight contexts provide educators the means to link technology and engineering to other content areas, including mathematics, science, and English language arts, as well as to historic and evolving technologies and societal elements of technological development.  Ultimately, STEL will serve as the basis for decision making and educational planning across a wide spectrum of school programs, districts, state departments of education, teacher certification exams, and national curriculum development efforts.
