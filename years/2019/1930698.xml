<AbstractNarration>This award will partially support the participation of approximately 14 participants in the combined Gordon Research Conference on Soft Condensed Matter Physics: "Living and Non-Living Soft Matter on the Edge" and the associated Gordon Research Seminar. The conference will be held between August 11-16, 2019 in the Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire. Preference will be given to supporting graduate students and postdocs. This is a long-running conference that brings together a diverse group of scientists from the broad spectrum of areas covering soft-matter physics. The conference has a substantial mentoring component as the main event is preceded by a two-day Gordon Research Seminar. The conference is expected to lead to fruitful collaborations and new insights on both theoretical as well as on experimental efforts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
