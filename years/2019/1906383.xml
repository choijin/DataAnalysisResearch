<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes the MonArk Quantum Foundry that is jointly operated by Montana State University and the University of Arkansas to accelerate the development of layered two-dimensional (2D) materials and devices for applications in quantum sensing, communication, and computing. Numbering in the thousands, 2D materials offer an expansive library of potential systems for next-generation quantum information science technologies. The exploration of these materials presents significant opportunities to grow the quantum industry in the US, but the vast parameter space presents several formidable challenges that slow the pace of scientific discovery and translating discoveries into quantum technologies. The MonArk Quantum Foundry directly addresses these challenges by (1) the development of materials synthesis and fabrication tools tailored to rapidly assemble prototype quantum devices made from two-dimensional materials, (2) the seamless integration of these tools with next-generation quantum-relevant characterization instrumentation, (3) making this newly developed infrastructure openly accessible to academic, government, and industrial research groups, and (4) providing open-source inspired infrastructure to accelerate the exchange of samples, ideas, technical knowledge, and pedagogical resources to quantum researchers and educators across the US. In addition to impacting the broader community, the MonArk Quantum Foundry accelerates collaborative research priorities of teams from Montana State University and the University of Arkansas to leverage two-dimensional quantum materials for generating and manipulating quantum states of light, innovating new qubit architectures, and exploring quantum magnetic phenomena in two-dimensions. Industrial partnerships and close synergy between theoretical and experimental research are deeply integrated at all levels of Foundry activities. The workforce development, graduate and undergraduate curriculum development, and recruiting activities focus on creating a diverse, quantum-literate workforce in the heartland of the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes a quantum materials foundry that tackles critical translational scientific challenges in the research area of two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials and devices. Two “2D Quantum Materials Pipelines” will be developed and hosted at the Foundry sites at Montana State University and the University Arkansas that integrate robotic automation of the most cumbersome and time-consuming processes of 2D quantum research with cutting-edge quantum characterization instrumentation developed in close collaboration with industrial partners for maximally effective quantum research. The 2D Quantum Materials Pipelines leverage technological innovations to enable researchers to rapidly progress from the conception of a new 2D system to a quantum device to be tested and characterized, accelerating all aspects of translational science in this field. The capabilities of the 2D Quantum Materials Pipelines as well as the acquired technical knowledge and scientific discoveries are made available to researchers through collaborations and open-source resources that expand the reach of the Foundry activities and infrastructure across the US. The in-house research activities of the Foundry converge experimental and theoretical expertise, new concepts from big data and machine learning, and industrial guidance. The 2D Quantum Materials Pipelines enable exploration of novel quantum systems and phenomena such as 2D quantum magnetism and ferroelectricity and development of quantum technologies such as single-photon emitters, entangled photon-pair sources, and novel qubits. Education and outreach activities include websites, webinars, short courses, public engagements, in-person laboratory training for middle/high school/undergraduate/graduate students, and continued professional development for technical workers from industry. The Foundry develops a quantum-literate workforce by integrated research and learning and builds leadership in the quantum sciences by advancing early-career faculty into leadership positions, the impact of which will endure for decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by Condensed Matter Physics Program, Division of Materials Research, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
