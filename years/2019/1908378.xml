<AbstractNarration>With support from the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources (IUSE: EHR), this project aims to serve the national interest by studying and understanding how all students develop graphical literacy, an essential concept for the modern workforce. This project will develop virtual tutoring systems and evaluate how they promote graphical literacy at both a two-year community college and a four-year primarily undergraduate institution. Understanding and interpreting graphical information is a critical foundational skill for STEM majors and the STEM-literate public. While college textbooks and curricula expect students to have mastered graph-reading skills, evidence indicates that college students struggle to read and interpret line and bar graphs. This is particularly true when graphs include multiple variables that increase the complexity and structure of the graph. Several versions of the tutoring system will be tested, each based on competing theories of how individuals learn, to evaluate the most effective method or methods for different students and in different environments. By its conclusion, this project will have developed several research-validated, flexible virtual tutoring systems that can be easily and freely disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop virtual tutoring systems for graphical literacy by drawing on preliminary data demonstrating common points of failure in graphical literacy exhibited by first- and second-year college students. Within these tutoring systems, a controlled experiment informed by cognitive and social-developmental theories of learning will test the independent and interactive effects of context and scaffolding to promote graphical literacy using a 2x2 ANOVA design. Additional hierarchical linear regression analyses will test the role of potential moderators of program impact as well as their interactions with program features. The proposed research is novel in that it explicitly examines competing learning theories and their interaction. An important element of the project is its intentionally inclusive framework that evaluates materials across both two-year and four-year college settings, as well as the role of individual learner characteristics on learning outcomes. An advisory board, consisting of faculty from biology, chemistry, exercise and health sciences, mathematics, and physics, will provide interdisciplinary insights, including discipline-specific applications or program modifications. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
