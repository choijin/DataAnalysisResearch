<AbstractNarration>A summer school on "Current Trends in Symplectic Topology" will be held at the CRM (Centre de Recherches Mathematiques) in Montreal from July 1-12, 2019. Symplectic topology is a rapidly developing branch of geometry that has seen phenomenal growth in the last twenty years. The school is intended to provide access to this subject to a diverse group of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The school will consist of minicourses by leading researchers in the field, exercise sessions, selected talks by young researchers, and an open problems panel to identify central directions for future research. The grant will provide funding to enable US-based graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in the summer school. This will improve the US workforce by providing training in important cutting-edge research topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major themes to be covered in the summer school are the dichotomy between rigidity and flexibility; the Fukaya category and homological mirror symmetry; Hamiltonian dynamics, capacities, and spectral invariants; symplectic field theory, its variants, and applications; and foundational properties of moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves. Although there have been some recent specialized conferences on individual topics in the above list, the summer school is unique in synthesizing these different aspects of symplectic topology into an overview accessible to young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was used to support 23 junior US researchers to participate in a summer school on "Current trends in symplectic topology" at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques (Center of Mathematics Research) in Montreal, Canada in July 2019.   Symplectic topology is a very active area of current mathematical research. It concerns relations between topology and symplectic geometry. Symplectic geometry is the geometry underlying classical mechanics, for example the dynamics of the solar system. Topology is the study of global properties of shapes which are invariant under continuous deformations; for example in topology a sphere is different from a torus (doughnut shape) because the torus has a hole in it while a sphere does not. In symplectic topology one can understand questions in symplectic geometry, for example the existence of periodic motions in a classical mechanical system, in terms of the topology of the phase space describing the possible configurations of the system.   The summer school lasted for two weeks with 4-5 lectures each day and additional opportunities for networking.

The summer school provided invaluable training to its participants, including the 23 junior US researchers supported by the grant, allowing them to get up to speed on topics of current research interest and prepare to make their own contributions to this important and rapidly growing research area.
