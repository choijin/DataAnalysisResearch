<AbstractNarration>The CombinaTexas 2019 conference will be held at Texas A&amp;M University, in College Station, Texas, on March 23-24, 2019. The conference will take place on Saturday and Sunday to make it easy for researchers to attend, and will feature six fifty-minute plenary lectures and a number of twenty-minute contributed talks. The aim of the CombinaTexas conference series is to enhance the educational and research atmosphere of combinatorialists in Texas and the surrounding states, increase communication among mathematicians of the region, and provide a forum for presentation and discussion of the most recent developments in the field of Combinatorics. The first CombinaTexas conference was held in 2000; CombinaTexas 2019 is the eighteenth conference in this series. Over 65 participants are anticipated in 2019, with 20-25 contributed talks in parallel sessions. The conference will be publicized using distribution lists and on related conference websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature a broad selection of combinatorial research. Researchers will present their new results and there will be time for open discussions to explore unsolved problems in the field. The confirmed plenary speakers are Ira Gessel (Brandeis University), Jessica McDonald (Auburn University), Criel Merino (UNAM, Mexico), Svetlana Poznanovikj (Clemson University), Brendon Rhoades (University of California, San Diego), and Joel Spencer (New York University). More details can be found at the conference website:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.tamu.edu/conferences/combinatexas/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CombinaTexas is a combinatorics conference series in the South Central United States.  It is dedicated to the enhancement of both the educational and research atmospheres of the community of combinatorialists and graph theorists in Texas and the surrounding states. The aim of the CombinaTexas series is to increase communication between mathematicians in the region, promote the research of the regional combinatorics community, and provide a forum for presentation and discussion of developments in the field of combinatorics.  CombinaTexas 2019 took place on March 23-24 at Texas A&amp;M University, in College Station, Texas. At that meeting, there were six plenary (invited) talks and twenty-three contributed talks. The conference had 74 registered participants, of whom  53 were early career mathematicians (high school students, undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty).     Intellectual Merit.  Participants had the opportunity to learn cutting edge developments from the distinguished invited researchers, and disseminated their own work through contributed talk sessions.  Broader Impacts.  More than seventy percent of the participants were early career mathematicians (including 30 graduate students), and about twenty-five percent were women.  Major goals of this conference series are to encourage beginning combinatorialists, provide a forum for interaction and collaboration with other members of the community, as well as an opportunity to disseminate their research.
