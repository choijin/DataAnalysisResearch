<AbstractNarration>This project will support early-career US researchers participating in an international mini-symposium titled "Mathematical Methods in Immunology and Infectious Disease Modeling" to be held as part of the summer school during the BIOMATH19 conference in Bedlewo, Poland in June 2019. The conference is an annual international event devoted to recent research breakthroughs and new mathematical challenges arising in life sciences. Early-career US researchers will be exposed to a broad international research community in biology, ecology, medicine, biotechnology, bioengineering, and environmental science. The proposed mini-symposium will be a satellite event of BIOMATH19 designed to develop expertise at the interface of complex dynamics, statistics, and computational science. The mathematical techniques presented have relevance beyond immunology and infectious diseases, with multiple applications in chemistry, neuroscience, physics, sociology, psychology, biometrics, homeland security and national defense. US mini-symposium attendees will establish valuable contacts with international peers, including members of an interdisciplinary consortium focusing on the prevention of vector borne diseases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mini-symposium will include several talks delivered by the PIs to 20-30 participants, as well as short presentations by US early-career researchers. The objectives of the activity are to: 1) Present an up-to-date review of mathematical and statistical tools and new developments in mathematical epidemiology, and 2) Increase international participation by US-based researchers, especially junior faculty and post-doctoral fellows interested in mathematical biology. Fifteen early-career, US-based participants will be supported.  Applications will be solicited broadly across the mathematical biology community; women and members of underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged to apply.  The US attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with an interdisciplinary consortium of European researchers focusing on the Investigation &amp; Mathematical Analysis of Avant-garde Disease Control via Mosquito Nano-Tech-Repellents (IMAAC).  BIOMATH19 conference details may be found on the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://www.impan.pl/en/activities/banach-center/conferences/19-biomath&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
