<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support a Pioneers Workshop (doctoral consortium) of approximately 21 students (18 graduate participants, one undergraduate participant, and two student organizers), along with distinguished research faculty. This full-day event will take place as part of the first day of activities at the 14th International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI 2019), to be held March 11-14 in Daegu, South Korea, and which is jointly sponsored by ACM and IEEE. HRI is the premier conference for showcasing the very best interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research on human-robot interaction, with roots in diverse fields including robotics, artificial intelligence, social psychology, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, human factors, engineering, and many more. It is a single-track, highly selective annual international conference that invites broad participation. The theme of HRI 2019 is "Collaborative HRI." The conference seeks contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, methodological, behavioral, and theoretical, that advance fundamental and applied knowledge and methods in human-robot interaction, with the goal of enabling human-robot interaction through new technical advances, novel robot designs, new guidelines for design, and advanced methods for understanding and evaluating interaction. More information about the conference is available online at http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pioneers Workshop is designed to complement the conference by affording a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities.  Participants are encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years.  Participants also gain leadership and service experience, as the workshop is largely student organized and student led. The workshop provides a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of HRI to share their current research with their peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference. During the workshop, participants talk about the important upcoming research themes in the field. The formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries is encouraged. To these ends, the workshop format encompasses a variety of activities including keynotes, a distinguished panel session, and breakout sessions. To start the day, all workshop attendees briefly introduce themselves and their interests. Following the opening keynote, approximately half of the participants present 3-minute overviews of their work, leading into an interactive poster session. This enables all participants to share their research and receive feedback from students and senior researchers in an informal setting.  After lunch, the remaining workshop participants give their 3-minute overviews, followed by presentation of their posters during a second interactive poster session. Senior researchers (in addition to those on the panel) are invited to attend the student presentations and poster sessions in order to provide feedback to participants, and workshop participants are invited to present their posters during the main poster session of the HRI conference as well.  The day will end with a working dinner for general discussion, reflection and career advice, which will facilitate networking.  The organizers have a strong commitment to recruiting women and members from under-represented groups, and to attracting students and postdocs from different areas of the world and from diverse areas of research.  To further ensure diversity, no more than two student participants will be accepted from a particular institution, and if two are accepted then at  least one of the participants must be female.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Accomplishments  The HRI Pioneers Workshop has a prestigious reputation as a workshop designed to empower academics early in their careers and is a cohort of the world's top student researchers seeking to foster creativity, communication, and collaboration across the diverse field of human-robot interaction. The 2019 Pioneers Workshop goals were for participants to learn about the current state of HRI, to present and receive constructive feedback on their work, and to network with one another as well as senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference.  Major activities:    Three Distinguished Keynotes (facilitating interactions with senior researchers)    Panel of Senior Researchers (facilitating interactions with senior researchers)    Oral and Poster Presentations by Participants (fostering collaboration among peers, facilitating  interactions with senior researchers)  Collaborative Breakout Session (fostering collaboration among peers) Interactive Dinner (facilitating interactions with senior researchers)   Specific objectives  The specific objectives of the workshop were (1) to provide students with opportunities to interact directly with senior researchers (2) to foster collaboration with their peers, and (3) to increase the diversity of participants in the workshop and the field of HRI.  Key outcomes: The 2019 HRI Pioneers Workshop brought together 18 graduate students and 1 undergraduate student, representing a diverse set of universities, labs, backgrounds, and skill levels.

All the accepted abstracts were published in the Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human Robot Interaction, in a dedicated section titled ?Pioneer Talks? (&#8203;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=8666012&#8203;).          Impact  What is the impact on the development of the principal discipline(s) of the project?  The HRI Pioneers workshop serves to supplement and aid in the development of collaborative interdisciplinary relationships with researchers across diverse disciplines and nationalities. In addition, the HRI Pioneers workshop serves to inform young researchers of current research being conducted by their colleagues world-wide, raise awareness of diverse interdisciplinary methodologies, and increase understanding of emerging themes and directions in the rapidly growing field of HRI.  What is the impact on other disciplines?  By allowing representatives of diverse backgrounds to meet in person and network, and by making the accepted abstracts publicly available, the topics and arguments discussed within the workshop are shared broadly with scholars and students who have not participated in the workshop, including researchers from other academic fields, such as cognitive science, neuroscience, gerontology, ethics, philosophy, and others.
