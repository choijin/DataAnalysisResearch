<AbstractNarration>The ever-increasing number of wireless devices that are projected to exceed 12.3 billion by 2022, is catalyzing a coming spectrum crisis in the sub-6 GHz bands. These devices are fueled by applications with ultra-low latency and extremely-high data rate requirements. Thus, spectrum-rich millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies, between 30-300 GHz, are being considered critical components of future mobile cellular systems and emerging WiFi networks with Gbps data rates. While it is true that the mmWave band has the potential to provide very high rates, its unreliability could lead to very poor end-user performance. Therefore, this project aims to develop low-latency mmWave communication protocols that substantially improve end-user performance. The developed techniques will be evaluated and refined using proof-of-concept implementation and testing. Tied with a wide range of novel applications – ranging from mobile AR/VR streaming to autonomous vehicles – this project has a broad appeal to young minds, including women and underrepresented minorities. Through an annual workshop and a summer camp program, this project will also increase participation in computing among female university and high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The true value of 5G-and-beyond wireless networks relies heavily on mmWave connectivity and availability. Thus, their full potential cannot be realized until stringent requirements on latency are satisfied even under stressed conditions. In mmWave-based systems, the delay is primarily dominated by availability (or lack thereof) and not by data rate, where lack of availability manifests itself due to blockage, highly directional communication, inefficient resource allocation, and scheduling policies, and the need for additional beam alignment/refinement steps. This project is aimed at developing the theoretical foundations and algorithmic development for low-latency mmWave networking design from the physical layer and MAC layer to the network layer and data prediction at the application layer. The project will leverage diverse tools across information theory, communication systems, wireless networking, protocol design, stochastic control, optimization, and software development. To achieve these goals, this project is organized in three inter-related thrusts: (i) agile connection setup, (ii) multi-user management and predictive data delivery, and (iii) proof-of-concept implementation and testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
