<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnership for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to create awareness about and provide some solutions to the risks associated with overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiations from sunlight that lead to a negative impact on human health. The technology developed will enable users to enjoy outdoor activities by developing a wearable sensor that detects high levels of exposure to sunlight. By taking preventive measures, the number of people affected by melanoma or other diseases related to over exposure of UV radiation is expected to decrease, thus reducing the financial burden faced with health care. The research will have applications beyond medicine to other industries, such as athletics and cosmetics.  The project will provide a means for faculty and students to transition their innovative technologies into the marketplace. Additional impacts are creation of a knowledgeable and creative workforce in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The experiential learning and entrepreneurial training that the PI and graduate students will gain will lead to an enhanced understanding of innovation, technology commercialization, and entrepreneurship. This will create opportunities for collaborating with small businesses/industry with the potential of launching a new startup. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a prototype of a wearable device which will enable users to monitor exposure to UV radiation when exposed to sunlight and provide prevention messages.  It is estimated that one in five Americans will have skin cancer at some point in their life and 90% of the most widely diagnosed skin cancers are from excessive exposure to sunlight. The lack of available gadgets in the market that can keep an eye on UV exposure and remind a person to use protection while vacationing or enjoying outdoor activities is clear. The intellectual merit of the proposed technology is creating a wearable device using a unique ferroelectric material as a sensor that responds to UVA and UVB radiations. The research objectives include developing a thin film-based UV sensor, testing the sensor and integration with other components to create a wearable device, creating and implementing software to allow users to input personal individualized data and notify the risk and protection messages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
