<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for US-based participants in the 2019 series of Mathematical Sciences Workshops to be held at the Casa Matematica Oaxaca (CMO) in Oaxaca, Mexico during the period April through December 2019.  CMO activities aim to contribute to advancing the frontiers of research in mathematical sciences worldwide, to strengthen the research schools and groups in mathematics and its interactions, in Mexico and eventually in Latin America, and to foster the academic ties of these with top level mathematicians and research schools in the world, particularly in North America.  Participation in the CMO workshops nurtures a globally-engaged US scientific workforce and provides US-based participants unique opportunities for interaction and collaboration with leading researchers from across the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twenty-five 2019 CMO Workshops include a broad range of research areas in the mathematical sciences and their applications. Each workshop hosts up to 42 participants in an intensive, 5-day event. Video recordings of workshop presentations are published, as are workshop reports that summarize the state of the research and directions for further work.  More information on the 2019 CMO Workshops can be found at the CMO web site https://www.birs.ca/cmo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During this  project, 16 BIRS-CMO workshops were held, in which 591 scientists from around the world participated.      The BIRS-CMO workshops for the period 2019 were selected by the BIRS Scientific Committee amongst a large number of applications by top  mathematicians from around the world. These workshops covered a wide variety of cutting-edge mathematical science research topics and their interactions with other disciplines. Each workshop provided a forum for lively and vigorous discussions that combined the skills and experience of longstanding researchers with the freshness and creativity of junior researchers.       Each of the workshops was organized to optimize the time to the maximum, leading to exchanges of the latest scientific advances and fostered new ideas and collaborations in the field of science. In most if not all of them was a significant participation of mathematicians from Mexico and Latin America. Each workshop had its own personality, but all shared the common goal of creating an atmosphere in which innovative ideas and a spirit of collaboration were fostered, all framed in a wonderful environment, with an excellent organization, adequate physical facilities and a quiet and secluded atmosphere that was highly appropriate for effective research in mathematics and its interaction with other sciences.       The BIRS-CMO 2019 workshops had the participation of researchers from the six continents, with 40% coming from the USA.
