<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on multi-modal gastrointestinal measurements for rapid detection and treatment of post-surgical complications. Over 300,000 patients in the US undergo abdominal resection surgery each year. These patients often experience serious complications, such as post-operative ileus, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and anastomotic leakage, that significantly impact quality of life. Treating complications extends hospitalization time at a rate of $2,000 per day; for post-operative ileus alone, additional costs due to prolonged hospitalization time exceed $1.5 billion annually. Rapid detection and treatment of these complications could accelerate recovery, enable closed-loop therapies, and increase quality of life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new sensing modalities for detecting post-surgical complications, combining them into a single miniaturized capsule which can be used for in vivo scientific research studies, and testing this device using a porcine model. This project focuses on developing multi-modal sensing technologies to non-invasively diagnose these complications.  Completion of the aims of this project will pave the way towards telemetric, closed-loop therapies for post-operative gastrointestinal complications. In addition, data gathered and tools developed during this effort will inform future studies using a porcine model of gastrointestinal perturbation and recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
