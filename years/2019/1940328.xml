<AbstractNarration>Environmental issues such as urban heat waves, flooding and sewer overflow, and access to green space present challenges to cities nationwide and threaten environmental sustainability. The Earth Stewardship Initiative (ESI), as a part of the Ecological Society of America (ESA) conference, immerses scientists in a demonstration project that helps shape cities by integrating ecological study with landscape and urban design. The participants include scientists from many disciplines and career stages, city officials, and urban planners. The emphasis on maximizing diversity of the participants will make ESI more effective and will improve societal impacts. ESI staffers will work with city employees to identify plans, projects, and priorities that could benefit from increased engagement with designers and scientists with different perspectives. At the end of the ESI project, the target city receives several white papers detailing solutions to identified sustainability issues. Graduate students exchange ideas and information with city workers while gaining invaluable experience from their collaboration with diverse frontline professionals. Ecologists are able to apply their academic knowledge towards practical problems, and city officials and employees gain access to current research and best practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entering its fourth program year, the ESI project has significantly impacted training of urban ecologists and is fostering the application of creative urban ecology through an interdisciplinary design summit that addresses local ecological challenges for the ESA host city. Historically, ecological research was predominately executed in remote areas where ecosystems were relatively isolated from human activity. The emergence of the field of urban ecology recognized the incongruence between ecological results generated in remote, protected areas and those drawn from experimentation in ecosystems heavily impacted by human use. Recognizing the critical feedbacks between human activities and patterns of land-use, biogeochemical cycles, climate, hydrology, and biodiversity, ecologists need to shift from studying ecology in and of the city to a more active approach to study and shape urban ecosystems. The ESI provides a forum for ecologists to position themselves as contributors to shaping cities and pushes them to do so. During the summit, participants are divided into teams and will research local sustainability issues identified by city officials using ecological perspectives to brainstorm creative solutions for complex city issues. They will also propose "designed experiments," which embed scientific research and statistical analysis into existing projects. This both advances theoretical knowledge and informs local project management, providing a more direct path between NSF research and societal benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Since its inception in 2014, the Earth Stewardship Initiative (ESI) has been uniting research ecologists, graduate students, urban planners, and industry professionals in cooperative and productive discussions addressing sustainability issues faced within the Ecological Society of America (ESA) meeting host cities. As one of the largest professional ecological meetings in the country, ESA is an ideal forum to engage these individuals working towards shared goals, but frequently without direct means of communicating their academic research, real-world findings, successes, and challenges. This NSF award contributed funds for the planning, event, and post-event activities pertaining to the ESI at ESA Louisville 2019. The funding provided for this program was critical to supporting the involvement of graduate student participants in the immersive ecological planning experience.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Nineteen graduate student Fellows participated in the 2019 ESI project, with direct access to Louisville city officials, landscape designers, and industry professionals during an instructional workshop, field trip, inspire session, site visits, workshop with the Louisville Metro Government, community meeting, and ecology and design working sessions. The weeklong event culminated with students presenting their work and findings to Louisville Forward Chief Mary Ellen Wiederwohl. Fellows focused their attention on one of four themes critical to the City of Louisville: park connectivity and access, urban heat island impacts, watersheds and water quality, and hydrology/public health and infrastructure flooding to address ecological sustainability projects that had been developed through iterative discussions with City of Louisville officials and ESI program directors. Participants engaged in these themes throughout the weeklong ESA conference, exploring the problems with novel solutions that incorporated designed ecological experiments in an effort to supplement the City&rsquo;s existing efforts to improve Louisville&rsquo;s livability and ecological sustainability. Findings were summarized in four white papers following the conclusion of the ESA meeting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To address <strong>Park Connectivity and Access</strong> in Louisville&rsquo;s California neighborhood, Fellows devised a low-cost and incremental plan to implement site improvements, including factored-in sociocultural, mental health, and ecological considerations, with contingencies for soil contamination, continued flooding, site upkeep and maintenance, community engagement, and ecological connectivity. Louisville ranks as the fourth hottest urban area in the United States; to address these increasing <strong>Urban Heat Island</strong> (UHI) effects, Fellows proposed building upon existing tree planting programs and creating an Urban Forest Toolbox with centralized data and community resources, education initiatives at different levels and time scales, and using student and community data to assess projects&rsquo; effectiveness in terms of both physical results and community perceptions about the project. Assessment data will be used to inform future projects and initiatives through adaptive management. The <strong>Watersheds and Water Quality</strong><em> </em>team focused on Louisville&rsquo;s Beargrass Creek, which experiences stream impairment due to urbanization and increased impervious surface and causing water quality and quantity issues. Fellows recommended preserving high-functioning headwater streams and using designed experiments to restore impaired headwater streams through monitoring, green infrastructure implementation, and watershed group involvement, citizen scientists, and education in sensor monitoring. To address <strong>Hydrology/Public Health and Infrastructure Flooding</strong>, Fellows targeted West Louisville neighborhoods plagued by soil, air, and groundwater contamination that correlate with chronic health issues, developing solutions that also facilitated park access, which can be challenged due to the contaminants. Fellows proposed a living-learning laboratory, with dispersed air quality and weather monitoring stations, in several West Louisville parks, and gathering baseline environmental quality levels to guide remediation measures and public access opportunities. The public would be directly informed and involved through community surveys, environmental education efforts, and community engagement opportunities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Inherent within each of the four project themes were issues of social equity and environmental justice. Underserved communities were most directly impacted by project themes. While the City of Louisville had the projects addressed by Fellows as forthcoming areas of focus, developing these projects within the context of the ESI program gave them direct and more immediate attention than they would have received otherwise. This targeted attention expedited the development of solutions, and the transdisciplinary nature of the program and embedded designed experiments made the solutions more novel and specific in their nature. Working with underserved and minority communities also allowed Fellows to directly communicate their research and proposals to community members, rather than to fellow scientists, expanding their growth potential as scientists and scholars.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The 2019 ESI project in Louisville created valuable professional interactions between young scientists and their colleagues through a unique multi-day collaboration. Findings generated from the demonstration project offer Louisville new creative solutions to existing and impending climate-related sustainability issues. The embedded designed experiments within the proposed solutions expand research opportunities for city professionals and ecologists to use to monitor and scientifically evaluate the efficacy of recommendations over time. Similarly, the experience granted Fellows valuable professional development experience and networking opportunities while disseminating relevant research and city-specific between ecologists, city planners, and the professional community.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/18/2020<br>      Modified by: Alexander&nbsp;J&nbsp;Felson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1940328/1940328_10622553_1605713139268_PHOTO-2020-11-17-19-23-302--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1940328/1940328_10622553_1605713139268_PHOTO-2020-11-17-19-23-302--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ESI Fellows Field Trip"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1940328/1940328_10622553_1605713139268_PHOTO-2020-11-17-19-23-302--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ESI Fellows Field Trip"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ESI Fellows learning about Louisville's hydrology issues from city professionals.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alex Felson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;J&nbsp;Felson</div> <div class="imageTitle">ESI Fellows Field Trip</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1940328/1940328_10622553_1605713244600_PHOTO-2020-11-17-19-23-303--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1940328/1940328_10622553_1605713244600_PHOTO-2020-11-17-19-23-303--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ESI Fellows Field Trip"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1940328/1940328_10622553_1605713244600_PHOTO-2020-11-17-19-23-303--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ESI Fellows Field Trip"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ESI Fellows participating in field trip to visualize the issues addressed by the problem.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alex Felson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;J&nbsp;Felson</div> <div class="imageTitle">ESI Fellows Field Trip</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1940328/1940328_10622553_1605713309458_PHOTO-2020-11-17-19-23-30--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1940328/1940328_10622553_1605713309458_PHOTO-2020-11-17-19-23-30--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ESI Fellows Field Trip"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1940328/1940328_10622553_1605713309458_PHOTO-2020-11-17-19-23-30--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ESI Fellows Field Trip"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ESI Fellows learning about Louisville's hydrology issues from city professionals.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alex Felson</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;J&nbsp;Felson</div> <div class="imageTitle">ESI Fellows Field Trip</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1940328/1940328_10622553_1605713926489_PHOTO-2020-11-17-19-24-312--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1940328/1940328_10622553_1605713926489_PHOTO-2020-11-17-19-24-312--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ESI Community Meeting Discussions"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1940328/1940328_10622553_1605713926489_PHOTO-2020-11-17-19-24-312--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ESI Community Meeting Discussions"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Discussions between ESI participants and community members during the community meeting.
