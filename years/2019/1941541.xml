<AbstractNarration>This award supports a 1.5-day workshop at the University of Maryland that brings together engineers and scientists from academia and industry with expertise in speech processing, natural language processing and robotics to focus on the critical role that speech science should play in developing future embodied robotic technologies that can communicate effectively with humans of any demographics and in any environment. The result of the workshop will be a report containing well-motivated interdisciplinary research opportunities to promote the development of social robot applications that are beneficial to society.  Solving the problem of spoken language processing for human to robot interaction will help in allowing a broad application of social robots including working with and alongside people in homes, schools, hospitals and workplaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first day of the workshop will include several parallel breakout groups that look at a variety of topics including the applications for social robots, what lessons we can learn from conversational agents, improving the spoken language communication of robots, shared resources and tasks across researchers, training of students, and collaboration between researchers in academia and those in industry.  The second day will include all participants in a  discussion of the results from the breakout sessions and the documentation of opportunities to move the field forward during the next 5 to 10 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With robotics rapidly advancing, more effective human-robot interaction is increasingly needed to realize the full potential of robots for society.   While spoken language must be part of the solution, our ability to provide spoken language interaction capabilities is still very limited.  The National Science Foundation accordingly convened a workshop, bringing together speech, language, and robotics researchers to discuss what needs to be done.   The result in a report, in which we identify key scientific and engineering advances needed to enable effective spoken language interaction with robotics.  Our recommendations broadly relate to eight general themes.   First, meeting human needs requires addressing new challenges in speech technology and user experience de-sign. Second, this requires better models of the social and interactive aspects of language use.   Third, for robustness, robots need higher-bandwidth communication with users and better handling of uncertainty, including simultaneous consideration of multiple hypotheses and goals.  Fourth, more powerful adaptation methods are needed, to enable robots to communicate in new environments, for new tasks, and with diverse user populations, without extensive re-engineering or the collection of massive training data. Fifth, since robots are embodied, speech should function together with other communication modalities, such as gaze, gesture, posture, and motion.   Sixth, since robots operate in complex environments, speech components need access to rich yet efficient representations of what the robot knows about objects, locations, noise sources, the user, and other humans. Seventh, since robots operate in real time, their speech and language processing components must also.  Eighth, in addition to more research, we need more work on infrastructure and resources, including shareable software modules and internal interfaces, inexpensive hardware, baseline systems, and diverse corpora.   Research and development that prioritizes these issues will, we believe, provide a solid foundation for the creation of speech-capable robots that are easy and effective for hu-mans to work with.
