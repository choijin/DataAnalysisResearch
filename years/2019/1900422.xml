<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael R. Wasielewski of the Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University is developing a fundamental understanding of how to control charge and spin transport through organic molecules.  Such control is critical to the future of electronics, computers, and quantum information science (QIS). The degree of control over molecular structure and properties afforded by this research makes it possible to develop molecules and materials that take advantage of electron spin changes to implement new strategies for computer of the future that may have speeds and encryption technologies far beyond the current models. The Wasielewski research group volunteers in the Science In The Classroom program (SITC), with 3rd/4th-graders at an elementary school in an historically under-served and diverse community in Chicago. Approximately one third of the classes served by SITC are multilingual, and learn English as a second language alongside the regular curriculum. By volunteering with the same class of students for the academic year, Northwestern students mentor and inspire young scientists. The research team also participates in the program "Letters to a Pre-Scientist" which focuses on creating personal connections between middle school students from underprivileged schools and scientists to encourage the younger students to consider science as a career by writing letters as a pen pals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photogenerated molecular excited states and electron transfer reactions are playing an increasing role in quantum information science (QIS). This project will address several goals based on what are known in the QIS field as the DiVincenzo criteria, which are essential for exploiting multi-radical assemblies as spin qubits that target QIS applications. Professor Wasielewski and his group use two spin-selective photophysical processes to hyperpolarize electron spins to generate well-defined initial quantum states of spin qubits and determine the dephasing mechanisms of the spin qubits.  The team then manipulates and addresses specific spin qubits to demonstrate quantum gates and uses both microwave and visible photon pulses to move (teleport) spin coherences between two sites.  Finally, the team establishes strategies for scalable spin qubit arrays based on DNA hairpin structures. They use laser excitation to generate the initial hyperpolarized spin qubits and time-resolved pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (pulse-EPR) spectroscopy to observe, manipulate and control the coherent spin states of these qubits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
