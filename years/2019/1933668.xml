<AbstractNarration>Morehouse College is requesting funds for 30 African-American computing undergraduate students and eight computing faculty to participate in a collegiate planning workshop that will be co-located with the 41st Annual National Black Data Processing Associates (BDPA) Technology Conference &amp; Career Fair. The workshop will be held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel during August 1-3, 2019. The workshop focuses on increasing the number of Black computing professionals at the undergraduate level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop activities will examine best practices and seek to articulate strategies for collaborating with the information technology industry to increase internships for historically underrepresented minority students pursuing computer science and information technology careers. Proceedings will be disseminated broadly to other institutions of higher education, particularly Historically Black Colleges and Universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
