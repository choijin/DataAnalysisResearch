<AbstractNarration>This grant will support costs for the 2019 biannual research and education conference of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) at Arizona State University. The theme of the conference is "Environmental Engineers and Scientists see Cities in 4-D." The conference will include one day of workshops, two days of technical sessions, poster sessions, plenary speakers, and numerous opportunities to exchange ideas and create new partnerships. Broader impacts will result from the exchange of ideas, sharing of best practices, and creation of new partnerships to improve education and address environmental issues facing society. The broader public will be able to view much of the knowledge shared at the conference through live-streaming. Underrepresented minorities will be supported by the conference, thus helping to diversify the Nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. A workshop on science communication will facilitate communication of science to the public, thereby increasing the scientific literacy of the Nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support the 2019 biannual research and education conference of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) at Arizona State University in Tempe, AZ. The theme of the conference is "Environmental Engineers and Scientists see Cities in 4-D," with distinct science and education tracks comprising the different branches of the AEESP community and overlapping complementary fields. Technical sessions will focus on state-of-the-science wastewater treatment and resource recovery, resilience and sustainability, urbanization, and incorporation of data science techniques such as artificial intelligence and machine learning in environmental engineering. The AEESP conference theme, plenary speakers, and technical session tracks will enable exchange of knowledge and forming of new partnerships between AEESP and data science researchers and educators. Broader impacts of the conference are numerous and originate from the exchange of ideas to educate the next generation of environmental engineering and science leaders to improve the well-being of society. Underrepresented minorities will be supported by the conference, thus helping to diversify the Nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. A workshop on science communication for AEESP members will facilitate communication of science to the public, thereby increasing the scientific literacy of the Nation. Major efforts will be incorporated to share the educational and scientific findings with the public, thus improving scientific literacy and increasing public engagement with science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The 2019 AEESP Research and Education Conference was held at Arizona State University in Tempe, AZ, May 14?16, 2019. The conference theme of Environmental Engineers &amp; Scientists see Cities in 4-D focused on cities as key area of important impact for environmental engineering solutions, and emphasized the dimensions of the built environment, the natural environment, human health, and cyberspace. Environmental Engineers &amp; Scientists see Cities in 4-D also provided a coherent theme for integrating research and education. The conference included one day of workshops, two days of technical sessions, poster sessions, plenary speakers, and numerous opportunities to exchange ideas and create new partnerships. The conference brought together over 700 attendees from over 100 institutions highlighting the broad reach and impact of the conference. The major outcomes of this project included supporting one day of preconference workshop, dissemination of the Environmental Engineering for the 21st century consensus study report, wide dissemination and broadening participation of technical conference content through recording and live-streaming technical session tracks, and advancing knowledge within Environmental Engineering and across related fields. The preconference workshops included 14 half-day workshops and 2 full-day workshops. The workshops provided a venue for advancing knowledge within fields of Environmental Engineering, e.g., emerging technologies for water reuse and environmental data science techniques, and broadening participation including increasing diversity and community engagement. The conference also served as key venue to share and discuss the recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine consensus study report Environmental Engineering for the 21st Century: Addressing Grand Challenges. The discussion of this report is critical and timely given that it sets the trajectory for Environmental Engineering research and education endeavors, and communicates the positive impacts of Environmental Engineering solutions for society. For the first time, the AEESP conference which is a biennial event, live-streamed its technical content. Specifically, one technical session track was live-streamed and recorded each day. This provided a unique opportunity to share new environmental engineering research findings and education practices. In addition, the conference premiered a new speaking format called Chats in 4-D. This provided the opportunity to discuss technical and non-technical topics related to the environmental engineering and science discipline. The conference made major impacts to advancing knowledge within Environmental Engineering and across related fields. The conference featured 200 talks covering all areas of Environmental Engineering research and education including emerging contaminants in water and air, state-of-the-art drinking water and wastewater treatment, emerging impacts of antibiotic resistance, curricular innovations, and student engagement.<br /><br /><br /></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/11/2020<br>      Modified by: Treavor&nbsp;Boyer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
