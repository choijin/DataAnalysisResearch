<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction between light and matter at the nanoscale can be very different from our daily macroscopic experience. When the dimensions of material structures, or the space separating them, reach the range of nanometers, the quantum nature of light and matter emerges and gives rise to new phenomena. This award supports theoretical research that is aimed at investigating various new phenomena involving the transfer of momentum and energy between nanoscale objects within the context of two novel concepts that have recently emerged in the field of nanophotonics: structures with atomic thickness and spin-orbit interactions of light. The investigation of these phenomena within a common theoretical framework will allow the PI and his team to establish the foundations for new paradigms enabling noncontact transfer of momentum and energy at the nanoscale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this award can, in the long run, help in developing novel approaches for manipulating nanoscale objects, including biologically relevant structures. The results on energy transfer can have an impact on the improvement of thermal devices and heat management strategies in nanoelectronics. This award also supports educational and outreach activities aimed at improving the recruitment and retention of students in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), with a special emphasis on first-generation and low-income students from underrepresented minorities. The PI and his team will implement a range of activities targeting students, from middle school to the graduate level, which aim to generate and foster interest in STEM disciplines, preserve that interest, and mold it into essential skills and experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research with an overarching goal of investigating the transfer of momentum and energy at the nanoscale mediated by the quantum and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. To that end, the PI and his team will implement a robust theoretical framework by investigating and overcoming the limits of the fluctuational electrodynamics approach, and use it to study two novel nanophotonics concepts within the context of fluctuation-induced phenomena: low-dimensional systems and spin-orbit interactions of light. The investigation will be organized around four research thrusts addressing the following specific goals: (1) explore the limits of the fluctuational electrodynamics approach and implement the necessary improvements to describe fluctuation-induced phenomena involving low-dimensional nanostructures and spin-orbit interactions of light, (2) investigate the Casimir torque between different rotating nanostructures as a mechanism to transfer angular momentum in the nanoscale, paying special attention to low-dimensional systems, and exploit the spin-orbit interactions of light to achieve unidirectional transfer of angular momentum, (3) investigate the Casimir forces acting on low-dimensional nanostructures and their interplay with other relevant interactions, such as electrostatic forces, and (4) study the thermalization of ensembles of nanostructures mediated by radiative heat transfer and explore low-dimensional structures and spin-orbit interactions of light as a path to achieve full temporal control over the transfer of energy at the nanoscale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this award can, in the long run, help in developing novel approaches for manipulating nanoscale objects, including biologically relevant structures. The results on energy transfer can have an impact on the improvement of thermal devices and heat management strategies in nanoelectronics.

The PI and his team will implement a range of activities targeting students, from middle school to the graduate level, which aim to generate and foster interest in STEM disciplines, preserve that interest, and mold it into essential skills and experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
