<AbstractNarration>The Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes (QLCI) program is part of the Quantum Leap, one of the research Big Ideas promoted by the National Science Foundation. This award is a QLCI Conceptualization Grant, which supports activities to build capacity among teams planning for the large-scale, interdisciplinary Challenge Institute projects that aim to advance the frontiers of quantum information science and engineering. Research at these Institutes will span the focus areas of quantum computation, quantum communication, quantum simulation, and/or quantum sensing. The Institutes are expected to foster multidisciplinary approaches to specific scientific, technological, and workforce development goals in these fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Conceptualization Grant will develop well-formulated plans for a future Challenge Institute proposal along the themes of quantum simulation, quantum materials, and quantum algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Initially focusing on the diverse Texas population, inclusive outreach and training programs were planned to widen and reinforce the STEM pipeline and prepare a workforce for quantum-enabled careers.     Intellectual Merit   Quantum simulation can provide deep insights into quantum phenomena beyond the limits of classical computation. This holds promise to unleash the creation of advanced materials with designer properties and harnessing of molecular energy transfer and harvesting processes with increased efficiency. A concerted program in quantum simulation can overcome existing obstacles and build the quantum-simulation infrastructure required to realize this vision and provide the first transformative results of the second quantum revolution well before large-scale, error-corrected quantum computers can be built. For many problems, quantum simulation will continue to provide the most powerful modeling tools for the foreseeable future, just as wind tunnels and analog computation machines played critical roles well into the digital age.

Encoding, algorithm, and platform advances were applied to related problems of molecular energy spectra, nonequilibrium dynamics, frustrated magnetism, and optimization problems in engineering reliability. To address the critical need for validation of quantum simulators, TQI addressed each challenge with multiple atom- and condensed-matter-based platforms with overlapping regimes of accessible parameters and validity. This unique approach also efficiently addressed cross-cutting challenges common to all platforms(including digital approaches) such as quantum state initialization, scalability, and decoherence.     Broader Impacts  We have engaged researchers from various communities in a series of activities aimed at building a network. Fifty-seven people from twelve Texas universities and three companies participated in the kickoff meeting. The PI, co-PIs, senior personnel, and collaborators at Rice and UT Austin, including experts in education, outreach, diversity, inclusion, assessment, and evaluation, have formed the core group of this initiative. Texas’ diverse, growing population has created a unique opportunity for workforce development, educational activities, and outreach initiatives that can target traditionally under-represented groups in technical fields.
