<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the thematic research program Operator Algebras, Groups, and Applications to Quantum Information that will be held from March 11 to June 29, 2019, at the research institute ICMAT in Madrid, Spain. The conference focuses on recent developments in the field of operator algebras (C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras) and its interactions with group theory and the relatively young subject of quantum information. The main activities of the program consist of two schools, two workshops, and an international conference, and the themes to be addressed include classification aspects of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, the dichotomy between amenability and paradoxicality in its various guises, and the Connes embedding problem in relation to quantum information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak in the schools, workshops, and international conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to participate in this program. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   &lt;br/&gt;More information is available at: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://www.icmat.es/RT/2019/OAGAQI/activities.php&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
