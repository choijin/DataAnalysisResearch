<AbstractNarration>This project funds a workshop for Postdoctoral Research Fellows in Biology, supported by the Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology track. The workshop is designed to serve fellows from the 2019 cohort by providing support for approximately 30 fellows to attend a workshop facilitated by SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science). The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for promoting best practices and assessment of broadening participation activities, professional and career development, and to catalyze interactions and collaborations between fellows and with established scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Postdoctoral Fellows conduct research across all fields of biology supported by the Directorate for Biological Sciences. The Fellows in this track also work to increase participation of students and others from groups underrepresented in science by mentoring, educational activities, and public outreach. The workshop will allow Fellows to exchange ideas and learn from experts about best practices and assessment of activities to broaden participation. To promote professional development, scientists will share effective strategies and information for different career paths. The venue for the workshop is 2019 SACNAS - The National Diversity in STEM Conference. The activities will occur in a day-long workshop prior to SACNAS followed by meetings throughout the three-day conference. Common interests and interactions during the workshop will make possible the formation of collaborations that persist as the Fellows disperse to their home research institutions across the US. Overall the workshop will contribute to the national goal of increasing STEM diversity by supporting leadership in broadening participation and the career success of the Fellows, who themselves comprise a diverse group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Question 2 of the survey asked participants to "Rate the value of the presentations and share suggestions for the additions and improvements to the workshop". A total of ten presentations were listed as part of the workshop. These included five on career profiles, two on best practices, and the following three topics: 1) mentors focused on individual development plans, 2) self-assessment of skills for individual development plans and 3) the opportunity to present on a poster on scientific research and broadening participation. Participants were asked to indicate the level of usefulness from 'Very Useful', 'Somewhat Useful', 'Neutral', 'Minimally Useful' and 'Not Useful at All'.&nbsp; Of the 23 who participated in the workshop, 18 participants completed the survey and five did not respond to the request to complete the post survey.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Career Presentations</h3> <p>Among the 18 participants, 17 provided responses to four career profile questions and 18 provided responses to one career profile question. Most participants (from 70% to 100%) considered the Career profile presentations as very or somewhat useful (see Figure A) with one exception. The career presentation on Abadie was considered very or somewhat useful by 48% of participants and 35% indicated a neutral rating.&nbsp; All participants who attended the Weaver and Husbands career profile presentation considered them very or somewhat useful.&nbsp; The remaining presentations rating of very or somewhat useful were from 71% to 83%.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Lunch with Mentors</h3> <p>Among the 17 participants that responded, the majority indicated "Lunch with mentors focused on individual development plans" was either very or somewhat useful (18% and 41% respectively) (See Figure B).&nbsp; A similar percentage (18%) rates the presentation as neutral or minimally useful.</p> <h3>Best Practices</h3> <p>Among the 18 participants that completed the survey, 17 provided feedback on the two best practices presentations. The majority (88%) of participants indicated the "Best Practices in Broadening Participation and Assessment" was very or somewhat useful (59% and 29% respectively) (see Figure C). Similarly, the majority-76% of participants indicated "The Best Practices in Culturally Sensitive Mentoring" presentation was very or somewhat useful (35% and 41% respectively).</p> <h3>Poster Presentation and Self-Assessment</h3> <p>Among the 18 participants that completed the survey, 17 provided feedback on the "Opportunity to present a poster on scientific research and broadening participation" and 16 on "Self-assessment of skills for individual development plans". The majority (87%) of participants indicated the Self-Assessment of Skills for Individual Development Sensitive Mentoring presentation as very or somewhat useful (56% and 31% respectively) (see Figure D). Slightly more than half (58%) indicated ?Opportunity to present a poster on scientific research and broadening participation work? as very or somewhat useful (47% and 12% respectively).
