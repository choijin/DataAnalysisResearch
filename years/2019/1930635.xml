<AbstractNarration>This is an award to support travel and a Doctoral Consortium at the 2019 Educational Data Mining (EDM) Conference for up to 10 doctoral students. The Doctoral Consortium provides a forum for mentoring and research collaborations with EDM participants. The doctoral students will be chosen through an application process. The selection committee will ensure that the selected students form a diverse group with respect to interests and with attention being paid for participation of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Doctoral Consortium is a conference within the conference where each student is matched with a mentor. The students will share their research with their mentors, other experienced researchers, and other students as they pitch their research as a high-level overview. They will then get tailored advice and research contacts that will be valuable for their future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
