<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Innovative Approaches for Robust and Reliable Operation of Voltage Source Converters in Critical Conditions of Emerging Grids&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grid-connected voltage source converters are increasingly deployed in the energy sector, e.g. for the interconnection of distributed energy resources to the power grid. An instant of the converter's poor functionality can cause local and system level problems. For example, the cause of the 1,200 MW fault-induced solar photovoltaic resource interruption in Southern California is identified in erroneous functioning of the phase-locked loop employed in the inverter control system. The field data also show an unstable operation of photovoltaic inverters caused by grid voltage harmonics and partial or full generation loss caused by routine utility-owned capacitor switching incidents. Functions such as accurate and robust frequency estimation, voltage synchronization, and current generation during challenging conditions are crucial to maintaining the reliability of a power grid with high penetration of distributed resources. This research has identified 1) grid weakness, 2) grid voltage distortions, and 3) grid voltage and frequency disturbances, as broadly describing the major critical grid conditions. Thus, it proposes to 1) investigate the impacts of these conditions on the inverter functions, and 2) to synthesize Innovative and Effective Solutions. The proposed research invests in developing Modular, Practical and Efficient solutions that fully integrate the converter components and minimize demanding components that compromise the integrity of this multi-objective system. The project results will advance the quality and strength of inverter responses during critical conditions of future grids and will lead to the 1) improvement in the power system reliability, 2) improvement in its power quality, and 3) increase in its inverter hosting capacity. This will enhance the public power delivery services, empower the related energy industry, and develop new ties among various education and research communities. The project will stimulate and sustain the cross-disciplinary training of diversified students, particularly the underrepresented minorities enrolled in STEM programs at Mississippi State University and Georgia Southern University, and improve the broad STEM curricula. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will establish theories to effectively formulate interactions among components of a grid-connected converter such as its phase-locked loop and its controller and between the converter and its hosting power network. Effective modeling, analysis and control processes will be developed for robust integration of the converter to the weak, polluted, and disturbed grid conditions. The phase-locked loop, optimal and robust controls, signals, and generator emulation theories are used to solidly tie the converter components together and design them in an optimal way. The project's approach is to fully integrate and optimize the converter components without adding redundant and disjoint components which may compromise other aspects of this multi-faceted and highly coupled engineering system. Particularly, recent advanced models of the phase-locked loops and recent optimal control design approaches will be deployed and joined to fully integrate the phase-locked loop into the entire control system of the converter and to design the entire control system in an optimal and robust way. High-fidelity power-hardware-in-the-loop testing will be used to examine the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methods. Through full components integration leading to reduced oscillations and instabilities, the proposed project will increase the inverter hosting capacity of a given power grid, as well as its reliability and power quality. The project will also enhance the fundamental knowledge in those multiple fields (i.e. the phase-locked loops, optimal and robust controls, and signals) as applied to the crucial problems of integrating renewable resources to the power and energy system of our twenty-first century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

We have 1) investigated the impacts of these conditions on the inverter functions and 2) synthesized innovative and effective solutions. We have proposed a novel 2-degree-of-freedom control for grid-connected voltage-source inverters. The proposed approach is substantially improved the converter performance considering pulse-width modulation-made nonlinearities in the control design. The project results have advanced the quality and strength of inverter responses during critical conditions of future grids (e.g., unbalanced, low-inertia, or weak grids). They have led to the 1) improvement in power system reliability and resiliency, 2) improvement in its power quality, and 3) increase in its inverter-hosting capacity. The project will stimulate and sustain the cross-disciplinary training of diversified students, particularly the underrepresented minorities enrolled in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs at Georgia Southern University and&nbsp;Mississippi State University, improve broad STEM curricula, and train the next generation of the power industry's professional workforces. The PIs have multiple articles published, under-revision, under-review, under-preparation---which are/will be&nbsp;available via the NSF Public Access Repository for this award---showing this project's results.</p> <p>Furthermore, we have built the 1,200-square-foot&nbsp;<strong>Laboratory for Advanced Power and Energy Systems</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wJkif_nydkLFh3NUoJcqeXtNnHUDgyMP/view?usp=sharing">hyperlink here,&nbsp;<strong>LAPES</strong></a><a href="file:///E:/Proposals/NSF/EPCN_CAREER_2021/Facilities_Resources/NSFcareer2021FacilitiesEquipmentVer3.docx#_ftn1"><sup>1</sup></a>)---founded, established, and directed by the PI in the recently established Center for Engineering and Research (CEaR) opened in January 2021 at Georgia Southern University---as the leading site to perform this project at Georgia Southern University. Three independent power systems (designed by the PI) with the four-pole, five-wire architecture have fed LAPES. They supply LAPES via three (3) three-phase feeders based on ABB bus duct (also known as ABB Spectra<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;series busway) with the voltage levels of 600/346 V, 480/277 V, and 208/120 V (each feeding 200 A) with the total power of over 440 kVA. They enable Georgia Southern University with any testing using LAPES's state-of-the-art facilities. LAPES's pieces of equipment are able to generate/consume dc and ac electric power to form different ac, dc, and hybrid ac/dc power systems. In order to test ac electric power, we are able to generate electricity for terrestrial power systems (60/50 Hz including harmonics up to 63<sup>rd</sup>) and for aerospace power systems (400 Hz including harmonics) with different structures. Our power electronics can be switched up to 30 kHz---depending on the applications. LAPES has been equipped with&nbsp;<strong>400,000 dollars'</strong>&nbsp;worth of pieces of equipment---funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and Georgia Southern University's start-up package/end-of-year funds---we are able to employ them in projects worth up to $2M.</p> <p>LAPES has graduate/undergraduate students (including underrepresented students) working on/completed projects directly related to the application of very fast, high-power voltage-source converters (VSCs) in hybrid ac/dc smart grids; control and protection of power electronic converters in modernized grids; and the integration of renewable energy systems.
