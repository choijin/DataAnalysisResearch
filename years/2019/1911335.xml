<AbstractNarration>The near-Earth environment (Geospace) is mostly organized by the Earth's magnetic field, which interacts with the solar wind (charged particles, plasma, flowing with a great speed from the Sun) and interplanetary magnetic field (extended Sun's magnetic field). Geospace is populated by plasma that mostly originates from the solar wind. Interaction of these two major players - geomagnetic field and solar wind plasma produces many electromagnetic phenomena such as beautiful ionospheric aurorae (Northern and Southern lights), natural electromagnetic radiation, field-aligned and ionospheric currents, that prominently appear and are observed in the polar areas where they are most intense. Studying these phenomena is a matter of high importance since they affect both satellite instrumentation and their communication with the ground centers. The number of satellites flying Geospace continues to grow every year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will study and establish the relationship between Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR) observed by distant satellites and ground-level AKR-like signals, as well as will test current theories on how these phenomena are connected. The methodology is to operate radio receivers at South Pole during anticipated conjunctions with the Cluster satellite high-resolution wave instrument and enabling simultaneous measurements of AKR fine structure at both locations. Further observations of coincident AKR on the Japanese Geotail and Canadian ePOP satellites and at South Pole will complement these measurements. All this research can only be done from Antarctica - because AKR-like signals cannot be regularly observed in the Northern hemisphere due to man-made radio frequency interference, as well as because conjugate satellite/ground-based observations at auroral latitudes require Antarctic measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
