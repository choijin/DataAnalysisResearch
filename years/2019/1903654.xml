<AbstractNarration>This award provides participant support to the North American High Order Methods Conference (NAHOMCon), to be held June 2-5, 2019 at the San Diego State University. The conference will serve as a forum for computational scientists, mathematicians, scientists and engineers to share ideas and techniques on and further the state of the art of advanced high order methods used to solve a broad range of scientific and engineering problems. American competitiveness depends heavily on technological advances.Yet American research on high order methods has been at a disadvantage compared to that in European or other nations due to the lack of conferences devoted to the subject. This conference will have broad impacts by providing a forum for researchers on high order numerical methods for the solution of scientific and engineering problems of strategic importance. It also recognizes the need for younger researchers, women and minorities  to have a forum in the US. More details about the conference can be found at https://www.nahomcon19.sdsu.edu/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High order approximations to PDEs, be they finite difference, finite element or spectral, have needed advantages over lower order methods. Of course, they have lower errors for a given number of degrees of freedom. But also they are usually designed to have lower dissipation and dispersion errors. Their high resolution makes them more suitable for intrinsic multiscale problems such as turbulence computations, chemically reacting flows and  nuclear fusion reaction. The NSF currently supports numerous research projects on high order methods, but no nationwide conferences are in place that are focused on their study. The proposed conference topics are based on the general thrusts of these projects and are the forefront of high order method development. They include provably stable schemes, fast solvers for high order methods, methods for complex geometries, efficient and parallel implementations. Applications are considered in a range of fields including geoscience, fluid mechanics, combustion, solid mechanics, electromagnetics, biomedical, and image processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
