<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the further development of sustainable mobility by developing a new, disruptive class of renewable materials for low-rolling resistance tire tread rubber compound applications. The company will be active not only in materials development and sales, but also in the exploration of new and valuable application areas for energy-efficient renewable materials. The initial target application area is the material used in low-rolling resistance tread compounds for tires currently using petroleum-derived materials, a $5 B market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be directed to the technical feasibility of a critical enabling technology supporting the use of renewable elastomers in low-rolling resistance tire applications. Specifically, the innovation will focus on latex-phase nano-scale reinforcement of natural rubber using novel functional silica-based materials. The technical hurdles include translation of the technology from spin-coating of polytetrafluoroethylene nanoemulsion thin films to bulk solids formation from a natural rubber latex. These are significant challenges because the formation mechanisms, required functional groups, and end-use performance requirements are significantly different. Specific challenges include creation of novel functional silica-based materials; uniform dispersion of the materials in a natural rubber (NR) latex; interactions between the material and the phospholipid of the NR latex particle surface; the chemistry and concentration of the functionalization; characterization of the resulting composite polymer and its microstructure; and adaptation and processing of the innovative polymer into a vulcanized rubber tire tread compound with the desired properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through this Phase I SBIR, Silpara has demonstrated a breakthrough technology that will reduce fuel consumprion and CO2 emissions by hundreds of millions of tons.  The application area is the tread material used in truck and bus tires.   All tires generate heat in use due to internal friction - this heat is wasted energy.  The internal friction is a result of weak bonding between the polymer and filler phases of the tread rubber compound. The bonding/friction/heat problem is especially bad with current silica-filled natural rubber compounds because of the poor bonding between the polar silica and non-polar natural rubber (polyisoprene). Silpara reduces the internal friction through the use of an innovative nanotechnology that improves the molecular polymer-filler bonding within the rubber  Tread materials are primarily composed of rubber polymers and inorganic reinforcing fillers.  The most common rubber polymer is natural rubber (NR) from Hevea braziliensis.  The industry wants to move to silica fillers because they can provid the best combination of properties.  The primary properties of interest are rolling resistance, wear resistance, and wet traction.  Silpara delivers improved silica-NR bonding through a novel chemistry and process:  An aqueous silsesquioxane oligomer solution is blended directly into a natural rubber latex.  Silica network formation begins in the aqueous phase (Figure 1.) The process is done with small molecules in a low-viscosity aqueous media in order to maximize the polymer-filler interaction.  This is in contrast to standard industry practice of attempting to physically blend solid natural rubber polymer with precipitated silica powder.  Figure 2 shows a fragment of the Silpara continuous silica nano-network. (This image was prepared by removing the polymer in a 600 &deg;C N2 TGA sweep and imaging the inorganic network fragments in a STEM.)  Figure 3. shows the EDS of the silicon-oxygen-carbon network.  Figure 4 is a nano-DMA image that contrasts the reinforcement (Composite E') of the Silpara composite to untreated NR (dried latex).  Figure 5 shows the bulk DMA (a tan-delta temperature sweep).  Low tan-delta at high temperature correlates to improved (reduced) rolling resistance (improved fuel economy and vehicle range) while high tan-delta at low temperature correlates to improved wet traction.  Figure 6.  Shows the so-called "Magic Triangle" of tread rubber properties for three Silpara compound varients compared to a control.  A significant expansion of the triangle area means significantly improved tire performance.  As a result of these technical breakthroughs, Silpara has secured testing agreements with major tire companies and industry suppliers.
