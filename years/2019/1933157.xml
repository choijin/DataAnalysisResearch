<AbstractNarration>Oceanhackweek 2019 will be a 5-day intensive "learning hackathon", held during August 26-30, 2019 at the University of Washington. The hackathon provides an avenue for expediting the adoption of data science methodologies and computational tools for data-intensive research in the ocean sciences community. These skills are indispensable for modern-day oceanographers to tackle complex scientific questions by harnessing the data revolution. Oceanhackweek differs from traditional academic conferences and one-off hackathons by its immersive curriculum, collaborative learning environment, and a set of carefully crafted participant selection criteria that helps promote diversity and inclusivity. These designs help spurs collaborative interdisciplinary ideas and help ingest best data science practices into ocean sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hackathon will focus on a variety of ocean data, including data from the Ocean Observing System, an ocean data facility supported by the National Science Foundation's Division of Ocean Sciences. Other databases that will be used include the  CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data Office (CCHDO) and Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) database. Oceanhackweek focuses not only on promoting data science literacy but also on building an inclusive and cohesive community of oceanographers for learning and sharing. The hackathon opportunity will be advertised nationally and internationally in traditional academic venues and via social media. Participants will be selected by an advisory committee that will seek to create a diverse community of ocean data users. The organizers plan to encourage and empower participants to bring the skills gained and the sense of community formed during the hackweek back to their own labs and institutions. Beyond the intensive in-person workshop, Oceanhackweek tutorials will be maintained as persistent open online resources to allow anyone to partake and self-learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The event was organized by an organizing committee consisting of eight members from five US academic institutions and government agencies. OHW differs from traditional academic conferences and one-off hackathons by its immersive curriculum, collaborative learning environment, and a set of carefully crafted participant selection criteria that helps promote diversity and inclusivity. Our goal was to provide an avenue for expediting the adoption of data science methodologies and computational tools for data-intensive research in the ocean sciences community. We received a total of 189 applications, from which we invited 54 to take part in the event in person. Due to the enthusiastic response we received from our call for application, we live-streamed all of the tutorials via Zoom and provided support for approximately 12 remote participants via Slack.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>We designed the OHW19 curriculum following the general research process to study the ocean:&nbsp; from data access and cleaning up, to computations and visualizations, concluding with reporting and archiving. In addition, we placed a strong emphasis on the community-building mission of OHW by facilitating collaborative ?hack projects? that were proposed and completed by self-organized groups of participants. We believe that such an experience will be a major driver for catalyzing cultural change toward a more open and collaborative scientific process in the ocean sciences community.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The outcomes of OHW19 were fruitful: in a five-day period, participants were exposed to a series of tutorials on state-of-the-art tools for data-intensive oceanographic research, ranging from data science collaboration tools (git and GitHub), programmatic database query and access tools, as well as software packages for visualizing and performing computation on larger-than-memory data sets (the oceanographic ?Big Data?). Participants were also introduced to basic machine learning concepts with concrete examples, as well as principles for reproducible research and open science adapted specifically for the domain of oceanography. All tutorials were conducted directly on the Pangeo community computing platform hosted on the cloud, on which participants can execute the Jupyter Notebooks presented by the tutorial instructors in real-time. An eye-opening array of 11 hack projects were completed and presented by OHW19 participants at the end of the five-day workshop, with a broad range of topics, including software development, machine learning algorithm testing, scientific investigation, and the creation of education materials.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>All tutorial and project outcomes are preserved and publicly available in repositories under the OHW GitHub organization at: </span><a href="https://github.com/oceanhackweek"><span>https://github.com/oceanhackweek</span></a><span>.

The top five topics participants reported that they learned a lot about were: Visualization, Big Data Methods, Programming, Open Science, and Cloud Computing. When asked about what they have learned at OHW19 may be useful in their research, participants overwhelmingly responded with topics or software packages that are related to cloud computing, big data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. These survey outcomes suggest that the participants did gain technical skills and knowledge on the topics at the intersection of data science and oceanography, and that OHW19 was successful in spurring collaborative interdisciplinary ideas and helping ingest best data science practices into ocean sciences. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Wu-Jung&nbsp;Lee</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933157/1933157_10603419_1601398545595_all_ohw19_people--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933157/1933157_10603419_1601398545595_all_ohw19_people--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Oceanhackweek 2019 took place during August 26-30, 2019 in University of Washington"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933157/1933157_10603419_1601398545595_all_ohw19_people--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Oceanhackweek 2019 took place during August 26-30, 2019 in University of Washington"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">All participants and organizing committee members of Oceanhackweek 2019.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jane Koh/University of Washington</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wu-Jung&nbsp;Lee</div> <div class="imageTitle">Oceanhackweek 2019 took place during August 26-30, 2019 in University of Washington</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933157/1933157_10603419_1601399535521_hacking_in_group--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933157/1933157_10603419_1601399535521_hacking_in_group--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Collaborative hacking on group projects."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933157/1933157_10603419_1601399535521_hacking_in_group--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Collaborative hacking on group projects."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Participants helped each other and interacted with organizers while working on hack projects together.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jane Koh/University of Washington</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wu-Jung&nbsp;Lee</div> <div class="imageTitle">Collaborative hacking on group projects.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933157/1933157_10603419_1601422857239_project_ideas--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933157/1933157_10603419_1601422857239_project_ideas--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Collaborative hacking on group projects."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933157/1933157_10603419_1601422857239_project_ideas--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Collaborative hacking on group projects."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Oceanhackweek 2019 participants discussed ideas for hack projects and spontaneously form groups to tackle technical and/or scientific challenges to achieve the project goal.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wu-Jung Lee/University of Washington</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wu-Jung&nbsp;Lee</div> <div class="imageTitle">Collaborative hacking on group projects.</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
