<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the 2019 Maine-Quebec Number Theory Conference, which will take place on October 5-6, 2019 at the University of Maine.  This is an annual conference, held at Laval University in Quebec in even years, and at the University of Maine in odd years. It provides a forum for number theorists from New England, Quebec, and beyond, to discuss their research and develop collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference features approximately 35 lectures addressing recent progress in different areas of number theory. The small scale of the meeting (with roughly 65 attendees) makes this a good opportunity for graduate students and young mathematicians to interact with leading researchers. This award may also provide some travel support for US-based participants to attend the 2020 meeting in Quebec. The conference website has more information, including participant lists and programs from recent years. More information can be found at https://archimede.mat.ulaval.ca/QUEBEC-MAINE/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
