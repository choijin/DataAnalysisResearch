<AbstractNarration>The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis will host the annual Undergraduate Research Conference at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology, 16 - 17 November 2019, in Knoxville, Tennessee. This conference showcases undergraduate research in mathematical biology and gives students a venue to network with others having similar interests. Two invited lectures by leaders in research at the interface of mathematics and biology will share their insights with students. About one hundred participants will attend the conference, many from traditionally underrepresented groups in mathematics and biology. All student participants will have the opportunity to present their choice of a research talk or poster. Additionally, interested students will be invited to attend a workshop on transitioning to graduate school, which will include a presentation on data analysis, a panel discussion on applications and career opportunities, a session on applying for graduate fellowships, and a graduate school showcase. The conference will strengthen exchanges between the mathematical and life sciences disciplines and will enable students to learn more about the potential of mathematics to make exciting progress on biological questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis Undergraduate Research Conference at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology is to provide opportunities for undergraduates from across the country to share their research with peers and faculty mentors. Between fifty and seventy student talks and posters on work that uses mathematical, statistical, and computational approaches to address challenging questions in molecular biology, biochemistry, epidemiology, immunology, ecology, and other areas will be presented at the conference. Their work comes from summer or academic year research experiences supported by a variety of agencies, including NSF, the National Institutes of Health, the National Security Agency or through their home institutions, thus allowing for cross-pollination of ideas from different programs. Student abstracts will be assembled into a program book and published on the conference website. As a side benefit, the research programs of faculty mentors will be enriched by the sharing of information about recent research and the formation of new connections. The conference's secondary goal is to provide students with information on careers and graduate school, as well as opportunities to network. The conference will host a presentation on data analysis, a panel discussion on career opportunities, a session on applying for graduate fellowships, a graduate school showcase, and ample networking opportunities through shared meals, frequent breaks, and organized breakout sessions. The combination of a venue for presenting research with information on how to advance their careers in graduate school will provide students a unique resource for personal and professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The primary goal of the Conference is to provide opportunities for undergraduates from across the country to share their research at the interface of biology and mathematics and be inspired by the research of their peers and faculty mentors and guest research speakers. The conference's secondary goal is to facilitate students in transitioning to graduate school. A total of 124 individuals (96 students, 28 faculty) participated in the Conference. The funds associated with this grant wholly or partially funded 57 student and 11 faculty participants.</p> <p>Two featured speakers presented at the Conference. Sadie Ryan (Geography, University of Florida) was the Keynote Speaker presenting her research on modeling climate change impacts on vector-borne diseases.&nbsp; Christopher Strickland (Mathematics, University of Tennessee) was the Featured Speaker presenting his work on applying two modeling approaches to systems with social impact.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several activities were conducted to help students gain perspectives on transitioning to graduate school, as well as to provide students with academic and career development opportunities. A Career Panel of four scientists was assembled to provide an open forum to address students' questions on graduate school and careers in math and biology. Five breakout sessions were held for students to discuss preparation for and expectations of graduate programs in several fields (Ecology, Microbiology, Mathematics and Biology, Biomedical, and Spatial Ecology). A session led by two faculty from the University of Tennessee was conducted to provide an overview of various aspects and selected commonly-used programs involved in data analysis in graduate school. A Graduate School Opportunities Showcase was conducted that consisted of informational booths on graduate school and professional development opportunities from several departments and programs from different institutions, including Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology, Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Mathematics, Genome Science and Technology, and NIMBioS from the University of Tennessee; Mathematics from Western Kentucky University; Geography from University of Florida; Marine Ecology from University of California, Santa Barbara; Mathematics and Statistics from University of North Carolina, Greensboro; Mathematics from Middle Tennessee State University; Society for Industrial and Applied Math. Another panel of two faculty and two graduate students from the University of Tennessee was assembled to provide an open forum for students to ask questions and hear perspectives on applying for graduate fellowships.</p> <p>Several positive impacts resulted from this Conference. Overall, 66 talks and poster presentations were presented by students at this conference. Students were provided ample time to present their talks and have discussions with audience members following each individual talk, and students presenting posters interacted with students as well as faculty during the allotted time for poster presentations. In addition to attending the Keynote Address, Featured Talk, and student presentations, participants were provided specific opportunities to network and gain information on careers and opportunities for graduate school through participating in the Career Panel, Graduate School Opportunities Showcase, Breakout Sessions, and Graduate Fellowships Panel. Additionally, a diverse group of participants (53% female, 19% minority/underrepresented groups) were funded by this grant. The development of this new group of researchers is important to the growth of mathematical biology, and the diversity of attendees enhances the breadth of perspectives of those working in this field.</p> <p>An evaluation of the Conference was conducted by NIMBioS staff in conjunction with the National Institute for STEM Evaluation and Research. The evaluation showed 95% of undergraduate respondents thought the Conference was successful in creating a forum through which they could present research and make new connections at the interface of math and biology, and 70% indicated participating in the Conference helped them make connections with others in the interdisciplinary field of math and biology. Additionally, 86% of undergraduate respondents thought the panels and sessions focusing on transitioning to graduate school and career opportunities were useful. Furthermore, the majority indicated they had a better understanding of career opportunities (89%) and undergraduate research (96%) at the interface of mathematics and biology as a result of attending this Conference. Finally, 94% of respondents indicated they would recommend participating in this conference to their colleagues.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/12/2020<br>      Modified by: Greg&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wiggins</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1935224/1935224_10645056_1584041858180_2019_NIMBioS_PosterB--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1935224/1935224_10645056_1584041858180_2019_NIMBioS_PosterB--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2019_NIMBioS_PosterB"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1935224/1935224_10645056_1584041858180_2019_NIMBioS_PosterB--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2019_NIMBioS_PosterB"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students presenting at Poster Session.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Greg Wiggins</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Greg&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wiggins</div> <div class="imageTitle">2019_NIMBioS_PosterB</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1935224/1935224_10645056_1584041974141_2019_NIMBioS_Showcase--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1935224/1935224_10645056_1584041974141_2019_NIMBioS_Showcase--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2019_NIMBioS_Showcase"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1935224/1935224_10645056_1584041974141_2019_NIMBioS_Showcase--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2019_NIMBioS_Showcase"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students participating in Graduate School Opportunities Showcase.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Greg Wiggins</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Greg&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wiggins</div> <div class="imageTitle">2019_NIMBioS_Showcase</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1935224/1935224_10645056_1584041801074_2019_NIMBioS_PosterA--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1935224/1935224_10645056_1584041801074_2019_NIMBioS_PosterA--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2019_NIMBioS_PosterA"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1935224/1935224_10645056_1584041801074_2019_NIMBioS_PosterA--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2019_NIMBioS_PosterA"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students presenting at the Poster Session.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Greg Wiggins</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Greg&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wiggins</div> <div class="imageTitle">2019_NIMBioS_PosterA</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1935224/1935224_10645056_1584042062003_2019_NIMBioS_StudentTalk--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1935224/1935224_10645056_1584042062003_2019_NIMBioS_StudentTalk--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2019_NIMBioS_StudentTalk"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1935224/1935224_10645056_1584042062003_2019_NIMBioS_StudentTalk--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2019_NIMBioS_StudentTalk"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students presenting research talk.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Greg Wiggins</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Greg&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wiggins</div> <div class="imageTitle">2019_NIMBioS_StudentTalk</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
