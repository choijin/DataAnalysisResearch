<AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support for enhancing graduate student participation, at the first joint meeting of the International Vacuum Nanoelectronics (IVNC) and International Vacuum Electron Sources (IVESC) Conferences to be held at the campus of the University of Cincinnati, in Cincinnati, Ohio, from July 22-26, 2019.  The conferences will focus on vacuum electron sources and applications, from basic principles to the most recent technological advances and include plenary talks, invited talks, contributed talks and posters. They will foster advances in the leading research of vacuum electron sources including theory, materials, structures, devices and their applications, field, thermal, photo, secondary, photo, and photo-enhanced field emission. Emission fundamentals and modeling will be addressed together with consideration of novel materials for electron emission and vacuum tunneling. The physics and technology of electron sources and their applications will also be addressed.  The meeting will consist of a series of three short courses in some of the fast-growing areas in the field of vacuum electron sources and applications, from basic principles to the most recent technological advances. The short courses are expected to help students and other young scientists to develop a multidisciplinary understanding of vacuum device research. The technical program will provide student participants with the opportunity to gain exposure to new materials and devices for vacuum electronics, their basic physics, and their engineering applications.  Exposing the next generation of researchers to these important disciplines is critical for learning how the new science and technology of vacuum nanoelectronics are developing. Students will gain exposure to the new advances in material growth, fabrication technology and device physics. The meeting will include three short courses which will be offered to all attendees as part of their registration. A collection of selected papers will be published in the Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B. The information will be disseminated through the conference proceedings and the journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
