<AbstractNarration>This grant is in partial support of the 2019 International Conference on Cleaner Production and Sustainability (CPS 2019), to be held October 30 to November 2, 2019. The conference is designed for researchers and practitioners interested in the issues of cleaner production and circular economy from all over the world to stimulate new ideas and share their innovations and best practice. During this conference, participants will discuss theoretical and practical concepts, methods, tools, policies, research gaps, and examples of sustainability-relevant research topics. Cleaner production and circular economy are two important concepts for realizing environmental, social, and economic sustainability and must be addressed in a convergent one. Solutions to complex sustainability challenges can be developed only via inter- and trans-disciplinary research. CPS 2019 will bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss barriers to achieving cleaner production and circular economy. They will also discuss how to address these challenges through new insights, engineering methods, social interferences, business practice, and wise policy. CPS 2019 will cover a wide range of topics related to cleaner production and circular economy, including eco-innovation and design for sustainability, ecological capital and eco-governance, education for sustainability, energy efficiency and renewable energy, food-energy-water nexus, green behavior, and green supply chain. CPS 2019 will identify knowledge gaps, enhance the holistic understanding on global sustainability, and discover new research directions of cleaner production and circular economy and result in a roadmap for sustainability research community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The event will enable international professionals with diverse backgrounds and expertise to share the most recent ideas, outcomes, and practices on cleaner production and circular economy. This engagement should have broader influences on professionals in research, industry, administration, and education. Attending the conference will allow the researchers, especially early career faculty and graduate students, to showcase their research and develop an international network for ongoing exchange and future collaborations. Practitioners and educators can learn new research progress and incorporate them into their practice. With participation of scientists, engineers, industry practitioners, and policy makers, CPS 2019 is expected to be an excellent venue for the broad, environmentally sustainable community to share their findings and opinions on cleaner production and circular economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
