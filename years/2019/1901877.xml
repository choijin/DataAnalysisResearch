<AbstractNarration>There is a growing demand for qualified technicians in information systems technology and cyber security.  In rural areas such as the Arkansas Delta region, this demand is even stronger because of a severe talent shortage in the information security workforce. Unfortunately, students pursuing education in these fields may be underprepared for even introductory courses.  As a result, they need additional tutoring and other academic supports to be successful. Financial constraints also make it difficult for students to obtain the necessary resources to complete their degree or other training programs. This project aims to increase the capacity to prepare information systems and cyber technicians to enter the workforce. Specifically, Phillips Community College of the University of Arkansas will implement strategies to increase the quality and capacity of skilled technicians completing degrees or certificates in the College's Information Systems program. The project also aims to increase the quality and capacity of faculty who have the required credentials to teach in the program. Graduates of the program are expected to help meet the demand in the job market across the tristate area of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will implement activities designed to support students and faculty. Student recruitment activities include summer workshops, high school outreach, and lunchtime career information sessions. Student retention and support activities include tutoring and study groups. Experiential education, including the use of hands-on experiences and high-tech virtualization products, will expand and enhance the curriculum by giving students the opportunity to connect classroom knowledge with real world experiences.  Additional hybrid and online courses will serve students who are unable to participate in traditional face-to-face classes. Partnerships with industry will be expanded and an industrial advisory board will help guide the program and connect students with internship and job opportunities. Finally, faculty training and certification support will ensure that faculty use the most effective pedagogy and students acquire the most current content. This project will strengthen the connections between the college and the community by providing the opportunity for graduates to secure technician jobs in the area, fill the employment gap, and become vital members of the community. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
