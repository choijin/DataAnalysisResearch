<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation for the R/V Hugh R Sharp, a 146-foot Regional research vessel operated by the University of Delaware as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V Hugh R Sharp is a state-of-the-art, coastal research vessel that is owned and operated by the University of Delaware. The vessel can carry fourteen to twenty scientists on cruises up to eighteen days in duration and supports projects from all disciplines of oceanography. The vessel is a regional asset, serving researchers from many institutions throughout the mid-Atlantic. The vessel typically operates in the coastal waters from Long Island, New York, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. Projects occasionally require the vessel to work as far north as the Gulf of Maine, as far south as Florida, and as far offshore as Bermuda. In 2018, the R/V Hugh R Sharp completed 143 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 18 days or 15% of the sailing schedule. In 2019, R/V Hugh R Sharp is scheduled for 86 days with NSF days accounting for 21% (18 days) of the total sailing schedule. Oceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Big Eye Binoculars  $40,480 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

SHARP  NSF Organization Unit  OCE &ndash; Oceanographic Instrumentation  Funding Code  5413                     Project Description                       Intellectual Merit: The awarded equipment/instrumentation will help support scientific operations and data collection in the mid-Atlantic region aboard the R/V HUGH R. SHARP.  The intellectual merit of these individual projects is determined by peer review at NSF.  The scientific questions posed must be meritorious enough to warrant funding, and only those few will be fortunate enough to go to sea.      Broader Impacts:  The number of missions supported, for a vessel in the mid-Atlantic coastal zone, averages around thirty per year.  The science support equipment/instrumentation proposed herein will enhance the infrastructure needed for research and education on the vast majority of those cruises.     The University of Delaware, the College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment, and the R/V HUGH R. SHARP operation are closely linked. The broader impacts of this ship/institution package on the public and the science community are many. The ship has participated in the "Teachers at Sea" program for several years during its NOAA Scallop cruises. This program allows educators an opportunity to work on a research vessel while assisting the science party by providing extra hands on deck. The R/V HUGH R.

The program provides students studying to become marine technicians the opportunity to experience real-life aboard an oceanographic research vessel.                      Big Eye Binoculars  With government laws, initiatives, and reports (such as the "Addressing the Effects of Human Generated Sound on Marine Life") there is an increasing requirement for mammal observations during oceanographic acoustic research projects. There are also large planning projects involving construction of offshore facilities (such as the "Delaware Bluewater Wind Farm") along the West Atlantic coast. These projects require marine life surveys to determine the impact on migration routes and spawning grounds. All these factors require the modern oceanographic vessel to become even more flexible then in the past. These mission flexibility requirements are what prompted the support group with the R/V HUGH R. SHARP at the University of Delaware to construct an observation platform.              The observation platform is on top of the ship’s existing bridge, as science mission requirements dictate. The built in-house observation platform uses a bulkhead wall design recommended to reduce wind effect on the observers. There are several additional features constructed in the observation platform.     Seated computer station with a console and wire pass to the ship’s navigational bridge providing computerized observation logging and direct communications with the navigational officers on watch.  There are two mounting stations for Big Eye binoculars and pedestals. There is an overhead awing and grab rails for shade and protection from inclement weather, providing enhanced viewing, comfort, and safety.      Since the observation platform was completed, it has been used on a number of research projects ranging from new federally agency programs with the National Science Foundation, NOAA, and Navy, to private contractors and state funding. All these groups have had to provide their own observation binoculars; they have ranged from simple hand held (like 8x50) to pedestal mounted Big Eye (like 28x100).     Included in the pedestal mount is the ability to adjust the height for the observer. The pedestal mounts were designed to fit the existing deck connecting system which is installed in the observation platform.

This makes the ship more marketable to potential new users, where use of the ship offsets cost to all users. This is important in this challenging budget climate, where funding for ship days has declined.     The new binoculars has increased the visual observation range by about four times (hand held 7x50 vs. big eye 28x150) thus substantially increasing the observation area and quality of the research data. By using the same equipment, the observation data will also be more consistent between projects.     This project has been completed. The binoculars have been test-fitted to the observation platform deck mounts. Reticles were installed to the binoculars to assist with measuring the observations. Covers for both the binoculars and pedestals have been fashioned. The observation platform is ready for the next science mission requirement.
