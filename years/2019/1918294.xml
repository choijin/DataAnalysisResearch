<AbstractNarration>Annual flooding in Charleston, South Carolina, and the surrounding Lowcountry has increased 50% and the region has suffered a major hurricane every year for the past 4 years. Although the low-lying region has a long history of flooding, this rapid increase has sparked a crisis discourse, leading the city government to name flooding "the #1 priority" and begin swift actions to preserve the local environs. This project, which trains a doctoral student in methods of rigorous and empirically-grounded data collection and analysis, examines the creation and maintenance of Charleston's storm drainage systems, seawalls, and networks of rice dikes and floodgates to map and analyze the preservation of heritage sites. Project findings will be disseminated in such a way that aids planners explore more equitable ways to define risk, resistance, and resilience in regards to specific community needs and desires. Finally, this research project aims to produce work that will be helpful to local communities fighting the impacts of flooding in Charleston, South Carolina.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brian Walter, under the supervision of Dr. Melissa Caldwell of the University of California at Santa Cruz will investigate the relationship between flood water and heritage discourses and practices by conducting ethnographic fieldwork in the Charleston Lowcountry. During this period, he will work across stratified locations suffering the effects of sea-level-rise. At these sites, the researcher will use interviews, participant observation, and participatory GIS to gain knowledge about how individuals differentially define heritage in the environment, experience sea-level rise and fight for the maintenance of flood infrastructure. This work aims to contribute to debates about environmental change mitigation, by offering an ethnographic case to better explain how sea-level-rise is experienced socioeconomically: an essential complement to quantitative data models that focus on macro-level change and assume an equal amount of flooding causes equal damage to life. This outcome will help make the intersection between race and the environment visible in policy conversations and help promote methodologies to determine alternative definitions of normed policy concepts such as value, vulnerability, or heritage site employed in current spatial studies determining the impacts of sea-level rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

My central research question was "how do individuals grapple with landscapes marked by the past amidst an urgent need to create new futures?" Through my ethnographic research, this question was complicated and broken down into four sub-questions which are analyzed below. It is important to note that these findings are preliminary. These results will be sharpened and modified as I continue to analyze my results and formulate my dissertation.      1. What is the relationship between past and present racial hydrology in the lowcountry?   Providing a universal response to this question is difficult because of the changing racial geography of the region. However, in my multi-sited research a strong theme emerged pairing whiteness and drainage, where actively draining areas often preceded settlement by white residents. This is connected to, but not synonymous with, the often-repeated sentiment that Black communities are relegated to low, flooding areas.

This complicates straightforward environmental justice calls for equal drainage for all neighborhoods without attention to history or impending gentrification.      2. How does heritage preservation impact the racialization of flood mitigation in the Lowcountry?   I found preservation to be a central value in discussions about the need to protect specific neighborhoods and the city at large. This logic was applied to communities of different races, but unevenly. Wealthier and whiter areas benefited from their heritage being recognized as a valuable tourist commodity and thus worthy of large infrastructure investments. Additionally, the popular belief in "preservation" made certain calls for justice from marginalized environmental justice communities seeking to maintain their existence politically legible, but at the expense of other calls which did not fit into the preservation discourse, such as those seeking to fundamentally change conditions.    3. What is the lived experience of chronic flooding and how is it produced by historical infrastructures and their maintenance?    In interviews and on flood walks I observed the differential impacts that flooding has on individuals based on wealth, commute, home construction, and location. These differential impacts were often racialized and compounded by complications accessing aid and maintaining land ownership for Black landowners on heir's property. In these conversations many individuals connected their flooding issues with the maintenance of their stormwater system.

Though most folks I spent time with believed their stormwater systems were fair and sufficient, they held that the systems had become unjust through poor maintenance. I also observed that maintenance at regular intervals is indeed necessary, especially in low-lying spaces near development.    4. How do state officials and residents envision the future of the region through large scale flood mitigation projects?   This question was added as new conversations about mega-projects, such as a large Army Corps of Engineers seawall project began while I was conducting my research. I found that through major projects for resilience, state officials were envisioning a future where the current trajectory of the city could continue with few major changes. I found significant overlaps in discourses of resilience and those of preservation. Residents were deeply skeptical of these projects and questioned their proposed benefits.   Broader Impacts:   These results and my future analysis will provide both intellectual merit and demonstrate the potential for broader impact. By providing a grounded account of climate change centering racial dynamics, this research adds qualitative detail to the myriad ways that climate change is experienced unequally. These details are helpful in theorizing the racialized impacts of the anthropocene, and describe how current infrastructural, legal, and political structures struggle to mitigate and often amplify the effects of climate change, in some expected and other surprising ways.
