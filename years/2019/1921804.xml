<AbstractNarration>The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project will be to address an unmet need to identify and alarm for all seizure types. More than 60 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition.  To reduce the risk of injury or death, neurologists frequently recommend caregivers constantly monitor patients, resulting in co-sleeping, significant changes in work and family schedules, and a substantial loss of independence. However, even under monitored conditions, caregivers fail to recognize more than 50% of seizures, resulting in sub-optimal treatment. Although technology is available to detect seizures in clinical settings, the necessary equipment is not currently suitable for continuous use in daily living.  The development and validation of technology to detect and alert patients and caregivers to all types of seizures in a non-clinical setting would have substantial benefits for timely treatment, improve patient outcomes, and improve patient and caregiver quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops a core technology that uses analysis of eye movements to provide a reliable, reproducible means of identifying seizure activity. The team is developing wearable eye-tracking technology and software suitable for identifying all seizure types during wakefulness and sleep. This work will significantly advance understanding of seizures through rigorous mathematical analysis of eye movements which previously has been only qualitatively described. The core technology analyzes eye movements, known as oculometrics, to detect seizures.  The goal is to transform how at-risk individuals and caregivers identify and respond to seizures, potentially reducing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and improving quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our I-Corps team was comprised Rachel Kuperman (EL), Nicole Ionascu (TL), and Wolfgang Stehr (IL). Our team was interested in defining the product-market-fit of device that analyzes eye movements to identify seizures. Over the course of 7 weeks, the team interviewed 111 individuals throughout the healthcare ecosystem including patients, family members, physicians, insurance providers, CMS decision makers, pharmaceutical researchers, competitors and strategic partners.   Prior to engaging in the NSF I-Corps program, TL (CTO) and EL (CEO) team members had already formulated a start-up company, Eysz. At the end of the I-Corp program a recognition of the importance of partnerships particularly as it relates to channel economics led to the addition of Parth Amin, whose brings 15 years of medical device background and partnership development to the company.  We were also to identify key advisor roles that would assist in growing the company including a technical expert in eye tracking, Peter Milford and a new board member who has a child with epilepsy and a background in finance.  As part of the NSF I-Corp program we conducted extensive interviews throughout the ecosystem.  Many of the contacts we have developed have become important relationships and developed into full blown partnerships with one pharmaceutical company giving us a non-dilutive grant and a second pharmaceutical company making a significant investment in the company in our first capital raise.  The NSF I-Corp program in particular allowed us to develop a realistic roadmap of the challenges that lay ahead for our company so that we can specifically focus on sustainable solutions.  For example, NSF allowed us to dive into physician reimbursement and medical device reimbursement.  We were able to understand many of the challenges in the space and ultimately decided through a different grant program to lay out a well-defined roadmap for insurance reimbursement. This process allowed us to explore not only the process for CPT code development, but the leveraging other billing systems including HCPCs codes.  Finally, the process of focusing on the value proposition allowed us to clearly articulate to the epilepsy community our goals and value.  This has paid off in dividends.  We have won the Epilepsy Shark Tank competition- both the judges award and the audience award and have been able to attract investors with our clearly articulated value proposition.
