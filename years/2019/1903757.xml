<AbstractNarration>The antihydrogen atom, a bound state of a positron and an antiproton, is the simplest atom made entirely of antimatter.    This unusual atom has been produced and suspended within magnetic fields that keep the antimatter atoms suspended at a central location.  The intellectual merit of precise comparisons of the properties of the antihydrogen atoms and their matter counterpart arises from the possibility of testing the prediction of the most fundamental physics theory, namely that matter and antimatter particles  are "exactly opposite", with charges of opposite sign and masses that are identical, and that antimatter atoms and matter atoms have precisely the same properties.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     There are good reasons to believe that the most fundamental physics theory is not a complete description.  Discovering a difference between the structure of antimatter and matter atoms would thus lead to an improved theory of fundamental physics, the consequences of which are potentially important for science and future technology.  Moreover, this research is the training ground for some of the most gifted science students and postdocs, preparing them for the successful careers in science and technology that are needed for a technological society to thrive.   Methods developed for such fundamental research typically find their way into more common applications.  Finally, many lectures on this science are used to educate students, professional scientists, and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 1.  Produced antihydrogen atoms that are made entirely of antimatter.  A positron orbits and antiproton in antihydrogen, while an electron orbits a proton in matter.  2.  Imaged the shape of trapped collections of electrons, positrons and antiprotons that would be used to produce antihdyrogen atoms.  3  Designed and built a magnetic trap using magnet coils within which antihydrogen atoms can be stored.   4. Demonstrated that antihydrogen atoms could be suspended in space using using this magnet trap within a high vacuum.  This is the only way to store antimattter atoms insofar as any contact with a matter container or gas would cause them to annihilate.  5. Designed, built and demonstrated the most intense source of coherent, pulsed, 121 nm radiation.  Ultra violet light (VUV) at this wavelenth is called vacuum ultraviolet light becuase only in a vacuum can it travel very far.  6. Send the 121 nm VUV light into a cold environment that is only 4 degress absolute above absolute zero.  Reflect this light through the magnetic trap where antihydrogen atoms were stored and then back out of the cold environment so its power could be measured.  The aim was to eventually use this light to cool the trapped antihdyrogen atoms.    All of these advances were steps on the way to precise laser measurements of the structure of antihydrogen atoms, the goal being to look for any possible small differences between antimatter antihydrogen atoms and matter hydrogen atoms.
