<AbstractNarration>The Oceanography Society (TOS) will publish a special issue of the open-access journal Oceanography with the title "Paleoceanography - Lessons for a Changing World". The special issue will provide a comprehensive, accessible, and authoritative summary of the Earth system problems that paleoceanographers are currently pursuing as well as the state-of-the-art techniques used in their research, with the twin goals of stimulating new collaborations within the global Earth and ocean sciences community and providing up-to-date, peer-reviewed syntheses for use worldwide by educators and decision-makers. Oceanography Editor Dr. Ellen Kappel, along with four guest editors who are experts in the field, Drs. Alan Mix, Peggy Delaney, Laurie Menviel, and Katrin Meissner, will ensure that the proposed set of peer-reviewed articles, spotlights, and information boxes will further these objectives. The special issue will provide a coherent compendium of the most recent results from research intended as a basis for undergraduate and graduate classroom instruction and discussions, as well as to inform policymakers. The journal gets broad distribution within the oceanography community as well as in institutional libraries and with government representatives. More than half the regular subscribers to Oceanography are graduate students. To ensure the greatest impact, TOS will make freely available a PDF of the full issue for download from the Oceanography website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed special issue of Oceanography will broadly review significant scientific accomplishments of paleoceanographic research in the last decade and provide a forward look at research opportunities. Six specific themes will serve to organize the special issue: (1) proxy development, new models and statistical tools; (2) geobiology, linking paleoclimate changes with biology and evolution; (3) carbon-climate feedbacks across time-scales; (4) ocean circulation and climate system dynamics; (5) the role of the Southern Hemisphere and tropical processes in global climate; and (6) ice-ocean interactions. The set of Oceanography articles will provide a benchmark against which current and future changes in climate, the carbon cycle, sea level changes, and marine ecosystems can be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Publication of this special issue of <em>Oceanography</em>&nbsp;titled <strong><a href="https://tos.org/oceanography/issue/volume-33-issue-2">Paleoceanography: Lessons for a Changing World</a></strong> celebrates the field of paleoceanography and paleoclimatology at a time when future climate changes are projected to be larger than within the range of instrumental variation detected to date. Through clear writing and visually appealing articles, as well as open access availability, the peer-reviewed articles make state-of-the-art paleoceanographic and paleoclimate research accessible to a broad audience. The articles also provide a signpost toward future research directions and highlight the value of paleoceanography in illuminating key processes that must be understood by humanity in order to coexist with a world that is changing, both naturally and due to the heavy impact of human activities. To that end, the 17 science articles in the special issue cover the following topics:</p> <p><strong>Proxy Development, New Models, and Statistical Tools</strong></p> <p>Paleoceanography has made steady progress since the middle of the twentieth century through continuous development of new tools that include the calibration and application of new proxies, examples described in articles by <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2020.222">Crumpton-Banks and Rae</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2020.206">Dixit</a></strong>, and<strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2020.219">Lam</a></strong>, and emerging statistical evaluation and chronologic modeling approaches as discussed by <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2020.223">Mix</a></strong>. Each new tool expands our ability to interpret paleoenvironmental information and quantify uncertainties in available archives and model experiments. Of particular interest to the IPCC is the potential for paleo-model simulations and sensitivity tests to constrain the long-term sensitivity of climate change and to illuminate the roles of ocean, cryosphere, and carbon-cycle feedbacks in large-scale climate changes of the past and projected for the future.</p> <p class="Normal1"><strong>Geobiology New Frontiers in Paleoceanography Linking Paleoclimatic Changes with Biology and Evolution</strong></p> <p>Geobiology describes the interaction between the physical Earth and the biosphere. By combining information about the past development of more than one species, geobiology offers the opportunity to explore the dynamics of biological communities and its relation to climate change. Papers by <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2020.225">Yasuhara et al.</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2020.207">Fietz</a></strong>, and<strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2020.211">Armbrecht</a></strong> address the evolution of marine biological communities and their environments based on biological proxy records that range from standard paleoecological methods to new proxy developments. This topic is of special interest to policymakers as they consider the likely ecosystem impacts of large-scale climate change that will inescapably modify the distribution and diversity of life on the Earth and bring together new and unprecedented associations of species, at the same time that the results of human activities impose a global mass extinction event.</p> <p class="Normal1"><strong>Carbon-Climate Feedbacks Across Timescales</strong></p> <p>Earth's climate history is characterized by long-term gradual changes interrupted by more abrupt transitions. The potential for crossing practically irreversible thresholds is difficult to address beyond the hypothetical absent historical examples of such events. Paleo records provide essential insights into extreme changes that have occurred in Earth's prehistory. The article by <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2020.203">Matsumoto et al.</a> </strong>highlights contributions that improve understanding of carbon-climate feedbacks across all timescales. Understanding the natural variations of the carbon cycle based on its past variations is an essential part of projecting long-term future changes, changes that may be initiated by anthropogenic emissions but may also trigger natural feedback mechanisms that will either exacerbate or mitigate change.</p> <p><strong>Ocean Circulation and Climate System Dynamics</strong></p> <p>Ocean circulation plays a central role in climate dynamics through air-sea interactions, global transport of heat and salt in ocean currents, and storage of heat and carbon in the subsurface ocean. Reconstructing the ocean's past is critical for understanding the dynamics of the climate system as a whole. Articles by <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2020.205">Tachikawa et al.</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2020.217">McCave</a></strong> synthesize knowledge about changes in ocean circulation and its links with climate system dynamics, including paleoceanographic reconstructions on various timescales derived from marine paleo-proxies, and articles by <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2020.209">Felis</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2020.216">Ford and Chalk</a></strong> describe the development and application of numerical models to simulate changes in ocean circulation and its impact on climatic changes. The paleo record illustrates how variability, in particular extreme events, may dominate impacts on regional and global systems.</p> <p><strong>Ice-Ocean Interactions: Drivers and Impacts</strong></p> <p>Sea level rise is perhaps one of the most alarming repercussions of present-day climate change. Now that it has started, sea level rise may become unstoppable for centuries or millennia. Current sea level rise is accelerating, in part related to ice melting that is catching up with thermal expansion and is expected to become dominant soon. To increase our confidence in sea level and climate projections and their policy implications, we must gain a more thorough understanding of the dynamics of changes in global ocean heat content and the responses of continental ice sheets.
