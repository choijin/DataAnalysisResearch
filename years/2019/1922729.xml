<AbstractNarration>This grant will provide student travel fellowships to the 2019 American Ecological Engineering Society (AEES) annual meeting, as well as to provide facilities for a student-oriented poster session and career networking event there. This funding will supplement AEES' ongoing efforts to engage students in the society and the discipline more broadly. The AEES annual meeting is the premier venue for ecological engineers to present new work to their colleagues and garner valuable feedback on their research. It allows researchers to hear about the latest discoveries, trends, and challenges in the field and related disciplines, and make connections that enhance their research programs through interactions with colleagues from different institutions around the country and world. Feedback collected from students supported by travel fellowships will be used to better understand how the discipline is perceived by the next generation of ecological engineers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AEES meeting will have approximately 170- 200 attendees; approximately half are expected to be undergraduate or graduate students studying fields related to ecological engineering. To increase the overall diversity at the meeting and within the discipline, student travel fellowships will be awarded to prioritize attendance by under-represented institutions and geographic regions. Through the networking session to be supported through requested funds, students will have the opportunity to interact with faculty and industry professionals working in the field of ecological engineering. Anticipated outcomes of this session include expanding student mentoring/professional networks and exposing them a variety of career pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

In addition to participating in the conference, many student receiving travel awards through this grant provided feedback to surveys and interviews administered before, during and after the conference as part of AEES? ongoing efforts to better understand the perspectives, goals and needs of students ?growing up? in the discipline of ecological engineering. Key observations from student surveys include:  Students tended to favor career paths in the private or industry sectors; however, they also indicated a high interest in careers in the academic/research, governmental, and NGO sectors. Irrespective of career path preferences, students tended to define their professional success broadly to encompass aspects of job performance, personal satisfaction and contributions to their community. To be successful in their chosen career path, students identified opportunities already provided by AEES (attending technical/scientific conferences, membership in professional societies), opportunities toward which AEES is working to strengthen (professional certification, licensure), and opportunities that AEES could consider taking up (mentoring programs).   The findings of these surveys are currently being used by the AEES executive committee and its respective standing committees to ensure student inclusion and success is promoted through the society?s activities.
