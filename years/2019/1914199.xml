<AbstractNarration>All astrophysical and cosmological data now point convincingly to a large component of Cold Dark Matter in the Universe, whose presence we only infer gravitationally.  A well-motivated candidate for Dark Matter is a light axion. Axions have been introduced to explain the smallness of the violation of the Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry in Quantum ChromoDynamics, the theory describing the action of the strong force. Dark matter axions may be detected through their conversion into a narrow Radio Frequency (RF) signal in a microwave-cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field. This Yale-Berkeley-Colorado collaboration came together to design, build and operate an advanced technology experiment, HAYSTAC, to serve both as an innovation test-bed to develop new cavity designs and quantum-limited photon detection schemes, and as a pathfinder to take first data in the 10 - 50 micro-eV mass range, well above all previous such searches for axions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R&amp;D on superconducting thin-films, and sub-quantum-limited photon detection will certainly produce unanticipated spin-offs, just as the NSF-supported development of the Microstrip SQUID Amplifier for axions did in the quantum information world. HAYSTAC has already proven to be a great attractor for young talent, more than half being women; this award can only be expected to extend this record. In addition, it is planned to establish a rotating exhibit on dark-sector science at the San Francisco Exploratorium utilizing prototypes and artifacts from many of the historic dark sector and cosmic microwave background experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Short of finding the axion, HAYSTAC has been extraordinarily successful. During the past three-year period, the experiment has achieved essentially quantum-limited operation (no other experiment has come within an order of magnitude). In preparation for Phase II, Berkeley has designed and built a microwave cavity with a high figure of merit for the 6 - 12 GHz range (~ 25 - 50 micro-eV). Colorado has designed, built and characterized a squeezed-vacuum state receiver, now being commissioned in HAYSTAC - it will be the first-ever sub-quantum receiver for a dark-matter experiment, and with LIGO the first squeezed-state receivers for data production in the world of fundamental physics. Furthermore, the group will produce a first cavity prototype incorporating planar thin-films of NbTiN, a Type-II superconductor, to achieve a boost in quality factor Q by an order of magnitude, a gain that would map directly into mass scan rate. Each of these innovations dramatically enhances the discovery potential of HAYSTAC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
