<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from improving the quality of healthcare in the United States and reducing the associated costs for common elective surgery procedures through evidence-driven patient-physician matching. This technology will improve the quality of care and reduce the variation in costs associated with these procedures. The platform will better equip health facilities to deliver sustainable, high-quality care in an industry that is transitioning towards value-based care. The commercial impact of the project will result from generating savings to healthcare facilities. Personalized physician scheduling helps patients access the most beneficial care and has the potential to reduce complications and improve patient outcomes. Facility-level cost reduction and patient outcome improvement enabled by this technology not only translates to cost savings for patients, but also increased capacity for the healthcare facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need for reducing the variations in outcomes and costs in elective medical care procedures with respect to factors including physician availability, the impact of care teams on medical outcomes and cost, and the effects of physician training and learning over time. The approach will be based on a unique combination of data analytics, stochastic processes, and machine learning, applied to the patient-provider matching problem. The technical challenges to be addressed in this project include the dynamic nature of physician strengths, the difficulty in attribution of outcomes to individual physicians in a team, and the challenges in adapting to the databases of health facilities. The team will closely collaborate with healthcare partners, leveraging historical data on physician and team performance over time as well as their feedback to develop an impactful and scientifically justified prototype. Anticipated technical results include documentation of the results of the proposed research and a prototype version of the technology for use at the healthcare facility level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this project was to develop and validate a tool that actively considers the strength of the operating surgeon and quantifies the risks imposed by patient comorbidities on the outcomes (cost, length of stay, 30-day readmission, etc.) of an elective surgical procedure.  This tool would also be able to suggest, rank order, and quantify the benefit of acting on modifiable pre-operative chronic condition management interventions (e.g., "losing ten pounds would reduce the length of stay by two days"). To develop this tool, the project team analyzed millions of historical surgical and other healthcare records to create and refine machine learning models that could reliably make these predictions for new patients.  Publicly available records provided through the Healthcare Cost and Utilization (HCUP) project of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) were used.  These records, gathered on a state-by-state basis, provide anonymized information gathered from hospitals at time of patient discharge.  Synthetic datasets based on statistical models of surgical outcomes in the US were also used to guide the development of the machine learning models. Through a  partnership with a large regional hospital system and a healthcare research institute, access to more detailed, but still anonymized, hospital electronic health records (EHR) was obtained.  This EHR data was leveraged to refine the models, for improved accuracy in predictions. In addition to these technical activities, the NSF grant helped in refining the company’s business model. The project team participated in the NSF-sponsored "Beat the Odds" boot camp.  This summer program provided the opportunity to discover significant insights from interviews with key decision makers (healthcare administrators) and potential end users (primary care physicians).  The project has resulted in a set of algorithms that integrate machine learning methods for the creation of risk profiles of patients based on their comorbidities for predicting and explaining surgical outcomes.  These algorithms:   find the impact of patient characteristics on medical outcomes;   identify ways in which patients and care providers can improve the outcomes from surgical procedures through targeted pre-procedure interventions (e.g., comorbidity risk-mitigation strategies); and   provide decision support for care providers, informing them of the expected outcome/cost improvement if a specific comorbidity, like BMI, was adjusted.   The algorithms for analyzing patient comorbidity risks at scale and adopting risk mitigation strategies (e.g., assigning patients to surgeons considering the gain in risk mitigation) have demonstrated, using historical medical data, the potential to reduce cost and length of stay, while providing better outcomes for patients.  Through this NSF grant, a research-grade prototype was developed into a functional proof-of-concept of the product prototype, a web-enabled server (running in the cloud) that uses the machine learning models and algorithms to analyze comorbidity-induced risks for a patient-provider pair.  This server can be connected to a hospital EHR system using standard protocols to integrate its analysis with the daily hospital/clinic workflow.  A mock-up of a hospital EHR system was built to assist with demonstrations and testing. The project has resulted in a new understanding of how to explain the risk stratifications and mitigations suggested by our prototype, a key requirement for acceptance in the medical community.   In addition, the project provided research experiences to three undergraduate students and one graduate student.        Last Modified: 05/21/2021       Submitted by: John T Korb]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
