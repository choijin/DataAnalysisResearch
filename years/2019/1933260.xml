<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to substantially transform the legal system and processes by incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the legal process of discovering and analyzing information. This project provides the legal community with AI tools that will enable them to adapt to a fast-changing information landscape (i.e., by procuring, organizing and extracting actionable knowledge from large amounts of documents and data during the pre-trial procedure of discovery), and to leverage the most recent advances on human-machine teaming for an effective delivery of AI-assisted discovery to legal teams. The target customers are practitioners at law firms, corporations, government agencies, and academic researchers and who perform qualitative data analysis on large volumes of unstructured data. This technology potentially aids the case discovery process in the legal field that often involves large amounts of electronically stored information in preparation for litigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on advance machine learning based algorithms and social teaming algorithms used to improve the efficiency of qualitative data analysis and the effectiveness of data result delivery to legal teams. The project explores the use of artificial social intelligence-based algorithms that automate the analysis of large volumes of unstructured text data to gain insights to the patterns within the data more efficiently, with better individual and inter-coder reliability, and within significantly shorter processing time. The results of this analysis will be delivered to legal teams using computer-based agents that observe their surroundings, infer their teammates goals and assist the legal team by providing information at the appropriate level and time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

We found that there are many gaps associated with increase in data types and volumes to the actual document review practice, the biggest pains noticed is the lack of workflow transparency  and process automation. Challenges:   E-Discovery is an ever growing market with huge increase in the voluminous data and corporates are insourcing their litigation processes and legal teams as are looking at smart solutions to reduce the costs involved.    The second big challenge is increases in discoverable data types along with data volumes. Not all data types can be handled in the same way, new data types are used for communicating and tracking analytics.    There are only a few case discovery solutions that only large organizations can adopt while the smaller organizations cannot afford.   Emerging social media data in court disputes, is leading to reimage the corporate ediscovery solutions.    Courts looking for new solutions are in demand for change in existing processes and skillsets.   New privacy concerns like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in international cases that involve cross-border discovery and regulatory compliance   Courts are looking for a superior level of dedication and cooperation by all the parties in case discovery.   Key take home message is that the current process of E-Discovery is complicated due to lack of transparent end-to-end solution to all the parties involved which is impacting majorly on the indirect cost burdens on the corporations. To that end while we continue our customer discovery we also aim to apply for SBIR grants as our technology helps legal professionals to perform case discovery through Artificial Social Intelligence by leveraging our Machine Learning expertise.
