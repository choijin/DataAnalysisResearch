<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research of Professor Timothy Funk at Gettysburg College. The goal of this project is to develop safe and sustainable catalysts based on iron. Catalysts increase the speed of chemical reactions. They are also important for environmental reasons because they can promote the formation of the desired products, generating less waste with unwanted by-products. Metal-based catalysts are common, but many are derived from rare elements. Iron can be a better choice for catalysis because of its high earth abundance. Professor Funk is designing iron-based catalysts that work in conjunction with chemicals derived from biomass. Biomass, a plant-based starting material is inexpensive and abundant. Part of the project focuses on the details of the bond-making and bond-breaking steps promoted by these new catalysts. This information enables the design of improved catalysts, which are still more efficient. The project supports the hands-on training of undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. The training emphasizes chemical catalysis in the context of the environmental considerations. Through this training, the project is preparing students for careers in technical fields such as advanced manufacturing, thus supporting the economic strength of the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the National Science Foundation, Professor Timothy Funk at Gettysburg College is developing sustainable catalytic reduction and oxidation processes based on iron. The air and moisture-stable, bifunctional iron compounds catalyze transfer hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. Plant-based compounds serve as hydrogen donors and acceptors. Replacing reactive oxidants and reductants with relatively stable, biomass-derived compounds increases both the safety and sustainability of these processes. In particular, Professor Funk is exploring how subtle differences in ligand structures affect the reactivity and selectivity of bifunctional iron catalysts. Additionally, the Funk group is examining how substrate structures and the reduction potentials of the hydrogen donors or acceptors modify the process. Insight into how these factors affect catalyst reactivity and selectivity is leading to the design and development of new catalytic processes. Overall, the goal is to develop safe, sustainable, selective alcohol oxidation and carbonyl reduction processes. Undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds are being trained to consider environmental impacts when developing new chemical processes and are developing skills that prepare them for careers in scientific research. The project also supports hands-on training of undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. The training emphasizes chemical catalysis in the context of the environmental considerations. Through this training, the project is preparing students for careers in technical fields, thus supporting the nation's economic interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
