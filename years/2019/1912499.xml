<AbstractNarration>The IEEE International Conference on Microwaves for Intelligent Mobility (ICMIM) is a conference covering emerging research topics on autonomous vehicles and unmanned aircrafts. It is sponsored by IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society, with technical co-sponsorships from IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society and IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society. The 5th annual IEEE ICMIM will be held in Detroit, MI, on April 15-16, 2019. The conference attracts researchers and engineers working on intelligent mobility facilitated by RF, microwave, and millimeter-wave technologies from component, circuit, to system level, for applications addressing autonomous vehicles (including land, sea, and airborne), automotive radar and other sensing, navigation, localization, and communication techniques. To support the training of the next-generation scientists and engineers working on intelligent mobility, this NSF grant will provide travel support for 20 graduate students to present their research papers at the conference and learn the cutting-edge research and development of microwave techniques for intelligent mobility. The travel grants will be awarded competitively to graduate students from U.S. universities who will present their accepted papers at the conference. The awardees will be selected by a committee of the conference and the paper quality will be considered in the selection process. The proposed travel support will have long-term and broad impacts on the participating students' career developments and the advancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
