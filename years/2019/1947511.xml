<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to provide a cost-efficient, and easy-to-use tool for construction managers and equipment owners to monitor performance of their machines, measure productivity rates and quantities of completed work, record active vs. idle times, and recognize abnormal conditions for considering preventive/corrective actions. The system will eventually operate on all equipment pieces in a construction project and necessary managerial information about the project will be generated. The project is expected to provide a transformational re-thinking about the concept of "construction equipment monitoring" and translate it from "location tracking" tools into informative "performance monitoring and control systems." Considering the significant costs of maintenance/repair/fuel/operator expenses in overall costs of construction heavy equipment, the technology can provide considerable savings to the U.S. architecture, engineering, and construction industries. Activities of this project will take place in Salt Lake City, Utah, one of America's emerging tech startup hubs and a setting for rapid construction. This may facilitate the commercialization phase of the project and also provide excellent educational and training opportunities, especially for the graduate student involved in the project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to develop and empirically test the feasibility of a hybrid system for automatically detecting, tracking, and recording activities of construction heavy equipment. The system works based on collecting audio, kinematic, and location data of construction machines using a specially designed hardware unit. The collected data will be transferred into a central processing unit through Wi-Fi links and a chronological list of activities and productivity rates will be automatically generated during each working shift. As the next step, the information collected and processed from individual machines will be further integrated and processed to generate managerial information at project and company levels. The novel aspects of the project are twofold: 1) The hybrid use of audio and kinematic signals capable of producing more accurate results and overcoming the limitations and barriers of implementing each signal individually; and 2) the concept of fusing information from multiple machines and automatically generating managerial information for the entire project (and company), which could replace the current manual procedures for updating the project schedule, budget, and inventory management systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The interviews provided the opportunity for the PhD students serving as the Entruprunership Lead and Co-Lead of the project to get out of their graduate offices and labs and get familiar with the real world and industry demands. Our team was engaged in several interesting tasks that prepared us for further actions on technology transfer procedures. The following items summerize some of the important outcomes of the project:</p> <p>1. After interviewing more than 110 industry experts, our team provided a list of important issues and challenges in the construction industry, specially related to our technology on action recognition and tracking of heavy equipment. The project provided an opportunity for our team members to better connect with key players within the construction industry and have friendly talks with decision-makers, such as project managers and project superintendents. In summary, we found that our technology is important to the construction industry and is capable of solving the specific problems described in the following sections.</p> <p>2. During these interviews, an intermediate-level BMC for our technology was prepared. In this project, we focused on the five important parts of the BMC: 1) customer segments, 2) customer relationships, 3) value prepositions, 4) channels, and 5) revenue streams. We have prepared a list of potential customers of our technology who are more interested in adopting new technologies to transfer from traditional methods to automated methods. Non-residential medium- and large-sized construction general contractors are our major customer segment because they own or rent a high number of heavy equipment and had specific issues with the safety and productivity rates of their machines on job sites. We have concluded that decreasing fatality and injuries by 20-30% and coordination of sub-contractors are the two most important values prepositions for our technology. Also, we found that attending trade shows and conferences and using emails are the most important methods for getting customers. We estimate the customer acquisition cost to be about $360 by considering the costs of attending trade shows, flights, and registration. Also, ordering the product through the website and using sales representatives were the two most easiest channels for our technology.</p> <p>3. Our team had the opportunity to travel and attend several conferences, industry meetings and workshops (Figure 2) in different States (e.g., Utah, Georgia, Philadelphia). We visited several decision-makers who are responsible for formulating the strategies and policies of the construction industry.</p> <p><strong>Fig 2.</strong> Our presence at safety meetings on construction job sites</p> <p>4. We had the chance to become familiar with the ecosystem of the construction industry and find the key roles in the market. This project helped us to find who is the decision-maker, influencer, seller, end-user, buyer and etc. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is our main influencer, project owner and project manager of a general contractor are the decision-makers and the project manager of the sub-contractor is the end-user.</p> <p>5. We concluded that our technology could be released considering the following options:</p> <ul> <li>Standalone device: Developing the necessary hardware unit for capturing and communicating data is the first option. To achieve this goal, a specific hardware unit should be designed and implemented. The system should include a central micro-controller (uController) module for recording data, and a communication component to transfer data through a Wi-Fi link to a central system inside the project office or any other specific locations </li> <li>Mobile app: The second option would be encapsulating the technology in the form of a mobile application rather than a stand alone device.
