<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a new platform for the cryopreservation of cellular therapies. This technology will allow for improved preservation of cells through the development of cell-type specific cryoprotective solutions and protocols that deliver high survival and function of cells after freezing and thawing. The cell therapy industry is a rapidly growing market that is expected to reach $8.21 billion by 2025. The proposed project will impact the cell therapy industry by improving quality of cells after freezing and thawing, extending the shelf life of these cells from hours or days to months or years, and alleviating processing bottlenecks associated with current preservation methods. This technology can be adapted for a variety of cell types, which may be administered to patients as cell therapies, used for research applications, or stored in biobanks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps Teams project builds upon prior research in the development of cryoprotective solutions and protocols for a variety of cell types.  The technology utilizes algorithm-driven optimization to create novel, nontoxic cryoprotective solutions inspired by how organisms survive freezing in nature. Proof-of-concept has been demonstrated with a cryoprotective solution and protocol optimized for the preservation of mesenchymal stem cells, which is currently undergoing beta testing at 8 sites. Additional technologies for other cell types are in progress. Development of this technology for specific markets requires a thorough understanding of customer needs. This I-Corps team project is aimed at identifying customer needs through customer discovery interviews, which will inform the development of new products in our pipeline to meet these specific needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The use of cells to treat disease or injury is of growing importance. Cells are commonly collected in one location at a given time and used at another location and a later time.  The cells must remain viable and functional all along the manufacturing and distribution process.   Freezing the cells is a common method of preserving them along the supply chain and therefore, is a critical step in the overall manufacturing process.  The project involved assessing the commercial potential for a new cryopreservation technology.  The technology which was assessed uses strategies found in nature to improve the preservation of cells.  One important objective of the project was completing customer discovery interviews. The customer discovery performed demonstrated that there is a high level of dissatisfaction with existing/conventional methods of cryopreserving cells. Furthermore, the new technology developed also addressed many of the needs expressed by those companies. The solution and method of freezing results in high levels of post thaw recovery, it can be integrated into the manufacturing process and the composition contains components that are safe for human use.  Another objective of the investigation involved manufacturing a prototype cryopreservation solution, which was successfully completed.   Instructions for use as well as a training video were also developed.  These resources could be used by end users of the technology.
