<AbstractNarration>Ethylene is an important chemicals in modern society, with impacts ranging from the production of plastics and other chemicals to playing a significant role in the food supply chain as the primary ripening hormone of some fruit. As a result, there has been a significant effort to detect this small molecule via instrumentation and with molecular recognition. While these efforts have led to some sensitive approaches for ethylene detection, methods for detecting ethylene in complex environments (such as inside a plant cell) do not currently exist. In this project, Professor Michel of the University of Denver is developing new small molecule probes that increase fluorescence upon reaction with ethylene. An understanding of the relationship between the structure of the probe and its signaling property in a specific environment are critical to the sensitive detection of ethylene. Fluorescent and color-producing probes have the unique ability to produce color within otherwise invisible chemical processes. This research is being developed into an integrated lecture-lab module for undergraduate organic students to provide context to underrepresented topics. Professor Michel develops outreach demonstrations at local high schools. Due to the desire to understand and control ethylene in the fruit supply chain, this research may have a broader impact on society by increasing the understanding of the molecular roles of ethylene in the ripening processes; thereby preventing premature food spoilage and reducing agricultural waste. Further, the graduate and undergraduate students working on this project are underrepresented minorities who are gaining a unique skill set due to the interdisciplinary nature of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms B program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michel of the University of Denver is developing new small molecule fluorescent probes for the detection of ethylene. Due to the relatively small and unreactive nature of ethylene under the confined conditions of living systems, an organometallic-based approach is being developed, which requires a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the ligands bound to the metal center and stoichiometric reactivity with ethylene. This research determines the optimal probes for a particular application, such as the detection of ethylene in relevant biological systems including A. thaliana and E. coli. Detection of ethylene in these organisms is being investigated with probe modifications tailored to the specific goals and challenges presented by these systems. The detection of gaseous ethylene in the atmosphere including from ripening fruit is also being investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
