<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by exploring the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques transform how knowledge is gained, applied, and transferred.  It will examine this issue across different sectors, including education, industry, and government. The project focuses specifically on the need to harness today's AI technology to augment human performance and productivity.  To this end, a two-day workshop will  bring together a broad range of stakeholders to share insights and ideas.  The workshop will include keynote presentations, panel and participant discussions, and AI technology demonstrations. Through these activities, participants will explore how to harness machine intelligence in ways that collaborate effectively with humans, thus augmenting human understanding, productivity, health, and safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will generate: (i) a white paper on AI systems to enrich human lives in an inclusive manner; (ii) a roadmap for priority action in AI-enhanced STEM knowledge acquisition and application; (iii) a sustainable network of researchers and advisors for future submission of proposals to federal and other funding agencies. On Day 1, following a keynote presentation by the governor of Pennsylvania, there will be a networking session for participants, followed by AI technology demonstrations. After lunch, a panel discussion will explore AI Knowledge Acquisition and Application, followed by a presentation on governmental funding opportunities to support work in this area of AI. On Day 2, following a  keynote presentation by the president of the Fund II Foundation and a networking session for participants, researchers will present their work on overcoming biases in AI.   Participants will develop a draft of the white paper during the working lunch and extending into the afternoon. Following additional networking breaks and presentations about funding opportunities, the afternoon will conclude with discussions about pathways forward. The workshop will benefit society by paving the way toward deeper discussion and greater collaboration among stakeholders regarding the use of AI to augment human performance and productivity. Additionally, the topics addressed involve human interaction with cyber-physical systems in ways that re-define the human-computer interface, a topic at the confluence of three NSF Big Ideas: Human-Technology Frontier, Growing Convergence Research and Harnessing the Data Revolution.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is cofunded by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources Program, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students and the NSF Engineering Education and Centers Division, which invests in creation of 21st century engineers and discovery of technologies through transformational center-based research, research in education and inclusion, and research opportunities for students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
