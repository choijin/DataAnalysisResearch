<AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;The National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) Annual Conference affords an opportunity to convene scholars from diverse disciplines and backgrounds to help engineer outcomes that advance the pace and scale of solutions to serve society. NCSE's Annual Conference provides ideal conditions to serve as a "convergence accelerator," actively bringing together scientists with those who make decisions. Through innovative conference design that brings together scientists and decision-makers (e.g. leaders from local governments in NCSE's Applied Solutions network of local governments), NCSE will expand active networks through new relationships for collaboration on areas of mutual subject matter interest (e.g. water, energy, etc). Through broader programmatic work post-conference, NCSE is laying the foundation for sustained and enduring collaboration between science and decision-making communities, outlining a path for further solutions-oriented research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will allow The National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) to add a third day to the Annual Conference. This third day will be organized and facilitated to create enabling conditions for future convergence research, along with specific opportunities and outcomes. Areas of focus will include: 1) innovative governance for science and decision-making from local to international scales; 2) connecting social and natural science research for sustainability solutions; 3) convening diverse communities through facilitated interactions between scientists and decision-makers that focus on knowledge co-creation and reframing critical questions. The conditions NCSE will create will lay foundations for true knowledge co-production, where scientists advance their ability to frame future research questions that are informed directly by questions that decision-makers are asking (Sarewitz and Pielke 2007). The result will be ideas and plans for solution-driven research, guided by the real-world grounding of problems that decision makers are working to solve on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   NCSE 2020 Annual Conference: Science in Environmental Decision-Making January 6-9, 2020 Washington, D.C. Twenty years ago, the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) hosted its first annual conference focused on our core mission&mdash;to improve the scientific basis of environmental decision-making. In January 2020, NCSE marked its 30th year as an organization by celebrating and revisiting the mission-oriented theme of our inaugural conference. NCSE 2020 By the Numbers Bringing together more than 600 participants, spanning science, practice, and decision-making, the Annual Conference provided opportunities for diverse groups of scholars from the social and natural sciences to interact with each other, as well as with the decision-makers representing different scales of decision-making, spanning local government to multilateral institutions. The NCSE 2020 Annual Conference brought together diverse constituencies, with higher education (57%), federal and local government agencies (22%), and other sectors represented. In 2020, NCSE achieved a large uptick in student participation, a result of an intentional effort to engage undergraduate and graduate students and encourage vertical integration between students and senior professionals. The NCSE 2020 Annual Conference addressed the ways in which science contributes to the decision-making process to serve society. It highlighted cases in which science has helped improve environmental challenges and decisions and examples in which a lack of science has compromised the efficacy of decisions and policies. The NCSE conference program featured five keynote presentations, six plenary panels, 40 program concurrent sessions, six workshops on science policy and science communication, 30 flash talks, and 36 posters.  Experiences and Outcomes Attendees of NCSE 2020 left feeling energized and empowered, with new connections and ideas for collaboration. Within the federal agency community, we received concrete feedback from FEMA, for example, that the conference offered a window into the environmental sciences community that this agency does not interact with frequently and inspired plans to build new connections.

Testimonials   "This whole meeting was a real joy &ndash; more impactful than any scientific meeting I’ve ever attended!" Martha Anderson, U.S. Department of Agriculture "I just wanted to let you know that the NCSE conference was the most influential and meaningful meeting I’ve attended in probably a decade.   My favorite part about the conference was the keynote and overall discussion about bridging that gap between science, policy and beyond.

Anonymous   "It was wonderful meeting folks from different backgrounds and different experiences as well as hearing from several strong speakers." Anonymous   "The panel talks were educational and interdisciplinary which I thought was very important relating to the theme and need for cooperative action in the environmental field." Anonymous   In addition to the connections made and collaborations that were inspired at the NCSE 2020 Annual Conference, NCSE collected valuable information from participants through the interactive "Experience Wall."
