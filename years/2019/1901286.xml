<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a conference titled "Arithmetic and Algebraic Geometry" to be held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in the period August 5-9, 2019. It will feature talks by international experts known for their expository skills, encourage new collaborations, and serve as an excellent opportunity where junior participants can learn and meet experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas of arithmetic and algebraic geometry have traditionally attracted the interest of many young mathematicians because of the depth and beauty of the ideas they offer. The purpose of this conference is to bring together leaders of various subfields within this very broad subject to explain some of the latest developments. The topics represented at the conference will include complex geometry, algebraic cycles, motives, birational geometry, derived and higher categorical techniques, rational points, and arithmetic and geometry of K3 surfaces. This conference will provide opportunities for fruitful discussions and exchange of ideas across different areas of arithmetic and algebraic geometry.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant supported a conference on ``Arithmetic and Algebraic Geometry" that took place at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor during the week of 8/5/19.      The twin subjects of arithmetic geometry and algebraic geometry are perhaps some of the oldest in mathematics, finding their roots in the work of the ancient Greek mathematicians. Their centrality within mathematics was cemented in the last century (thanks in large part to the firm foundation provided by the work of Zariski, Weil, Serre, Grothendieck, Deligne, and their many collaborators) through applications across mathematics, especially in number theory, representation theory, and algebraic topology. The goal of our conference was to highlight some of the recent advances in the subject.     The conference speakers included many leaders in a broad spectrum of topics in the area. The talks featured some of the latest results, and were presented in a way that made them accessible to such a broad audience. Topics covered included algebraic cycles, cohomology theories, rational points, birational geometry and special geometeries. In all, there were 21 research talks (including two minicourses of 3 lectures each).  In addition to the talks, the conference also featured the following:  - A poster session (where 10 posters were presented)  - Five evening background talks aimed exclusively at the junior participants   - Various informal opportunities for mentoring and discussions.  Over 100 participants attended the conference, and we believe it was very successful.        Last Modified: 05/03/2020       Submitted by: Evangelia Gazaki]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
