<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to reduce two stroke emissions while improving overall engine efficiencies. Engine emissions directly impact the environment, wildlife, and public health. Small engines used in powersports and small lightweight ground transportation are becoming a significant source of emissions. The technology developed in this effort will yield a low cost high power density engine with reduced emissions output. Transportation manufactures have limited low cost options to improve emissions and this technology will provide a commercial incentive to implement; keeping cost low while achieving lower emissions outputs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop two stroke engine technology that reduces engine emissions. Two stoke engines are low cost with high power density but despite these advantages, the two stroke engines' major disadvantage is the emissions produced by the engine. The disadvantages are inherent to the design of the traditional two stroke engine with the lubrication oil being mixed with the fuel and the port design allowing unburnt hydrocarbons to exit the engine. This project will address these shortcomings of the traditional two stoke developing an engine with an emissions profile similar to that of a four stoke engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
