<AbstractNarration>This conference will bring together researchers and students, observers and theorists representing a variety of surveys and missions for the presentation and discussion of the latest discoveries and on-going work with RR Lyrae and Cepheid type pulsating variable stars.  During the meeting, participants will discuss and share the latest results from a variety of datasets (ground-based surveys and space-based missions), the latest theoretical models (from hydrodynamical codes describing stellar interiors, stellar evolution of pulsating stars, and pulsation theory), and topics on the small (binary systems) and large (near-field cosmology) scale.   The conference is scheduled for October 13-18, 2019 in Cloudcroft, New Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is well situated to bring astronomy to the local communities in southeastern New Mexico. One aim to broaden the impact of the meeting is to engage with the local Native Americans to share their understanding of the night sky with our group of scientists. This cultural exchange is expected to be illuminating and inspirational, and educational for everyone. The second aim is to reach out to the amateur astronomy community to encourage joint research projects with professional astronomers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The community of astronomers studying classical pulsating stars, namely RR Lyrae and Cepheid types, met in Cloudcroft, New Mexico, USA, on 13-18 October 2019.  The conference is part of a series started in 2015, and it is an international gathering of astronomers, focusing on the latest research techniques and presenting results from our studies of these variable stars.  Our 75 participants hailed from 20 countries, which spanned 5 continents.  We achieved gender balance among our speakers (22 women and 34 men) and in the scientific organizing committee (6 women and 9 men).  The gathered astronomers ranged in career age from graduate students to senior astronomers.  A special session was held for students and early career astronomers to introduce machine learning and data mining in the context of variable star studies.  Another special session was devoted to the NASA space missions, Kepler, K2, and TESS, to discuss ongoing and future research.  This meeting included presenters and participants who are members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers, and we provided a forum to connect amateurs and professionals for future collaborations.  The conference also acknowledged and honored the Indigenous Peoples in the American Southwest by inviting representatives to special educational events to share and teach their cultures to our meeting participants.  Our meeting had additional special excursions to introduce the natural beauty of southeastern New Mexico as well as a visit to Apache Point Observatory, to highlight the excellent scientific resources in the area. There will be a published book of conference proceedings, currently in press with the Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series.  The proceedings in this volume will be made public in 2021 and will be available through the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System search as well as through the preprint service, arXiv.org.
