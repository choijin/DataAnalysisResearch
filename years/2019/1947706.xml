<AbstractNarration>The Northeast Partnership for Atmospheric and Related Sciences (NEPARS) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site brings together two primarily undergraduate institutions with atmospheric and related science programs to expand research opportunities for a diverse population of undergraduate students early in their education. REU interns will conduct research in areas of mesoscale and synoptic weather, microclimates, biometeorology, mountain meteorology, modern climate, and paleoclimate to better understand physical processes, predictability, and impact on society. The primary objective of the NEPARS REU site is to provide learning opportunities to a promising and diverse group of undergraduates to help them prepare for careers in STEM fields by conducting quality scientific research, building professional networks, improving leadership skills, and developing effective communication skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year a cohort of 12 undergraduate students will be offered paid summer research positions with the NEPARS REU to work with faculty mentors from Hobart &amp; William Smith Colleges (HWS) and Plymouth State University (PSU). Six students and three mentors will work at each research location during a 9-week summer research program. Additionally, the NEPARS REU will partner with the Mt. Washington Observatory and the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at SUNY Albany to offer interactions beneficial to REU student professional development. The NEPARS REU site has a primary focus on participation of rising sophomores and rising juniors that have just completed their first and second year, respectively, at two-year or four-year colleges and universities across the U.S. offering degrees in STEM fields. Each summer the REU will feature a full-group gathering at HWS in the first week for orientation and workshops, a second gathering at PSU during mid-summer for a colloquium and workshops, and a third gathering near the end of summer at SUNY Albany for a REU symposium and sessions/workshops to share information about graduate school. During the two multi-week periods between gatherings, the primary focus will be on designing and conducting project-based research using student pairings and close student-mentor collaboration with a goal of progressing from project and hypothesis development to students presenting research results at conferences and publishing in scientific journals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
