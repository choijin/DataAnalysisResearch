<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to address the high costs associated with building heating and cooling in a sustainable fashion. Heating/cooling constitute approximately 48% of building energy consumption. Ground-source or geothermal heat pumps (GSHPs) represent an energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable heating and cooling solution, but their high upfront capital costs have significantly limited deployment. This project takes a fundamentally different approach to GSHP heat transfer, with the expected result that installation costs are decreased by up to 50% and operating costs by 20% compared to conventional GSHP systems. This project will thoroughly field test and analyze the performance of the GSHP innovation, advancing the technology design and installation parameters, and readying it for commercial deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of the high installation cost and large, disruptive footprint of GSHP systems, with the objective to provide a cost-effective, widely-deployable, renewable solution for building heating and cooling. This project will advance an innovative GSHP field loop technology from numerical and laboratory analyses to manufacturing and field testing. The overall research objective is to determine the performance of the innovative GSHP field loop under real-world conditions. The research program includes: 1) development of a comprehensive numerical model of the innovative GSHP system for field sites; 2) field testing, including final design, installation, and operation of equipment at a field site; 3) numerical model and equipment design refinement following initial field testing; 4) installation and testing of modified equipment; and 5) development of a comprehensive cost, energy use and emissions model. It is anticipated that the project will result in a commercially-ready GSHP product, with design and installation guidelines, that substantially (by up to 50%) reduces the installation cost of GSHPs while improving their performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Our innovation is an  advective GSHP (AGHP) that fundamentally changes the approach to  subsurface heat exchange in GSHP systems.

It explicitly considers and fully uses the  thermal exchange properties of water, including advective and convective  energy transfer, the additional heat capacity that water provides  relative to earth and sediment, and the diffusion mechanism/transport  medium for traditional GSHPs.  In this SBIR Phase I research effort, we sought to answer the following technical questions:  Whether the combination of the proposed wellbore design and heat  exchanger design can deliver the anticipated amount of heat exchange  capacity, and that these designs are sufficiently optimized for future  commercialization. Whether groundwater flow can be sufficiently induced to provide the  desired level of heat exchange, and that the appropriate mechanism is  utilized. Whether individual wellbores can perform in a sufficiently  independent fashion so as not to impact the performance of nearby or  adjacent wells in the same aquifer. This question was to be addressed in  one of two ways: 1) if the first AGHP well installed in the field  performed as designed, then a second well would be installed near the  first to field-test both wells simultaneously, or 2) if the first well  required significant upgrades to meet desired performance, then this  effort would be completed numerically.   To answer these questions, we completed a series of tasks, described  below, that included analytical and numerical modeling of our heat  exchanger system and hydrogeologic numerical modeling,  design/development and manufacture of equipment, and extensive testing  in the field.  Installation and testing of the AGHP system in the field  was the critical component of the present effort.  We encountered  several challenges throughout the process that led to numerous design  and construction improvements.  In addition to these technical advances to our system, we also made  iterative improvements to our testing methodology and progressively  bolstered our own understanding of how the system operates, using this  data to update our numerical models of the heat exchanger and of the  hydrogeology.  Through the course of Phase I, we tested three heat  exchanger designs (one more than originally anticipated in our SBIR  Phase I application) in two different wells.  We also had the  opportunity to test  two distinct types of geological formation, one  more than originally anticipated. Using an analytical approach, we  designed the second- and third-generation heat exchangers (heat  exchanger 2 and 3). The performance of these designs was then analyzed  with numerical simulation, which was also used to strengthen the  analytical models.
