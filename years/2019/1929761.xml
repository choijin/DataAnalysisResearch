<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for offsetting registration and travel expenses to enable 15 graduate students to attend the 2019 Titanium USA conference, September 22-24 in Mobile, Alabama.. The attending students will participate in the conference by giving technical papers, and participating in a poster session to display their research, and attending technical sessions. The funding opportunity will be broadly announced, affording students ample notice and time to apply. Applications will be reviewed by committee, and he support provided will cover the student registration as well as travel expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The support will provide 15 selected students with the opportunity to participate in the preeminent titanium industry research conference in the US. Student participation at national manufacturing conferences is crucial to expanding the manufacturing research base in the US. Students obtain unique experiences and interactions with academic and industry researchers, and are motivated by the opportunity to present their own work. Participation at conference also gives them the opportunity to learn about the latest research results in their area, and to explore interest in new areas of titanium manufacturing. Additionally, exposure to research from others helps to instill a good foundational understanding of the scientific method, which will serve them well throughout their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding received for this project was used to support 13 students  from very different backgrounds to attend the Titanium USA 2109  conference in Mobile, Alabama.  The understanding of the science and technology surrounding the production and utilization of Titanium and its alloys is critical to the national interest of the United States. This project has allowed undergraduate and graduate students to present their relevant research to academic and industry leaders in the titanium field. Exposing students to the national and international titanium community provides them exposure to a potential career path in Titanium research and development and will broaden the number of students able to present their research at a national level.  The titanium industry is particularly interested in encouraging presentations by students who otherwise might not attend such an event, and the potential impact of their research would therefore be lost to the titanium community.  While attending the conference, the students were engaged in a number of activities to promote their professional development. These activities included 1) attend the supported conference and participate in numerous educational workshops and seminars on current research in the titanium industry, 2) present their own on-going research through poster presentations to their peers, professional researchers in the titanium field, and titanium industry leaders, and 3) receive feedback from the assigned research mentors (researcher volunteers) after their poster presentation, and 4) participate in meetings with titanium industry leaders to explore post-graduation career options in research within the titanium industry, national laboratories, or academia, and 5) participate in a career workshop arranged just for these students.  The International Titanium Foundation, which supports the Titanium USA Conference, received excellent feedback from students and the academic faculty advisors. There was a strong concensus that the conference organizers provided very rich educational and professional experiences for the thirteen student awardees.
