<AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together U.S. and European researchers from health, computer/data science, architecture, engineering, construction, social science and government policy to explore research collaboration strategies to address the common challenges in human wellbeing in the built environment. The focus for this workshop is data structure, data acquisition and validation, and the prerequisite is data analytics for various wellbeing constructs. Built upon the strengths of existing research networks, especially in development of Virtual Information Fabric Infrastructure (VIFI), the participants will harness the data revolution to support data sharing, interoperability, modeling, analysis, and visualization for wellbeing-centric sustainable built environment. The workshop targets to provide a forum to lay the foundation for future international collaboration in the theme areas identified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anticipated collaboration among researchers from the U.S. and European researchers will enrich access to rich datasets for comparability and case studies and obtain raw materials with which to develop novel proposals on data infrastructures. By using comparative data and case studies, the participants will begin to draw inferences on common model features as well as divergent model features, especially in the area of human behavior. Data derived from comparative local environments will be instructive for building future scenarios comparing unit-to-community level integration. Those platforms should also help to enable various solutions to bottleneck problems that hinder wider research collaborations and development of data- driven decision tools. Through this workshop the engagement of U.S. researchers with similar researchers and stakeholders (scientists, engineers, industrialists, healthcare professionals, etc.) from Europe will begin a dialogue that enable U.S. researchers, and ultimately U.S. industry, to develop multidisciplinary validation and verification models to assist U.S. market and policy decisions from data derived by comparative studies. This provides an opportunity in which strategic bridges between U.S. and international networks would create mutual benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
