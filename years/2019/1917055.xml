<AbstractNarration>This grant supports fundamental research that contributes new knowledge in the manufacturing of multiscale three-dimensional structures for applications such as energy storage devices. This project investigates a combination of three-dimensional micro-casting and three-dimensional (3D) printing to enable the fabrication of multi-component, porous structures and devices. Most 3D printing and micro-casting processes require high temperatures that can cause thermal damage or part distortion if not properly controlled. This research investigates room temperature processes thus avoiding damage and distortion. The multiscale manufacturing approach involves control of the microstructure and macrostructure in multi-material structures for devices such as advanced energy storage systems. When made from conductive materials, the three-dimensional porous structures have applications in energy, healthcare, biomedical, aerospace, chemical and automotive industries, which benefits the U.S. economy and society. This research involves several disciplines including advanced manufacturing, electrochemistry, control theory, and materials science. The multi-disciplinary approach helps broaden participation of women and underrepresented groups in research and positively impacts engineering education and training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project studies an electric field-assisted 3D micro-casting process to fabricate battery electrodes combined with a 3D printing process to fabricate the separators for advanced energy storage devices such as Li-ion batteries. This novel process has the potential to overcome the limitations of anisotropic microstructures, residual stresses, poor inter-layer bonding, poor resolution, and rough surfaces in conventional manufacturing. This project studies the mechanisms of porosity formation and particle alignment during electric field-assisted micro-casting using atomistic simulations, physics-based predictive models and experimental verification. The team tests the hypothesis that rheological properties and electric field strengths are the determining factors for porosity and particle alignment in micro-cast structures and establishes relationships between process parameters and microstructural features. The project explores how micro-casting governs the macrostructure and electric-field governs the microstructure of the particle network, and how this cooperative multiscale control can improve energy and power density for energy storage devices. Further, the study investigates how local laser heating maintains the fine structures and enhances the mechanical integrity of the constituent materials. The effect of material and geometry on safety and ion transport in the 3D-printed separator is studied. The project relies on multiscale understanding and control, enabling transformative change in electrode manufacturing and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
