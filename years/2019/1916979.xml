<AbstractNarration>The dynamics of flames is known to change significantly in the presence of ambient flow circulation. For example, the interactions of the swirling flow with the uprising plume of hot gas induced by a fire leads to the formation of so-called fire whirls or fire tornados, which have been found to occur both in wildland and urban conflagrations, with disastrous consequences. Despite considerable research efforts, the physics underlying these flame-swirl interactions is still unclear. This projects seeks better understanding of this type of flame dynamics to enable better predictive tools for risk management, evacuations, and firefighting of wildland and urban fires. Beyond these advancements for broader society, an outreach component training undergraduate and graduate students in combustion science as well as contributing to broader awareness of flame dynamics through a series of outreach demonstrations entitled "The physics of swirling fires" will help to promote STEM careers and the field in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research combines linear stability and sensitivity analyses, controlled laboratory experiments, and mathematical descriptions of reduced canonical problems to clarify the complex interacting processes governing the dynamics of pool fires in the presence of ambient swirl. The investigation targets quantification of the different combustion regimes corresponding to different levels of ambient circulation, namely, axisymmetric puffing, fire whirls, dwarf fire whirls, and blue whirls, as well as characterization of a number of key fluid-mechanical phenomena that control their existence, including global instabilities, vortex breakdown, and edge-flame detachment and lift-off. The work will use the results to (i) provide improved understanding of the underlying physical processes; (ii) quantify critical transition conditions and associated controlling phenomena; (iii) clarify effects of variations of buoyancy, outer circulation, wall-surface thermal characteristics, fuel type, and swirl-generation mechanism; and (iv) investigate the extent to which these swirling flows can be controlled by passive means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
