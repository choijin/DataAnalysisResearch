<AbstractNarration>Funding is provided to Battelle Memorial Institute to execute a workshop intended to assemble leaders of Environmental Research Infrastructures (ERIs) from six countries to explore common research interests and explore models to enhance collaborations that leverage each infrastructure's individual, and their combined research strengths. The sheer geographic breadth and the diverse research communities served by participating ERIs potentially add extensive societal benefits to this global scientific endeavor, supported by international data sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop facilitating the identification of common research themes and the development of features and potential requirements for a potential governance structure that aligns with each ERI's national goals and engenders global perspectives and good practices for research infrastructures is funded. The workshop also promotes the building of lasting scientific collaborations that will catalyze actions addressing global research questions in environmental science and ecology. The activities proposed will initiate the creation of a platform that fosters wider community mobilization across international boundaries, thus having the potential for significant societal impacts. The organizers plan to engage 28-32 individuals from six ERIs and allow for remote participation, expanding the reach of the workshop. In summary, this workshop leverages NSF's investment in the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and provides a collaborative framework for US researchers to participate in this global conversation and potentially influence, and gain access to, a global ecological data set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past decade, large-scale Environmental Research Infrastructures (ERIs) have been designed, constructed around the world, and now they are in operations to address these challenges and to provide informed decision making tools in light of our changing world.  By design, ERIs capture ecological data over the continental scale and over decades, making them unique among individual research projects.  The coevolution of both ERIs (approach) and ecological sciences (theory) has developed into a new science discipline; macrosystems ecology.  Here, we brought together 6 ERIs from around the world (Global ERI = GERI), and: (i) developed a process to federate the ERIs globally (i.e., development roadmap and removed barriers); (ii) defined the steps needed to design and make an operational-ready Governance Structure (with Charter), Governing Principles (i.e., how we will make decisions), and an Organizational Chart; (iii) drafted a GERI Value proposition of ‘How’ we will realize a GERI, and ‘What’ are our offerings’; (iv) drafted a GERI Vision Statement, and (v) developed a strong GERI science rationale that demonstrate the utility of a GERI to enable cross -continental/cross-country frontier ecological research (which will be submitted for publication).  This workshop advanced our ability to federate ERIs across continents, that in turn, enable new understandings and knowledge that otherwise would not be possible and meet the rubric of Transformative Science.  The 6 ERIs are; the US National Science Foundation-sponsored (NSF) National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON); European Commission-sponsored European Long Term Ecosystem, critical zone and socio-ecological systems Research Network (eLTER); European Commission-sponsored Integrated Carbon Observing System (ICOS); Australia’s Department of Education, Skills, and Employment (NCRI)-sponsored Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN); the Chinese Academy of Science-sponsored (CAS) Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN); and the South African National Research Foundation-sponsored (NRF) South Africa Ecological Observatory Network (SAEON).  The GERI is now ready for implementation and broader inclusion of other networks and infrastructure, with a Mission Statement of;  "We are site-based research infrastructures dedicated to better understand the function and change of indicator ecosystems (terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, indicator, representative, benchmark, tbd) across global biomes to support excellent science that can inform political and managerial decision-making addressing grand societal challenges"     Broader Impacts: The National Science Foundation (NSF) ‘envisions a nation that capitalizes on new concepts in science and engineering and provides global leadership to advance research and education’, and ‘advance large science areas,’ i.e., ‘Big Science’.  One of NSF's 10 ‘Big Ideas’ specifically calls for ‘&hellip;establishment of observational research sites, observational platforms, or networks of sites to document key aspects coupled processes across terrestrial, marine, atmospheric and social systems.’ and through large research infrastructures, e.g., the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).  This workshop contributed directly towards NSF’s; ‘Harnessing the Data Revolution’, ‘Navigating the new Arctic’, and ‘Growing Convergence Research’ rf. NSF 2026.  Moreover, by adhering to the G7 Group of Senior Officials (GSO) recommended guidelines (namely: e-infrastructures; data exchange; clustering of research infrastructures; international mobility; and monitoring of socio-economic impact), GERI provides is an international value-added project that also directly addresses NSF’s Big Ideas.  In all of GERI’s activities, working groups, annual planning meetings, and working group activities, we will provide opportunities and be inclusive to broaden (a) participation of other networks and infrastructure, and (b) the engagement of researchers and other end-users.  The GERI embraces diversity in gender, career stage, scientific discipline, and geographic and institutional distribution.
