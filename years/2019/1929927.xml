<AbstractNarration>One of the existential problems facing civilization in the 21st century is mobility.  A crowded urban planet must determine how to move people through cities and provide access to opportunities in an environmentally-friendly, socially-just and economically efficient manner.  Both due to these concerns and the availability of new communication and location-aware technologies, we are witnessing the introduction of disruptive mobility services in many communities.  However, this is often happening in an ad-hoc, bottom-up manner: examples include ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft, dockless bike-sharing and scooters. Consequently, researchers, public officials and other stakeholders are struggling to keep up with these innovations and understand their potential impacts on equity, the environment and economic performance. Thankfully, these new mobility technologies generate a large amount of "digital exhaust:" incidental data that is a byproduct of their use.  Also, urban processes are increasingly digitized, urban environments are increasingly sensed, and people contribute to this urban data maelstrom through social media and citizen science.  We can leverage these new data sources to understand the impacts of new mobility technologies and services on urban sustainability.  We will conduct a two-day interactive workshop in Columbus, Ohio in July 2019 to engage community-based stakeholders and a diverse group of researchers in a facilitated dialogue on how to use these data to generate transformative urban sustainability science and actionable knowledge for evidence-based policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will focus on the opportunities and challenges of building and maintaining an urban sustainability data observatory (USDO): technological and organizational system for persistent collection, cleaning, fusing, analysis and sharing of urban data.  A USDO can enable new measures and analyses of progress towards sustainability over time.  It can also leverage real-world events to develop retrospective and prospective natural and quasi-experimental designs that provide stronger support for causality than cross-sectional designs. The workshop will focus on two specific cities in which USDOs are currently being planned and are also experiencing the introduction of disruptive mobility technologies and services, Columbus, Ohio and Portland, Oregon. In addition, the workshop will seek to develop a convergent sustainable urban systems (SUS) framework that can support the development of a network of urban sustainability data observatories and lay the foundation for a new kind of data-driven, comparative observatory science guided by SUS theories of change. A key principle that will be explored is the role of partnerships among researchers, public entities and community stakeholders in co-developing research questions that advance an understanding of SUS.  Organizers envision a comparative approach that generates more nuanced, context-sensitive approaches to evidence-based policy, facilitates the sharing of best practices, and ultimately leads to a deeper understanding of the principles underlying urban sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Civilization is facing three transformative changes that will profoundly impact humanity and the planet.  First, is an urban revolution: the world’s urban population became a majority for the first time in history in the early 21st century, and this urbanization trend is accelerating:  by the end of this century, the vast majority of the 9-10 billion people on Earth will live in cities.  If human civilization is to survive and thrive in an urban world, we must determine how to create cities that are sustainable: foster economic growth in an environmentally-friendly and socially-just manner.    Second, we are experiencing a mobility revolution in many cities with the introduction of new mobility technologies and services including light individual transport (e.g., e-scooters), shared vehicles, microtransit, and eventually connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).  These technologies will have profound and disruptive effects on cities similar to the development of railroads in the 19th century and highways in the 20th century.   Finally, a data revolution: smart mobility and related urban data technologies generate massive data about various aspects of cities, including the activities and movements of people in them.  These data present an opportunity to inform a new sustainable urban systems (SUS) science that recognizes the complexity of cities and enables better policy and planning decisions during this time of urban transformation.    This workshop explored the concept of an urban sustainability observatory (USO).  A USO uses ongoing data collection and analysis to generate new knowledge from planned interventions and unplanned events in a geographic community of interest.  Ongoing data collection creates timely, always-ready benchmarks that can be leveraged with quasi and natural experimental designs and methods for extracting causal inferences in non-laboratory settings.  This can enable new scientific and policy collaborations involving tactical urbanism: a growing trend where communities make local, provisional changes to infrastructures or policies to test impacts and iterate to better solutions before wider deployment; examples include pop-up bus lanes and opening streets for walking and biking on weekends.  Timely benchmarks mean that investigators are ready when an unplanned or short-notice disruption occurs, such as e-scooters appearing suddenly in a city, an extreme storm flooding a highway, or a global pandemic. These events can be analyzed retrospectively if the urban system is being monitored when the unexpected disruption occurs. By creating a platform for ongoing, data-enabled experimentation, a USO treats the city as a complex system that must be understood one intervention or event at a time.   The workshop focused on two US cities that are investing in urban data resources &ndash; Columbus, Ohio and Portland, Oregon.  Columbus is also the winner of the US Department of Transportation 2016 Smart City challenge; an outcome is the Smart Columbus Operating System open data platform.  The workshop was an equal mix of academics, city officials and businesspeople, drawing heavily from both cities but also including national participants.  The workshop occurred at The Ohio State University STEAM Factory facility in downtown Columbus, 15-16 July 2019, with approximately 50 participants in attendance.   Through keynote lectures, facilitated participation and break-out discussions, participants explored the types of data, analysis, visualization and mapping functions needed in a USO, and the scientific research challenges required to create this functionality at an urban scale.  Participants also discussed challenges in building and sustaining these observatories and how university, community and industry partnerships may establish successful observatories that serve as critical drivers of research, technology transfer and commercialization.  The main product from this workshop was a report to the National Science Foundation (NSF) that outlined the research and development challenges identified through the workshop.  The workshop organizers further developed these concepts into a vision paper, Urban Sustainability Observatories: Leveraging Urban Experimentation for Sustainability Science and Policy.  This paper brings the USO vision and its challenges into sharper focus, with further conceptual development of its functionality.      Main findings:  The core of a USO is a geospatial and moving objects database that integrates spatial, temporal, moving objects and streaming data across the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability, using georeferencing as the common element.   A USO facilitates opportunistic science through tools that support quasi and natural experimental statistical methods.    A USO contains methods and models for building knowledge beyond temporary, local-scale experiments and events. A USO is inclusive and recognizes heterogeneous perspectives on analysis and modeling results, corresponding to sustainability stances such as weak (tradeoffs between physical and natural capital), strong (no tradeoffs) and weak+ (selected tradeoffs). A USO is scalable, open, distributed, user-centric, service-oriented and community-driven in its design and operation.   Data challenges include data standards, hidden data biases, data governance and privacy.  Multilaternal community partnerships are also required to build long-term collaborative research, education and translational pipelines.  USOs also require innovative public-private business models, plans for workforce education and capacity building among community partners, and policies for technology transfer and knowledge dissemination.
