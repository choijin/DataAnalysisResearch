<AbstractNarration>The capability to bring computer science and technology as well as large and complex data sets to bear on interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary science is emerging. It is therefore critically important to establish and enable transnational frameworks so that data-driven scientific knowledge can transcend disciplines and geographical borders, ultimately increasing the scientific underpinnings of policy and action. International collaboration within global environmental change research fields holds the potential to establish international foundations for federated data integration and analysis systems with shared services, bring together best practices from the public and private sectors, foster open data and open science stewardship among the science communities including related areas such as publishing, and encourage data and cloud providers and others to adopt common standards and practices for the benefit of all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 29 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum Call for proposals on "Science-driven e-Infrastructure Innovation (SEI) for the Enhancement of Transnational, Interdisciplinary and Transdisciplinary Data Use in Environmental Change".  SEI is a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that bring together environmental, social and economic scientists with data scientists, computational scientists, and e-infrastructure and cyber-infrastructure developers and providers to solve one or more of the methodological, technological and/or procedural challenges currently facing inter-disciplinary and transdisciplinary environmental change research that involves working with large, diverse and multi-source transnational data. The SEI call will intimately link research thinking and technological innovation toward accelerating the full-path of discovery-driven data use and open science and enable a broader scientific community to benefit from the identified new and potentially disruptive demonstrators or pilots toward solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific advances depend on the availability, accessibility and reusability of data, software, samples, and data products. Yet large amounts of data on the Earth are not well preserved or preserved at all. This project will address these questions by supporting the collaboration of a synthesis science team and data-science team. The teams will conduct a trans-disciplinary, trans-national synthesis science project in parallel and in partnership with a project on the use and re-use of environmental and socioeconomic data to assess practices for managing and preserving data. The project will provide a unique opportunity for data scientists and synthesis scientists to collaborate in real-time toward the goal of improving research outcomes and data sharing. In partnership with teams in France, Brazil, the United States, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom, the project will examine the socioeconomic effects of natural protected areas on local communities. The resulting tools and metrics will enable better prediction and mitigation of the effect of actions that disrupt historical land use practices. The project team will develop leading practices on data citation, attribution, credit, and reuse. With these new practices as the content, a toolkit and workshop materials to deliver the content via face-to-face meetings and webinars will be created as will a tool for researchers to view their shared data, data usage and reuse through widgets and on-line profiles. The project results will be useful to circa 300,000 earth, space, and environmental researchers worldwide. It will advance the momentum of cultural change in the use and re-use of big data in research on real-world problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
