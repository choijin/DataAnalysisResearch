<AbstractNarration>Robot hands fall short of the dexterity of human hands for several reasons. One reason is the lack of affordable high-performance contact and force sensors to provide sensation at the fingertips. This project is to develop a new inexpensive fingertip for robot hands, with the goal of enhancing their dexterity.? Specifically, the new fingertip will incorporate a consumer-grade miniature camera and a flexure mount to deliver three characteristics that are promising for enhancing dexterous manipulation: (1) a well-characterized relationship between the force applied to the fingertip and its deflection (i.e., stiffness); (2) high-resolution contact location sensing; and (3) high-resolution measurement of the forces and torques applied by the fingertip. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these characteristics, the project is broken into four tasks: (1) the design and testing of a compact six-degree-of-freedom (6-dof) flexure exhibiting low hysteresis and stress relaxation, providing a consistent mapping between wrenches (forces and torques) applied to the flexure and its 6-dof displacement; ?(2) visual estimation of the 6-dof flexure displacement by the embedded camera, with a target resolution of better than 100 microns in linear displacement; (3) bench tests of flexure displacement sensing, wrench sensing, and contact location sensing, using our custom 5-dof stress-strain test robot, which provides ground-truth force sensing resolution of better than 0.01 N and motion resolution of better than 1 micron (linear) and 0.001 degrees (angular); and (4) initial validation of the utility of the sensor for dexterous manipulation in single-finger tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tactile sensing can dramatically improve the dexterity of robot hands.  Consider trying to insert a key into a lock when your hands are cold or you are wearing thick gloves.  The lack of tactile sensation makes the task much harder.   Current commercially-available tactile sensors are expensive and provide only coarse tactile feedback.  To address the need for better tactile sensing for robot hands, this project developed a novel tactile-sensing robot fingertip, called the Visiflex, that is compliant (responds to forces by displacing) and senses the contact locations and 6-axis forces and torques applied at the fingertip.  The built-in compliance is easily modified by replacing a flexure as appropriate to the task, and the compliance allows the robot fingers to interact stably and safely with rigid or delicate objects.  The sensor element is a small and inexpensive commercial camera, similar to a cell phone camera.  The Visiflex is capable of sensing multiple contacts on the fingertip with a location accuracy well below 1 mm and average force errors less than 0.1 Newtons. The project also provided new insights into how to design six-degree-of-freedom flexures, i.e., flexures that yield in six motion directions (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw) in response to three forces and three torques.  Such flexures are key building blocks of soft robots, micromachines, and other mechanical systems.   Ongoing research is directed toward enabling a robot hand equipped with multiple Visiflex tactile sensors to perform dexterous in-hand manipulation. This project supported training opportunities for a PhD student and several undergraduate and masters students.
