<AbstractNarration>Depletion of nonrenewable energy resources, climate change, environmental pollution, and population growth are creating global challenges, whose solution heavily depends on the development of sustainable manufacturing technologies. This grant is to provide travel support for US-based faculty and students to attend The Fifth International Conference on Sustainable Chemical Product and Process Engineering, Tianjin, China, June 30-July 3, 2019. This international conference has a focus on chemical manufacturing technologies that promote both energy and environmental sustainability. The organizing committee, which consists of distinguished researchers with a broad range of skills in chemical process systems and reaction engineering, will provide for a vibrant and diverse atmosphere that fosters exchange of ideas on research and education. It is anticipated that approximately 20 US-based researchers will receive partial travel support to attend this conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meeting the world's demands for energy, food, water, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals in a sustainable manner while protecting the environment will be key topics of this conference. The US participants will have the opportunity to network with leading researchers from China and the rest of the world and exchange ideas about the state of the art in research and education in this important field.  The main objectives of the Conference are: (i) to share knowledge and research experience in studying economic, environmental and social sustainability, (ii) to assess the state-of-the-art in sustainable chemical product and process engineering, (iii) to bridge the gap between research and development, strengthening the linkage between academia and industries, (iv) to discuss research directions for the chemical and allied industries to move towards sustainability and educational approaches for the integration of industrial sustainability into chemical engineering curriculum, and (v) to explore opportunities for international collaboration in various technical areas. The organizers plan to encourage faculty researchers as well as graduate/undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to participate and receive partial travel support from this grant. Participation in the conference will be especially beneficial to the young US-based researchers, who will have an opportunity to interact with experienced academic and industrial researchers in the field from around the world, which could positively influence their professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
