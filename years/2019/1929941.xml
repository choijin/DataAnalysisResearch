<AbstractNarration>This project funds a three day conference to be held August 14-16, 2019 at the University of Texas, Austin. The goal is to bring together researchers, stakeholders, and policy influencers to explore scientific themes around natural -engineered-human subsystems comprising Sustainable Urban Systems in semi-arid regions. The ideal outcome of the conference is a cohesive network of project proposals around the grand challenges of Sustainable Urban Systems. The conference will have presentations and breakout sessions and innovative activities of breakout sessions  mental models exercises, toolbox dialog initiative, and design thinking. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to improve urban sustainability which will save lives and economic losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference explores four themes: 1) Processes and Feedbacks, 2) Big Data, 3) Integrated Models, and 4) Co-Designed Research. While necessarily technical in nature, these conference sessions are designed to elucidate disparate and converging approaches to these themes within the context of holistically advancing cross-sector partnerships that engage the broadest range of participants, from citizen scientists and community organizers to sustainability professionals and elected policy makers. To support this approach, facilitated break-out sessions will use established system-modeling toolkits to delve deeper into discussions initiated during presentations to integrate ideas across theme topics. Improving transdisciplinary communication is an overarching goal, and the discussions will enhance scientific collaboration by developing a common research language and by measuring the degree of pre- and post-conference convergence among participants around their epistemic valuation of Sustainable Urban Systems Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Changing climate, rapid urbanization, and the projected increase in population of 2.5 billion humans over next 25 years has created a new socio-ecological paradigm. In order to achieve sustainability and maintain a habitable planet, we need to understand the complex relationships between humans, nature, and urban systems and the role that the data and emerging technologies may play in transforming these cities toward more preferred states in the face of these changes. &nbsp;Building resilience and actually achieving the transformation needed to address these challenges in rapidly growing cities in semi-arid regions poses unique challenges. It is in these regions where small changes in climate will drive much larger perturbations in the social-natural-engineered subsystems, with cascading effects that are not well understood or even predictable with current modeling and assessment tools in a way that is meaningful across a range of decision makers.</p> <p>Our conference was designed to close this knowledge gap by inviting a comprehensive discussion of the challenges that multiple semi-arid cities and communities are facing and by outlining a pathway to achieve research convergence in four primary themes, including Big Data, Integrated Modeling, processes and Feedbacks, and Co-production of Knowledge. The Sustainable Urban Systems conference entitled <em>Challenges to and Opportunities for Developing Resilience in Rapidly Growing Urban Corridors in Semi-Arid Regions</em>&nbsp;was held at the University of Texas at Austin on August 22-24, 2019. The conference comprised participants representing a geographical distribution of higher education institutions from Washington to Massachusetts (n=14; Figure 1). Non-academic professionals spanned non-profit organizations, regional water utilities, tech start-ups, urban design practitioners, energy providers, and environmental and sustainability offices. In total, 45 participants from 28 unique inter/trans-disciplinary backgrounds engaged in this conference.</p> <p>Three intensive, interactive workshops were held during the conference to maximize the generation of ideas and assess their convergence (Figure 2). Operating on the premise that the Urban-Rural interface is a complex and important boundary for a SUS, these workshops focused on:</p> <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defining the boundaries of Urban Systems, including the political, social, physical, and natural bounds, framing each as a function of systemic vulnerabilities.</p> <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examining cross-boundary flows of energy, water, food and other resources between Urban and Rural systems, culminating in a <em>Causal Loop Diagram</em> (CLD) for each group (Figure 3).</p> <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Layering into the CLDs the key stakeholders, their roles and relationships to each other, and then projecting systemic responses to the cascading effects of a catastrophic natural event such as a decade-long drought.</p> <p>One surprising outcome was that while the scientific drive for generalized solutions that are applicable to multiple urban systems is ideal, <em>each city system is unique and pilot solutions likely need to be highly specific to local conditions. </em>Another challenge that arose during workshops and panel discussions was that participants found that definitions of terms like <em>sustainability</em> and <em>resilience</em> can be discipline specific, and therefore require efforts to incorporate a unified lexicon to describe SUS science.</p> <p>Several important themes and numerous research questions emerged from the surveys and workshops. These were distilled into four primary categories, with scientific questions that participants felt were eminently addressable under a convergent SUS research agenda. These themes and some representative research questions include:</p> <p><strong>Theme 1: Urban-external entity relationships. </strong><em>Hypothesis: Urban systems are inextricably linked to the larger ecosystems, watersheds, and populations that provide resources to urban centers.</em></p> <ul> <li>How do these feedbacks and features change across spatial and temporal scales? To what extent do outcomes differ across scales and within systems?

In total, 45 participants from 28 unique inter/trans-disciplinary backgrounds engaged in this conference.  Three intensive, interactive workshops were held during the conference to maximize the generation of ideas and assess their convergence (Figure 2). Operating on the premise that the Urban-Rural interface is a complex and important boundary for a SUS, these workshops focused on:  1.     Defining the boundaries of Urban Systems, including the political, social, physical, and natural bounds, framing each as a function of systemic vulnerabilities.  2.     Examining cross-boundary flows of energy, water, food and other resources between Urban and Rural systems, culminating in a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) for each group (Figure 3).  3.     Layering into the CLDs the key stakeholders, their roles and relationships to each other, and then projecting systemic responses to the cascading effects of a catastrophic natural event such as a decade-long drought.  One surprising outcome was that while the scientific drive for generalized solutions that are applicable to multiple urban systems is ideal, each city system is unique and pilot solutions likely need to be highly specific to local conditions. Another challenge that arose during workshops and panel discussions was that participants found that definitions of terms like sustainability and resilience can be discipline specific, and therefore require efforts to incorporate a unified lexicon to describe SUS science.  Several important themes and numerous research questions emerged from the surveys and workshops. These were distilled into four primary categories, with scientific questions that participants felt were eminently addressable under a convergent SUS research agenda. These themes and some representative research questions include:  Theme 1: Urban-external entity relationships. Hypothesis: Urban systems are inextricably linked to the larger ecosystems, watersheds, and populations that provide resources to urban centers.  How do these feedbacks and features change across spatial and temporal scales? To what extent do outcomes differ across scales and within systems? Is there a balance in resilient, sustainable urban systems that integrates both the local and the global?   Theme 2: Co-design of Research and Co-production of Knowledge. Hypothesis: Building a successful SUS research agenda is predicated on comprehensive collaboration between researchers and stakeholders.   What factors motivate participants of different backgrounds (e.g., researchers, policy makers, residents, youth, minorities etc.) to become involved and to remain involved in these efforts?   Theme 3: Integration of Social/Physical Modeling and Observations. Hypothesis: Projections of future scenarios are essential for providing decision makers with actionable information for fostering a sustainable future of urban systems.  What advances are needed to integrate physical and social models comprising changes in climate, hydrology, economics, public health, population, agriculture, transportation, and the growth of cities?   Theme 4: Governance of Sustainable Urban Systems. Hypothesis: Understanding unique governance challenges and opportunities is essential to attaining SUS.  What are the behavioral, political, and other social barriers to (and opportunities for) designing effective governance systems and processes to enhance societal cooperation and coordination?   We believe that achieving true urban resilience and sustainability requires an unprecedented convergence amongst researchers, stakeholders, and decision makers from all disciplinary backgrounds. We thank the National Science Foundation for this opportunity to convene an intrepid group of like-minded citizens to draft a research agenda that addresses the grand challenges of rapidly growing urban centers in uncertain future climate regimes.
