<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the principles of how ions move into lithium-ion battery electrodes is crucial in making reliable and safe batteries that store energy by storing lithium. However, big knowledge gaps remain in the understanding of how these principles apply to other ions such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium; all of these ions are crucial components of exciting next-generation batteries. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program at NSF, introduces ultra-thin electrodes, which are composed of a few atom-thick flat layers of carbon, so-called few-layer graphene (FLG), as a platform for identifying problems during the storage of a broad range of ions. Because FLG is so thin, experiments can be performed very quickly. On this project researchers use techniques for seeing through FLG easily, and perform reliable quantum calculations mimicking their behavior. This allows them to swiftly evaluate ion storage performance and to learn fundamental principles impacting battery systems at large. This project aligns to NSF's mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing national prosperity by creating new knowledge on strategic materials for energy storage, such as batteries. This helps the USA to remain at the forefront of science. In order to contribute towards these greater objectives, the PI and co-PI, both identifying with Hispanic communities, offer programs that enrich and make a positive impact on student's learning and scientific life. This is achieved by providing direct educational and research opportunities to undergraduate and K-12 audiences through laboratory experiences and training, and through computational and social media resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program at NSF,  is to address challenges in the fundamental understanding of interfacial phenomena faced during ion intercalation on graphitic hosts. While several studies have addressed lithium intercalation kinetics and mechanisms, comparatively fewer have done so on other alkali ions, anions, and multivalent cations. The scope of this project is to use a versatile platform consisting of few-layer graphene (FLG) electrodes which enable high-fidelity, fast, and efficient electrochemistry to address this knowledge gap in a timely manner. FLG electrodes improve experimental throughput with true interfacial selectivity, allowing to swiftly identify and overcome interfacial kinetic barriers. Studies are complemented with insightful compositional analysis, in situ characterization, and robust quantum simulation methods for providing a deep understanding of the intercalation process. This project generates knowledge on the impact of heteroatom surface modification and ion co-intercalation on the kinetics and mechanisms of ion insertion for next generation batteries in an accelerated manner. The identification of PI and co-PI with Hispanic audiences and other underrepresented minority groups helps preparing them to tackle future challenges in energy technologies through demonstrations, laboratory experiences, and social media tools. This project aligns to NSF's mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing national prosperity by providing fundamental understanding of strategic materials for energy storage, creating transformative knowledge for allowing the USA to remain at the forefront of science, and contributing to NSF's 10 Big Ideas by growing convergence research through interdisciplinarity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
