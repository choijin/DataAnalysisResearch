<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovations Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve access to digital content by the vision impaired community. This access will improve the quality of life for the vision impaired as well as improve the probability of employment. Multiple studies have shown a connection between Braille literacy and employment rates. Creating a tactile display not only improves access to digital media through braille usage, but also allows several new paths to interact with digital content, including through maps, vertical math and graphical images currently not accessible with existing devices. Our research into a new cell creates a basic building block for new graphical tactile displays. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project targets the problem of creating a low cost and refreshable tactile display cell for the use by the vision impaired. The objective is to design, fabricate and test a series of tactile display cells and then perform a merit evaluation for both usability by the vision impaired and for scaling into low cost production.  This research will draw on technology under development for computer display Braille cells, and then modify these designs for use in tactile displays. Samples will be produced based on multiple designs and evaluated for technical and economic merit. The end goal will be to demonstrate tactile display cells which are practical for use by vision impaired, allowing access to graphical information via digital media for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Beacon Street demonstrated modular braille cells using an electro-magnetic effect that will be used to manufacture 2D displays for tablets and computers for the vision impaired.  This technology will replace the incumbent piezo-electric technology which has been in use for decades and is limited to single line displays.  The Beacon Street modular braille cell can be mass produced using automated production tools and therefore can reach economies of scale at a reduction in cost of the incumbent technology.  Beacon Street researched numerous designs for actuation of the braille dots and evaluated them for ease of integration into displays and for assembly efficiency.  The project resulted in a live demonstration of a practical 2x10 array and a roadmap to use such cells in practical 2D braille enabled computer applications in the next 2-3 years.      Beacon Streetâ€™s technology will serve a tremendous social need to the roughly 1.3 million legally blind Americans who are chronically under-employed and continuously fall further behind society as our economy and culture grows evermore internet and data centric. Less than 10% of blind Americans are braille readers which is a tremendous drop from the 1950s in which literacy was over 50%.  This lack of literacy has led to unemployment rates of over 70% and results in the need for public assistance at a cost of hundreds of millions U.S. dollars per year. It is the goal of Beacon Street to improve braille literacy through our innovative, modular braille cell technology, and hence enable the blind to live independently with greater self-sufficiency.  Not only will modular braille cells improve literacy, this technology will also allow vision-impaired persons to have access to 2D graphical information as well.  This will allow the vision impaired "to see" graphical information such as maps, mathematics, chemistry, etc. for the first time.  It is our goal to commercialize this technology to improve multiple facets of the lives of the vision impaired.             Last Modified: 02/08/2021       Submitted by: Doug Cohen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
