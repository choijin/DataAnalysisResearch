<AbstractNarration>This is a Travel Award to enable anthropologist Dr. James Holland Jones (Stanford University) and a post-doctoral scholar working with Dr. Jones to participate in a workshop on behavioral risk modeling for pandemic prevention and response. The workshop is hosted by the National Science and Technology Council and the Pandemic Prediction and Forecasting Science and Technology (PPFST) Working Group, at the National Museum of Natural History. The workshop will address the role of human behavior in pandemic prevention and response. Understanding human behavior and its consequences for disease transmission dynamics is essential for effectively developing a national pandemic preparedness plan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human behavior is central to many aspects of the ecology and evolution of emerging infectious disease (EEID). Consequently, the contributions of social scientists to work on EEID are essential. This workshop will provide an opportunity to better integrate behavioral and social sciences with EEID and pandemic preparedness. Dr. Jones brings to the workshop a unique constellation of expertise in the behavioral sciences, social structure, and the ecology and evolutionary biology of infectious disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
