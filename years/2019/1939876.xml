<AbstractNarration>The science of catalysis drives the creation of novel materials called catalysts that make chemical transformations occur that would otherwise be difficult or impossible. Catalysts are perhaps best known in automobile catalytic converters to reduce pollution in automobile exhaust. Catalysts are used to produce a wide variety of products of societal importance such as fuels, textiles, plastics, food and pharmaceutical products to name a few. Catalysts are used to produce common chemicals such as gasoline, textiles, plastics, food and pharmaceutical products to name a few. It has been estimated that catalysis accounts for over 95% (by volume) of all products and over 80% of added value in the chemical industry. About one third of the world’s economy depends directly or indirectly on catalysis. Yet in spite of their immense importance, the development of new catalysts is still largely done by trial-and-error, and is therefore time-consuming and expensive.  A grand challenge of catalysis research is the precise design and controlled synthesis of catalytic structures. Discoveries which transform catalyst synthesis from an art to a science will serve to enhance the productivity, energy efficiency and economic impact of a very broad industry base that involves the conversion of raw materials into finished products through chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Rational Catalyst Synthesis (CeRCaS) is the world’s first and only research center with the focus on understanding the chemical fundamentals of catalyst synthesis.  CeRCaS brings to bear powerful, complementary expertise at the University of South Carolina and Virginia Commonwealth University, and in Phase II. CeRCaS research projects, which the industrial partners help develop, select and mentor, are in three thrusts. First, the Fundamentals of Metal Deposition including in-situ observation of metal deposition mechanisms and a variety of methods for nanoparticle genesis; second, Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Solid-Solid Bonding, using theory and experiment to allow prediction of the wetting or sintering of metal oxides on support surfaces, and prediction of the size, shape and, in the case of bimetallics, composition of supported nanoparticles; and third, Precision Site Synthesis for Specific Reactions, in which nanoparticles will be synthesized with specific size, content (single or multi-metals) and shape and so be optimized for particular reactions or to minimize the content of expensive precious metal ingredients. Graduate students will be actively mentored with a practical mindset. Educational outreach will include the active recruitment and eventual industrial placement of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
