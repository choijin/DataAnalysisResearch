<AbstractNarration>The Western Algebraic Geometry Symposium (WAGS) is a series of biannual conferences in the field of algebraic geometry. This award supports six WAGS conferences which will be held at University of Utah on November 2-3, 2019, at Pomona College in Spring 2020, at Stanford in Fall 2020, at University of Colorado in Spring 2021, at University of Washington in Fall 2021, at UCLA in Spring 2022. (While the first two locations are established, some variation in location may happen as a consequence of unforeseen circumstances.) Algebraic geometry is a central subject in mathematics, with deep and substantial connections to almost every aspect of modern mathematics: besides its central role in fundamental research, several recent applications of algebraic geometry (to robotics, big data, machine learning, financial mathematics etc) have made its contributions to society at large more immediate and visible. This broad and active field is widely represented in the Western United States. The primary goal of WAGS is to foster knowledge and communication among members of the algebraic geometry community in the western part of the United States; particular attention is given to fostering an equitable and inclusive environment where all members of the algebraic geometry community can find stimulus and support in pursing excellence in their mathematical activity. Information about the conference series may be found at www.wagsymposium.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For almost twenty years WAGS has served as a catalyst for the development of algebraic geometry in the Western region of the United States. The collaboration between Cascini,  Hacon and McKernan that lead to massive progress in the minimal model program was born through interactions at WAGS. At WAGS Bertram was first exposed to Bridgeland stability conditions, which are now an important aspect of his research activity. Several young researchers, including the PI of this grant, found their PhD thesis problem or benefited from interactions with senior mathematicians at WAGS. Graduate students on the job market have had the occasion to present their work in WAGS poster sessions. Besides continuing the excellent work that has been done, WAGS is seeking to enlarge and improve its scope: besides selecting excellent researchers and communicators as speakers, we endeavor to give a broad representation of both areas of algebraic geometry and of speakers; besides poster sessions, we want to introduce capsule talks and panels to aid the development of younger mathematicians; in particular we are seeking to devote the first afternoon of the conference to some activity organized by and for graduate students, as a way to give junior mathematician ownership of part of the conference with a minimal organizational burden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
