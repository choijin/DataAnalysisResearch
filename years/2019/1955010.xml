<AbstractNarration>The field of advanced manufacturing is being transformed by the integration of automation with digital data exchange.  This integration of physical and digital systems is often called, Industry 4.0.  Examples of Industry 4.0 technologies include Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, and Cloud Computing. This project is designed to help meet the rising need for highly skilled workers who are ready for employment in Mechatronics and Industry 4.0. The College’s South Georgia service area is home to more than 150 manufacturing companies.  Current industry partners include Polar Beverages, Kelly Manufacturing Company, Campbell Scientific, NextEra Energy, Dillard’s Distribution, Letica Corporation, BASF, and Innotek. To operate and maintain modern manufacturing facilities, these companies need technicians who have Industry 4.0 skills. Coupled with this growing demand for Industry 4.0-competent technicians, there is a shortage of faculty who can teach Industry 4.0 concepts and skills. To meet the dual need for educators and workers, this project plans to: 1) build on an existing mechatronics program to develop a new Mechatronics – Industry 4.0 degree that can produce workforce-ready technicians; 2) develop educational pathways from local high school mechatronics programs into the new Mechatronics – Industry 4.0 program; 3) support the teaching and learning of workplace Industry 4.0 competencies; and 4) increase program enrollment, especially of underrepresented student populations including female and Latinx students. A comprehensive evaluation will determine the impact of the project as well as make recommendations for modifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project intends to develop a pipeline of students from a high-school advanced manufacturing program into a college-level Mechatronics program that includes Industry 4.0 training. Using industry experts as co-teachers, professional development activities will provide college faculty with the necessary training and certifications needed to provide high quality education in Industry 4.0 concepts and skills. The project will develop blended-learning resources (i.e. in person and online) and generate insights into how a blended environment affects student learning. Anticipated outcomes of the project are an advanced mechatronics degree with an Industry 4.0 focus and articulated pathways in automated manufacturing from high schools to community and technical colleges. Anticipated benefits to industry partners include: 1) a steady stream of highly skilled, work-ready advanced manufacturing technicians; 2) a curriculum more reflective of industry needs; and 3) an opportunity to shape the educational future of students interested in advanced manufacturing as a career path. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
