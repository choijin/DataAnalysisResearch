<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports the acquisition of a powder X-ray diffractometer (PXRD) at Southeast Missouri State University, a primarily undergraduate university with a rural service region. The instrument will be housed and maintained in the Department of Chemistry and Physics while serving a broad community of users across a range of disciplines. PXRD allows researchers to analyze the structure of unknown materials and perform materials characterization in such fields as chemistry, metallurgy, mineralogy, forensic science, archeology, physics, and biological and pharmaceutical sciences. Combined with the existing single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) facility, which is in heavy use for research and undergraduate training, the PXRD will increase research productivity and student training opportunities in chemistry and physics. It will also engage non-traditional users in agriculture, geosciences, historic preservation, and anthropology. The equipment will be used for research training in both faculty-mentored and course-based undergraduate research, the latter being an equitable and inclusive gateway to broader STEM participation. Incorporating PXRD techniques commonly used in industry and academic research will prepare students for careers and graduate school. PXRD will also be used in STEM courses for K-12 teachers and education majors, providing them with research experience they can share with their students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PXRD is a leading technique for the rapid, non-destructive analysis of the chemical and internal structural identity of a sample and complements the SCXRD capabilities available at the institution. While SCXRD requires a tiny, homogeneously pure single crystal and several hours for data collection and analysis, PXRD uses a bulk, multicrystalline sample that may not be homogenously pure, and a scan can be completed in minutes with pattern matching against a standard library to provide rapid identification. The properties of molecules and materials are exquisitely dependent upon the structural arrangements of the atoms that make up these systems. These structural arrangements are readily studied using XRD techniques. In synthetic applications, PXRD provides evidence that the bulk sample is homogeneously pure and allows a researcher to proceed confidently with other characterization such as SCXRD, magnetic or electrical measurements, thermal analysis, catalysis, or spectroscopy. The technique is also suitable for studying the structure of non-crystalline materials such as thin films and amorphous solids. Additionally, PXRD provides a means of rapid identification of the chemical identity of heterogeneous or mixed samples from the field, such as soil composition for agriculture, mineral composition for geosciences, or building material composition for historic preservation. Existing projects supported by the PXRD include 1) the preparation and development of novel magnetic materials, such as multifunctional, magnetocaloric, and hard magnetic materials, 2) the activity and stability of heterogeneous oxygen evolution electrocatalysts operating in low pH conditions or in the presence of a magnetic field, and 3) the synthesis and structural characterization of hybrid organic/metal halide compounds that exhibit thermochromism, polymorphism, and interesting magnetic properties. The PXRD and SCXRD facilities together will promote structural science in an underserved region and enable mutually beneficial collaborations with neighboring universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
