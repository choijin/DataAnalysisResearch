<AbstractNarration>All of us are aware that the computing revolution has changed our world in profound ways over the past several decades, but many desired applications of computing -- of great potential importance and utility -- are simply beyond the capabilities of today's computer systems. This is because for many central problems in computer science, the fastest known computer programs that can solve these problems have running time or storage requirements that scale too quickly with increasing input sizes (exponentially as opposed to linearly or polynomially); even worse, it is widely believed that faster programs for today's conventional computer systems simply cannot exist. Quantum computing offers the possibility of a new and dramatically different approach. The key premise is that by harnessing quantum mechanical properties, in certain settings it is possible for a quantum computer to simultaneously process an exponentially large number of superimposed states, and thus (in some sense) to perform parallel operations over an enormous search space in a way that is simply impossible for classical computers. Motivated by this exciting possibility, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Columbia University (SEAS) has launched the "Columbia Quantum Initiative," an ambitious multi-year plan to develop a center of excellence at Columbia University spanning multiple aspects of quantum science and technology, leveraging the long-standing world-class research and educational programs at Columbia University on closely related topics. A central goal of the Quantum Initiative is to recruit a half dozen or more tenured/tenure-track faculty over the next few years whose primary research interests are in the areas of quantum computing, communication, sensing, materials, devices and technologies, and a near-term goal of the Quantum Initiative is to hire two tenured/tenure-track faculty members in the area of quantum computing. As part of the Quantum Initiative, this award will enable the creation of a tenured/tenure-track position for a faculty member with research specialization in quantum computing, either in the Computer Science Department or as an interdisciplinary joint hire between Computer Science and a second department such as Applied Physics/Applied Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, or Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A core Computer Science hire is necessary to provide a solid base of expertise in key computational aspects of quantum technology such as quantum algorithms, quantum programming methodologies, and quantum computer architectures, while an interdisciplinary hire will play a key bridging role in ensuring that the entire team of electrical engineers, applied physicists, researchers from other domains, and quantum computing researchers comprising the Quantum Initiative can work together effectively. The addition of quantum computing faculty to the intellectual ecosystem at Columbia SEAS will greatly expand educational offerings to train students at Columbia University in a range of subjects relevant to the development of quantum technologies. Such technologies have the potential to have broad, as-yet unforeseen impacts on many aspects of science and society. With its large population of outstanding students in Computer Science and associated subject areas, there is great potential for significant broader impact through education via faculty growth in quantum computing at Columbia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
