<AbstractNarration>There is an increasing body of evidence that quantum mechanical behavior plays non-trivial roles in certain biological functions.  Examples range from photosynthesis in plants to magnetoreception in animals.  Incorporating quantum and other non-classical behaviors found in living systems opens the possibility of creating novel, non-traditional biosensing technologies that can sense beyond our current detection capabilities to monitor our surroundings.  Johns Hopkins University (with support from also the Air Force Office of Scientific Research) is to convene a 2-day workshop entitled "Getting a Deeper Sense for Non-Classical Sensing", which will explore the opportunities and challenges of this nascent field.  This workshop is a follow up to the Non-Classical Behaviors in Biological Functions: Potential for Smart Sensing Workshop held Arlington, VA on April 12-13, 2018.  The findings of the workshop will be disseminated and accessible to the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in sensor technology has been long focused on transduction platforms based on "classical" chemical, electromagnetic, and mechanical modalities.  Despite the fact that many of these sensor platforms have been successfully deployed, alternatives sensors systems based on non-classical (e.g., quantum) modalities should be explored and developed.  The exploration at the intersection of non-classical behavior in biology and smart sensing can be used to understand new phenomena in nature as well as offer new opportunities for monitoring living system interactions with its environment.  It is, thus, highly desired to have a more interactive discussion on integrative quantum and other non-classical phenomena in biology and smart sensing.  The overarching goals of this workshop are to assemble a group of diverse, world-class scientific leaders to: (1) review the progress to date in the field; (2) explore advanced tools and techniques need to identify novel quantum biology behavior and other non-classical phenomena; (3) identify challenges and potential approaches for the incorporation of non-classical behavior appearing in smart sensors; and (4) develop a community to share ideas, resources, and technologies to address challenges identified through the workshop as well as to educate and train the next generation of researchers in this area.  Led by leading scholars and researchers, the workshop consists of a series of panels (invited short presentations) followed by in-depth discussions with all the participants.  The output will be a workshop report that will be accessible to the public on a website and as a published report.  While there has been increasing number of workshops and symposia in quantum biology, the proposed workshop probes more deeply into issues relating toward the implementation of measuring/detecting such quantum phenomena in biology.  We expect that this workshop will initiate and stimulate the discussion on integrating quantum and other non-classical effects in biology with smart sensing and initiating research toward potential impactful and timely quantum technology needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "Getting a Deeper Sense for Non-Classical Sensing" workshop was held at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) School of Advanced International Studies in Washington D.C. on September 23-24, 2019.  The workshop brought together a group of world-class scientific leaders, their trainees, and government officials from around the globe to review key findings and progress, as well as new technologies, techniques, and approaches, in the study of non-classical behavior/sensing and its effects on biological function.  Non-classical sensing can occur across multiple length scales and potentially involves collective behavior, which allows for deriving better sensing capabilities from emergent properties in the group rather than an individual entity.  This nascent field of study may allow for potential breakthroughs in understanding and unprecedented control of biological function and other processes for new applications.  Moreover, the workshop identified gaps and particularly highlighted several potential application areas including understanding cancer and brain function.  The "Getting a Deeper Sense for Non-Classical Sensing" workshop was hosted by JHU through grant support by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) and the National Science (NSF) and in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  Furthermore, the workshop was a follow-on to the "Non-Classical Behaviors in Biological Functions: Potential for Smart Sensing" workshop, held in Arlington, Va. in April 2018 through support from AFOSR.   The workshop consisted of 40 participants, including 7 participants from overseas and 8 US government officials (4 current/former NSF officials, 2 AFOSR officals and 2 NIH officials).  From academia, 17 institutions (Binghamton University, Columbia University, Florida Institute of Technology, Florida International University, George Washington University, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Kent State University, Johns Hopkins University, Pennsylvania State University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Stanford University, University of Adelaide, University of Maryland College Park, University of Miami, University of Notre Dame, University of Toronto, and Virginia Tech University) represented all levels of faculty (senior and early career) and trainees (post-docs &amp; graduate students).  The 2-day workshop provided a forum for a group of world-class scientific leaders in academia and government from around the globe to examine non-classical behavior/sensing and its effects on biological function, which resulted in an open exchange of ideas and recommendations for moving the field forward and providing motivation for interdisciplinary global collaborations.  With the engagement of a broad and diverse group of researchers and government officials, participants had the opportunity to closely interact with leading thought leaders in the field in an informal setting think-tank style format.  Moreover, the unique opportunity to directly interact and hear related government programs from AFOSR, NIH and NSF program managers was valuable for these students, postdocs, and early-career investigators as they transition into their independent careers.
