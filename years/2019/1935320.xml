<AbstractNarration>This grant provides travel support for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to participate in the 15th US National Congress on Computational Mechanics (USNCCM XV) to be held in Austin, Texas, from July 28 to August 1, 2019. USNCCM has been the premier event of the U.S. Association for Computational Mechanics (USACM) since 1991. The biennial event attracts a wide international and US audience covering broad aspects of computational sciences, including topics of fluid mechanics and solid mechanics, computational mathematics, biology, manufacturing, materials science, nanotechnology and high-performance computing. The conference will be attended by researchers and professionals from industry, governmental laboratories, and academia. Through this grant, the students and post-doctoral researchers will be exposed to the state-of-the-art developments in computational sciences and mechanics. They will also be given opportunities to present their research as well as conduct networking for professional prospects. The organizing committee will make a concerted effort to encourage underrepresented minority students and postdocs to participate in the overall experience through travel awards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At USNCCM XV, the focus of the presentations will be on the development and applications of novel, state-of-the-art computational models and numerical methods in a wide variety of fields, including nanotechnology, materials, manufacturing, bioengineering, and geomechanics. Constitutive behavior, multiscale methods and multiphysics phenomena in these fields will be covered at substantial length through more than 70 mini-symposia that will be held. In a close alignment with NSF?s Big Idea on Harnessing the Data Revolution, the intersection of physics-based modeling and data-driven/machine learning approaches will be a major theme covered by 8 mini-symposia. More than 1000 presentations are expected to be delivered at the conference. The students and postdoctoral scholars supported by the grant will find opportunities to present their research as well as conduct networking. Two forums will be provided for the presentations: technical sessions and a poster contest. Additionally, a plenary panel discussion is also planned with representatives from academia, government laboratories, and industry for professional development and career advice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

A female reserchers working group held a meeting where Dr. Mary Wheeler discussed her career and accomplishments.  Dr. Wheeler was one of two female plenary speakers at the congress, along with Dr. Karen Willcox. An NSF information panel was held with widespead attendence.

Additionally, students were able to showcase their work through a poster competition and session, with posters on display in the main foyer/hallway of the convention center.  The travel support provided by this project were thus seen as being integral to ensuring broad participation by students at arguably the premier Congress in their field.  The intellectual merit of this project was manifested in several ways.
