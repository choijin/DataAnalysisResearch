<AbstractNarration>The Conference on Biology and Medicine through Mathematics will take place on May 15-17, 2019, at Virginia Commonwealth University. The conference will feature recent developments in the broad areas of mathematical biology and medicine. The conference will: (1) be a regional mathematical biology conference that promotes junior investigators that range from students, postdoctoral fellows, to junior faculty; (2) give visibility to a wide range of applications and methods in mathematical biology; and (3) provide a stimulating environment for networking between junior and senior researchers, fostered by the size of the conference (approximately 100 attendees). Scientific research of the highest quality from four plenary speakers will be showcased. In addition, there will be a mix of plenary talks, break-out networking sessions, and a poster session. Travel support will be provided to junior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide an intimate conference environment with opportunities to present a poster or give a seminar talk to researchers at all levels. Junior researchers will directly benefit from these opportunities because the travel award funds will help promote attendance by junior presenters. Given the diversity of the research topics (that includes topics from Ecology, Evolution, Epidemiology, Medicine, Neuroscience and Fluid Dynamics), students relatively new to research will have the opportunity to attend talks from many subfields. Moreover, this conference is an excellent opportunity for undergraduate and master's students from VCU and other regional institutions. Participation of women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics and science will be especially encouraged and supported. More information about this conference can be found at https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/bamm/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

And finally, Nina Fefferman from the University of Tennessee presented on how the intermingling of mathematical modeling, epidemiological data, and social behavior help contain and treat viral epidemics (i.e., HIV/AIDS). We had about 70 attendees with 35 contributed talks and 14 posters to round out  the  conference.  Topics  ranged  from  disease  spread  dynamics, human  physiology,  to  cancer  dynamics,  cardiac system modeling, neuroscience, as well as ecology. Years ago we envisioned this as a local conference, but it has continued to  attract researchers from around the country (23 states represented), from undergraduate students on up.  Everyone participated in a networking coffee break (see photo) which had insightful conversations about career advancement among other topics. The poster session took place in VCU?s library event space and fostered further conversations and socializing (see photo). The goals of this conference were achieved: i) establish a regional biomathematics conference that promotes junior investigators (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty); ii) give visibility to a range of applications and methods in mathematical biology; iii) provide a stimulating environment for networking between junior and senior researchers. Thanks to the funding provided by the NSF, the organizers were able to support the travel expenses of 27 junior researchers composed of students (graduate and 1 undergraduate), post-doctoral fellows, and early career Assistant Professors.
