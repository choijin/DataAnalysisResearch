<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical section&lt;br/&gt;Synthetic biomaterials are of critical importance in developing innovative solutions for the repair of soft tissues, such as human cartilage, tendons, valves, and blood vessels. New polymer compositions and polymers with novel properties will precipitate rapid progress in medical device and tissue repair areas. Scientific advances, such as those described in this NSF sponsored research, will potentially lead to tangible improvement in the lives of millions of Americans suffering from osteoarthritis, and other diseases caused by soft tissue degradation. Furthermore, the outcomes will support US pharmaceutical device industries, which play an important role in medical polymers market. US companies have 45% share of a 300 B industry. NSF funding will be used to support undergraduate and graduate students, who will benefit from a cutting-edge interdisciplinary research and educational experience that encompasses training in biomaterials and polymer chemistry. Students will be encouraged to think independently and creatively while recognizing the importance of collaborating with other experts (e.g., materials scientists, pathologist, biomedical engineers, surgeons, entrepreneurs and patent lawyers). These activities will contribute to positive societal outcomes by fostering excitement for fundamental research while educating and training the next generation of academic research and biotechnology workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical section. &lt;br/&gt; Biomaterials are highly sought-after for the repair of soft tissues. However, there are limited solutions to the mechanical wear or failure of human cartilage, tendons, ligaments, sphincters, valves, and blood vessels, which can be caused by aging, disease, or injury. Consequently, there is significant need for new and innovative approaches to restore the material and functional properties of tissues using synthetic biomaterials. With NSF funding, the PI (Grinstaff) and his team will evaluate the performance of an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) formed between a synthetic hydrophilic biocompatible polymer and osteoarthritic cartilage tissue, as a case study. The synthetic polymer reinforces the tissue and acts like rebar steel in concrete to strengthen the material. Key preliminary data support this new idea and the proposed studies, well-characterized materials and rigorous experimental designs are established, and essential cross-disciplinary collaborations and expertise (biomaterials, tissue culture, biomechanics, etc.) are in place to accomplish the studies. This highly interdisciplinary and cutting-edge research will also prepare educated and trained undergraduate and graduate students for employment in industry and academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
