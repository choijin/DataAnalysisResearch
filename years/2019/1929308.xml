<AbstractNarration>This project helps support the participation of up to 20 US-based students in the 2019 IEEE Data Science Workshop (DSW), which will take place in Minneapolis, MN, during June 2-5, 2019. The DSW is a recently established annual conference of the IEEE Signal Processing Society, which offers a unique opportunity to its participants for sharing scientific discoveries related to various aspects of data science theory and applications. The event will gather researchers and practitioners from a gamut of data-driven disciplines, including learning, data mining, signal processing, optimization, statistics, and computing. It will bring together experts from Academia, Government, and Industry groups with interests on fundamentals and applications, as diverse as agriculture, personalized health and medicine, biology and physics, grid analytics, earth and the environment, education, finance and economics. Student participation in the 2019 IEEE DSW will contribute to the preparation of the next cadre of data-analytic engineering professionals. Ultimately, the vision is to further promote and leverage a Big Data research and development enterprise that will positively impact the society, economy and healthcare, along with consequent improvements in quality of life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students attending the 2019 IEEE DSW will benefit from a stimulating environment to learn about emerging research areas in data science, and to network with other researchers and leading academic and industrial experts in their research areas of interest. The conference will feature several events specifically designed to enhance student research experiences, including a student paper contest to recognize outstanding papers in which the primary author and presenter is a student. Through these travel awards, special efforts will be devoted to attract students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Out of the 46 graduate student participants in the IEEE DSW, 20 were supported thrugh the travel grants offered by this project. The travel grants were awarded competitively to graduate students from US universities who presented papers at the meeting. 8 of the student awardees are from groups traditionally underrepresnted in STEM (7 female, 1 Black or African American and 1 Hispanic or Latino). The provided travel support is an effective way to encourage graduate students from U.S. universities to participate in this international conference, and offer these students opportunities to exchange research ideas, advance their knowledge, and participate in the different special student activities. It will improve our graduate students' competitiveness in the global market.  Today?s students are tomorrow?s research leaders.
