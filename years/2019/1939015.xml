<AbstractNarration>In this NSF funded research, the principal investigator seeks to address fundamental challenges in the study of dynamical systems in general, and trajectories of a ball moving in polygons in particular.  Dynamical systems are mathematical objects which evolve in time, and they are ubiquitous in the applications of mathematics.  Whenever mathematics is used to predict the future, e.g. to predict the weather, the stock market, or the behavior of particles in a solution, a dynamical system is involved.  The dynamical systems in the real world, like those just mentioned, are often extraordinarily complex.  The principal investigator will study a simple class of dynamical systems modeled on ideal billiards in polygons with a view towards understanding the complicated dynamical systems that occur in applications.  The principal investigator will work to uncover and categorize the range of dynamical behaviors possible in billiard systems, and will continue his research exploring connections between billiards and the theory of numbers.  In addition, the principal investigator will continue his educational, mentoring, and outreach activities to promote the broader impacts of his work.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to address fundamental challenges in the study of dynamics on Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces. These subjects have connections with many areas of mathematics and important applications to the classification of mapping classes, the dynamics of rational maps and trajectories of a ball moving in polygons in polygons. Of particular importance are the special subvarieties of moduli space which are invariant under the geodesic flow.  Such subvarieties are rare and their origins are mysterious.  The principal investigator will pursue two lines of research. First, the principal investigator and his coauthors will give new constructions of special subvarieties.  Second, the principal investigator will investigate connections between special subvarieties and number theory, with the particular goal of understanding the arithmetic geometry of these spaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the course of the grant, the PI and his collaborators made several important discoveries in the field of dynamical systems, specifically concerning a class of polygons with optimal dynamics.  Dynamical systems are all around us.  They arise whenever we use mathematics to predict the future.  For instance, the stock market, the diffusion of particles in solution, and weather can all be mathematically modeled using dynamical systems.  Most of the dynamical systems that arise in the real world are extraordinarily complicated, and the long-term behavior of trajectories are difficult to classify.  While billiards systems, like more general dynamical systems, can be complicated, mathematicians have now known for decades that the dynamics certain polygons with optimal dynamics can be completely understood.  A ball set in motion along an idealized path in a polygon might return to its initial starting position and direction, and its trajectory is closed.  Another possibility is that the ball will chaotically visit every portion of the polygon.  While in most polygons, there are a host of exotic other possibilities, for polygons with optimal dynamics, these are the only two possibilities.   Polygons with optimal dynamics are like gems, exhibiting a surprising level of symmetry, and while a handful of constructions of these gems are known, a complete classification remains elusive.  The PI studies the algebraic and geometric properties of polygons with optimal dynamics.  During the course of this grant, the PI and his coauthors discovered several new types of polygons with optimal dynamics by studying quadrilaterals, as well as some quadrilaterals with other remarkable dynamical properties.  The PI also discovered mysterious algebraic resonances between the algebraic equations defining billiards with optimal dynamics, yielding interesting connections between these dynamical systems and arithmetic geometry.  These results were shared with the scientific community in two research papers, two international conference talks, and three seminar talks.  During the course of this grant, the PI also began new collaborations in genetics, exploring the role that structural variation plays in the inheritance of complex human traits.  He has contributed to two new papers on this topic, and a third paper concerning a project he is leading is in preparation and will be released as a preprint and submitted for publication shortly.  In addition to the scientific outcomes supported by this grant, the support afforded the PI the opportunity to continue his outreach efforts towards a broader impact.  He prepared and delivered talks aimed at undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics at Rice University.  He has aided in the mentorship of graduate students in his role as Instructor at Harvard Medical School.  The funding provided by the grant was critical for allowing the Math Corps, a summer camp for high school students at the University of Michigan, to successfully run in 2020.
