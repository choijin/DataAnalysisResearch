<AbstractNarration>The Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Annual Meeting will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from October 16-19, 2019, and anticipating over 4,500 participants. The meeting will feature 19 Program Tracks with the theme "Connecting Communities: Bioengineering Locally and Globally". The goal of the meeting is to encourage innovative learning that promotes inclusion from underrepresented populations within the biomedical engineering community, and opportunities that support research in both academia and industry. NSF funds will support networking and small group interactions and will promote increased knowledge of educational opportunities and pathways to success in biomedical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding for several competitive travel grant programs as well as professional development activities targeted at underrepresented groups and those that may not otherwise be able to participate in the conference. The competitive travel grant programs include: 12 students research awards, 40 career development awards for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, early career faculty and professionals from underrepresented populations in BME, including junior faculty; and 20 NSBE members interested in biomedical engineering. Additionally, funding is required for a High School Expo program for students from schools that might not have a STEM curriculum. Finally, funding from NSF will be used to support 15 high school students with chaperones in this activity. Over four days, the 2019 meeting will feature 19 Program Tracks with approximately 950 oral presentations and more than 2,000 poster presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
