<AbstractNarration>The goal of this workshop is to have a group of leading experts from government, industry, and academia with expertise covering microelectronics, semiconductor materials, wireless systems, internet-of-things (IoT), RF antennas and electromagnetic wave propagation, analog/mixed-signal processing, etc. to discuss how the RF/analog technologies in microelectronics and electromagnetics can advance the security of future communications and sensing. The workshop will focus on two main objectives: (1) Security vulnerability in RF/analog microelectronics and electromagnetics; (2) Secured Communications and Sensing by RF/analog microelectronics and electromagnetics. The outcome of the workshop will be a report on the needs and challenges in RF/analog-based security for future communication and sensing systems. The outcome of the workshop is expected to encourage researchers from different research communities to work together and explore opportunities for new security techniques in RF/analog hardware domain, which may lead to new avenues of important research. The two-day workshop will feature keynote talks, panel discussions, breakout sessions, and a wrap-up conclusion session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

There were three invited talks representing government, academia, and industry.  Jeremy Muldavin (who manages the Department of Defense Trusted and Assured Microelectronics Initiative) gave an excellent talk on the challenges of modern-day security issues and the opportunity to use RF/analog microelectronic and electromagnetic techniques to address them.  Harry Lee from MIT presented the latest research on analog/mixed-signal circuit techniques to combat security vulnerability on semiconductor chip?s power management system.  Miroslav Knezevic from NXP talked about the security issues in various wireless products and the existing methods to address these issues.   In addition, a large number of security loopholes and associated research needs were identified by the workshop attendees during the panel discussions and the working group sessions.

Some attendees who have worked on hardware security for a few years felt excited to see renewed interest for this research area especially the focus on RF/analog techniques in microelectronics and electromagnetics versus traditional digital techniques. Through the working group discussions on the workshop, the following areas are identified to be the ones in which more research is needed  Benchmarks and metrics for RF/Analog security measures for assessing the security strength with different attacker models. Built-in self-identification-and-detection functions to achieve early analysis of counterfeit and malicious insertions, such as RF/Analog PUF and Trojan detection. Development of RF/Analog crypto engines to protect the signals and detection/prevention methods to counter side channel attacks Heterogeneous integration in RF components for increased robustness against electronic attacks. Anti-reverse-engineering and anti-tampering electronic materials and devices. Anti-spoofing using material/device inherent properties Detection of attacks and alterations with both self-attestation devices and advanced analysis tools.   Development of arrays and signal processing for spatial selectivity in radar and wireless communications Built-in radar and lidar self-calibration and testing to detect spoofing and jamming Development of radar and lidar waveforms that are tolerant to jamming and spoofing Millimeter-wave and terahertz MIMO and high-directivity beamforming technologies Radio-frequency physically unclonable functions Efficient spectrum sensing and adaptive filtering        Last Modified: 01/27/2021       Submitted by: Ruonan Han]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
