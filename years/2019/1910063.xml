<AbstractNarration>The resilience of a network is generally defined as its ability to continue performing well when it is subject to failures &lt;br/&gt;and attacks. Designing and developing graph analysis algorithms that are robust against missing data, incomplete network &lt;br/&gt;observation, or errors in data collection is essential in many real-world applications. One fundamental and important class &lt;br/&gt;of graph analysis methods are those that find the dense regions in a given network.  These methods have applications in &lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics, social network analysis, router network monitoring, visualization, and other areas. Core decomposition, &lt;br/&gt;a powerful and efficient algorithm for finding dense subgraphs, has been proven to be extremely useful in understanding &lt;br/&gt;the structure of complex networks from a variety of domain. However, it is notoriously non-robust against small changes in the network structure. This project will explore and characterize the robustness of core decomposition process and develop attack (and corresponding defense) &lt;br/&gt;strategies to manipulate the network to hinder the core decomposition analysis. The outcome of this research will allow &lt;br/&gt;for increased understanding of the accuracy core decomposition analyses on real-world networks, and propose new, related &lt;br/&gt;decompositions that are more robust against noise or missing data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be performed in three parts: 1) Exploring and characterizing the robustness of core decomposition to develop a variety of techniques and metrics to quantify the robustness, 2) Developing graph modification 'attack' strategies to tamper with a network's core structure by &lt;br/&gt;adding/deleting nodes or edges -- the project considers three types of attacks: those targeting nodes' core numbers, the subgraphs &lt;br/&gt;induced by the core decomposition, and the hierarchy induced by the core decomposition, 3) Developing corresponding strategies&lt;br/&gt; to defend against the attacks on a network's core structure. Given the wide application space of core decomposition, this project&lt;br/&gt; will increase the robustness of algorithms for describing the hierarchical structure of a network, detecting central nodes,&lt;br/&gt; spotting the anomalies, and speeding up algorithms for other tasks, like community detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
