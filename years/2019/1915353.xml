<AbstractNarration>This project will provide funding for students from U.S. institutions of higher learning to attend the 2019 Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet-of-Things Week (CPS-IoT Week 2019) in Montreal, Canada during April 15-18, 2019. CPS-IoT Week (previously known as CPSWeek) is the premier conference for Cyber-Physical Systems research, and is comprised of five flagship conferences in CPS, namely ICCPS (International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems), RTAS (Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium), IPSN (Information Processing in Sensor Networks), HSCC (Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control) and IoTDI (Internet of Things Design and Implementation). In addition to these 5 conferences, there are 11 confirmed workshops and demonstrations that permit papers to be submitted and presented by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon, the seamless integration of computation and physical components. Advances in CPS will enable capability, adaptability, scalability, resiliency, safety, security, and usability that will expand the horizons of these critical systems. CPS technologies are transforming the way people interact with engineered systems, just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. Travel support to this conference for today's graduate students and postdoctoral researchers enables broad participation by tomorrow's researchers in this interdisciplinary field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The event provided the participants an opportunity to learn about the field, present their research, and engage with other established and peer researchers for professional development. The project also contributed to increased diversity among the attendees at the conference: many of the awardees are from among minority groups and some institutions are Hispanic Serving Institutions. The CPS IoT Week 2019 included five conferences, 13 workshops, two tutorials, two competitions, and one PhD forum. The conference also included keynotes from established researchers from the US and abroad. Thus the conference provided ample opportunity to the participants to gain exposure to the diverse set of topics in the field.
