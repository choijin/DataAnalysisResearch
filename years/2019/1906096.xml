<AbstractNarration>Technologies that rely on and exploit the quantum properties of light and matter are touted as the next phase&lt;br/&gt;of the modern industrial revolution. Light has become the preferred medium for information transfer in&lt;br/&gt;quantum technologies due to its high speed and exceptional noise properties, with single photons acting as&lt;br/&gt;the most basic building blocks. However, the realization of robust, device-compatible, room-temperature&lt;br/&gt;single photon sources that can be activated and controlled on demand has been a major hurdle. Although&lt;br/&gt;there have been different material systems that have shown single photon emission, they operate at low&lt;br/&gt;temperature or at incompatible wavelengths, and are often hard to integrate with conventional photonic&lt;br/&gt;materials or CMOS technology. To address this challenge, this project aims to develop single photon&lt;br/&gt;emitters based on cavity-coupled van der Waals (vdW) materials. Specifically, the program will focus on&lt;br/&gt;hexagonal boron nitride, a wide bandgap semiconductor that can host optically active point defects with&lt;br/&gt;emission in the visible and near infra-red. Combining defect engineering and "pick-and-place" techniques,&lt;br/&gt;the project will develop a range of light-confining hybrid structures designed to enhance light collection&lt;br/&gt;and light emission from single photon emitters as well as increase the strength of light-matter interaction.&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal is to develop the key building blocks for realizing quantum photonic devices based&lt;br/&gt;on vdW materials.&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The development of quantum photonic technologies that can operate at elevated temperatures, are CMOS&lt;br/&gt;compatible, and can be integrated with conventional photonics is highly desirable. This project addresses&lt;br/&gt;precisely this need through the use of monolayer or few-layer vdW materials integrated with silicon&lt;br/&gt;nitride photonic platforms where we exploit the unique strengths of the two material systems. vdW&lt;br/&gt;materials are a highly attractive platform for active components in quantum photonics due their large&lt;br/&gt;light-mater interaction strength, compatibility with a variety of substrates, and pick-and-place fabrication&lt;br/&gt;techniques. In particular, hexagonal boron nitride has a wide bandgap (6 eV), which allows for a broadly&lt;br/&gt;accessible spectral range and mid gap defect states. Furthermore, owing to the few-layer vdW structure,&lt;br/&gt;these systems show extreme susceptibility to strain and the dielectric environment, which will be&lt;br/&gt;exploited to control defect activation and integration with nanophotonic structures such as microresonators&lt;br/&gt;and waveguides. Silicon nitride, already recognized as an excellent material for passive&lt;br/&gt;photonic devices due to its low loss and mature fabrication protocols will form the platform for realizing&lt;br/&gt;the quantum photonic chips. Specific program goals include: (i) Deterministic engineering of defect&lt;br/&gt;states in hBN for single photon emission, and (ii) Integration of emitters into micro-resonators and hybrid&lt;br/&gt;cavity systems for enhancing spontaneous emission and achieving the strong coupling regime.&lt;br/&gt;The program will help train students from diverse backgrounds in the emerging interdisciplinary field of&lt;br/&gt;quantum optoelectronics. A highlight among the planned outreach activities is a hands-on quantum&lt;br/&gt;technologies workshop for undergraduate students at City College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
