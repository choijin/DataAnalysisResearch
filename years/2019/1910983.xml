<AbstractNarration>Many applications in the real world, such as online &lt;br/&gt;shopping, recommendation, social media and information &lt;br/&gt;security, involve interactions among different &lt;br/&gt;entities. For example, online shopping behaviors can &lt;br/&gt;be simply described by the interactions between &lt;br/&gt;customers, commodities and shopping web sites. These &lt;br/&gt;interactions are naturally represented by tensors, &lt;br/&gt;which are arrays of multiple dimensions. Each &lt;br/&gt;dimension represents a type of entities (e.g., &lt;br/&gt;customers or commodities), and each element describes &lt;br/&gt;a particular interaction (e.g, purchased/not &lt;br/&gt;purchased). The project aims to develop flexible and &lt;br/&gt;efficient tensor decomposition approaches that can &lt;br/&gt;discover a variety of complicated relationships &lt;br/&gt;between the entities in tensors, handle a tremendous &lt;br/&gt;amount of data from practical applications, and adapt &lt;br/&gt;to rapid data growth. The developed approaches can be &lt;br/&gt;used to promote many important prediction and &lt;br/&gt;knowledge discovery tasks, such as improving the &lt;br/&gt;recommendation accuracy, predicting advertisement &lt;br/&gt;click rates, understanding how misinformation propagation &lt;br/&gt;through social media, and detecting malicious cell- &lt;br/&gt;phone apps. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the success of the existing tensor &lt;br/&gt;decomposition approaches, they use multilinear &lt;br/&gt;decomposition forms or shallow kernels, and are &lt;br/&gt;incapable of capturing highly complicated &lt;br/&gt;relationships in data. However, complex and nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;relationships, effects and patterns are ubiquitous, &lt;br/&gt;due to the diversity and complexity of the practical &lt;br/&gt;applications. Furthermore, there is a lack of &lt;br/&gt;efficient, scalable nonlinear decomposition algorithms &lt;br/&gt;to handle static tensors nowadays at unprecedented &lt;br/&gt;scales, and dynamic tensors that grow fast and &lt;br/&gt;continuously. The project aims to develop scalable &lt;br/&gt;deep Bayesian tensor decomposition approaches that &lt;br/&gt;maximize the flexibility to capture all kinds of &lt;br/&gt;complex relationships, efficiently process static data &lt;br/&gt;at unprecedented scales and rapid data streams, and &lt;br/&gt;provide uncertainty quantification for both embedding &lt;br/&gt;estimations and predictions. The research will be &lt;br/&gt;accomplished through: (1) the design of new Bayesian &lt;br/&gt;tensor decomposition models that incorporate deep &lt;br/&gt;architectures to improve the capability of estimating &lt;br/&gt;intricate functions, (2) the development of &lt;br/&gt;decentralized, asynchronous learning algorithms to &lt;br/&gt;process extremely large-scale static tensors, (3) the &lt;br/&gt;development of online incremental learning algorithms &lt;br/&gt;to handle rapid data streams and to produce responsive &lt;br/&gt;updates upon receiving new data, without retraining &lt;br/&gt;from scratch, and (4) comprehensive evaluations on &lt;br/&gt;both synthetic and real-world big data. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;research will contribute a markedly improved tensor &lt;br/&gt;decomposition toolset that are powerful to estimate &lt;br/&gt;arbitrarily complex relationships, scalable to static &lt;br/&gt;tensors at unprecedented scales (e.g., billions of &lt;br/&gt;nodes and trillions of entries) and to fast data &lt;br/&gt;streams with efficient incremental updates. Moreover, &lt;br/&gt;as Bayesian approaches, the toolset are resilient to &lt;br/&gt;noise, provide posterior distributions for &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty quantification, and integrate all possible &lt;br/&gt;outcomes into robust predictions. Once the toolsets are &lt;br/&gt;available, the understanding of the high-order &lt;br/&gt;relationships in tensors, and the mining of associated &lt;br/&gt;patterns, such as communities and anomalies, will be &lt;br/&gt;enormously enhanced; the predictive performance for &lt;br/&gt;the quantify of interests, such as social links, &lt;br/&gt;click-through-rates, and recommendation, will be &lt;br/&gt;dramatically promoted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
