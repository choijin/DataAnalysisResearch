<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enhance wind farm output by increasing the annual energy production through advanced turbine wake-control technologies. This will further enhance the benefits of wind energy and provide guidance in overcoming its challenges. According to the DOE's Wind Vision Report, wind power can be a cost-effective renewable energy source. At the land-based utility-scale, wind is one of the lowest-priced energy sources available today. It has employed 100,000 workers in 2016 and by 2050 it is expected to employ 600,000 workers. Furthermore, researchers estimate that wind power generation in 2013 reduced power-sector water consumption by 36.5 billion gallons. It has reduced the direct power sector carbon dioxide emission by 115 million metric tons, sulfur dioxide emission by 157,000 metric tons, and nitrogen oxides by 97,000 metric tons in 2013 alone. Searching the product-market fit will improve the possibility of incorporating wake-control technologies in the marketplace. Additional applications of this technology can be found in naval defense, where submarine wakes should be concealed, as well as airline traffic control, where airplane wakes need to be dispersed rapidly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project technology utilizes instantaneous wake location as a feedback input to a closed-loop control algorithm that manipulates available turbine parameters (such as pitch, speed, and power control) to steer the wake to a desired location. Individual wind turbine wake is a fundamental building block of the complex flow structure in a wind farm. It has been observed that an upwind turbine wake reduces downwind turbine power generation by 40%. As a result, wake control or manipulation provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve wind farm output as a whole, in contrast to the limited benefits of improving individual turbine efficiency. Texas Tech University's wake control algorithm can be incorporated in existing wind farms and can function by altering existing control parameters. This technology has been tested at the wind-tunnel based Hyper Accelerated Wake Kinematics Simulation (HAWKS) platform. The HAWKS platform is capable of emulating full-scale wake detection and steering. Such wake steering would potentially increase power generated by downwind turbines, increasing wind farm power generation as a whole. This increase in power generation increases revenue potential, especially in a grid-price bidding scenario for a low wind speed forecast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

In the process the team travelled to Denver, CO and Houston, TX on 2 occasions to meet experts during Industry trade shows.  Finally, the team travelled back to Phoenix, AZ for the closing workshop to summarize and present their cumulative findings.   The team began I-Corps activity to understand the wind industry ecosystem and to determine the product-market fit.  At the beginning of the I-Corp program, the team defined the following initial thesis: "Wake control technology influences wind farm flow to increase power production by 15%, increase operation bandwidth by 25%, or reduce maintenance by 10%, ultimately promoting revenue increase for wind farm operator or owner". However, after conducting 101 interviews, the updated business thesis is "We develop a wind turbine wake control for wind farm operators to increase annual energy production by 3%".  The project has introduced, especially, the entrepreneurial lead the novel Business Model Canvas BMC concept. The I-corps customer discovery process highlights gleaning the customer’s pain (or gain) from their perspective, and their preferred solution to their problem. This is unlike the typical process of ‘pitching’ the technology and hoping to convince the customer regarding its advantages. The BMC methodology guides the team towards understanding customer’s requirements first to establish a product-market fit, and then subsequently preforming customer validation. It allows the team to discover pit falls early on to avoid effort or investment waste, and also to pivot to new BMC hypotheses to test.
