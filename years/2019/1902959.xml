<AbstractNarration>This project supports an interdisciplinary workshop on Foundations of Responsible Data Science, convening experts across computer science, statistics, social sciences, law, and policy to articulate a new foundational research agenda in responsible data science. The term "responsible" refers to data-intensive systems that take into account the ethical and epistemic issues associated with the larger social contexts in which they are deployed. These issues relate to the sources of data on which a learning system is trained, the decision-making contexts in which it is deployed, and the potentially competing goals among stakeholders that use it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop produces a report defining a research agenda to incorporate findings in the social sciences, economics, law, and public policy into new algorithmic techniques and systems. Although the emphasis is on foundational research, the workshop is designed to surface translational issues in bringing techniques into practice, new research questions in the social sciences driven by advances in data science, and new research questions in education and workforce development driven by the changing landscape of algorithmic decision-making. These activities are synergistic with Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR), one of the ``10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments,'' in that it focuses on the opportunities to transform society with the use of technology, and to embed societal norms into technological development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the deployment of automated decision tools in society continues to accelerate, their interactions with fundamentalquestions in law, in the social sciences, and in public policy have become impossible to ignore. Attention on these topics has exploded in recent years, sometimes with reference to AI ethics. But the foundations of these topics pertain more broadly to any kind of algorithmic decision system and the data on which they rely. Most data with which we are concerned are adminisrative exhaust from the social, legal, political, and organizational systems that have been rigorously studied for decades in fields apart from statistics and computer science. Our premise is that these fields are far better positioned to consider how data should and should not be used to automate policy decisions that affect peopleâ€™s lives than CS or stats alone.  Early attempts to define data science emphasized an opportunistic amalgam of computer science and statistics, sometimes with a nod toward "applications." But a mature definition of data science will centralize the social, legal, andorganizational contexts in which data are collected and in which the resulting systems are deployed. This emerging field of responsible data science retains the engineering and solutions-oriented culture of computer science, and the culture of applied rigor in statistics and economics, but grows from the foundational culture of reflexive scholarship in information science, social science, political science, and law.  The Foundations of Responsible Data Science Workshop, held online in March 2020 helped bootstrap a new interdisciplinary community across computing and society, research and practice, and across public and private sectors.  This community grew out of attendees' leadership in science and technology studies, fair machine learning, and data management systems, but represents a new approach to afford a framework for how data systems should be designed, developed, deployed, and decommissioned to improve people's lives.
