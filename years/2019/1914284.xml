<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR Phase I project is the stimulation of a new economy for natural fiber composites, allowing wood manufacturers and other industries an opportunity to expand into a profitable and sustainable venture, improving livelihoods. Developing a suitable replacement to asbestos cement corrugated sheets can drive new industry and work opportunities for the 125 million people in the world who are exposed to asbestos in the workplace. Further, a safe and affordable alternative will reduce millions of families future exposure to the harmful and toxic substance. Providing a cost-effective, energy-efficient roof will have both an environmental and health impact at a household level and lead to increases in energy savings and productivity while also reducing heat-related stress and illnesses. Demonstrating the potential of natural fiber composites as structural construction materials will promote a low-energy production process and sequestration of carbon dioxide through sustainable and renewable grasses and fibers, which can be scaled in resource-limited settings throughout Asia and Africa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project seeks to develop a commercially viable and scalable process to manufacture a bamboo-based strand composite for application in low-cost roofing globally. The intellectual merit of the proposed project resides in undertaking technical objectives to (i) determine ideal feedstock characteristics to produce suitable bamboo strands for formation into three-dimensional (3D) panels (ii) developing proper resin application systems to effectively consolidate and bond bamboo strands into durable panels and (iii) produce a prototype sandwich panel and evaluate its structural performance as well as resistance to moisture uptake and dimensional stability, and thermal conductivity. This new knowledge is expected to significantly advance the field of natural fiber composites by addressing several existing technical challenges for long-term construction applications that can withstand hot and humid climates, including ideal distribution of particulate geometry and moisture content, biodegradation, and effective binders for functionality. A prototype of the process to manufacture a non-woven bamboo-based strand composite for a roofing application will be designed and built to ensure it can be deployed at scale for industrial production in resource-limited settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The key objective of this project was the translation of a technological innovation to manufacture an affordable bamboo-based, strand-corrugated core and sandwich panels to be used for roofing in low-income communities in hot and humid climates where bamboo is a prevalent raw material.  The demand for timber and agricultural commodities is increasing as the global population expands and consumers and policies push for renewable and sustainable production methods and materials. Bamboo has increasingly been seen as a possible substitute to timber and can have an important role to play in reducing pressure on forestry resources.  The intellectual merit of the proposed project resided in undertaking technical objectives to (i) determine ideal feedstock characteristics to produce suitable bamboo strands for formation into three-dimensional (3D) panels (ii) develop a proper resin application systems to effectively consolidate and bond bamboo strands into durable panels and (iii) produce a prototype sandwich panel and evaluate its structural performance as well as resistance to moisture uptake and dimensional stability.  The three technical objectives were met and a method to manufacture bamboo-strand panels with required mechanical properties was developed. A prototype of a commercial size 8? x 4? bamboo strand panel using a large match-die mold was produced under the Phase I award.  The bamboo 3D panels tested and evaluated based on the Indian Standard for Bamboo Mat Corrugated Sheets (IS 15476) for density, load bearing capacity (dry and wet), water absorption, and cyclic test passed all the requirements.  Bamboo represents an immense opportunity for innovation within the building industry with proven applications in flooring, wall systems, and now roofing.
