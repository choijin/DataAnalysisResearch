<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports student travel to attend the 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Communications and Network Security Conference (CNS 2019) to be held in Washington, DC in June 2019. The IEEE CNS Conference is a premier venue for communications and network security researchers to present new research results in this domain. This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2019 IEEE Communications and Network Security  Conference by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by research output, coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of the project is to provide the student travel support for IEEE CNS conference, which aims to create a high-quality venue that seeks cutting-edge technical papers on the fields of communications and network security from academia, government, and industry.  We received 32 applications to the student travel award, with 6 applications from women students. A total of 14 students were funded to attend the conference and 6 of them are women students. We conducted a survey to evaluate student experience and below are the survey questions.  Have you ever attended the symposium before? What is your name? Is the student travel grant helpful to you? Which university are you affiliated with? Do you think attending the symposium/workshop can enrich your research capability? Do you think the symposium /workshop a good venue to network with other researchers? Which technical session do you find the most interesting? Do you feel encouraged to work in the fields of security and privacy in the future?  Summary of survey responses:  From all student responses, 85.7% students indicate that they have attended the symposium before and 14.3% students are first-time attendees. All students indicate that the travel grant is helpful and the conference is a good venue for them to network with other researchers. 88.9% students indicate that they would like to attend the conference in the future and the rest of them indicate that they may attend the conference in the future. 85.7% students indicate that they are encouraged to work in the field of security and privacy, and the rest of them feel that they may work in this field in the future.
