<AbstractNarration>The Auburn University Collaborative Approaches among Scientists and Engineers (CASE) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) aims to foster increased understanding of different approaches to experimental design through cross-disciplinary problem solving while also addressing the unique challenges faced by students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. During the 10-week summer program undergraduate students will engage in research that increases their understanding of the collaborative nature of STEM as well as how to utilize the convergence of disciplines to problem-solve. Students will utilize a team-based approach to conduct research on projects led by two faculty mentors from different disciplines. Cross-disciplinary projects include collaborations between Aerospace Engineering and Biological Sciences; Civil Engineering and Geosciences; Biosystems Engineering and Fisheries, Aquaculture, and Aquatic Sciences; as well as Chemistry and Physics. In addition to laboratory experience, the CASE REU will offer weekly professional development workshops that cover a wide-range of topics which address critical-thinking skills, scientific communication, sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and cultural competency. A key component of the CASE REU focuses on fostering effective mentor-mentee relationships both inside and outside of the laboratory, in order to provide students with an opportunity to further develop their scientific identity. This is accomplished in part through collaborative workshops with faculty mentors and participants. The program also includes social activities that provide networking opportunities with faculty, students, and colleagues across REU programs on campus. Upon completion of the program, participants will present their research to the Auburn community and also be provided with resources to travel to national conferences to present their work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CASE REU will recruit heavily from national conferences and partner institutions with an emphasis on broadening participation from students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. Novice, early-career students as well as those with prior research experience are encouraged to apply. Through participation in the CASE REU students will not only enhance their ability to examine real-world problems utilizing multidisciplinary approaches but also increase their exposure to scientific role models/potential mentors who will provide a supportive environment designed to increase retention and success in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
