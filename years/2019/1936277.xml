<AbstractNarration>The ACM/IEEE NanoCom conference series aims at creating a trans-disciplinary forum to foster and develop new communications and computing paradigms for nanoscale machines. The conference has been held annually since 2014 and has become the premier venue for fundamental advances in nanoscale computing and communication networks.  NanoCom highlights research potentials, stimulates novel and breakthrough ideas, and identifies the short and medium-term exploitation goals. The conference features distinguished keynote speakers, invited plenary talks and an open call for papers presented both in oral and poster sessions. Novel theoretical research results, implementation-based solutions, and position and roadmap papers are welcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support 10 students in the United States to attend ACM/IEEE NanoCom 2019, which will be held in Dublin, Ireland, on September 25-27, 2019. Attending such high-caliber technical venue is extremely valuable for future researchers. This is a truly inter-disciplinary field, which requires close interaction and frequent discussions with experts that span different areas. ACM/IEEE NanoCom 2019 is aimed at becoming the forum for such discussions to occur. Students will not only be exposed to the state-of-the-art in the field, but they will also have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with leading researchers, and take part in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field. The travel grants will target undergraduate and graduate students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited travel funds. In particular, one quarter of the available awards will be reserved to first-time attendees to NanoCom who do not have a paper accepted to the conference, with priority to undergraduate and first-year graduate students. Another quarter of the available awards will be reserved for under-represented groups (women, minorities and people with disabilities), with or without an accepted paper. For the remaining half of the available awards (not reserved for the aforementioned categories), higher priority will be given to female students as well as those from underrepresented minority-serving institutions that are not traditionally represented in the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
