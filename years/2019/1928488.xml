<AbstractNarration>The Engineering Technology Challenge (ETC) program is a collaboration among Connecticut community colleges, three inner-city high schools, industry, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association (CBIA), and Catalysts Powering Educational Performance (CPEP Inc.) to engage a diverse group of underrepresented students from urban comprehensive high schools in Saturday and summer programs focused on manufacturing technology. The program will create teams of high school students, mentored by community college students, faculty, and industry professionals in industry-driven problem based learning (PBL) projects, including the integration of professional skills and teamwork. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the ETC Program will develop and implement: 1) after-school programs for high school students, using industry and interest driven PBL projects; 2) career and college readiness workshops; 3) summer learning experiences including industry internships; 4) high school teacher summer workshops using the PBL curriculum and hands-on kits developed in ETC; 5) manufacturing career pathway experiences for career counselors, STEM high school teachers and parents; and 6) participation in Mini Maker Faires. Diversity is a core goal of ETC, directly impacting approximately 240 inner-city/under-represented high school students and 75 high school teachers. Through teacher professional development workshops, another 7500 students are indirectly impacted (~100 students per teacher). ETC will contribute to preparation of students for continuing their career pathway in manufacturing technology through credit certificates and degrees at partner community colleges and universities; and for high-tech jobs in the advanced manufacturing workforce. Project evaluation efforts will contribute to the general knowledge base regarding the attributes and practices of successful after school and summer programs for secondary school students, as well as associated professional development for teachers, that are carried out in collaboration with community college faculty and industry mentors.</AbstractNarration>
