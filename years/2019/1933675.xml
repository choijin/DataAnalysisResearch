<AbstractNarration>Mentorship plays a critical role in the careers of scientific researchers. Most researchers spend several years training under just one or two graduate and/or postdoctoral mentors, suggesting that these few relationships can have a large impact on scientific careers. Mentorship can provide both direct intellectual benefits to the trainee, through the learning of new skills and concepts, and indirect social benefits, through engagement with the social network of the mentor. Given the importance of mentorship in scientific career development, this aspect of training may play an important role in determining access of underrepresented groups to scientific careers. The purpose of this study is to characterize the impact of demographic variables--such as gender, ethnicity and socio-economic background--on the outcome of scientific training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Networks of mentors and trainees can be represented by a directional graph resembling a traditional family tree. This project develops a large crowdsourced database of academic mentorship relationships, and links that data to databases that measure scientific productivity (publications and grants) and demographic variables. Graph theoretic and semantic tools will be used to determine if and how demographic variables, associated with both of the mentor and trainee, impact scientific productivity. A preliminary analysis of gender replicates previous reports of bias toward representation male researchers, especially at more senior career stages. Accurately modeling effects of demographic variables requires accounting for other variables that impact scientific productivity metrics, namely differences between fields and long-term temporal trends. This project will use semantic analysis of publication data to develop the concept of the "intellectual neighborhood" of mentors. and incorporate this into the modeling of career outcomes. Data will be made open-access for general use by the public, providing a new resource for studying the dynamics of research fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
