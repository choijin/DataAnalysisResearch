<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of a select group of US-based Ph. D. students in the student program of the Second AAAI/ACM Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Ethics and Society (AIES 2019) which will take place in Honolulu, HI on January 27th and 28th, 2019.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIES was formed to promote concrete planning and research in the present and future of AI, examining the imperative that technologists talk not only to one another, but to thinkers and experts across the humanities and social sciences as well.  The AIES conference is a valuable opportunity for students from a range of disciplines to learn from AI experts across the disciplinary spectrum including computer scientists, sociologists, philosophers, economists, and lawyers specializing in privacy, human rights, and other relevant aspects of law. This exposure will help enrich their understanding of the powers and perils of their own work. The student track also serves as an important opportunity for "cohort-building" among students in various humanities and social science disciplines, with disparate knowledge bases and trainings but a common concern for the future of AI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
