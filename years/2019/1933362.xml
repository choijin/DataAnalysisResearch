<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide support for students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career researchers to attend 2019 Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MPA) to be held August 12-16, 2019 in Riga, Latvia.  The focus of the MPA 2019 conference is on analyzing topological structure-function relationships of metabolic networks to study fundamentals of biology and its biotechnological applications, with topics covered over including six sessions spanning systems and synthetic biology, metabolic networks, and mathematical algorithms.  The conference also provides pre-conference workshops on tools and methods for systems biology modeling and provides opportunities for early stage investigators to interact with senior researchers in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Network modeling and analysis approaches are making advances in this field through elucidation and quantification of phenotypes reflected by genomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic, and fluxomic data. The Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MPA) 2019 conference will focus on topological analyses of metabolic networks and in particular techniques utilizing linear algebra, linear programming and computer modeling in conjunction with experimental data to decode biological principles found in omics data sets. These analyses can be applied at many levels of abstraction, from individual reaction mechanisms to whole organisms and mixed cellular populations.  The MPA conference and the unique series of pre-conference tutorials provide an environment for research dissemination and education for early stage and established investigators to interact with the international systems biology research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
