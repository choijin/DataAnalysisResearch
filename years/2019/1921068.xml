<AbstractNarration>This award will partially support the participation of approximately 12 participants in the Aspen Summer Program on Active and Driven Matter, which is to be held at the Aspen Center for Physics between June 9th and 30th, 2019. Preference will be given to supporting members of underrepresented groups and first-time participants, especially emerging scientists: students, postdocs, and junior faculty. The workshop will bring together scientists from both the hard- and soft-condensed matter fields that are working on quantum and classical nonequilibrium driven systems. This cross-disciplinary workshop is the first of its kind, and it seeks to facilitate cross-pollination between the fields, and will feature extensive discussion sessions, which will feed back into reshaping the weekly schedule. It is expected to lead to fruitful collaborations and new insights on both the theoretical as well as on the experimental front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Straddling the interface between Quantum Leap and Rules of Life, the Aspen summer  program, partially funded by NSF,  brought together researchers working on two heretofore disconnected fields: Active matter in the classical context, and driven quantum systems.  The program focused on uncovering common themes and transferable theoretical techniques between these two sectors, with the common topics being nonequilibrium systems and topological states of matter.  One notable aspect was that this was one of the first meetings bringing these two communities together. The meeting was deemed a success as there were clear transfer of ideas between the two communities, and perhaps more importantly, questions provoked by contrasting approaches. The meeting ended with a clear desire to organize similar ones on a regular basis.   Another highlight of this program was the establishment of  new, and the strengthening of existing  collaborations between international research groups such as those in the UK, India, Italy, and the USA.   The funding provided opportunities for the participation of 5 junior scientists and under-represented minority scientists, thus helping to contribute towards the development of the future workforce.  Scientists also engaged in outreach activities under the auspices of the Aspen Center. For example Professor Baskaran from Brandeis University was interviewed by high school students for the local public radio channel. Moreover, Prof. Bruinsma from UCLA delivered a public lecture.          Last Modified: 06/05/2020       Submitted by: Aditi Mitra]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
