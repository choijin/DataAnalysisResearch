<AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together experts from academia and public and private institutions from across the United States to identify critical research questions and needs with respect to the management and environmental impacts of the large quantities and wide varieties of debris and waste generated by disasters such as hurricanes and floods. The occurrence, magnitude, and particularly damage and destruction from disasters have been increasing due to increase in number and frequency of extreme weather events, controlled and uncontrolled urbanization, deforestation, soil erosion, inadequate and aging infrastructure, and significant alterations to the natural environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will for the first time bring together a critical mass of experts to identify major research needs related to the complex issues of management and environmental impacts of post-disaster materials in a systematic manner. The topics that will be included in the workshop are: (1) potential pre- and post- disaster actions to mitigate the environmental impacts of post-disaster materials, (2) moving and transfer of debris and waste, (3) recovery, recycling, and reuse of post-disaster materials, (4) waste-to-energy conversion and extracting energy from debris and waste, (5) mining of debris and waste, (6) optimal systems and infrastructure for disposal, (7) new and innovative uses for debris and waste, and (8) broader environmental and health impacts of these materials including large-scale contamination, adverse climate impacts, and public health effects. Disaster debris and waste potentially generate public health and environmental problems; however, these wide-variety and large-quantity of wastes also include materials with high potential for recycling/upcycling, beneficial reuse, and conversion to energy replacing raw and natural material resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="p1">Millions of tons of debris and waste materials are generated due to natural and anthropogenic disasters on an annual basis in the United States as well as other parts of the world. The main causes of the disasters include storms/hurricanes, fires/wildfires, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and explosions. In 2018 alone, there were 8 hurricanes in the Atlantic region and over 8000 fires in California. Disasters occur in both rural and urban areas and affect all members of society. The composition of the disaster wastes varies as a function of the type of disaster (e.g., storm, flood, earthquake,&nbsp;and wildfire), geographic location, population density, characteristics of the built environment, and socioeconomic setting. In general, disaster events generate significant amounts of debris similar to construction and demolition waste in populated areas and high amounts of&nbsp;organic wastes and other&nbsp;natural materials in rural areas and less developed locations. Various contaminants and hazardous materials enter the disaster waste streams from different sources in variable types and amounts as a function of specific source such as residential, commercial, institutional, industrial, and agricultural sources. The debris and waste materials pose human health risks and environmental threats including impacts on soil, surface water and groundwater, and air. The sheer magnitude of the debris and waste materials generated and the highly heterogeneous nature of waste and debris and presence of hazardous and toxic constituents complicate the proper management of these materials.</p> <p class="p1">This workshop brought together experts from academia and from public and private institutions across the nation to identify critical research questions with respect to the sustainable management and environmental impacts of the debris and waste generated by disasters, with a focus on debris reuse and recycling. The workshop participants consisted of a diverse group of individuals with demonstrated expertise in workshop topics through theoretical, experimental, or modeling research investigations, though publications, oversight of management activities, development of new interventions, leadership in interdisciplinary studies, and specifically through direct and central involvement in post-disaster recovery and waste and debris management activities during recent disaster events. Four main themes were identified during the workshop for future research and development activities to find sustainable solutions for management of disaster debris and waste materials: pre- and post-disaster debris characterization and inventory; recycling/reuse planning and optimization; technology development (for improving recycling/reuse, handling, and monitoring of disaster materials); and business models and market development.</p> <p class="p1">The main research needs identified during the workshop include the development of debris management inventories; collection of post-disaster debris management data; characterization of post-disaster debris; development of a widely-applicable framework for pre- and post-disaster debris planning; development of advanced technologies; and development of post-disaster recycling markets. In addition to research investigations to be conducted by academia for improving recycling and reuse of post-disaster materials to provide alternatives for natural materials or raw resources, collaborative activities between academia and industry are recommended. The recommendations include evaluating disaster materials in accordance with specifications for recycling and reuse required by the recycling industry; development and application of standardized contaminant identification and decontamination procedures for broad use in practice; investigation of new sorting technologies available from recycling industry for application to disaster debris management; investigation of potential technologies for sorting and processing debris with better energy efficiency.</p> <p class="p1">A research agenda was developed that identified potential funding agencies and specific funding mechanisms. In addition, the workshop fostered development of a broad network of experts connected through the workshop activities as well as smaller collaborative groups that has grown through the interactions of the participants at the workshop. Development of publications is underway based on the activities at the workshop including editorials, special issues, and regular journal and conference manuscripts. Workshop materials also impact university teaching and learning through incorporating workshop findings in courses. Further dissemination occurs through practical implementation of workshop findings in standardization of disaster debris and waste use in large-scale civil engineering applications.</p> <!--    @font-face  {font-family:"Cambria Math";  panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:roman;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;} @font-face  {font-family:Calibri;  panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:swiss;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073697537 9 0 511 0;}    p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal  {mso-style-unhide:no;  mso-style-qformat:yes;  mso-style-parent:";  margin:0in;  margin-bottom:.0001pt;  mso-pagination:widow-orphan;  font-size:12.0pt;  font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;  mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;  mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;  mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;  mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";  mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} p.p1, li.p1, div.p1  {mso-style-name:p1;  mso-style-unhide:no;  mso-margin-top-alt:auto;  margin-right:0in;  mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;  margin-left:0in;  mso-pagination:widow-orphan;  font-size:12.0pt;  font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;  mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";} .MsoChpDefault  {mso-style-type:export-only;  mso-default-props:yes;  font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;  mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;  mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;  mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;  mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";  mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} @page WordSection1  {size:8.5in 11.0in;  margin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in;  mso-header-margin:.5in;  mso-footer-margin:.5in;  mso-paper-source:0;} div.WordSection1  {page:WordSection1;} --><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/06/2019<br>      Modified by: Sybil&nbsp;Derrible</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1922539/1922539_10595530_1565078929175_Group_Photo_Sheraton--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1922539/1922539_10595530_1565078929175_Group_Photo_Sheraton--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Workshop Participants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1922539/1922539_10595530_1565078929175_Group_Photo_Sheraton--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Workshop Participants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photo of All Workshop Participants</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sybil Derrible</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sybil&nbsp;Derrible</div> <div class="imageTitle">Workshop Participants</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
