<AbstractNarration>The GO-SHIP program seeks to characterize the time-evolving global scale ocean distributions  of  heat,  freshwater,  carbon,  oxygen,  nutrients  and  other chemical  tracers  with  a  view  to  illuminating and quantifying important physical and biogeochemical processes and to document global change.  As part of this international effort, the meridional section P18 was occupied  in  2016  along  approximately  110°W  in  the  eastern  Pacific  and  Southern  Ocean  (from  Baja California to  the  ice  edge  off  Antarctica). The grant will fund efforts to measure ocean tracers – tritium, 3He/4He isotope ratio, and the full  suite  of  noble  gases  (He,  Ne,  Ar,  Kr,  and  Xe)  –  on  approximately  500  archived  water  samples  collected  on  the  2016  P18  section.  The tracer samples  will  be  processed  on  specialized  extraction  systems and mass spectrometers at the WHOI Isotope Geochemistry Facility.  Evolving ocean-climate  systems  present  us  with  challenges  that  are  never  more  important than now. Increased glacial and sea-ice melting, increasing sea level, ocean acidification, and deoxygenation are a few of the societally important effects that must be anticipated and if possible quantitatively predicted using global ocean circulation and biogeochemical models.  Such models require a better understanding of the inherent processes, and because they are necessarily complex, yet incomplete abstractions of reality, they need observations for calibration, testing, and (if ever possible) verification.  Evaluation   and   documentation of the distributions of these tracers and their evolution, within the context of many other observational data sets and theories, will provide valuable constraints on global ocean-climate physical and biogeochemical models that are key to understanding and dealing with global change. The  new  P18  tritium–3He  and  noble  gas  data  will  be  made  publicly  available  to  any  interested parties  through  the  CLIVAR  and  Carbon  Hydrographic  Office  (CCHDO)  site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project science objectives are to: (1) Document the evolving tritium and 3He distributions in 2016 on the P18 section relative to the  earlier  1994  and  2008  occupations  to  illuminate  decadal-scale  patterns  and  possible  climatic changes in ventilation and circulation in the eastern Pacific;  (2) Make the first high quality noble gas measurements in the eastern Pacific and Southern Ocean to characterize air-sea exchange effects and diapycnal mixing on dissolved gases in the Pacific, and glacial melt contributions to the Circumpolar Deep Water. In the U.S. Global Ocean Carbon and Repeat Hydrography Program, tritium–3He is a Level 2 (“highly desirable”) data set that is funded separate from, but heavily leverages and adds to the measurements and ship time conducted by the core GO-SHIP program. The new tritium–3He and noble gas data will be interpreted in the context of the 2016 GO-SHIP P18 hydrographic and tracer observations (e.g., CFCs, SF6, O2), tritium–3He data from previous P18 occupations in 1994 and 2008, and Pacific basin-scale   tritium–3He   data   from   other   GO-SHIP   and   GEOTRACES   sections.  The  new  tracer  data  offer  unique  and  valuable  information  on  physical and biogeochemical processes in the eastern Pacific and Southern Ocean:  Tritium  as  a  transient  tracer  has  a  unique  hemispheric  asymmetry  that  can  be  used  as  a  diagnostic tracer of north vs south water mass provenance in the tropics. Tritium-helium dating provides  a  unique  and  sensitive  measure  of  shallow  ventilation  and  circulation on annual to decadal time-scales that is distinct from other tracers such as CFCs and SF6, giving estimates of water mass origins, ages, and modification in shallow waters.  Helium  Isotopes  in  the  deep  water  provide  important  information  regarding  hydrothermal  plume provenance, dispersion and dilution, and constraining deep-water circulation models. Noble  gases  are  sensitive  and  unambiguous  tracers  of  air-sea  exchange,  water  mass  provenance, ice-ocean interaction, upwelling, and in situ diapycnal mixing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
