<AbstractNarration>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)/International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Symposium on Integrated Network and Service Management (IM) is a leading conference in network and service management community. The IM 2019 conference will be held April 8-12, 2019 in Washington DC, USA.  The conference brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry which provides a multidisciplinary trend-setting forum to explore the hottest areas of information and communications technology management related to industry, academia, government, enterprise and other market segments from around the world. Attending conferences such as IM is of paramount importance for the development of graduate students. Students will have the opportunity to touch frontier research topics in the area of network and service management and establish collaboration relationships with other researchers during the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project provides travel support for high school, undergrad or graduate students in the United States to attend the IM 2019 conference. The travel awards will focus on bringing in first-time attendees and under-represented minority students into the conference, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds. The research community and the technical workforce benefit from the improvement of students in the pipeline, and new ideas generated through introducing new participants into the research field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
