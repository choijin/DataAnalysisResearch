<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and Applications" that will be held at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor on July 9-12, 2019.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the topics of hyperbolic conservation laws, mathematical general relativity, compressible and incompressible fluids, boundary dispersive phenomena, fluid dynamics and kinetic theory.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at: https://mcaim.math.lsa.umich.edu/events/pde-conference/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
