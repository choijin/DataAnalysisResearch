<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide an open technical forum that brings together leading researchers from the US and Europe to discuss cutting-edge research in two-dimensional materials and devices. Student participation will be encouraged and they will have the opportunity to interact with leading researchers in the field. The workshop is anticipated to catalyze important collaborations. Participants will discuss ways to share unique research infrastructure at their instiuttions to streamline efforts and consolidate resources. Finally, the proposal will foster collaborations with the EU Graphene Flagship and US Scientists, for planning innovative international activities that can facilitate joint collaborative projects in the near future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  purpose of this workshop is to bring together leading scientists working on graphene, 2D materials and devices, from Europe and the United States to help promote future collaborations and address common  challenges in this dynamic field. In doing so, it is envisioned that such interactions will help promoting  new synergistic activities and hence research progress. The Workshop will also promote the participation  of students who will have the opportunity to interact with experts in the field and learn about the latest  advances in 2D materials and devices. This workshop will foster advances in the leading research on 2D atomic layers and devices by gathering a diverse group of experts and researchers. The presentations and scientific exchanges will focus on a wide range of 2D layered materials such as phosphorene, transition metal di-chalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride, tertiary compounds of carbon nitrides, and complex oxides. It will prompt collaborations with the EU Graphene Flagship program administrators and NSF that will lead to international activities that can facilitate joint collaborative programs in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2019 edition of the US-EU workshops on 2D systems continued to highlight key points for collaboration and joint research efforts and emphasize community-identified issues in international collaboration focused on 2D materials. There was a specific focus on quantum materials (QMats), as they are prime candidates for next-generation energy-efficient technologies, such as topological quantum computing, quantum sensing, and neuromorphic computing. 2D materials offer to drastically advance our ability to synthesize, characterize, and control QMats at the atomic scale.The list of topic addressed at the workshop involved synthesis techniques for beyond graphene 2D materials with the view on potential scalability, characterization techniques, device nanofabrication and device characterization, theory and modeling for predicting properties and research on 2D heterostructures.  The workshop identified that the role of 2D materials in advancing quantum information science is twofold: in some implementations they serve as superior components in existing qubit or single photon emitter realizations, in others they allow the emergence of new degrees of freedom. In general, desirable qualities 2D materials introduce include:  1)    Absence of surface dangling bonds that reduces unrecorded perturbations that degrades spin coherence or photon distinguishability  2)    As the source are close to the surface, reduces dielectric loss and allows facile integration into quantum optical devices.  3)    Lowered dimension allows more spatially freedom and allows the direct fine-tuning of the electronic structure and dielectric environment of the material using e.g. control over deformations such as strain and stacking orientation, and control over material assembly such as pairing with different materials into a heterostack and coupling with optical cavities and electric/magnetic fields.  4)    Lowered dimension allows more control over the spatial engineering of defects.
