<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Blue Heron, an 86-foot Coastal research vessel owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large Lakes Observatory as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF). Built in 1985 for fishing on the Grand Banks, the Blue Heron was purchased by the University of Minnesota in 1997. She is outfitted with state-of-the-art research equipment, has berthing for 11 crew and scientists, and can operate 24 hours per day for up to 21 days in between port calls. The Blue Heron is part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF) and is available for charter by research scientists on any of the Great Lakes. In 2018, the vessel completed 44 funded days where 21 (48%) were for NSF. In 2019, Blue Heron is currently scheduled for 75 days, 60 of these (80%) will be for NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;1) A.C. for galley and main deck berths $7,873 &lt;br/&gt;2) Galley refrigerator $6,392 &lt;br/&gt;       $14,265 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts       &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Minnesota Duluth purchased a new commercial grade refrigerator and added air conditioning to the research vessel Blue Heron using funds provided by the National Science Foundation award OCE#1916123 ?Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment 2019 R/V Blue Heron?.  The refrigerator and air conditioning will improve living conditions aboard the vessel for the scientists and crew that use the ship.     The addition of air conditioning to our galley and berths was strongly recommended by inspectors who focus on inspecting research vessels.  The RV Blue Heron works on all of the Great Lakes and researchers who use the vessel have recently added more work on southern Lake Michigan and Lake Erie during July and August.  Without air conditioning work on the southern Great Lakes can be intolerable during the summer months.  Additionally, the new refrigerator for our galley was necessary due to the increased number of repairs on our 34-year-old refrigerator.      The air conditioning and refrigerator will be used by all user of the R/V Blue Heron, including the four National Science Foundation funded projects that will use the vessel in 2021.  Besides the NSF funded projects, we are supporting several other science projects in 2021: two Great Lakes Observing System (NOAA) cruises, two Sea Grant cruises, and multiple research and educational cruises funded by the University of Minnesota.  The educational cruises will allow close to 160 undergraduate students to be exposed to scientific research on Lake Superior.
