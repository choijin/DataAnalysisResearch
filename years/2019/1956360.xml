<AbstractNarration>This award will support U.S. participants in the “Trends in Operator Theory Workshop” to be held June 22-26, 2020, at the Lorentz Center in the Netherlands. The meeting will focus on topics in operator theory. The study of operators is a classical area of mathematics that provides powerful tools useful in the development of many areas of science; for example quantum theory, physics, and mechanics. The award will support travel expenses of mathematicians and graduate students from institutions in the United States to participate in the workshop and also in working group sessions. The Lorentz Center will host and assist with the coordination of this mathematical event. The Center provides an excellent environment to learn and discuss mathematics. The conference will have significant impact on the education of graduate students and early career mathematicians by promoting ample interactions among participants. The organizers will make a concerted effort to include women and other groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. To extend the impact of this workshop beyond immediate participants, the organizers will disseminate widely the workshop products to the broader mathematical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop consists of a series of six lectures, follow-up seminars, and also intensive group sessions, all to take place at the Lorentz Center. This conference will focus attention on topics from Operator Theory and applications. Topics to be addressed include: The study of particular weighted composition operators and their connection with renowned open questions in Complex Analysis and Functional Analysis, like the Brennan Conjecture or the Invariant Subspace Problem; the shift operator on H2 on the unit disk and its invariant subspaces; the theory for H2 on the bi-disk and its connection to the formulation of many questions about the numerical range; inverse eigenvalue problems on an infinite dimensional setting; the study of complex symmetric operators on a Hilbert space; multiplication operators and structural projections on JB*-triples; and semigroup methods and operator theoretic methods applied to evolution equations. Participants will have the opportunity to hear lectures by prominent operator theorists, and then discuss ideas to explore solutions of problems in small groups.
