<AbstractNarration>This award supports 8 U.S.-based graduate students to participate in Doctoral Consortium held in conjunction with the 12th Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2019), held in Melbourne, Australia, February 11-15, 2019. The consortium allows doctoral students to interact with established researchers and with other students, through presentations, question-answer sessions, panel discussions, and invited presentations.  Each participant will give a short presentation on their research and will receive feedback from at least one faculty mentor as well as from fellow students. The consortium will further include activities led by the faculty ? such as a panel discussion ? to give students more information about the transition into the job market after graduation. Seasoned researchers will share lessons of research and life in academia and industry. WSDM conference seeks to support a diverse body of students and foster development on a new generation of researchers and practitioners in the important areas of web search and data mining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WSDM is a highly selective conference that includes invited talks, refereed full papers and poster sessions. WSDM publishes original, high-quality papers related to search and data mining on the Web and the Social Web, with an emphasis on practical yet principled novel&lt;br/&gt;models of search and data mining, algorithm design and analysis, economic implications, and in-depth experimental analysis of accuracy and performance. Recent WSDM conferences have been attracting approximately 600 participants with equal numbers coming from academic and industrial research labs from the IR, NLP, data mining and ML communities. WSDM proceedings are available via the ACM Digital Library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The event was a research-focused meeting of an international group of selected Ph.D. candidates, and a panel of distinguished research faculty. The Consortium allowed participants to interact with established researchers and with other students, through presentations, question-answer sessions, panel discussions, and invited presentations.  Each participant gave a short presentation on their research and received feedback from faculty mentors as well as from fellow students. The goals of the Consortium were to develop a group of promising young researchers interested in information retrieval through a full-day workshop event: guiding the research of these promising young researchers through contact with a select group of experts in the field; offering each participant fresh perspectives and comments on their work from researchers outside their own institution, both from faculty and other students; providing a supportive setting for mutual feedback on participantsâ€™ current research and guidance on future research directions; and enabling them to form a cohort group of new researchers.
