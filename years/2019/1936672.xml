<AbstractNarration>The Front Range Number Theory Day (FRNTD) is a new, one-day, biannual miniconference whose location alternates between the University of Colorado in the spring and Colorado State University in the fall. In particular, FRNTD will be held in Fort Collins, CO, on November 16, 2019, September 26, 2020 and September 25, 2021; and in Boulder, CO, on April 25, 2020, April 24, 2021, and April 23, 2022. More detailed information, including past schedules and future plans, is available at https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/front-range-number-theory-day. The Front Range of Colorado is mathematically rich, but geographically isolated. This conference serves the students and faculty of this community by providing an easy-to-attend local conference with speakers and participants from across the Front Range and the USA. It offers local graduate and undergraduate students a financially supported opportunity to present their findings to, and engage with, a wider audience, without requiring lengthy travel. Moreover, it provides a venue for junior researchers from around the country and a conference opportunity for students and faculty from local undergraduate-serving institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each FRNTD features three keynote talks, with at least one accessible to undergraduates, and an additional scientific event, such as a poster session or a round of lightning talks. By choosing one local keynote speaker, as well as giving a platform for local rising number theorists, we support FRNTD's goal of strengthening the local community in number theory. In choosing individuals to invite, one of our goals is the promotion of mathematicians from historically underrepresented groups and backgrounds. Due to the interests of many of the participants, the areas of algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry have been well represented at past FRNTDs; however, we will continue to invite participants with expertise in any area of number theory whose research interests facilitate collaboration and community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
