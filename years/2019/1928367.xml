<AbstractNarration>The 14th Conference on the Theory of Quantum Computing, Communication and Cryptography (TQC 2019) will take place at the University of Maryland in June 2019. This grant funding supports the travel of 14-16 eligible US students to the conference. Recipients would be able to attend the main conference, workshops, and poster sessions. Travel grants will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort will be made to reach out to women and under-represented minorities, and institutions not traditionally represented at TQC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Theory of Quantum Computing, Communication and Cryptography (TQC), is a leading annual conference for students and researchers working in the theoretical aspects of quantum computing, quantum information and quantum cryptography. The workshop presents a great opportunity for participants to gain exposure to a particular topic and hear from the relevant experts in it. This workshop will focus on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Information (NISQ).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
