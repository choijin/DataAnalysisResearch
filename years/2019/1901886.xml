<AbstractNarration>The research supported under this award is concerned with the study of systems of polynomial equations. The equations can be thought of as dependence relations between physical quantities in some model, while the solution set of these equations describes the geometric shape of the model. Natural phenomena often come equipped with a rich symmetry, which is important to identify and incorporate into the modeling process. To imagine how equations, geometry and symmetry naturally fit together, one should think about lines and planes that are defined using linear equations and exhibit translational symmetries, or about circles and spheres that are described by quadratic equations and display rotational symmetries. For more complex systems, the degrees of the equations alone are not able to capture the geometry or the symmetries. The goal of this project is to systematically analyze (higher) relations between the equations defining elaborate systems, that are robust enough to accurately predict shapes and portray symmetries. The techniques developed by the PI will be used to study curves and configurations of linear spaces, polynomials and their factorization pattern, or spaces of matrices and higher dimensional tensors. Such spaces are not only important for the fundamental research in mathematics, but they also play a central role in applications throughout the sciences. The research is suitable for engaging students in research, as well as for computer experimentation and software development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate a number of fundamental invariants in homological commutative algebra and classical algebraic geometry. An important emphasis will be on the study of problems that are concrete, exhibit a rich symmetry, and that touch upon a number of related fields within mathematics. The PI will continue to advance the theory and applications of Koszul modules, exploring their uses to group theory and to syzygies of curves, to hyperplane arrangements or to the homological theory of algebraic varieties. The PI will study homological invariants such as syzygies and Ext modules, regularity and projective dimension, local cohomology and Lyubeznik numbers, in the context of examining central objects such as determinantal and monomial ideals, Segre and Veronese varieties, binary forms, or representations with finitely many orbits. The methods employed fall mainly in the realm of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, but also incorporate tools from combinatorics, D-module, quiver and representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
