<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project is focused on developing a mobile biotech laboratory for high schools. Education in biotech is limited from a practical point of view to schools with the funds to purchase expensive equipment and to train their teachers to use it. Kits including equipment and accompanying instructional materials are available in large biotech markets but require teacher training, purchase of materials and check-out and return of equipment. In this, instruction is limited to a few high schools in key biotech hubs. Our goal is to give every student in the country equal access to biotech training by building a laboratory in their pocket through the proposed product. Through use of mobile devices, a $100 tablet can replace thousands of dollars in laboratory equipment. Everything the student needs to complete their studies will be included in the app or through in-app purchases. Teacher training would be minimal because back-end validation of all reagent kits and accompanying gear is completed to make its use seamless and universally applicable. All accompanying information required for the teacher is provided including in-App assessment tools of student performance. The app may be downloaded by anyone in the country and gear/reagents rapidly shipped directly to the teacher?s classroom. Teachers in rural communities will have the same access as teachers in the wealthiest school districts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on developing a web-based app with a back-end database that teaches hands-on biotech laboratory skills and concepts via discovery-based learning. The app includes an exploration lab module that simulates high-end scientific equipment, including a spectrophotometer and microscope that use the smart-phone camera. A second module takes students through various laboratory skills including micropipetting, use of microscope, and spectrophotometer. Students learn background and are led through practice and research activities resulting in a report. A third module uses guided discovery-based learning approaches to take students through the scientific method to a real-world research problem and adheres to all three dimensions of Next Generation Science Standards. Unit includes a study of milk digestion by the pancreas that features isolation of pancreatic proteases, drug discovery/natural product screening and quality control testing of commercially available enzyme supplements. In these explorations, students are not given answers. They must formulate hypothesis and do guided background research and ultimately perform hands-on experiments resulting in a final report. Student progress is captured in a back-end database and monitored by their instructor. Hardware such as micropipettes and attachments for phone/tablet will be designed and prepared through 3D printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
