<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project will be leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) to better understand how to construct models for complicated systems with incomplete information, such as the coastline and nearshore of the Arctic.  Natural beach processes are not stagnant shorelines but rather dynamic systems that shift, migrate, fill and erode. Accurate seafloor depths and nearshore charts are important for forecasting weather, tsunami, and storm surge events that can impact local communities, infrastructure, and shipping industries. The necessity of safe navigation for civilian ships not rated for ice operations and dynamic geographical needs is driving the need for innovative modeling.  Traditional mapping techniques are incapable of updating constantly evolving bathymetric navigation models quickly and accurately to suit the needs of business and communities.  AI/ML technology has much to offer and investigate in terms of different architectures, applications and possible modifications.  Some of the largest roadblocks to implementing current AI/ML modeling are that they require data, cannot directly include current scientific understandings of systems, and are considered a black box for understanding the way the system is solved.  The proposed work will teach AI/ML models to learn from more than just data but also scientific theories, and then to write out solutions that can be interpreted by humans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR project will develop a method to integrate data and models in a dynamic learning environment.  Systems using AI/ML have the capability to identify critical patterns in nonlinear, complex systems when good training data is available.  However, this process does not create new insights on system dynamics.  Beach physics and coastal morphology are actively researched today and have led to high quality traditional coastal modeling codebases, both phenomenologically generated and physics-based, but these are not easily updated.  This project will design an architecture using analytical functions and data to develop solutions as a codebase, which can then be reviewed and compiled as a traditional coastal model, allowing for novel AI/ML methods without requiring the user to learn new readable formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Up to date nearshore bathymetry data and the ability to monitor coastal change are critical needs in Arctic and sub-Arctic Alaska. Currently, some of the Alaskan NOAA bathymetric surveys have not been updated since the late 1800s.  Traditional bathymetric surveying is costly and dangerous due to the extreme environment, which includes high turbidity waters, constantly changing nearshore conditions, and the sheer quantity of coastline. The research funding provided by NSF through an SBIR supported the development of CENA: Coastline Evolution &amp; Nearshore Approximation; an Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine that synthesizes multiple methodologies to automatically generate tailored software that estimates nearshore bathymetry. We designed the architecture of our AI engine and trained it to understand several scientifically-derived methods of estimating nearshore bathymetry from remotely sensed imagery. Since each scientific method succeeds under different environmental conditions, we trained the AI engine to be able to choose the most applicable method within a generalized area of interest.  As an added feature, the AI engine is designed to easily and rapidly integrate the discovery of new techniques as they are developed within the scientific community and can automatically generate updates to the software. Both breadth and depth of model development are addressed in the agile architecture, as the most relevant scientific methodologies can be applied to a large area with significantly less time and resources than is usually required to manually classify and develop new models.  AI is challenging paradigms in many disciplines and is well suited to meet the needs of the Arctic; a complex environment in need of innovative solutions. CENA is designed to build products tailored to unique customer needs while significantly reducing the need for costly field surveys and scientific model development. Our framework supports remote monitoring of regions that are rapidly evolving, such as the severe coastal erosion occurring on Alaska’s north slope. More up to date elevation modeling will additionally support flood inundation and risk assessment. The result of our efforts created the framework of a system with great potential to be provided at scale across commercial applications.
