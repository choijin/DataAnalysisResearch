<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project rests in the advanced biomedical treatments that can be delivered using recombinant protein-based materials. In current surgical procedures, hydrogel adhesives are limited to applications as sealants in conjunction with sutures. In addition to the unmatched strength of sutures, problems such as poor bonding on wet surfaces, low strength, and high swelling limit the reproducibility, applicability, and adoption of currently available adhesives and commercialization of other advanced tissue regenerative materials. The goal is to bring to market an adhesive platform that will overcome those limitations and introduce new functionalities. Furthermore, the ability to use protein engineering to improve material functionality will broaden the target market segments. The availability of an effective hydrogel adhesive platform will empower patients and health care providers with a next-generation tool that can replace sutures to achieve cosmetically and functionally improved healing, decrease complications, and increase patient comfort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is focused on the development of a protein-based adhesive that can bond to soft tissues. An advantage of the bioinspired recombinant protein in our core technology is that it can resist washout once applied because it deswells (does not absorb water) at body temperature. Once cured, the resulting hydrogel is flexible and can maintain its properties unlike other hydrogel adhesives which absorb water and swell. Genetic engineering also allows direct integration of functional peptide sequences. During development and testing, the project will establish the design principles that will enable the creation of next-generation adhesives with high bonding, flexibility, and bio-interactive properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This team, Protean Materials, was comprised of a UCSF post doctoral researcher and a business lead with an MBA and past experience with startups.  After an initial promising start, the team dropped out of the National I-Corps programs midway through the course.  The team and their mentor felt that they were being discouraged from pivoting after 40 interviews.  This created irreconcilable differences with the teaching team and all parties agreed that the best course of action was removal from the National I-Corps program.   The team did attend multiple conferences and conducted multiple interviews in their initial target segment of resconstructive (specifically breast augmentation and reduction surgeons). Ultimately, however, they did not find strong signals for validating product-market fit within a large enough market.  During the customer discovery process, the team identified other needs from this particular customer segment that their existing technology could not address. As a result, they were not interested in further pursuing the initial customer segment and wanted to pivot to a completely different customer segment.    The team is continuing to conduct customer discovery for a new customer segment and is applying the lessons learned during their I-Corps experience.  The Node will continue to refine team training, preparation and support during the cohort in order to minimize this type of situation occurring in the future.
