<AbstractNarration>The Arctic is undergoing rapid climate change, with atmospheric temperatures warming at a rate greater than twice the global average, a precipitous decline in Arctic sea ice, and sustained accumulation of heat and freshwater in the ocean. These changes have extensive consequences for global climate, marine ecosystems and geopolitics. The Beaufort Gyre is one of the Arctic Ocean’s main sea-ice and ocean circulation systems and a centerpiece for Arctic and global change. The most pronounced sea-ice losses and ocean changes are observed in this region. Conspicuous examples are the substantial increases in concentrations of relatively fresh water in the ocean, and in the amount of heat contained in the ocean. Other prominent changes in the Beaufort Gyre include ocean acidification and transformations in the marine ecosystem. This project is an extensive observing program to document and analyze the Beaufort Gyre’s evolving sea ice and ocean properties. In-depth analyses of the data provide understanding of the Beaufort Gyre’s role in the Arctic and global climate system, which is essential to develop the most viable future climate predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds upon the discoveries of the 2003-2020 Beaufort Gyre Observing System (BGOS) project to sample and analyze the Beaufort Gyre. BGOS operations are continued in 2020-2024 including an extensive analysis and interpretation of the data. Ocean moorings sample seawater properties and sea-ice to resolve sub-daily to interannual variability. Annual ship-based ocean sampling, in collaboration with Canadian scientists, augments the year-round mooring measurements. The data comprise measurements of heat, freshwater, currents, bottom pressure, biogeochemical properties, and sea ice. These observations are analyzed and interpreted in context with the existing long-term measurements to test key hypotheses related to the evolving freshwater, energetics of the ice-ocean system, the accumulation of ocean heat, and biogeochemistry. The BGOS program coordinates with and accommodates other national and international projects to enhance effectiveness and interconnections of observing activities. The project includes training of students, providing them with the opportunity to participate in BGOS expeditions and advising them in BGOS data analysis. This encompasses an educational exchange between Yale and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution involving graduate students and summer undergraduate students, and tiered mentoring. Other broader impacts include ship-board scientific presentations, tutorials, and dispatches, participation in the NSF PolarTREC program, and engagement of Arctic communities in Canada and Alaska. The long-term Beaufort Gyre system perspective and knowledge gained from the data and analysis are vital to a wide variety of Arctic processes and, ultimately, our understanding of the climate system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
