<AbstractNarration>Prior research demonstrates that building professional skills and support networks of female engineering faculty, who are underrepresented in engineering colleges, can improve their retention in academia. The 2019 Big 10 Women's Workshop provides opportunities for assistant professors in their first three years of their academic appointment to learn professional skills critical to early success in their tenure track positions and long-term careers. Additionally, the workshop generates opportunities for mentorship by senior women faculty role models, along with a vehicle to foster research collaborations across institutions. Participants will be provided effective strategies and multiple pathways for pursuing rewarding and impactful careers in the academy. The workshop and follow-on activities will contribute to the hiring, retention, and success of women faculty, while also helping to increase the number of women engineering students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;One goal of this project is to establish a continuous cycle of community building and networking across the Big 10 engineering colleges. In order to do this, the workshop includes participants from the prior 2010 conference and activities that foster community building.  The workshop attendees will return to their home institutions with a broader professional network that will support their successful pursuit of tenure-track positions. Increased retention of female engineering faculty will additionally improve the nation's capacity for research, education, and preparation of the future engineering workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recently, engineering colleges have seen modest year-over-year gains in the number of women faculty, although the overall percentage of women faculty in engineering remains low in top-ranked programs.  As a consequence, very few opportunities exist for junior women faculty to network, foster peer-mentoring relationships, and connect with senior women faculty that could serve as role models.  The resulting sense of isolation and lack of professional interactions often dissuade or discourage junior faculty women from persisting in the tenure-track path.  The disproportionate absence of women faculty, especially at large engineering schools, may also be adversely affecting the representation of women in the engineering workforce.   To address this mentoring gap, the Big Ten Women?s Workshop (BTWW) (March 27-28, 2019) was designed to advance the knowledge and skill sets of women engineering faculty in the first three years of a tenure-track academic appointment at the participating institutions. The workshop gathered 56 junior women engineering faculty from the Big 10 schools in the first three years of their positions and a group of 23 senior women faculty mentors (including now-tenured women who were in the first BTWW junior faculty cohort in 2010).  Together, this group in the context of the workshop provided a rich professional networking experience, including explicit networking sessions and opportunities to engage in research-related conversations; cultivated peer collaborations and mentoring relationships through activities designed to share best practices for success; and fostered interactions and connections with senior women faculty role models, highlighting multiple pathways to rewarding and impactful careers in the academy.   Specifically, both junior and senior women attending the workshop were trained in mentorship (both peer and non-peer), communication, and other skills, which can in turn enable mentorship of students (undergraduate and graduate).  The organizers? goal was to have this activity make an impact on hundreds of students, since the participating schools account for more than 18% of the engineering PhD degrees and more than 11% of the bachelor?s degrees in engineering awarded annually in the US.  Four of the top 10 schools in terms of numbers of degrees produced (BS and PhD) are in the Big 10.  Therefore, the women faculty members who attended this workshop returned to their home institutions with skills that they can use to be successful mentors and advisors and to inspire a large number of women and men students alike.  The post-workshop survey results indicate that participation inspired workshop attendees to establish mentoring relationships with senior and peer faculty members both inside and outside their home institutions.   For the first time, this offering of the workshop included several of the participants from the original 2010 junior faculty cohort, while maintaining attention on the unique experiences of women faculty of color.  The workshop included an additional layer of skill development for these early associate professors on the evening preceding the workshop to enable expansion of their professional networks, their research and teaching activities, career planning, and leadership.  This helped to establish a virtuous cycle of networking and community building across the Big 10 engineering colleges that will contribute to the hiring, retention, and success of women faculty members, and the growth in numbers of women engineers, well into the future.   Results of the post-workshop survey indicate strong uptake and application of the skills developed during the 2019 BTWW across all faculty ranks.
