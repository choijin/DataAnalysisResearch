<AbstractNarration>This award supports student and qualified postdoctoral fellow attendance at the inaugural SIAM Symposium on Algorithmic Principles of Computer Systems (APOCS)in Salt Lake City, Utah on January 8, 2020, co-located with the SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), the premier conference of the algorithms community, from January 5 to January 8, 2020. This award will provide partial support to about 30 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer Systems is the branch of computer science that concerns itself with the building and evaluation of systems, such as networks, database, computer chips, file systems, operating systems and the like.  Theory of Computing is the branch that concerns itself, in part, with the theoretical analysis of the performance of algorithms.  There is strong evidence that cross-disciplinary research between the two  communities is beneficial to both fields and to the world at large. The SIAM Symposium on Algorithmic Principles of Computer Systems (APOCS) is a new conference which has been started to help promote this fertilization. This travel award supports much-needed student participation, including students from underrepresented groups, in this effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SIAM Algorithmic Principles of Computer Systems (APOCS) is a new conference that addresses algorithmic research the has application to or is motivated by computer systems.  Algorithms are mathematically grounded step-by-step proceedures that a computer can take to complete a task.  Computer systems included: operating systems, which is the software that runs the applications; file systems, which is the software that organizes data on storage devices; networks, which are used by computers to communicate with each other; etc.     The purpose of this grant was to support student travel to this conference.  In total, nice (9) students were supported, including three (3) women.  All tsudents were at US universities, and five (5) of the students were US nationals, quite a high perfect for computer science.     Seven of the students presented at the conference.  Conference travel is essential for students to understand the range of topics being studied and to make professional connections that will be critical to the careers of these students.  APOCS is co-located with SODA, the premier algorithms conference, ALENEX, the premier algorithms engineering conference, and SOSA,  a conference designed to showcase simplification results in algorithms.  The attendees of APOCS were also able to attend talks at these other conferences, which provided additional opportunity for enrichment for the students.
