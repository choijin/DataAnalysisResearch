<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Local and Nonlocal Trends in Analysis and Geometry" that will be held University of Pittsburgh on October 10-12, 2019.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of nonlocal partial differential equations and geometric analysis.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by NSF, an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at:  http://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/events/local-and-nonlocal-trends-analysis-and-geometry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ What are the major goals of the project?     The main goal of this project was to facilitate the participation of 24 young researchers (graduate students, postdocs, and assistant professors) in the workshop Local and Nonlocal Trends in Analysis and Geometry, held at the University of Pittsburgh on October 12-13, 2019.     Funds for this project were used to pay for travel expenses to Pittsburgh and for hotel expenses at Pittsburgh. Funds from the Mathematics Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh were used to pay for the participation of senior scientists, three of whom came from abroad.      What was accomplished under these goals (you must provide information for at least one of the 4 categories below)?      Major Activities:     Thirty-three (33) US mathematicians and three (3) international senior mathematicians participated in the workshop Local and Nonlocal Trends in Analysis and Geometry, held at the University of Pittsburgh on October 12-13, 2019.  Their names are listed in the participants section of this report.     The workshop was advertised at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Mathematics web page, and via e-mail to departments of Mathematics in the US. The response by the mathematical community was outstanding.  Of the total number of participants (36), we had twenty-four (junior participants) and twelve (12) senior participants, while our proposal called for fifteen (15) junior and five (5) senior participants.                          Specific Objectives:     The workshop run over a long weekend a Friday afternoon to a Sunday late morning. There were 16 talks and a poster session, where seven (7) graduate and postdocs presented their posters.  In addition, there was ample opportunity for discussion in the classrooms nearby the lecture room.     Due to the significant support of the University of Pittsburgh Mathematics Research Center, and the fact that several senior participants chose to pay for the expenses, we did not spend all the funds allocated to this project. The award was for a total of $15,000, of which we spent $12,968.40, leaving an unspent amount of $2,031.60, which was returned to NSF.     Significant results:     We were happy  to attract a diverse group of participants that included seven women mathematicians (a professor, an associate professor, one assistant professor, two postdocs, and two graduate students), one African-American mathematician (associate professor), and eight Hispanic mathematicians (two professors, two assistant professors, and three graduate students).      Overall, we think that we have contributed to bring research mathematics to a diverse group of participants. NSF's investment of approximately $13,000 in this project has resulted is some unique training opportunities for the twenty-four (24) younger scholars (assistant professors, postdocs, and graduate students).     * What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?     During the workshop, there were numerous opportunities for interaction between the participants. We had long coffee break during the sessions, and we held a very-well attended the poster session.  This informal atmosphere provided young investigators with many chances to discuss their projects with senior researchers.          How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?        The workshop information, including the schedule and the abstracts of the presentation are available at the page  https://sites.google.com/view/pittpde19/home                         Last Modified: 11/05/2020       Submitted by: Juan J Manfredi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
