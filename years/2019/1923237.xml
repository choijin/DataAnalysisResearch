<AbstractNarration>The travel award supports US participation in the 13th Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences (ISAES). Ten interdisciplinary themes are identified including solid earth and ice interactions, changes in the Southern Ocean, evolution of Antarctic life, and the history of the Antarctic Ice Sheets.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide partial support (airfare and meeting registration) for ~ 25 US participants enabling them to travel to Incheon, Republic of Korea and attend the SCAR International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences in July 2019. Preference will be given to applicants who are students and early career scientists. The call for applications will be broadly disseminated to encourage participation by underrepresented groups in the sciences. ISAES is a unique opportunity for US scientists to present their work to an international community and address fundamental Antarctic Earth Science questions from an interdisciplinary perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
