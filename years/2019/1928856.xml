<AbstractNarration>The investigators are leading the "Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History" (SMASH), a project to observe two nearby dwarf galaxies, visible in the southern hemisphere.  These dwarf galaxies, called the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), are a unique local laboratory for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies in exquisite detail. The investigators' goal is to observe the debris left over from star formation in these galaxies.  Using these observations, they will learn the history of formation of these dwarf galaxies and determine what type interactions these galaxies have had with our Milky Way Galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are working with the Zooniverse team, which connects research scientists with the volunteers in the general public that want to help with research.  The team will organize the data in a way that allows non-experts to group the stars into different categories, using web-based tools.  The Zooniverse software tools help researchers make progress, while making the process enjoyable for the volunteers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A decade ago, the interaction history of the Magellanic Clouds was thought to be well understood, with only minor details remaining to be explained. However, in the last decade, several important discoveries have been made which raise fresh questions about their structure and past history.   The observations indicate LMC-SMC interactions alone are responsible for the formation of the Magellanic Bridge, Stream, Leading Arm and neutral hydrogen extending half way across the sky.  These results point to a much richer and more complex structure than was imagined just a few years ago.  The investigators observations will uncover the vast, but low surface brightness, stellar structures in the Magellanic periphery and thereby unravel the complex interaction history of the Clouds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The formation and evolution of galaxies is still not well understood. The current "hierarchical" paradigm indicates that galaxies start out small and grow by successively merging and "swallowing" each other under the influence of gravity. During this process, galaxies get shredded leaving behind tell-tale signs of this process. While signifcant observational evidence has been obtained over the last twenty years for this happening in large galaxies, little has been learned about how smaller, dwarf galaxies grow. The goal of the SMASH survey has been to use the nearby Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) as a test-bed to study the growth of small galaxies.  SMASH is the deepest and most extensive survey of the structure of the Magellanic Clouds in the visible wavelength range, to date. This has allowed us to gain a better understanding of the structure and formation of these two dwarf galaxies and their interactions with each other.  With the deep SMASH data we have been able to detect very diffuse stellar structures in the periphery of the Magellanic Clouds.  Both of the galaxies have an extensive stellar "envelope" in their outskirts.  Although this is predicted from the hierarchical paradigm, the content of heavy elements in these stars measured by SMASH is inconsistent with that prediction.  A better explanation is that the interaction of the two galaxies with each other has flung out material and scattered it into their surrounding.  While the two galaxies are "eating" each other, there is no clear sign yet of smaller galaxies that were devoured by the Magellanic Clouds.  SMASH has also made interesting discoveries in the inner regions of the Magellanic Clouds.  Our state-of-the-art software has allowed us to obtain precise measurements even in the very "hearts" of the Magellanic Clouds where the density of stars is extremely high and challenging to work with.  We have made a number of discoveries that indicate the Clouds had close interactions and that it has left lasting impacts on their structures.  First, the LMC has a ring of stars surrounding it that can often be produced by galactic interactions.  Second, SMASH data indicate that the side of the LMC nearest the SMC is severely warped, likely due to an interaction.  Finally, the LMC is the prototype of the one-armed "Magellanic Irregular" galaxies and our results indicate that its star-forming arm has been long-lived and in place for the last two billion years when a close interaction of the Clouds with each other likely triggered its formation.  Citzen scientists have also helped SMASH achieve its goals.  Humans actually perform better than computer software at identifying star clusters in images.  Using the Zooniverse platform, almost 600,000 visual classifications in the SMC were performed and helped create a reliable catalog of 300 SMC star clusters.
