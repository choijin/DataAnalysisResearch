<AbstractNarration>Algebraic geometry is the study of geometric shapes which can be defined by algebraic equations in several variables. These shapes can be assembled from certain basic building blocks of three types: Fano, Calabi-Yau, and general type. Fano shapes are positively curved like the surface of a ball. They have been classified completely in dimensions one, two, and three by delicate geometric arguments and case-by-case analysis. According to the mirror symmetry phenomenon from theoretical physics, Calabi-Yau shapes come in pairs X and Y such that geometric properties of X correspond in a precise way to different geometric properties of Y, and vice versa. There is a version of mirror symmetry for Fano shapes as well: if X is a Fano shape of dimension n then its mirror partner is a union of Calabi-Yau shapes of dimension n-1. This project will use mirror symmetry to develop an approach to classification of Fano shapes which is amenable to computation, and to investigate new viewpoints on Fano shapes provided by the mirror correspondence. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Fano manifolds are positively curved spaces that play a central role in algebraic and complex geometry. There are finitely many topological types of Fano manifold in each dimension. Fano manifolds of dimension at most three have been classified by hand, but due to the scale of the problem a computational approach to classification is needed in higher dimensions. There is a version of the mirror symmetry phenomenon that applies to Fano manifolds: the mirror partner of a Fano manifold X of dimension n is the total space Y of a one parameter family of Calabi-Yau manifolds of dimension n-1. This project will use the mirror correspondence to describe a computational approach to the classification of Fano manifolds and to develop new perspectives on the geometry of Fano manifolds, using tools from toric geometry, birational geometry, deformation theory and moduli, Hodge theory, and enumerative geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
