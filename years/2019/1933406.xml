<AbstractNarration>The AfricaRice Advanced Crop Improvement (ACI) short course will build a network of collaborative young US scientists that understand how plant science will help address global problems. The content will focus on modern crop improvement strategies, how they can be incorporated into crop improvement, and the sociological and economic issues for their acceptance by farmers and consumers. By showcasing real-world issues faced in crop production and delving deeply into state-of-the-art crop improvement methods and the controversial issues associated with their use, the ACI short course will bring the science and sociological issues alive to the participants. The participants will learn how the science of crop improvement intimately links to food security, the national and international politics of food and agriculture, and science communication, attracting them to explore career and research options in this area. Other outcomes of the workshop will be up-to-date educational materials, brief podcasts and a publishable position paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the AfricaRice Advanced Crop Improvement (ACI) short course is to build a network of collaborative young scientists that understand the importance of innovative plant science in addressing global problems. The ACI will focus on modern improvement strategies relevant to most crop species, including genomic selection and genome editing.  Classroom, lab, and field-based learning will be augmented by topical discussions on how advanced technologies and novel resources can be incorporated into crop improvement, and the sociological and economic issues for their acceptance by farmers and consumers. A team class project, in collaboration with a professional science writer/lecturer, will produce a concept note and podcasts of interviews of consumers, growers and scientists on issues related to the adoption of crops improved by various approaches. Graduates of the course will have a broader appreciation for international agriculture, collaborative approaches to science, and the possibilities for putting modern plant sciences into practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The increasingly growing population and the impact of climate change are challenging crop production and food security globally. With the advances in plant breeding and agricultural practices, effective solutions can be formulated and applied to address sustainable production constraints. Considering the complexity of the cropping systems, the best solutions may derive from holistic approaches that integrate different expertise and analytical processes. Therefore, it is critical to prepare researchers and the public to take advantage of the most advanced technologies, in addition to equipping the next generation of researchers with the skills necessary to effectively collaborate across disciplines, nations and cultures.</p> <p>To help meet the need for an empowered next generation of crop researchers, the course <em>Advanced Crop Improvement </em>(ACI) was designed by a group of scientists from AfricaRice, Colorado State University, Cornell University, and IRD (Institut de recherch? pour le d?veloppement, France) &nbsp;to bring together an international group of students, postdocs, and early career researchers for two weeks of interactive lectures and discussions, experiential learning, and project collaboration centered on advanced crop improvement approaches, technology adoption and communication.&nbsp; Twenty-three participants from Benin, Cameroon, Colombia, C?te d?Ivoire, Ethiopia, France, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, USA, and Zimbabwe, participated in the &nbsp;course held from October 27 to November 9, 2019 at the AfricaRice Regional Training Center in St. Louis, Senegal. Participants (12 females / 11 males) included MS and Ph.D. students and post-doctoral fellows and spanned diverse disciplines, such as plant pathology, plant breeding, entomology, agricultural economics, biotechnology, agronomy, and plant biology.&nbsp;</p> <p>Theoretical and practical learning was enhanced by discussions on how advanced technologies can be incorporated into crop improvement and the sociological and economic issues for their acceptance by farmers and consumers. Given the diverse range of participants? expertise, comprehensive lectures were given on everything from climate change to pathology, to bridge specialized understanding with the bigger picture. Topics like breeding history, local food trends, and soil structure, all play a role in navigating solutions for the rice industry.</p> <p>The course offered opportunities for the participants to have a better understanding of the complexity of adopting new technologies in the developed and developing worlds and described how the science of crop improvement intimately links to food security, national and international politics of food and agriculture, and science communication. As part of a team project that was guided by a reporter/communications expert, participants interviewed consumers, growers, millers, marketers, and scientists on issues related to crop production, nutrition, and the adoption of new technologies. These interviews were used for the production of podcasts. But the audio from the interviews wasn?t just handed over to a team of experts. Participants from the course collected their interviews and took them back to the training center for lessons on how to edit and arrange their podcasts, leaving them with a finished audio artifact and skills that they could take with them in the future.</p> <p>The practical learning offered during the ACI course also included a LAMP assay for disease diagnosis, and a genome editing lab exercise. In the field, participants also experienced what it?s like to work in a rice paddy. Teams learned about maintaining agricultural machinery, planted seedlings by hand, and got stuck in the mud! Beyond the science and practical learning, this course was a great opportunity for cultural exchange between the participants, who were always together in the training center, traveling on the bus or exploring Senegal, learning from its fantastic people, colorful dresses, and delicious food.</p> <p>The lectures, field experiences, and discussions were facilitated by 16 instructors from AfricaRice, Colorado State University, Cornell University, IRD, ISRA (Institut S?n?galais de Recherches Agricoles), and the University of D?sseldorf.</p> <p>Through the ACI course, the participants gained a better understanding of crop production challenges for food security; deeper knowledge of modern crop improvement approaches; practical experience on how to communicate science to their peers and to the potential beneficiaries of their research; experience in accomplishing scientific work in a multicultural and multidisciplinary group.</p> <p>Experiencing diverse cropping systems, interacting directly with international agricultural scientists, as well as consumers and growers provided participants with an appreciation for the complexity of adopting new technologies in the developed and developing worlds. With a better understanding of how the science of crop improvement intimately links to food security, national and international politics of food and agriculture, and science communication, participants could be attracted to explore career and research options in this area. Deliverables were an up-to-date syllabus upon which future ACI and similar courses can build; learning materials including lectures and reproducible lab protocols; and edited podcasts that cover topics related to the course.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/17/2020<br>      Modified by: Jan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Leach</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933406/1933406_10613004_1597701498639_ricearchitecturelecture2019--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933406/1933406_10613004_1597701498639_ricearchitecturelecture2019--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Understanding the architecture of rice."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933406/1933406_10613004_1597701498639_ricearchitecturelecture2019--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Understanding the architecture of rice."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ACI participants had interactive lectures from diverse scientists on a wide range of topics.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jan Leach</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Leach</div> <div class="imageTitle">Understanding the architecture of rice.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933406/1933406_10613004_1597701129419_Firstday--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933406/1933406_10613004_1597701129419_Firstday--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The 2019 Advanced Crop Improvement Class."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933406/1933406_10613004_1597701129419_Firstday--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The 2019 Advanced Crop Improvement Class."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Twenty-three participants from Benin, Cameroon, Colombia, Cote de Ivoire, Ethiopia, France, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, USA, and Zimbabwe, participated in the  ACI course held from October 27 to November 9, 2019 at the AfricaRice Regional Training Center in St. Louis, Senegal.</div> <div class="imageCredit">AfricaRice</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Leach</div> <div class="imageTitle">The 2019 Advanced Crop Improvement Class.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933406/1933406_10613004_1597701296131_interviewingfarmersACI2019--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933406/1933406_10613004_1597701296131_interviewingfarmersACI2019--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Interviewing farmers at the 2019 ACI."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933406/1933406_10613004_1597701296131_interviewingfarmersACI2019--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Interviewing farmers at the 2019 ACI."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ACI participants interviewed consumers, growers, millers, marketers, and scientists on issues related to crop production, nutrition, and the adoption of new technologies.
