<AbstractNarration>This award to the University of Hawaii (UH) System results in the acquisition, deployment, and maintenance of a high-performance cluster to support computational and data intensive research for the UH campuses, supporting data science research that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence. Focusing on three multi-disciplinary research efforts (Data Science Institute (HI-DSI), Ike Wai: Securing Water Future for Hawaii (EPSCoR RII Track 1), and Center for Microbiome Analysis through Island Knowledge and Investigation (C-MAIKI)), the investigators aim to impact a broad range of research that primarily involves 15 pre-tenured faculty. The cluster will be managed as a shared resource servicing various goals that include: &lt;br/&gt;1. Advance technical training, &lt;br/&gt;2. Support for researchers who use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in their research, &lt;br/&gt;3. Support High Throughput Computing (HTC) users, &lt;br/&gt;4. Broadening the multi-campus user base through training activities and support, and &lt;br/&gt;5. Expanding educational and research opportunities in the classroom and in hands-on immersive training workshops. &lt;br/&gt;The HI-DSI is diverse UH system-wide effort that serves as a nexus for expertise in data science research and education. This effort creates new knowledge important to the islands and the global community to improve national security and derive economic value from its research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides the critical computational resources, and technical human infrastructure (a cadre of early career faculty from top tier institutions recently recruited) to ensure that these new investigators thrive in the university. The UH Information Technology Services-CyberInfrastructure (ITS-CI) will continue training and collaborate with HI-DSI to add new data science training modules and workshops. These activities will augment formal classroom education and support graduate and undergraduate research projects. The investigators will work to engage new user communities and help design training programs to meet the needs of the researchers. The cluster, managed as a shared campus resource free to all researchers, will contribute to keep researchers at the leading edge of their programs and better prepare students for careers in research and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
