<AbstractNarration>In September of 2019, the first of three Southeastern Number Theory Meetings planned for the 2019-2020 academic year will take place at University of North Carolina at Charlotte, NC. The local host at UNCC will be Arindam Roy. Clemson University in Clemson, SC will host the second meeting in December 2019. The local hosts will be Kevin James and Hui Xue. The third meeting is tentatively planned for April 2020, with the location to be determined during the meeting on April 2019.  The meetings consist of participant talks on current research in all areas of number theory, including analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms. These topics reflect the research interests of number theorists working in the Southeast. Each meeting features plenary talks by nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field, invited talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a larger number of contributed talks by mathematicians at all levels including undergraduate and graduate students, and junior and senior faculty. Number theorists from outside the Southeast will give the invited and plenary talks, while regional researchers will give most of the contributed talks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A primary purpose of the Southeastern Number Theory Meetings is to regularly convene Southeastern number theorists at all career stages and from all types of institutions at low cost to the participants. Participants and speakers include graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty. Efforts will be made to increase participation of undergraduates. Many participants come from institutions that do not award Ph.D. degrees. Such participants often have limited access to travel funds or to research seminars. The Southeastern Number Theory Meetings serve the purpose of integrating them into the larger research community. The organizers will also continue to try to attract a demographically diverse participant base, including women and racial and ethnic minorities. As a means of engaging undergraduates at host institutions, we will include an accessible Friday colloquium lecture by one of the plenary speakers. The Southeastern Number Theory Meetings are designed to both strengthen and invigorate the number theory community in the Southeast. By working together, its members can achieve more than by working alone. Further information on these meetings including the locations, dates, lists of speakers, lists of participants, and registration information will be linked to the conference home pages as it becomes available: http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html and http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
