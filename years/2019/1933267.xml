<AbstractNarration>The  2019 Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference will take place at the University of Michigan-Dearborn on October 11-13 2019. The conference will showcase recent developments in several complex variables, functional analysis, operator algebras, operator theory and related fields. The Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference series started back in 1980's and has significant impact in the field. It provides  a unique opportunity for senior and junior researchers to interact and initiate joint projects. The funds from the National Sciences Foundation will cover travel expenses and accommodation for the invited speakers, graduate students, and junior researchers without external financial support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together the leading experts in these fields with junior researchers and  graduate students. The interaction between these groups will be promoted by an additional workshop-style problem session on the second day. The conference will particularly benefit the growing number of junior researchers and graduate students in these fields at Midwestern and East Coast universities.
