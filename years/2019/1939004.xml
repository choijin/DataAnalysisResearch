<AbstractNarration>This award supports student travel support to the International Green and Sustainable Computing Conference (IGSC), a leading conference in this area. The conference will enable researchers and students to the study and practice of using computing resources efficiently, which in turn can impact a spectrum of economic, ecological, and social objectives. Green computing has become an established interdisciplinary research area spanning across the fields of computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, and other engineering disciplines. With these funds, 20 travel grants will be provided to students who may otherwise not be able to attend IGSC and take advantage of the available learning and networking opportunities in the newly evolving research area of green computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This provides the students the opportunity to:&lt;br/&gt;o    Interact with top researchers in their research domain;&lt;br/&gt;o    Learn, listen, and exchange ideas with other students working in their research domain to build future collaborations;&lt;br/&gt;o    Learn what is considered state-of-the-art in Green and Sustainable Computing; and&lt;br/&gt;o    Attend topic specific workshops held in conjunction (which are not yet finalized), but from experience, they should be excellent and meaningful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very solid and dedicated recruitment strategy is presented on attracting and supporting women and under-represented minority students to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
