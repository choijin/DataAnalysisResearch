<AbstractNarration>This project will test a novel approach to riverscape monitoring and mapping by using new boat-based drone technology to measure river geometry, sediment type, river habitats, and riverbank erosion patterns. Recent scientific advances have demonstrated that river dynamics and habitats vary in the downstream direction not only in smooth, gradual ways, but also in non-smooth, complex ways at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. This mosaic-like "riverscape" is a challenge for existing research methods monitoring how rivers change through space and time, where habitats for specific organisms are or are not connected with one another, and how rivers could be managed.  One of the data collection devices to be tested is a small automated mapping boat that can be used by volunteer watershed managers and recreational river runners creating crowd-sourced (citizen science) data to monitor and map riverscapes.  The data that will be produced using these new methods are likely to be useful to watershed managers in diverse agencies, watershed groups, and other river-related entities. By engaging with stakeholders during the design and testing phase of the automated-boat data collection phase, the investigators aim to ensure that the results will be relevant to the many people involved in making river management decisions. Additionally, the technical methods developed for this project will be designed so that they can easily be recreated and reproduced by others wishing to do similar monitoring and mapping work. The plans, software, documentation, and data will be made available via the internet using an open-source licensing framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monitoring and mapping of river environments is a task usually completed by governmental agencies, private firms, scientists, and private individuals. River monitoring achieves a variety of objectives, such as examining where and at what rate rivers are eroding adjacent property and structures, for characterizing river habitat for restoration purposes, or for evaluating water volumes and water quality. To-date these measurements are mostly done manually, one station at a time, creating a very limited spatial picture of river environments and conditions. Management of rivers is thus conducted with very little detailed knowledge of these rivers. The project's research objectives are to: (1) Develop and test a new, small, drone-boat platform capable of collecting basic longitudinal river data with minimal user interactions; (2) Compare and validate the drone boat data with expertly-collected data using a fully-outfitted research marine craft; and (3) Evaluate if it is feasible to employ a citizen science approach to monitoring and mapping of longitudinal riverscapes by deploying the drone boat within several regional test watersheds. Although this research project will focus on rivers in the Pacific Northwest, the methods will be applicable to a wide array of rivers in the U.S and worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
