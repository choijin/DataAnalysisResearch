<AbstractNarration>This proposal will investigate the variations of uranium isotope ratios (234U/238U), a naturally occurring and easy-to-detect geochemical signature, in large Texas rivers that flow from northwest to southeast across the state. This study aims to understand in detail how changes of climate parameters (such as rainfall and temperature), rock type (sandstone, shale, limestone, and evaporite) and land uses (agricultural, urban, and natural) in Texas river basins control the river (234U/238U) ratios. Knowing this important information will advance knowledge of 1) how fast natural rocks break down to form soils and release solutes and mineral nutrients into river basins; 2) how surface water interacts with groundwater flow and whether certain observed water quality issues are related to agricultural or urban water uses; and 3) how to interpret (234U/238U) ratios in geological records such as carbonates in soils, caves, and travertine deposits to reconstruct past environmental and hydrological conditions. The gained knowledge will advance the scientific fields of low temperature geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology, and environmental science with important societal impacts especially related to water resources management. This study will support a team of 4 early to mid-career faculty, 3 graduate, and 8 undergraduate students from University of Texas at El Paso (a minority serving and Carnegie R1 university), Oregon State University/University of Kansas, and El Paso Community College (a large urban community college). This proposal will provide a valuable research and education opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students, and especially community college students from two geographically distinct regions (Southwest and Central USA) facing different but equally pressing water and environmental issues due to agriculture and urban development. Investigators will develop environmental science development programs (ESPD) with hands-on training both in the field and laboratory, online training modules, geohydrological field trips for the general public, and outreach events with the Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant and Earth Science day at El Paso. These experiences will allow students to develop necessary scientific research skills for their future career in Geoscience, Environmental Science, and Critical Zone Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riverine (234U/238U) ratios have great potential to advance the understanding of watershed functions, ecosystem services, water sustainability, surface and groundwater management, and global carbon and nutrient cycles. However, their widespread adoption for solving many critical geochemical and hydrological issues has been hindered by the inability to decipher the multitude of mechanisms that control (234U/238U) ratios across climate, lithology, and land use gradients. Here, researchers will test the umbrella hypothesis that riverine (234U/238U) ratios can be predicted by quantifying factors of alpha recoil and chemical dissolution at the weathering interfaces that are controlled by 1) climate parameters (precipitation and temperature) of the watershed; 2) lithological parameters of the weathering bedrock (e.g., grain size and mineral weatherability); and 3) water residence times; while land uses (agriculture and urban development) can overprint these natural signatures. Their approach is to leverage the strong environmental and geologic gradients across Texas river basins with sizes ranging from 10s-100s of km, at a critical regional scale that will fill the gap existing in current watershed studies. They will conduct a combined geochemical, geological, and geographic information system (GIS) study to investigate the controls of precipitation, lithology, and land uses on the riverine (234U/238U) ratios in Texas. They will also test (234U/238U) fractionation models in the existing literature across this matrix of drivers for the first time with the observed U isotope fractionation in these watersheds. The gained knowledge will be transferable outside of Texas as (234U/238U) fractionation is a ubiquitous signature observed in rivers, watersheds, and the geological record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
