<AbstractNarration>The international conference "Representation theory and integrable systems" will take place at ETH Zurich August 12-16, 2019. There will be twenty invited lectures by renowned experts, contributed talks by younger faculty, and a number of graduate student presentations. The goal of the conference is to study the recent advances in the area in the title and to educate the younger researchers. This award will fund participation of US scientists in this conference, with priority given to recent PhDs and underrepresented minorities, so they can share their research and learn about the new ideas in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum integrable systems are large families of commuting operators (Hamiltonians) acting on a vector space. Such families naturally appear in the representation theory of reductive Lie algebras and their corresponding quantum groups. The main goal is to study the spectra of the Hamiltoninians. It turns out that this question has deep connections to various mathematical theories: differential and difference equations, equivariant cohomology and K-theory, the theory of special functions, combinatorics, and more. The conference will provide a common venue for a diverse group of researchers who study the subject using different methods with different goals to interact and share recent advances. More details about the conference are available at http://rtis2019.math.iupui.edu/  and http://www.nccr-swissmap.ch/events/representation-theory-and-integrable-systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The international conference "Representation Theory and Integrable Systems" took place in ETH Zurich, Switzerland on August 12 - August 16, 2019. It brought together a diverse body of renowned experts and early career mathematicians who discussed the new developments in the fast expanding area of research on the boundary of mathematics and mathematical physics.   The conference united more than 80 scientists from 23 countries and featured 16 plenary talks, 17 invited talks, and 13 short talks. The speakers covered a wide range of topics centered at representation theory of various algebraic objects: Lie algebras and superalgebras,  quantum groups, Hecke algebras, vertex operator algebras, etc. The overarching motivation was applications to the study of integrable systems.  The NSF grant supported the travel and accommodation of 12 of US participants. The US-based mathematicians had an excellent opportunity to promote and disseminate their research, to establish new international collaborations, to learn from comments of leading experts in the field, and to build connections to many researchers with similar research interests.   More than half of the supported US participants where postdocs and graduate students who were given a rare chance to speak to a top level international audience and to enter the research community.
