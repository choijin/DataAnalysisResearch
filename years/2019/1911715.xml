<AbstractNarration>Summer Research Conference (SRC) in statistics and biostatistics, sponsored by the Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS), is held at General Butler State Resort Park in Carrolton, Kentucky on June 2-5, 2019.  The 2019 SRC is the 55th anniversary of that conference.  Its purpose is to encourage the interchange and mutual understanding of current research ideas in statistics and biostatistics, and to give motivation and direction to further research progress.  The project focuses on young researchers, placing them in close proximity to leaders in the field for person-to-person interactions in a manner not possible at most other meetings.  Speakers will present formal research talks with adequate time allowed for clarification, amplification, and further informal discussions in small groups. To enhance the recruitment and retention of under-represented groups in STEM fields, SRCOS has added an undergraduate component, Statistical Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE). The SURE encourages involvement of under-represented minorities, presents career opportunities in Statistics, provides a Real Data Analytics Workshop, as well as a graduate school information session.  Under the travel support provided by this award graduate students attended and presented their research in posters which are reviewed by more experienced researchers, while undergraduate students have been exposed to data analytics, graduate school opportunities in statistics and biostatistics, and career opportunities available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summer Research Conference (SRC) in statistics and biostatistics  is an annual conference sponsored by the Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS). The SRCOS is a consortium of statistics and biostatistics programs in the South, stretching as far west as Texas and as far north as Maryland.  This project is funding student participation in the 2019 Summer Research Conference (SRC) sponsored by SRCOS.  The meeting is particularly valuable for students and faculty from smaller regional schools at drivable distances, affording them the opportunity to participate and interact closely with internationally-known leaders in the field without the cost of travel to distant national or international venues.  This conference is strengthening the research of the statistics and biostatistics community as a whole, and particularly focuses on reaching under-represented undergraduate students with Statistics Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE 2019).  For all details, please consult the conference link at https://www.srcos.org&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
