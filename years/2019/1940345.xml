<AbstractNarration>This Coastlines and People (CoPe) conference will bring together tsunami and flash flood researchers from countries/regions such as the United States of America, Caribbean, Puerto Rico, Japan, Indonesia, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, Europe (flood researchers), Canada, and China. The international researchers, together with US participants, are drawn from a wide range of disciplines including social science, engineering, geoscience, urban planning, public policy/public administration, computational science, and mathematics. This conference will address fundamental issues on how to integrate diverse forms of social science data (i.e., survey, interviews, drills, field observations, cell phone or GPS) into interdisciplinary agent-based evacuation models. These qualitative or quantitative data exist often in fragmented and unstructured formats, an obstacle that impedes the development of a comprehensive model of people's evacuation from imminent tsunamis. The procedures for integrating empirical behavior data into mathematical evacuation models by engineers and computer scientists are only at the beginning stages of development. Engineers and computer scientists recognize the importance of including behavioral parameters in their models but typically oversimplify them by making unfounded assumptions that significantly diminish the value of the research products for policy makers. Conversely, social scientists have generally failed to collect data on people's actual and intended behavior that meet all of the engineers' and computer scientists' data needs. These problems of interdisciplinary integration, which have long plagued tsunami research, have begun to be overcome by hurricane researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, this conference will draw upon the experience in hurricane evacuation modeling, recognizing the substantial differences parameters such as the amount of forewarning - many days for hurricanes but only a few minutes for some tsunamis. Consequently, the conference participants will seek to identify critical data needs for tsunami evacuation modeling (e.g., warning dissemination times, household preparation times, evacuation mode choice, distance to safety). They will also examine the effects of household and community preparedness for tsunami evacuation, which varies between countries and from one community to another within each country. The conference participants will overcome the current research fragmentation by identifying behavioral datasets and mathematical models that have not been published in international English-language journals, establish protocols for post-tsunami behavioral data collection, and establish a collaborative network of international interdisciplinary researchers. The conference will also actively engage coastal emergency managers and governmental policy makers, who can share their community resilience challenges and seek opportunities to collaborate with researchers. At same time, this conference will create opportunities to actively engage undergraduate, graduate and K-12 students through a poster/paper competition, and coastal hazard literacy education opportunities. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this CoPe conference is to enable truly integrative and convergent interdisciplinary evacuation models integrating natural, social, and engineered systems for rapid onset disasters such as near-field tsunami and coastal flash flooding. This conference will bring together a highly-diverse group of academic researchers, educators, and agency professionals from many disciplines and countries around the world to identify knowledge gaps, challenges, barriers, and opportunities for integrated, interdisciplinary, and transformative evacuation modeling approaches for rapid onset coastal disasters such as near-field tsunami and coastal flash floods. The three-day symposium will feature keynote speeches by recognized leaders and sessions focusing on different themes on the integration of social science data into interdisciplinary evacuation models: (1) Current state-of-art interdisciplinary rapid onset disaster evacuation modeling from invited researchers, with each researcher being invited to contribute a perspective or case study paper to an edited volume; (2) Integration of social science data into interdisciplinary evacuation models; (3) Validation of interdisciplinary evacuation models; (4) Tsunami warning dissemination mechanism and communication channels; (5) Community-based testbeds and benchmark dataset; and (6) Integration of protective-action decision-making theory to interdisciplinary agent-based evacuation models. The expected outcomes are (1) an edited volume to document the identified knowledge gaps and a road map of future research directions; and (2) a journal special issue focusing on the use of agent-based models in hazard vulnerability, mitigation planning, evacuation modeling and planning to be published in a premier disaster related journal. The conference organizers plan to hold the workshop at the brand-new Marine Science Building at the Hatfield Marine Science Center located on Oregon State University's coastal campus in Newport, Oregon. Graduate students will have opportunities to present their research before world-renowned researchers. Simultaneously, they will be responsible for developing poster sessions and undergraduate student research competitions. Although this conference will focus on rapid-onset coastal disasters such as tsunami and flash foods, the knowledge gaps, key challenges, future directions, and emerging opportunities identified to enable interdisciplinary evacuation models from this conference will be transferable to other types of rapid-onset disasters such as wildfires, dam failures, levee breach floods, landslides, and hazardous materials releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
