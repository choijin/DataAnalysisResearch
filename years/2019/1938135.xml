<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial impact of this proposal is to reduce fraud in telecommunications.  Americans received approximately 26 billion so-called "robocalls" last year, and in March 2019, a new monthly record of 5 billion robocalls was reached, according to the FCC. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reports the agency is on pace to receive 5+ million complaints about robocalls in 2019, a 30% increase over 2018. Robocalling scammers rely on relatively cheap technology that works on a large scale, and new schemes are getting smarter and pose a growing threat. Significantly, robocallers leverage artificial intelligence (A.I.), synthesized voice (so-called "deep fakes"), and caller ID spoofing, creating fraud of over $22 billion annually.  This proposed project will work to reduce robocalls and associated fraud by filtering at the telecommunications device level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed innovation leverages new decentralized ledger technology with blockchain encryption, real-time parsing of records, and real-time machine algorithms to block robocalls and reduce connection delays. The goal of the proposed innovation is to dramatically reduce the volume of fraudulent phone calls.  This SBIR proposal focuses on filtering at the device level; initially applied to prevent robocalls, but potentially relevant for other secure applications.  The innovation leverages blockchain's shared storage and memory, ability to operate in a "trustless environment" (due to lack of cross-telecom network collaboration on centralized robocall lists), as well as advances in blockchain encryption, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and real-time parsing of records and machine algorithms to block robocalls and reduce connection delays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Robocalls are not merely a nuisance. In fact, 40% of all robocalls are scams generating over $26 Billion annually in fraud.  And robocall scams disproportionally impact the elderly at $3B a year, followed by disabled veterans, and students.  The key outcomes of this project were twofold. First, to determine the feasibility of BLOCKCHAIN/DLT for telecommunications data and call filtering services. An incoming call becomes "tokenized" by extracting, digitizing, and storing specific features onto a blockchain token where those data elements are permanently stored as a whitelisted or blacklisted caller ID enabling peer-to peer transfers of value (i.e. identification of trusted callers).  Second, a framework was created in which people own their mobile data, in which all transactions are transparent, and the blacklisted numbers are chosen democratically and in a manner consistent with state and federal laws.  The project also delivered new methods including a swarm intelligence mechanism to crowdsolve emerging scams, and Artificial Intelligence/Deep Learning models to detect, classify, and share information about emerging scams including disinformation and deepfakes with all users before they can spread and claim more victims.  Phase I resulted in the delivery of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on the Google Playstore that includes prototype gamification and the swarm intelligence mechanism which are key for leveraging real-time user sentiment to dynamically increase or decrease (metering) connection fees phone companies charge robodialers.  The approach will completely upend an economic model that hasnâ€™t changed in 30 years, and incentivize phone companies to reduce spam and scam calls. The approach also will incentivize telemarketers to reduce legal but nuisance calls because they will be subject to significantly higher connection fees.
