<AbstractNarration>Hurricane Florence caused extensive flooding in North Carolina. Facilities housing thousands of pigs and millions of chickens were flooded, causing the spread of the hog waste, manure, animal residue and potentially releasing dangerous pathogens into the water. The inundation after hurricanes may lead to the outbreak of one or more In agricultural-dependent coastal regions and the joint impact of extreme natural events on human and animal infrastructure has not been studied. A robust civil infrastructure (animal shelters, water distribution and treatment systems, transportation, and animal waste lagoons) is critical to minimize these interactions and to limit the outbreak of diseases after a natural disaster. Surveillance and detection of a broad range of pathogens are not usually initiated until a few human cases of infection are reported. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will collect key data on the presence and abundance of pathogens, which are often assumed otherwise, leading to potentially inaccurate reactive resource allocation strategies for disease outbreak prevention and containment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this RAPID project is to use genomic epidemiology combined with bioinformatics and computational phylogenetic analyses to track pathogen sources and dispersal in water bodies to create spatial pathogenic profiles. Water and soil samples will be systematically collected near flooded farms with upstream locations serving as controls. Results from field data collection and associated analysis will provide data on the abundance, presence, and source of pathogens in water to assess the functionality of water infrastructure in the studied regions. The pathogen profiles will be combined with the human population, socio-demographics, infrastructure damage information, and data from a rapid flood model to develop a preliminary index which will characterize the spatial risk of disease outbreaks in the affected region. The analysis will help provide guidance on where to focus countermeasures (infrastructure rehabilitation, medicines, emergency personal, relief, and clean water supplies) to contain the risk of infection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

We also isolated culturable S. enterica to identify the antibiotic resistance profiles of these same Salmonella isolates from the sampling regions of NC.  Significant Results:  1)      We detected Enterococcus, general E. coli, Enteropathogenic E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas, Legionella pneumophila, and Mycobacteria spp in at least one sample collected from NC. S. typhimurium, a typical diarrhea-causing pathogen in piglets, was present in more samples collected near flooded farms than in those collected near unflooded farms, downstream of the farms, and upstream of the flooded region of NC. S. typhimurium were also detected in FL samples. Among the FL samples, S. typhimurium were detected at the highest concentration near a flooded WWTPs. Compared to samples collected in NC, samples collected in FL were up to 1000 times lower in concentrations of S. typhimurium. These results show that flooding by hurricanes Florence and Michael clearly caused the spread of these bacterial pathogens.  2)      High Antibiotic Resistance Gene (ARG) level and similar ARG profiles were observed in all S. enterica isolates from both flooded and unflooded samples, suggesting that the antibiotic resistance was prevalent in S. enterica within this region.  3)      The research team has developed a robust relief supply optimization model that accounts for uncertainty in demand and capacity disruption. We develop a mathematical model which can help answer the following questions: (i) which distribution centers should be acquired?; (ii) which of the acquired distribution centers should be fortified?; (iii) which of the candidate relief shelters should be opened?; and, (iv) To which relief shelter should an affected area be directed to?; to minimize the cost of acquiring facilities and commodity, fortification of the distribution center, and transportation costs.
