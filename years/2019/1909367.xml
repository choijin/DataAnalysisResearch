<AbstractNarration>This research project will address how flood from hurricane landfalls impacts weather forecast models by collecting and analyzing field, radar, satellite observations of wind, rainfall, and flood. To extend the observation coverage beyond the government operated weather and hydrological stations, the scientists will collect data from non-regular government-operated weather stations in the area that was affected by Hurricanes Florence and Michael. The project could potentially provide observational evidences to improve weather forecast models for better heavy rainfall forecasts after hurricane landfalls. Improvement of weather forecast models for hurricane landfalls will benefit hurricane preparation especially for the states along the coast lines, leading to reduced damages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of researchers at Colorado State University and University of Texas at Arlington will work together with a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow to collect and compile near-surface wind data from in situ, radar, and satellite observations present along the North Carolina coast, and in particular the areas surrounding Albemarle Sound and Pamlico Sound, which encompasses the downstream estuaries of Chowan River, Pamlico River, and Neuse River, and was impacted by both Florence and Michael. In addition, they will use satellite observations in combination of the surface hydrological observations to estimate surface roughness changes. By comparing spatial variations of surface roughness changes and wind, they will investigate flood-rainfall-wind interactions. The significance of the interaction and the magnitude of the surface roughness change between pre-inundation and maximum inundation will provide useful information on whether these factors will be included in numerical forecast models for hurricane landfalls. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will recover and maintain time-critical wind data sets especially datasets in private sectors which are often not well maintained or broadcasted. The investigators will engage science community and agencies through meetings and web broadcast, and educating and training a graduate student and a post-doc research associate on conducting researches. The team will publish the data set in the CSU web portal, present their results at science conferences, work with agencies, in particular NOAA, to ensure that the forecasters are aware of the availability of the dataset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The project was aimed at collecting critical surface and lower atmospheric wind data during the landfall of Hurricane Florence in North Carolina in September 2018, and performing simple analysis to determine how the wind intensity could have been impacted by the flooding along the Neuse River.           The UTA project team has collected surface and remotely sensed wind data from three weather radar units operated by the National Weather Service with coverage over New Bern.  The coverage of radar unites is shown below:        The project team has created an online repository at hydroshare to share the data and documentations with the broad communities (https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/6088bb8112af4f289af290e0c9e435ac/), and a website at UTA describing the project and data (https://hydromet.uta.edu/hurricane-florence-inundation-near-surface-data/).    The UTA team also performed model simulations to reconstruct the flooding during Florence. The intent was to study how the extent of flooding was determined by finer scale wind variations.   The simulations were performed using a 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model, namely Delft-3D.  driven by two sets of wind and pressure fields produced at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The first one is a coarse-resolution North American Regional Reanalysis - a retrospective gridded analysis that took in surface observations, and the product is on a 32-km grid.  The second one is the Hurricane Weather Research Forecast  (HWRF) reanalysis, which is on a nested grid of 18/6/2-km resolutions. The simulated inundated areas are shown in the figure below.        The research contributes to the welfare of the society, and in particular that of the coastal communities in the following ways. First, it helps understand processes that give rise to flooding, and therefore enables the development of better tools for predicting the flooding.  Second, the availability of the data set through the online repository promotes the sharing of information with the research community as well as the public.  Third, the research team integrated the research into the education at UTA and exposed students with real-world issues and research needs, and thereby helps the students to be informed.
