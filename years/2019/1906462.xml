<AbstractNarration>The 17th International Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) meeting on Mechanisms in Plant Development will be held on July 28 - August 2, 2019 at St. Bonaventure University in Olean, New York. This meeting will bring together leading researchers from around the world to exchange unpublished ideas and advance concepts and new research directions for the field of plant developmental biology. Invited speaker sessions will focus on broad areas of plant development such as "Establishing the Body Plan", "Cell-Cell Communication", "Developmental Plasticity", "Maintaining the Meristem", and "Cellular Specialization". With NSF support, the meeting will promote the participation and recognition of early career scientists and those from underrepresented groups through numerous networking opportunities, poster sessions and career development workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference, which has been held at regular intervals for the past 25 years, is a unique international meeting devoted entirely to the field of plant developmental biology. The small size of the meeting leads to intense discussion of new ideas and emerging techniques in this exciting and rapidly moving field. It will bring together plant biologists using evolutionary, genetic, genomic, cell biological and computational approaches for exchange of ideas. The meeting includes outstanding researchers from around the world, presenting cutting edge, unpublished research on the mechanisms that control establishment of new tissues and lead to the self-organization of the plant body plan. This conference is an important and unique scientific meeting where the intersections of plant development, signaling, modeling and genomics are explored through talks, poster sessions, and intensive scientific discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
