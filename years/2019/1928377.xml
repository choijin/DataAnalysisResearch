<AbstractNarration>Much of our understanding of the geologic history of the Earth comes from radiometric dating of Earth processes. Currently, Earth scientists have a difficult time placing narrow constraints on the precise time that a fault occurs deep within the crust of the Earth. This project combines two state-of-the-science techniques to directly date the time of faulting along a key fault zone in southeast Alaska, and thereby date when ancient earthquakes occurred. Development of this new analytical technique will enable considerable future research and understanding of how Earth materials deform. In addition, this research project will provide training and research opportunities for a female graduate student and several undergraduate students. Visits to local elementary schools will enable potential future scientists to experience the methods and results of Earth science research, with direct implications for earthquake hazards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project consists of two principal objectives: 1) develop the mineral titanite as a tool for dating high-temperature deformation by a combined microstructural and microgeochronology approach, and 2) apply this tool to the evolution of the spectacular Coast Shear Zone and Great Tonalite Sill in the Coast Mountains orogen of southeast Alaska. Research methods will incorporate a field study to understand qualitatively the evolution of a mid- to deep crustal intra-arc shear zone and synkinematic sheeted-sill complex exposed in the Coast shear zone of Alaska and Canada. Titanite analyses will include electron-backscatter diffraction maps of titanite microstructure, and laser-ablation split-stream inductively coupled plasma maps of titanite composition that incorporate U-Pb dates. These data will allow assessment of the physical and chemical processes that affected the crystal, and the identification of crystals whose U-Pb distribution reflects high-temperature deformation. Because titanite is a widespread crustal mineral, this technique should have broad application globally and enhance our understanding of how crust deforms and orogens assemble and change through time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a collaborative effort with researchers from UC Santa Barbara to:  (1) develop new techniques to determine the age of high-temperature deformation,  (2) use these new techniques to constrain the age of deformation along the Coast Shear Zone of Southeast Alaska and coastal British Columbia,  (3) provide opportunities for undergraduate students from the University of Arizona to become involved in a high-profile research project, and  (4) use our findings to raise interest in Earth science among K-12 students, and especially students who belong to under-represented minority groups.  Following are the primary outcomes from each of these activities:  1. We have developed two different techniques for determining the age of high-temperature deformation. The first involves very detailed analyses of individual titanite crystals that have been distorted or reoriented during deformation. The second involves analysis of many different zircon, titanite, and apatite crystals from a thin section, which provides information about the age of cooling of the sample. Both of these techniques are of interest to researchers working in other regions.  2. Our new information demonstrates that the Coast Shear Zone was active between 60 and 50 million years ago. The age of the onset of deformation had not been previously determined.  3. This project has provided research opportunities for five undergraduate students and one MS student at the University of Arizona. Three of these students are female, and three belong to under-represented minority groups (Black, Asian, and Hispanic).  4. The results of our research have been presented on two occasions at STEM events with students at Mansfeld Middle School in Tucson, which has 85% under-represented minority enrollment.
