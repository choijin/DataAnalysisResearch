<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to support US-based students and postdoctoral associates and young professionals who will attend the 2nd International Conference on Microbiome Engineering to be held in Boston, in December 2019. The conference explores the importance and applications of microbiome engineering and will bring together leaders and experts from cutting edge fields of microbiome engineering to discuss progress and needs to develop research, technology, and innovation. The chairs and organizing committee of the 2nd International Conference on Microbiome Engineering are experts and leaders in their fields.&lt;br/&gt;The field of pharmaceutical design and microbiome engineering is growing rapidly and needs collaboration between the professionals and young researchers in biomedical science and engineering. This conference will provide a venue for scientific presentations from a diverse group of researchers; encourage active participation by graduate and undergraduate researchers who represent the future of the field; bring scientists and engineers together to provide an atmosphere and venue to discuss their disciplines and approaches, motivate new research into barriers limiting the development of microbiome modeling and engineering and will have a particular focus on females and scientists from underrepresented groups. Peer reviewed conference proceedings will be published on the AIChE website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
