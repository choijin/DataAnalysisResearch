<AbstractNarration>In this project, Texas Tech University will extend the previously successful industry-driven research program of the Cloud and Autonomic Computing (CAC) Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) as part of the NSF IUCRC program. The CAC Center currently comprises participants from two principal academic institutions, Texas Tech University (TTU) and the University of Arizona (UA), as well as two affiliate sites associated with TTU: the University of North Texas and Texas State University, and two international sites associated with UA: Universidad de Sonora, Mexico and American University of Malta. The mission of the NSF CAC Center across all participating sites is to conduct research and development activities that advance the knowledge of how to design and engineer highly distributed (cloud) and highly automated (autonomic) computing systems for practical applications with stakeholders including industry, federal agencies, and academia together. This grant will extend the IUCRC research of the CAC at TTU from Phase I to Phase II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TTU site of the NSF CAC focuses on advances in algorithms, methods, standards, and tools for cloud and highly automated computing systems. The Phase-II program of CAC@TTU site will continue research and development in areas including: 1) code development and Application Programming Interface (API) design for data acquisition, procedural, and workflow control; 2) high-performance data analytics and visualization in the cloud and autonomic computing settings; 3) improvements to practical applications of methods that use these and other cloud and autonomic computing techniques and methods; 4) standards implementations and design for cloud software and underlying infrastructure; and 5) applications of the above to data center control based in both industry and academic arenas. The CAC@TTU site will pursue these overall themes while remaining open to new and emerging opportunities that relate to the needs of current and future industry members or that come up through pursuit of the program of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funding for this project plays a key role in facilitating and promoting research collaboration among stakeholders including industry, federal agencies, and academia. This project will also train a broadly inclusive and globally competitive science workforce for the nation by integrating the latest development and advanced knowledge into mentoring and educational activities. Texas Tech University is a Hispanic-Serving Institution, and the Phase-II CAC@TTU effort will leverage its experience in Phase I to carry out research and development activities to have broader impacts, including targeted efforts to integrate hands-on learning experiences for historically under-represented population groups, actively engaging undergraduate students in research programs, and organizing community activities such as workshops and conferences. These activities will also be coordinated with the overall CAC center program of broader engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phase-II CAC@TTU site will distribute portions of its output through GitHub repositories (https://github.com/nsfcac) and websites including https://nsfcac.org/, http://cac.ttu.edu/, and https://discl.cs.ttu.edu/ for public releases of software, data, and results. The project members will provide industry motivation, expertise, and materials to facilitate research and development progress. The websites and repositories will be maintained for three years past the project completion date, and principal investigators will strive to maintain the associated output software products that remain in use as long as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
