<AbstractNarration>Cell function is tightly coupled to cell shape in plants where the cell wall defines cell shape and maintains the physical structure of the plant.  Creating cell shape requires carefully expanding the cell walls, a process that involves the patterned deposition of cellulose fibers into the cell wall and the controlled activation of cell wall enzymes.  Intracellular polymers, termed microtubules, serve as critical pattern generators for cellulose deposition during plant growth.  This project examines the molecular and cell biological mechanisms driving the organization of these microtubules into specific array patterns and seeks to determine how plant hormones, such as auxin and brassinosteroids, coordinate microtubule patterning with cell expansion to affect a morphogenetic program.  By understanding the mechanisms by which microtubules form patterns, researchers may one day be able to engineer plant morphogenesis and create smart cellulosic materials.  This project will have broader impacts through training undergraduate researchers in the Integrated Freshman Learning Experience honors program, which is linked to Indiana University's residential STEM programs that have 50 women enrolled.  Underrepresented students will be recruited through the SACNAS and ABRCMS programs to help broaden participation in this STEM field.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because microtubules direct the deposition of cellulose fibers into the cell wall that are required for creating plant cell shape, this project seeks to understand the molecular mechanisms by which microtubule patterning is controlled.  Using a multi-disciplinary approach, this project will integrate genetic screens, computational modeling, live-cell imaging, and mass-spectrometry to identify and characterize genes hypothesized to control the dynamic transitions between the different microtubule array patterns, as well as to discover how microtubules are created in specific positions within the cell.  Time-course imaging will be employed to examine how, and in what capacity, information from the microtubule cytoskeleton is transferred to cell wall materials for controlling expansion anisotropy.  Additional work will focus on two previously identified genes that alter the dynamic properties of the microtubules, leading to defects in microtubule array patterning with subsequent cell morphology defects.  In summary, the project seeks to define the central molecular mechanisms driving plant morphogenesis at the cellular level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
