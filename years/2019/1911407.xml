<AbstractNarration>This award will partially support the participation of approximately 40 participants in the "Superconductivity: Today and Tomorrow" symposium to be held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, on March 29th and 30th, 2019. Preference will be given to supporting students and postdoc participants. The symposium will feature invited talks from 20 leading scientists. The aim of the symposium will be to discuss recent progress in superconductivity, discuss new ideas, determine future research directions, and enable future collaborations among the participants. As a product of the symposium, the organizers will produce a report on the current status and future prospects for the field, summarizing key points of the presentations and the relation to NSF big ideas, such as Harnessing the Data Revolution and Quantum Leap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Research in unconventional superconductivity is relevant to broader  NSF mission which includes the discovery of novel materials with  controllable properties. Commonly, the superconducting transition is  just one of many phase transitions revealed by unconventional  superconductors. These phase transitions can be controlled by various  external stimuli, offering potential for future technologies.   Superconducting power applications boast several properties that can  prove them environmentally advantageous over conventional electric power  applications. Such are, for example, up to 50% lower losses, which  means savings in electricity and thus savings in greenhouse gas  emissions from electricity production, and less raw materials required  to construct devices resulting in lower environmental impact of  manufacturing.   NSF funds were used to partly support junior participants of  the  symposium "Superconductivity: Todfay and Tomorrow", which was held on  the campus of the University of Illinois, March 29-30, 2019.  The symposium was dedicated to the memory of our colleague Prof. David Pines, who  made seminar contributions to the field of superconductivity, and who  passed away on May  3, 2018.   The talks at the symposium were dedicated to search for new materials  with  exotic superconducting properties, to novel instrumentation  methods with broad relevance to research  in new materials, and to  advances in theoretical studies, including the application  of machine   learning  technique to study superconductivity.
