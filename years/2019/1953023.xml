<AbstractNarration>Deep technologies (deep tech) are typically defined as those that are based on substantial scientific discoveries and engineering advances with high potential to profoundly impact existing and emerging industries as well as peopleâ€™s lives. Because challenges facing deep tech startups are different from those for other startup companies, they frequently take longer time and require more financial resources to reach market-ready maturity. To strengthen our economic and technological competitiveness, it is critical to explore methods and develop best practices to accelerate deep tech commercialization. The Deep Dive Into Deep Tech Incubation workshop will bring together key players in the deep tech ecosystem, including incubators, universities, government, investors, and industrial partners. The Workshop aims to address fundamental issues of deep tech commercialization, providing an opportunity for participants to share knowledge and form partnerships with the ultimate goal of accelerating time to market of deep tech. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deep Dive Into Deep Tech Incubation Workshop will convene thought leaders and key stakeholders from the deep tech incubation ecosystem around the country to (1) better understand relationships among incubators, universities, government, investors, and industrial partners; (2) explore how to most effectively engage with incubators and other venture development organizations that provide deep tech incubation; (3) study how to advance the deep tech incubation ecosystem and grow more and stronger early-stage deep-tech companies in the U.S.; and (4) share best practices among stakeholders. The Workshop will generate knowledge and insights in deep tech incubation and foster collaborations among participants, accelerating time to market for deep tech. Given its broad scope and success in deep tech research and incubation, the State University of New York (SUNY) is uniquely qualified to lead the planning, execution and post-program follow-up of the Workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
