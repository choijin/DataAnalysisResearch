<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for travel support for young participants attending the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) Symposium on Shape Memory Alloys, being held in Austin, Texas, from April 28 through May 2, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium will bring together scientists from very diverse backgrounds who work on different aspects of foam mechanics in order to present their work to researchers with whom they do not usually interact. The intellectual growth that results from the interactions and cross-fertilization of ideas and approaches that take place at the symposium should be a lasting experience to all attendees. The symposium will include graduate students, post-docs and young researchers who will benefit by their interaction with the best researchers in the mechanics of shape memory alloys in the world. The lectures will be video taped and be available for viewing by anyone at a dedicated website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Shape memory alloys are metals that exhibit the unique characteristics of: (a) shape memory, where the material reverts back to its original shape shape after undergoing seemingly large and permanent deformation by imposing a modest increase in temperature; and (b) pseudoelasticity that describes the ability of the material to be deformed to strains of a few percent, which are large for metals, and return to its unstrained configuration on unloading. Both effects are derived from transformations between two solid-state phases, austenite and martensite, which can be induced by either changes in temperature or stress. These characteristics are being exploited in novel structural applications in diverse fields like biomedical devices, aerospace components, damping and energy absorption, MEMS, morphing of structures, and generally "smart" structures.    This project received funding for participant travel support for an international symposium sanctioned by the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. Such symposia are highly selective and and are used to disseminate scientific knowledge amoung internationally renowned researchers in the specific technical area. The intellectual merit of the symposium stemmed from bringing together researchers who through the use of experiment, theory and numerical modeling try to understand the complex nonlinear phenomena that govern shape memory alloy material and structural behavior. This included mechanicians, materials scientists, applied physicists, and numerical modelers. This diversity of backgrounds has resulted in the cross-fertilization of ideas and approaches that is leading to significant advances to the field. The broader impacts of the symposium originated from the training and participation of students and  junior scientists. We sought out and encouraged graduate students, post doctoral researchers, and junior faculty to attend and present their work at the symposium. A poster session was organized where graduate students presented their research progress. Of the 49 participants, there were 14 graduate students, 5 post doctoral researchers, 6 assistant professors, and 5 associate professors.   The symposium took place at the AT&amp;T Conference Center on the campus at the University of Texas at Austin.
