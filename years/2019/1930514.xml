<AbstractNarration>This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Texas Tech University.  Over its five-year duration, this project will fund four-year scholarships to 38 students who are pursuing Bachelor of Science degrees in biology, chemistry &amp; biochemistry, geosciences, mathematics &amp; statistics, or physics &amp; astronomy.  This project aims to improve retention of STEM students from rural areas by combining best practices for retention with the distinct features and strengths of the rural community.  The project seeks to reshape understandings of the responsibilities of institutions of higher education with respect to rural communities.  It also plans to provide models for student success that are transportable to other institutions serving these important communities. Because Texas Tech University is a Hispanic-serving Institution, this project has the potential to broaden participation and increase diversity in the STEM workforce.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The project focuses on developing a community-based, cross-departmental scholarship program that supports students from rural areas. It seeks to leverage the strengths of rural communities through infusing foundational courses in mathematics and research with examples drawn from rural experiences as well as creating and supporting research, service-learning, and internship opportunities that are responsive to rural issues. At the center of the project are case studies designed to capture nuances of identity, including ethnicity, rurality, and attachment to place and community, thus targeting the relatively neglected intersection of rurality and higher education. A conceptual framework rooted in Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) and informed by Theory of Place is intended to create insights into the changing demographic of rurality. Project evaluation will provide formative feedback regarding the effectiveness of recruiting strategies and program elements as well as summative evaluation of the extent to which the project meets retention and graduation targets and successfully disseminates transferable knowledge and strategies. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
