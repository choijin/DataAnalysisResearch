<AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Catchment Science was conceived on the idea of improving the understanding of interaction among hydrology, biology and geochemistry in catchments (also known as watersheds), which are hydrologic drainage areas that act as systems and encompass interconnected physical, chemical, and biological processes that determine the composition, regime, and value of water. No other hydrologic science meeting is focused on this goal. The Catchment Science GRC, has taken place biennially since 1991 and continues to represent a unique opportunity for scientists from academic institutions and government agencies from around the world in this field. The GRC on Catchment Science and the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS, for early career scientists and students) includes members from broad ranging disciplines but maintains a focus on interactions among hydrology, biology and geochemistry in catchment science. The conference will identify new research opportunities and define new research questions in catchment science from an integrative, multidisciplinary standpoint. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Conference on Catchment Science is a biennial event that draws an international audience and mixes established researchers with new investigators. This year's conference theme is "Transcending the Uniqueness of Place in the Age of Big Data" and will examine how process research and large-scale, high resolution modeling can be used to advance scientific understanding. Unraveling catchment functions and transferring knowledge to other sites requires an integrated physical, chemical, and biological perspective. The Gordon Research Conference and the Gordon Research Seminar on Catchment Science are designed with a format that favors discussion, interaction, and a focus on cutting edge, interdisciplinary science. The conference fosters exchange among hydrologists, ecologists, engineers, soil scientists, and biogeochemists.  The conference will enable catchment scientists from different disciplines to share and learn from one another in order to identify opportunities for research and scientific advancement. The conference will host a pre-conference Graduate Research Seminar where young investigators can discuss their work and gain valuable one-on-one council from investigators at a more advanced career stage. The Graduate Research Seminar provides opportunities for the exchange of ideas among early career investigators and the opportunity to build relationships with peers that will form the next generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
