<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to offer enhanced accessibility to bring the unbanked into the banking system by creating a savings product that is a compelling alternative to lotteries and sweepstakes. More than half the people within the US are estimated to lack $2,000 in savings for emergencies.  The proposed product could combine the ability to save aggressively, with exposure to the upside of lottery style winnings that are attractive to many consumers.  This prize-linked stablecoin is enabled by blockchain, which offers efficiencies and transparency beyond what is available in current lotteries. The commercial impact is substantial: as of 2019, The Global FinTech blockchain market has been estimated to reach $34 B by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 74.2%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will focus on application of random number generator (RNG) research and cryptography, as this is the critical link in games of chance.  A lottery system of this scale requires a hack-resistant and collusion-resistant RNG. In current chance-based systems, the lack of a robust RNG is the weak link and leaves organizations vulnerable to cyberthreats. This project proposes to develop and deploy a robust, secure, decentralized and trusted random number generator. The decentralization and cryptography of blockchain provides the essential architecture to build our RNG. The resiliency of such a robust and trusted RNG will have value in deployments beyond blockchain and financial products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Local Stablecoins -- Banking the Unbanked Efficiently. (f k a Prize-Linked Stablecoin)     Accomplishments Overall achieved our stretch goal of creating a commercial proof-of-concept software app and deploying it to 20+ users for testing and feedback.  Functionality of app includes deposit/withdrawl, send/receive and buy/sell using the Local Stablecoin and contactless payments via QR code scanning. Lottery:  Also achived our stretch goal of deploying a lottery with winning distribution system. Our research into Decentralized RNG resulted in an implementation within our App to select winners from the current wallet holders and automatically distribute the winnings from an existing pool.  This is deployed an operational. Random Number Generator:  We achieved our goal of operating the Decentralized RNG on a testnet, and also deploying a lottery system (see above).  Next steps are to have the system reviewed by an auditor. Partnerships:  We accomplished outreach to a number of local currency organizations across the country and are following up with implementation of a digital stablecoin for deployment as a local currency.      Intellectual Merits      The research into Decentralized Random Number generators uncovered significant challenges in technical implementations of various solutions but also uncovered the economic issues inherit with distributing winnings above a certain threshold where any centralized organization would find itself subject to bribery due to the large reward. Looking at the solutions from both a technical and economic framework uncovered important approaches to widespread deployment of blockchain-based lottery systems. We have successfully deployed a system which is designed to handle this combined challenge and have published our findings.     Broader Impacts:      Even before COVID19, bringing people out of the economic shadows and into the mainstream is a $380B opportunity.  Now with the country facing a tremendous economic challenge especially in disadvantaged areas, the impact and urgency for our solution is now. Historic levels of unemployment (10-16M people) not seen since the great depression is creating strong demand for new economic tools ? and local economies investing in themselves is a strong candidate to help lift the unemployed and regain stability. And Local Stablecoins are a critical element to ensuring neighbors invest in neighbors.          Last Modified: 10/05/2020       Submitted by: Steve Derezinski]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
