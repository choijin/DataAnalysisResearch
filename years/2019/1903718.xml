<AbstractNarration>Over the past 50 years, the discipline of geomorphology has evolved substantially over a relatively short timescale. General, historical interpretations and descriptions of the landscape were replaced by detailed studies to understand processes at fine scales using quantitative techniques. Soon thereafter, new tools and technology improved data collection techniques and expanded observations, providing geomorphologists with a wealth of data to reveal new research questions. Contemporary geomorphology has become a challenging system science that evaluates the interaction and complex connectivity among many variables and incorporates many other disciplines. The history of the discipline is an important educational resource that can be used to help shape perspectives of modern geomorphologists. The 50th Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium (BGS) will be a milestone event which provides an introspective assessment of the past and future of the discipline. The agenda for this BGS aims to make the event more student friendly and diverse. The plans include a peer mentoring program called "Rocky Mountain Rendezvous" to connect students and senior researchers, coordination with Diversity Officers and Equal Opportunity Offices at local colleges, and a panel discussion designed to address the challenges of inclusivity. A Diversity and Inclusion Statement will be developed and included in conference materials as well as on the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the past 50 years, BGS has offered many benefits to the scientific community, culminating in 25 special issues of Geomorphology and other book publications for the early symposia. The longevity and continued success of the BGS to advance the discipline has been recognized at a global scale. The symposium continues to provide a prominent forum for established and emerging scientists to present, exchange, and disseminate methods, techniques, and results on geomorphic research to the global community. Because of its size and focus, the symposium offers an unrivalled opportunity to engage actively in discussion with a broad range of scientists linked by the discipline. Opportunities for scientists, researchers, and students to interact closely in single-session symposium for an extended period are virtually non-existent at large society meetings such the American Geophysical Union (AGU), Association of American Geographers (AAG), and Geological Society of America (GSA). Whereas the symposium will contribute substantially to the scientific foundations of geomorphic research, it also will address topics of great importance and relevance to society, including topics such as natural hazards, environmental change, human impacts, landscape evolution and management, and policy. The organizers have plans to attract attendees from a broader range of countries, which will infuse the discipline with a richer international character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium (BGS) celebrated its golden anniversary in 2019.  Fifty years have passed since Donald R. Coates and Marie E. Morisawa organized a symposium to bring geomorphologists together in a single venue.  As faculty members at The State University of New York, they foresaw that such an event was needed to enhance the science.  From this small university and city in central New York (NY), a geomorphology event blossomed into an international event that influences geomorphic thought, theory, and has shaped the direction of the discipline. The 50th BGS provided a perspective of geomorphology from its historical past to potential advancements in the future.  The 50th BGS consisted of 17 invited papers presented in sessions representing Forces 1 (i.e., water, wind, wave, and ice); Forces 2 (i.e., planetary geomorphology, tectonics, and gravity); biogeomorphology and soils; and concepts, paradigms, and traditions.  Papers were published in a special issue of Geomorphology.  Ninety professionals attended the conference, which was held from October 11th through 13th, 2019.     Broader Impacts  The 50th BGS was held at Metropolitan State University of Denver, a diverse, Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), predominantly an undergraduate, teaching institution and included 7 undergraduate student poster presentations and 25 graduate student presentations.  Roughly 30% of conference attendees were female, 9 came from international venues, and 15 were from underserved populations.
