<AbstractNarration>The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program.  Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As human population continues to grow, the strain on our natural resources will also increase. Basic human needs for water, food, and shelter cannot be met without energy and resource consumption. In fact, approximately 40% of the energy consumption is attributed to housing (i.e., heating and cooling, cooking, waste disposal, entertainment, etc.). Our current practices for supplying these needs with current singular-use technologies are not as efficient as they could be in combination with other technologies. However, the adoption of more efficient technologies is outside the affordability of most of the populations.  The primary goal of a planning grant for a Center for Empathetically Engineered Profitable Housing (CEEPH) is to develop the science, engineering, financial, policy-related, and social information required to create homely single-family and multi-tenant housing that are also profitable for their owners.   In other words, these housings would generate revenues sufficient to pay the cost of their financing and to provide the owners with an additional income while meeting the design needs for residential use, and home-based businesses.  A secondary goal of the CEEPH is to include as diverse a perspective in the research as possible, which will be accomplished through a diverse group of researchers from the collaborating universities as well as stakeholders involved in the planning grant. The planning grant will be crucial to bring together this diverse (in terms of disciplines, gender, race, and backgrounds) group of researchers and stakeholders to developing the ERC activities and management. We envision dwellings that generate surplus electricity, require zero or near-zero water input, supply the owners with food via hydroponics and additional income streams, while ensuring satisfaction in home-ownership through empathetic and collaborative design.  CEEPH will also serve as a regional resource for workforce development through training regional contractors, architects, house subsystem service providers, city leaders, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ERC in this area has the potential to foster the interdisciplinary discovery of novel scientific and engineering knowledge that could significantly improve all humans' impact on our environment through the development of environmentally friendly and sustainable technologies. The Center would be founded on the fundamentally transformative principle that integrated residential power generation and potable water production from human and household organic waste (among other solutions) is a scientifically sound and socio-economically viable and responsible approach. In addition, a potential Center's research outcomes would have far more disruptive impacts on current housing designs as we propose an active and living ecosystem that is self-sustained by internal symbiosis and synergy. One of the important pillars of the planning grant for the proposed CEEPH is the inclusion of all aspects of housing design with numerous stakeholders' input.  This planning grant will provide an opportunity for potential ERC participants and stakeholders to participate in a two-day intensive discussion at Mississippi State University to strengthen the development of the goals for the proposed ERC, communication pathways, plans for an inclusive environment, and identification of additional stakeholders. The planning grant activities will focus on the development of diverse interdisciplinary teams and address challenges related to team science by establishing pathways to strong communication and collaboration between the scientists, engineers, economists, policy researchers, architects, and stakeholders. Since the proposed Center activities could have significant impacts in developing countries, the planning grant will be used to identify international partners that would benefit from these discoveries and give a global prospective on the impacts of center's activities.  Consequently, outcomes of this planning grant activities help prepare for the anticipated center?s research on empathetically designed housing models that will be self-sustainable and profit-deriving sources for the homeowners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tangible results: Development of an interdisciplinary team that has the ability to address societal needs in the areas of housing, energy, water, and/or food.     Dissemination of the preliminary knowledge related to understanding and in-depth discussions of the conceptual design perspective and prospects of future sustainable homes with over 25 researchers in eight universities across the country.     Intangible Results (or outcomes?): Alignment of five major research-intensive universities and their missions to think forward on the need for affordable and sustainable housing.     Realization (by the expert team of this project) of the necessity for preparing future workforce to have more forward and outward thinking in creating better ecosystems that co-dwell with human race.   We were able to introduce many junior faculty members to interdisciplinary research concepts and expose them to a truly convergent research approach.  Many of our engineering researchers had never collaborated with researchers from sociology, economics, or political science.  We were also able to host a virtual discussion with Dr. Steve Fiore of the University of Central Florida on Team Science and Convergent Research which was beneficial to all team members. This project has inspired one of the faculty members at MSU to expand and apply the sustainable housing concepts to nationwide competitions such as solar decathlon design challenge in which more than 50 undergraduate students from diverse disciplines are participating.  Key outcome   The submission of our Pre-Proposal to the ERC program call in October 2020.       Last Modified: 12/21/2020       Submitted by: William French]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
