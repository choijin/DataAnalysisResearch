<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by organizing a dissemination outlet for grant holders from NSF programs that support engineering education. Specifically, it will support a poster session at the American Society for Engineering Education's (ASEE) Annual Conference in 2020 through 2023. Such a poster session has been held at the ASEE annual conference since 1986, with NSF support since 1992. NSF grant programs from which awardees have been invited in recent years include Advanced Technological Education, Improving Undergraduate STEM Education, Professional Formation of Engineers, Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers, and Scholarships in STEM. In the fall of the year preceding the ASEE conference, NSF grant recipients with active awards are invited to submit an abstract for inclusion in the poster session. Upon peer review, if abstract is accepted, an invitation is extended to the investigator(s) to submit a paper for the ASEE conference proceedings. Following acceptance of the paper, another invitation is extended to present in the ASEE conference poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ASEE NSF Grantee Poster Session is a central and well-attended event at the ASEE Annual Conference. Continuation of the session at future conferences will enhance the broad and rapid dissemination of innovative, research-based engineering education developments. The papers associated with all posters will be freely available and searchable via the ASEE webpage. This exchange of ideas promotes the adoption of effective engineering education tools, resources, and practices by engineering educators nationwide. The session also fosters interaction between engineering education practitioners, education researchers, and institutional administrators. These interactions can lead to new collaborations and project ideas to address emerging challenges in engineering education.  This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources.  Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
