<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to pioneer new control strategies for emerging systems whose operating environments change as functions of both time and a controllable spatial position. Such applications include coordinated unmanned aerial vehicles that operate in variable atmospheric conditions, concepts for relocatable marine hydrokinetic energy systems that operate in a varying ocean environment, and airborne wind energy systems that operate in an atmospheric environment where the wind varies with respect to both time and vertical position. This research will focus on deriving general theory that will be relevant to a variety of applications, along with the validation of these results on an airborne wind energy system. In airborne wind energy systems, the conventional tower is replaced by tethers and a lifting body (a wing or aerostat) that elevates a horizontal-axis turbine to high altitudes. Because the tether lengths can be adjusted, the operating altitude can be varied to optimally harness the wind resource. The work will include a substantial complementary educational component, wherein graduate, undergraduate, and STEM high school students will utilize NREL's Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software to optimize renewable/storage/dispatchable network configurations for microgrids in North Carolina and California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will derive new control theoretic knowledge and tools for the systems that operate in a spatiotemporally varying and partially observable environment. While optimal control in a temporally varying environment is a well-studied problem that can be addressed through Markov models, the addition of a spatial component results in an explosion in the number of states, rendering Markov-based methods computationally infeasible in most cases. Furthermore, the presence of partial observability results in a fundamental tradeoff between exploration (obtaining knowledge of the spatial environment) and exploitation (operating at the most favorable locations). To address the complexities of this spatiotemporal optimization problem, this research will explore the use of a multi-rate, multi-scale hierarchical framework. Specifically, an upper-level controller will perform a global optimization over a very coarse grid (thereby rendering the optimization computationally tractable), and a lower-level optimization will perform adjustments on a much finer grid. The research will focus on model predictive control for the upper-level optimization and will explore the use of extremum seeking and model predictive control strategies at the lower level. Control algorithms will be validated on a model of a lighter-than-air airborne wind energy system, using real wind shear profile models and load demand data. In this airborne wind energy system, the wind speed is only measurable at the system?s operating altitude (thereby making the problem partially observable), and significant energy production improvements can be realized through the optimal adjustment of the operating altitude.&lt;br/&gt;uction improvements can be realized through the optimal adjustment of the operating altitude.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Focusing on an airborne wind energy application, this research effort resulted in advancements in fundamental knowledge relating to the control of mobile systems operating in spatiotemporally varying environments. In particular, the research effort focused on three factors: (i) observability of the spatiotemporally varying environment, (ii) forecasting of the environment, and (iii) control of the mobile system within the envronment. For the airborne wind energy system, the critical control variable is the operating altitude of the system, and the critical environmental variable is wind speed, which varies with respect to both altitude and time. In terms of addressing the first factor (observability), the team performed a substantial study regarding the performance of pre-defined control algorithms under three different measurement configurations, including local measurement only (i.e., an anemometer on the airborne wind unit itself), measurement of the wind speed along the entire length of the tether, and full measurement of the wind speed vs. altitude profile by a ground-based wind profiler (which provides wind speed information above and below the airborne wind energy system). Results of this study were published in the Proceedings of the 2019 American Control Conference. With regard to the second factor, the team has recently completed an initial study of statistical forecasting mechanisms' impact on energetic performance, the results of which have been incorporated into a conference paper that will be submitted to the 2021 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications. Both of the aforementioned efforts were led by the collaborating institution (University of California at Berkeley) but were substantially supported by efforts at North Caronlina State University. In terms of the final factor, control, the team has performed multiple studies. Early in the project, the team performed a data-driven study, led by North Carolina State but involving substantial efforts from both groups, of its multiscale switched extremum seeking algorithms on an integrated airborne wind energy migrogrid (including the airborne wind energy system, a diesel genset, and battery storage system). After initial presentation of results in the 2018 European Control Conference, the team prepared a journal version of this paper, to be submitted to Renewable Energy. Following the evaluation of candidate control strategies on available data, the team turned to the derivation of more theoretical properties for algorithms for mobile systems that both explore and exploit spatiotemporally varying environments. Focusing on regret as an evaluation metric for control algorithms, the team used statistical wind information to construct a large synthetic data set that made possible a Monte Carlo regret analysis for various algorithms. Results of this study were initially reported in the Proceedings of the 2019 ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference, where the team's paper was selected as a finalist for the ASME Energy Systems Best Paper Award. In a journal version of this paper, submitted to the ASME Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control (under review), the team expanded its study to include a dimensional analysis-based assessment that allows regret bounds to be extrapolated to different operating environments. For example, while the team's work focuses on an airborne wind energy system that can adjust its altitude, the extrapolation technique allows for conclusions to be drawn, based on environmental statistics alone, for mobile systems within a marine environment. In fact, in very recent work by the North Carolina State team, which was published in the Proceedings of the 2020 American Control Conference and was an Energy Systems Best Paper Award finalist, the team focused on optimal control of sailing drones within a 2D spatiotemporally varying wind field. Research activities performed under this award were complemented by educational activities as well. Most notably, Dr. Vermillion served as an advisory board member for the Charlotte Engineering Early College High School, a STEM-centered high school serving a 50 percent disadvantaged population, during the course of this project. Dr. Vermillion advised on curriculum and project development, particularly in regard to energy systems curriculum content in Earth science and physics.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;R&nbsp;Vermillion</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
