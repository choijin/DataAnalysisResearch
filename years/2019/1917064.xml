<AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 20th ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing (MobiHoc 2019) is a premier symposium with a highly selective single-track technical program dedicated to addressing the challenges emerging from networked systems that must operate in the face of dynamics ranging from changing user demands to connectivity and resource availability. This award supports graduate and undergraduate students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited foreign travel funds. Priority will be given to students from under-represented groups (women, minorities, and those with disabilities), authors without other funding, and first time attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 20th ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing (MobiHoc 2019) is a premier symposium with a highly selective single-track technical program dedicated to addressing the challenges emerging from networked systems that must operate in the face of dynamics ranging from changing user demands to connectivity and resource availability. This award supports the travel of graduate and undergraduate students from U.S. universities to participate in the conference. The selection criteria give preference to applicants who are women, minorities, have disabilities, or are from other under-represented groups. The students will be exposed to the state-of-the-art developments in the field and will have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, participate in a mentoring event, meet with leading researchers, and participate in discussions that are likely to shape their future and that of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 20th ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing (MobiHoc 2019)  is a premier symposium with a highly selective single-track technical program dedicated to addressing the challenges emerging from networked systems that must operate in the face of dynamics ranging from changing user demands to connectivity and resource availability.  In 2019, MobiHoc was held in early July in Catania, Sicily (Italy).   The goal of this project was to support the travel of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as early career faculty, from universities in the United States of America to participate in MobiHoc 2019.  The selection criteria gave preference to applicants who are women, minorities, those who have disabilities, or those from other under-represented groups.  A total of thirty-six applications were received and reviewed.  From these a total of eight individuals from seven institutions nationwide were selected by a committee to receive a travel grant.  The NSF award of $13,000 allowed these eight grantees to attend a premier symposium in emerging topics in networking.  From this experience, they built and strengthened their ties to the research community, and shared scientific information through participation in the keynote presentations, the technical sessions, and a panel.  Several events in the symposium program were designed to provide mentorship for the grantees and inspire their own research in the field.
