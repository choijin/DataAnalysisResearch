<AbstractNarration>Award: DMS 1711053, Principal Investigator: Yevgeny  Liokumovich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A minimal surface is the mathematical idealization of a soap film spanning a wire, which minimizes surface area within the family of spanning surfaces. The min-max theory for minimal surfaces and other variational problems is modeled on a description of an efficient path over a mountain range that goes through a mountain pass: among nearby choices for a road over a mountain, the efficient choice will minimize the maximum altitude attained.  A min-max method was developed in the 1960s and 1970s to study existence and other questions for minimal surfaces and has been made more useable in recent years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects address four areas of current min-max theory.  An investigation of index and multiplicity bounds is expected to have applications to Heegard surfaces in non-Haken 3-manifolds A second project is intended to develop optimal bounds for min-max families of cycles with integer coefficients and may lead to a related, conjectural parametric coarea inequality.  Min-max minimal hypersurfaces in dimensions eight or more may have singularities; a third project will aim to show that for a generic set of metrics on an 8-manifold, smooth minimal hypersurfaces may be constructed.  A fourth project concerns equidistributional properties of k-parameter sweepout constructions of minimal hypersurfaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The current project studied applications of min-max methods to problems in geometry and topology.      Finding min-max is an optimization problem. The simplest optimization problems that we learn from high school are finding minima and maxima. It’s clear why these are important: a manger may want to maximize profit and an engineer may want to minimize stress concentration in a structure.     Finding min-max is a somewhat more advanced optimization problem. It's also sometimes called a "mountain pass problem" for the following reason. Say, a group of tourists wants to get to the other side of a mountain range in the easiest possible way. They are not interested in climbing the peak of a mountain in the range, rather they want to find a mountain pass. The problem of finding a mountain pass can also be described as finding a path with the smallest possible maximum elevation among all paths connecting two points on the two sides of the range. In other words, we are trying to minimize a maximum, hence the name "min-max".     Min-max problems arise in many areas of science, such as machine learning in Computer Science, differential equations, geometry, and topology in Mathematics. An important problem of such kind in differential geometry is construction of minimal surfaces. Minimal surfaces are generalizations of soap films or soap bubbles; using min-max techniques one can show that they exist not only in our usual space, but also in a very large class of spaces that can be defined mathematically. Describing them like that makes them sound exotic. Why would anyone study these objects? It turns out that they can be used to prove many important results in mathematics and General Relativity. The reason is because these "soap bubbles" can be used to cut a complicated space into simpler pieces and also because they capture important information about the space they lie in. One of the results of this project is a proof of a conjecture of J. Pitts and H. Rubinstein (PI’s joint work with Daniel Ketover and A. Song), which asserts existence of a minimal surface with very special property in a large class of 3-dimensional spaces. This result has important implications for the understanding of 3-dimensional shapes.     Another result of this project is a joint work of the PI with Boris Lishak, Alexander Nabutovsky and Regina Rotman on approximating complicated spaces with simple spaces of low dimension. This problem arose from the study of scalar curvature in differential geometry, but the PI believes that both the result and the methods will have applications to manifold learning problems in Computer Science.
