<AbstractNarration>The award will provide funding in support of participation by U.S. graduate students and post-doctoral researchers at the 2019 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Chemical Reactions at Surfaces to be held back-to-back in Ventura, California February 16-22, 2019. The conference and seminar will expose a new generation of scientists and engineers to the latest international advances in surface science and engineering as applied to some of the world's most pressing technological challenges. International exchanges of this type are essential for ensuring that U.S. scientists and engineers maintain leadership in areas of critical importance such as concrete materials, catalysis, photocatalysis, and biomolecules, where surface phenomena play an important role. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRC on Chemical Reactions at surfaces is the preeminent international meeting in the field of surface chemistry and related catalysis. Together with the GRS, it will bring together an interdisciplinary group of students and young researchers from chemistry, physics, chemical engineering and materials science. They will have an opportunity to present their work in the form of oral presentations or posters while interacting with some of the most eminent researchers in the field. The GRS and GRC will address fundamental aspects of surface chemical reactions, which are related to the grand environmental and sustainability challenges facing mankind. Specific emphasis will be given to defining the next generation challenges in surface chemistry and surface science. Participation by young researchers will add significant value to this conference and will foster communications among current and future leaders in a field that combines academic and industrial issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Abstract at Time   of Award         The award will provide funding in support of participation by U.S. graduate students and post-doctoral researchers at the 2019 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Chemical Reactions at Surfaces to be held back-to-back in Ventura, California February 16-22, 2019. The conference and seminar will expose a new generation of scientists and engineers to the latest international advances in surface science and engineering as applied to some of the world's most pressing technological challenges. International exchanges of this type are essential for ensuring that U.S. scientists and engineers maintain leadership in areas of critical importance such as concrete materials, catalysis, photocatalysis, and biomolecules, where surface phenomena play an important role.     The GRC on Chemical Reactions at surfaces is the preeminent international meeting in the field of surface chemistry and related catalysis. Together with the GRS, it will bring together an interdisciplinary group of students and young researchers from chemistry, physics, chemical engineering and materials science. They will have an opportunity to present their work in the form of oral presentations or posters while interacting with some of the most eminent researchers in the field. The GRS and GRC will address fundamental aspects of surface chemical reactions, which are related to the grand environmental and sustainability challenges facing mankind. Specific emphasis will be given to defining the next generation challenges in surface chemistry and surface science. Participation by young researchers will add significant value to this conference and will foster communications among current and future leaders in a field that combines academic and industrial issues.    Project Outcomes Report     The 2019 GRC on Chemical Reactions at Surfaces was held in Ventura, CA (US) between February 17 and 22, 2019.  The conference convened an interdisciplinary group of world-recognized experts and young researchers from chemistry, physics, chemical engineering and materials science to address and discuss fundamental aspects of chemical reactions at surfaces, relevant to the grand challenges facing mankind.  These topics included:  well-defined surfaces of model systems, environmental interfaces including that of concrete, catalysis, photocatalysis, adsorption of biomolecules, and novel approaches for layer-by-layer methods for modifying surface properties and engineering new materials. Specific emphasis was placed on cutting-edge experimental and theoretical methods and topics in surface science such as surface and catalytic properties of oxides, surface phenomena on nanoparticles and nanoclusters and virtual design of interfacial properties. Immediately prior to the GRC (Feb. 16-17, 2019) there was a Gordon Research Seminar held at the same location: this event gave young scientists and engineers the opportunity to network among their peers and to familiarize themselves with the style and content of the GRC, which followed their GRS.  The main focus of the Gordon Research Seminar on Chemical Reactions at Surfaces was placed equally on both computational/theoretical and experimental methods used to address novel challenges in science and technology where surface science and chemical reactions at surfaces are the unifying themes. This includes fundamental and applied studies investigating catalysis, electronic materials, environmental science, electrochemistry, surface chemistry related to concrete, solar energy conversion, biomaterials, and nanoscience.  Several sessions addressing a diverse range of surface science fundamentals and applications were dedicated to oral and poster presentations by GRS/GRC participants, where they could freely exchange their ideas and have engaging discussions on unpublished work.
