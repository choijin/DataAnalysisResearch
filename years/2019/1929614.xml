<AbstractNarration>Computational geometry is an important area of computer science, with applications in graphics, 3D modeling, robotics and topology. Geometry Week organizes the flagship conference for computational geometry with several workshops, most notably the Young Researchers' Forum, where PhD students and Postdoctoral researchers can present their work. The project expects to support the equivalent of 10 full support participants and 5 half support participants. The proposal also aims to increase the representation of under-represented groups at the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The travel support provided in this project will help bring young researchers in the field of computational geometry together and create synergies and idea exchanges to solve problems, and open up new areas for study. Past versions of this effort have been productive in generating several high-impact research papers in addition to encouraging and mentoring young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
