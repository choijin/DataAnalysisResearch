<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for travel to a workshop entitled "Workshop in Commutative Algebra" to be held at the Banff International Research Station in the period October 20-25, 2019.  It will feature six different topics within the discipline of Commutative Algebra, with twelve group co-leaders presenting proposed problems of study and directing the research conducted during the week.  It will provide new collaborations and strengthen the research network of the forty-two participants in attendance.  Researchers at all stages of career are involved, providing opportunities for those in beginning and mid-level positions to not only interact with experts in the field, but to explore leadership opportunities during the workshop.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commutative algebra is a mature field, with deep roots in number theory and algebraic geometry, yet also with growth in its own right.  It has thriving branches bearing exciting fruits, especially as a trio of different decades-old conjectures recently fell, making a collaborative workshop particularly timely.  The topics to be investigated at the conference include methods in primes characteristic, Rees algebras, resolutions and complexes, combinatorial--as well as tropical--commutative algebra, and rings of differential operators.  This workshop has the goal of bringing together high profile researchers from underrepresented communities.  More information can be found at  https://awmadvance.org/research-networks/wica/conferences/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The grant supported travel of some US based participants to the Women in Commutative Algebra workshop, held at the Banff International Research Station October 20-25, 2019.  This event was an inaugural research collaboration conference for the newly-formed research network of women working in the area of commutative algebra.  It involved forty-two researchers, at all stages of career, traveling from countries across the globe, including the United States, Canada, England, India, Switzerland, Scotland, Germany, Lebanon, and Kazakhstan.   Divided into six teams, each group prepared for, and focused on, a specific set of relevant problems and timely goals predetermined by its two co-leaders.  The team topics were combinatorics and differential operators; methods in prime characteristic; combinatorial commutative algebra; Rees algebras; finite resolutions and complexes; and tropical commutative algebra.  Team leaders were comprised of researchers at all stages of career, allowing for leadership opportunities for participants across the spectrum.  During the workshop, groups met individually and all together to advance the research, report on progress, and receive feedback about overcoming mathematical hurdles that arose during the day.   Outcomes of the workshop include advancing commutative algebra through cutting-edge research, facilitating collaboration between junior and senior mathematicians to bolster leadership and provide mentoring, cultivating a research network among women in commutative algebra, and supporting those from historically underrepresented groups and teaching universities, as well as those geographically isolated from other researchers with similar interests.   Publications include a conference proceedings, as well as multiple papers from the various groups.  In addition, several of the participants have delivered presentations on their projects and results at conferences of the American Mathematical Society and the Institute for Computational Experimental Research in Mathematics.  Finally, many groups are continuing their collaborative efforts at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach, and others.
