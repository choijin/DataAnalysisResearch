<AbstractNarration>This grant supports student attendance to the IEEE Cyber Security Development (SecDev) conference. Research on software security usually focuses on detecting vulnerabilities in software and attacks on resources. However, there is not much attention to how programmers can develop secure software by construction. This new conference series on Secure Development (SecDev) focuses on this problem area. The support for the conference is important for educating/training the workforce in this area, and to help provide a pathway to research careers. The technical advances presented and nurtured by the conference are important to development of secure software, which is important to society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a function of the 2019 IEEE SecDev, the fourth year of the conference, we were able to attract almost 100 participants to Virginia for a riviting discussions, presentaitons, and practiums to improve the community of Secure Development.  Through this we had substantial participation from many universities, research labs, and industry partners. This we focused on HBCUs within the community and had success in attracting new participants to the community.    Overall, the student sentiment to SecDev 2019 was positive. All the respondents found the travel application process easy, straightforward and the processing organization, Johns Hopkins University to be responsive.  We believe SecDev to be a unique conference in the area of security, one that appeals to industrysecurity practitioners. It is one of the only conferences dedicated to research for applyingsecurity throughout development and operational cycles, while many conferences focus on howsecurity is "broken" by showcasing vulnerabilities and exploits or on theoretical research notready for widespread use. SecDev removes some barriers to industrial participation by hosting a"practioner’s session" where submissions are reviewed based on short abstracts and presented as2 0 minute presentations, allowing more security professionals to focus on content rather than themechanics of submitting a full paper. The majority of SecDev’s organizing committee is madeup of either a practicing security professionals or academics involved in security researchdirectly aligned to the needs of industry.  In 2020, we planned to migrate the conference to Atlanta to distinguish IEEE-SecDev from other conferences such as HOST.  The 2020 conference will be going virtual and invite students to participate in the venue.  We will be requesting a NCE of the 2020 NSF funds based on the guidance received from NSF.  The request will be arriving soon, and we will focus on continuing the community through 2020 and extending the outreach in 2021.  We greatly appreciate your understanding and the special effort you undertook for continuing tomake SecDev accessible to student participants. Positive experiences as students in conferencessuch as SecDev promote valuable future professional contributions and leadership in venues suchas this one.
