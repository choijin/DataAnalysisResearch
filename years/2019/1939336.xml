<AbstractNarration>The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) Simulation Society Research Workshop is a periodic event to convene researchers in simulation methods around an emerging research theme, with a stated goal of encouraging participation of graduate students and junior researchers working in simulation and related areas. The theme of the 6th Workshop is "From Data to Decision Making: Contending with Uncertainty and Non-stationarity in Simulation Research", and this version of the workshop will feature a day-long simulation summer school for graduate students and junior faculty members on foundational topics in simulation modeling. This award will provide funds for eight graduate students and junior faculty to attend the Workshop and Summer School, each of whom will be presenting his or her talk or poster at the workshop. Participation in the Workshop and Summer School will provide students and junior faculty with an opportunity to highlight their ongoing work and network with other researchers from industry and academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 6th INFORMS Simulation Society Research Workshop will be held June 22-24, 2020, in University Park, Pennsylvania. The solicitation for the travel support opportunity will be sent to a variety of mailing lists, with particular effort to broaden participation by attracting students and junior faculty from underrepresented groups in engineering. By providing travel funds for graduate students and junior faculty, NSF will help to decrease the cost of attendance to encourage participation of students and will support the engagement of STEM students in emerging research in the field of simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
