<AbstractNarration>Computational and quantitative approaches to the study of the brain and nervous system have been a part of neuroscience since its beginnings as a field. However, recent advances in the ability to collect large data sets, to create and run very large simulations, and in the development of new data analysis approaches may soon lead to an even more central role for computational thinking in this field. The goal of this meeting is to promote discussions and collaboration between experimental and computational neuroscientists. The meeting will highlight strategies for increasing the participation of historically under-represented groups in computational neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators and Co-Principal Investigators of grants supported through the NSF-NIH-ANR-BMBF-BSF-NICT-AEI-ISCIII Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program meet annually to report on projects; to discuss scientific, educational, and program-related issues; and to develop a cohesive investigator community representing many different approaches to computational neuroscience. This 15th meeting of CRCNS investigators brings together a broad spectrum of computational neuroscience researchers supported by the program, and includes plenary lectures, oral and poster presentations, and panel discussions. The meeting is scheduled for September 2-4, 2019 and is hosted by the University of Texas, Austin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
