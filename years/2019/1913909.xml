<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to assist in the commercialization of a new type of engine. Macro-scale vehicle electrification has opened doors to new types of engines not previously practical. Amongst the most interesting of these is the free-piston engine. Free-piston engines (FPE) and Free-piston linear generators (FPLG) are well-suited to electrification because they directly produce electricity instead of torque and do it in a way that is cleaner, more efficient, and better suited to work with advanced electrified vehicles. These engines are inherently more capable of running on a diversity of fuels to enhance both low-carbon fuel consumption and US energy independence. Key to this technology is advanced controls and development of new sensors. This project focuses on development of a new sensor whose lack is a key roadblock to the commercialization of these advanced engines. This new sensor will be employed immediately in the laboratory and test vehicle development of these engines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop the framework of a new integrated circuit (IC) that will enable the mass adoption of clean, efficient free-piston engines. In order to realize practical free-piston engines a position sensor able to measure piston position to 0.1micron (4 millionths of an inch) and up to speed of 30m/s (over 1000 inch/second) is needed. Currently there is no sensor that gives the required speed and precision. The sensors that are close in functionality are large devices that nearly double the length of the engine. The proposed sensor must survive in the harsh thermal and vibration environment of an engine. In phase 1 the company will build a proof of concept from available discrete circuits; to build the actual custom IC in phase II. This sensor will be combined with distributed high-speed computation allowing high-speed piston control at a rate of greater than 10kHz. This IC will serve additional secondary markets for other fast, high power linear machines in robotics and factory automation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Vieletech, makers of Drivven brand engine controllers, provides research engine controllers to customers across the globe.  Our controllers are used by academia, government, and corporate research to prove out concepts in combustion fundamentals, alternate fuels, or novel engines.  Vieletech combined with its antecedents Drivven Inc, and NI Powertrain Controls, have provided control systems to over 800 institutions resulting in over 1000 publications and several new commercial engine applications.  Throughout this process we see recurring problems being targeted with varying degrees of success among our customers.  We looked at these and decided that many could be solved using a novel and complex engine design called a free-piston engine (FPE).   While our research engine control platform is widely regarded at the most flexible, it still needed additions to make free-piston engines a reality.  In addition to modifications to our internal software we identified a key stumbling block for free-piston engines.  There was not practical sensor that could measure with the speed and precision required for FPE control, let alone one that could stand the automotive engine environment and support the price and packaging required.  Over the course of this project we identified and prototyped a sensor that could do this on a test rig we built.  We built a series of models describing the system and validated our modeling results against our experimental data.  We identified and costed the components required to implement this at both lab and production scale.  In phase 2 we plan to integrate this sensor in to a running free-piston engine and build a line of controllers to allow free-piston engines to be developed in the lab and deployed in industrial and low-volume applications we an eye toward supporting high-volume deployment.
