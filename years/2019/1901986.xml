<AbstractNarration>This award will support participant travel costs to the international workshop, "Thought to Speech" Step 3: Science, Engineering and Clinical Planning of an Intracortical Communication System for Adults with Cerebral Palsy (BrainGate-CP)", being held at the Hilton Chicago O`Hare Airport on November 28, 2018. The summit will bring together people with expertise not only in brain-computer interfaces (BCI's) and cerebral palsy, but also in neuroscience, language development and related fields to promote a comprehensive understanding of the challenges involved in creating BCI's for this purpose. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A "thought-to-speech" BCI would provide an opportunity for people born without the ability to speak as well as relieve the burden of acquired speech impairments from those who acquire such a condition later in life. The intelligence of people with motor and communication impairments is routinely underestimated. A thought-to-speech or rapid-text BCI would circumvent this fallacious assumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal leveraged NSF partial support for an international workshop aimed at identifying and discussing challenges and detailed solutions in designing a first-in-human clinical trial to test advanced neurotechnological approaches that can enhance communication for people with cerebral palsy (CP).  The summit was an outgrowth of prior NSF-supported efforts launched by the Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation (CPARF, NSF 1817353) and brought together field leaders in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), cerebral palsy, neuroscience, speech and language, and neurotechnology clinical trial design. The meeting was held at the Hilton Chicago O`Hare Airport on November 28, 2018 and was an enormous success.  The primary objective of the meeting was to answer the key engineering, neuroscientific, and clinical procedure questions needed to complete a detailed protocol for a clinical trial. This included specific issues such as:  (1) Inclusion criteria including use of screening tools such as fMRI, (2) Detailed protocol for placement of microelectrode arrays, (3) Safety endpoints, (4) Decoding approaches and decoding targets, (5) Purposefully shared/uniform and purposefully parallel methodological approaches across multiple clinical trial sites.  By the conclusion of the meeting the group had made concrete recommendations for both the outline and details of a clinical trial to be conducted using Utah array electrodes to acquire neural signals which could be decoded to enhance communication in patients with CP.  Those recommendations have already been incorporated in documents related to the IDE which is part of the BrainGate clinical trial.  Furthermore, these recommendations have helped move the consortium toward various funding possibilities for a clinical trial.
