<AbstractNarration>The IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM 2019) is a premier conference with a highly selective multi-track technical program dedicated to addressing the emerging challenges in the broad area of communication networks. This award supports students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited access to foreign travel funds. Priority will be given to students from under-represented groups (women, minorities, and those with disabilities), authors without other funding, and first-time attendees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM 2019) is a top-ranked conference in the broad area of communication networks.  The broad scope of the conference includes both system and theoretical research. The conference includes a diverse range of activities, including research presentation, panels, and keynote speeches. This award supports the travel of graduate and undergraduate students from U.S. universities to participate in the conference. The selection criteria give preference to applicants who are women, minorities, have disabilities, or are from other under-represented groups. The students will be exposed to state-of-the-art developments in the field and will have the opportunity to exchange significant and innovative contributions and ideas in the field of networking and closely related areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
