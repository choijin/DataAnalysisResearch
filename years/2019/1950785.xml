<AbstractNarration>This award supports the funding of the REU site in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Toledo. Undergraduate students have a variety of cutting edge research opportunities in topics: Astrophysics; Atomic/Molecular/Optical Physics; Biological/Health/Medical Physics; Condensed Matter/Materials; Computational Physics; (with specialization in thin films and photovoltaics); and Plasma Physics. Opportunities exist for some of the research projects to be conducted with their faculty mentors at national facilities. The research projects are chosen such that they will lead to eventual publication in the appropriate professional research journals.  REU students will be involved in exciting research in a department that allows individualized attention yet is large enough to give students experiences in a variety of physics subfields. A variety of social activities for the REU students are also planned. The REU site is committed to involving students from diverse backgrounds in this research experience. A majority of tracked former REU students have successfully gone onto graduate school for an M.S. or Ph.D. in physics, astronomy, and related areas. This program contributes to the generation of the STEM workforce in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
