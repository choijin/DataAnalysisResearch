<AbstractNarration>The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) operates R/V Sikuliaq, a 261 foot, global class ice-capable oceanographic research vessel owned by the NSF as part of the UNOLS fleet. Sikuliaq provides a general-purpose platform for multidisciplinary research missions from polar to temperate latitudes. The ship was delivered in 2014 and has completed four years of funded operations. UAF requests funds to purchase and install shipboard scientific support equipment that would be custom engineered to enhance the vessel's capability in support of NSF-sponsored research to be undertaken on Sikuliaq in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2018, R/V Sikuliaq completed 232 days, 142 (62%) of which were for NSF. In 2019, the vessel is scheduled to sail 252 days with 69% (174 days) of the schedule for NSF.  With this proposal, UAF provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Timeserver replacements $13,668 &lt;br/&gt;2) Workhorse 300 kHz ADCP $37,943 &lt;br/&gt;3) Meteorological sensors $17,050 &lt;br/&gt;4) Software-defined Data Center (SDDC) Hardware  $248,058 &lt;br/&gt;       $316,719 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Major Goals - COMPLETED  All major goals for Year 1 of this award were completed to a high level of confidence and satisfaction of the Sikuliaq IT staff.  Ship-Side Software-Defined Data Center   Lifecycle Replacement - VM and compute hardware is up to date and vendor supported through 2025 Capacity Upgrades - Anticipated capacity for Sikuliaq's VM computer and storage through 2025 has been deployed to production. In the event that unanticipated capacity is needed over the next 5 years, the Sikuliaq's SDDC is future ready to add one more VM server, and up to ~100TB of additional storage capacity at cost for the additional hardware. While ready for future expansion, this seems like an unlikely need in the next 5 years. Capability Upgrades - Sikuliaq's VMWare SDDC supports High Availability (HA) Zero Single Point of Failure services for all hosted VM guest services. Meaning that Sikuliaq's hardware can likely run for 2-3 years at a time without any outages or impact to services. This level of availability is critical to ensure uninterrupted service for Science while at sea, and also makes it possible for shoreside IT staff to support shipside services. Without this level of uptime stability it would not be pragmatic to support service from shore.   Ship-Side Core Network Refresh - Sikuliaq's new Core Switch architecture replaced a single monolithic chassis with 3x identical switch components there by providing more options for network redundancy, power supply redundancy, future network expansion capacity, 10 Gigabit ethernet service, and updated firmware capabilities. Sikuliaq is prepared and ready to implement the Year 2 scope of funded projects on this award.   Equipment Re-purposing / Disposal  Legacy servers and network equipment which was replaced during the recent Seattle in port site visit in Jan-Feb 2021, remain on board Sikuliaq. One legacy storage server remains onboard Sikuliaq for backup storage. A second legacy server is planned for additional backup capacity. The remaining legacy VM and storage servers are planned to be offload from Sikuliaq in Seward, AK during June 2021, and destined to be re-purposed as shoreside resources in Fairbanks Alaska. The legacy Cisco core switch equipment will be off loaded from Sikuliaq in Seward, AK during June 2021, disposed of, and likely repurposed as a spare by the UAF network operations team for other UAF campus projects using similar equipment.   SDDC Documentation and Training  Both John Haverlack and Jeffrey Simonson have worked side by side to provide redundant points of knowledge for the administration and management of Sikuliaq's SDDC cluster. Significant effort were made to document the SDDC during installation and migration of legacy service. However documentation is incomlete and additional documentation efforts remain. Critical shutdown and startup procedure trainings with Sikuliaq's Science Techs were video recorded and are available on Sikuliaq for viewing at anytime.
