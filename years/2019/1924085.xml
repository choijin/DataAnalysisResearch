<AbstractNarration>The Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology was created in 1995 to foster the interdisciplinary collaborative research focused on understanding the basic mechanisms of how hormones affect brain and behavior spanning all levels of biological organization, from cells to organisms. Faculty, students and trainees will present their research findings collected from a wide array of organisms and across a diversity of contexts, including field-based investigations of animals in their natural habitats, laboratory research on model systems, as well as clinical research on a variety of topics directly related to human health. Diverse topics will focus on biological rhythms, reproduction, courtship, social affiliation, aggression, parenting, food intake, cognition, and mood.  As in past meetings, SBN will consist of a series of topical symposia with speakers who are the world's leaders in their respective fields, a young investigator symposium that highlights the outstanding research of students, trainees and new faculty, as well as several poster sessions and mentoring events. A half-day pre-meeting workshop will provide professional development and foster mentoring and networking relationships across the membership. The research presented at this meeting will ultimately result in a greater understating of how hormones affect brain and behavior and will also help train the next generation of scientists in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology is a multidisciplinary society that brings together scientists from diverse fields, including physiological and developmental psychology, behavioral ecology, animal behavior, chronobiology, psychoneuroendocrinology, neuroscience, cellular and molecular endocrinology, developmental biology, and genetics. The society fosters interdisciplinary interactions to promote conceptual advances and continually rejuvenate the research enterprise. The goal of this multidisciplinary perspective is the integration of cellular and molecular concepts into a functional framework. It is expected that this goal will ultimately lead to an understanding of the neural and physiological basis of hormonally modulated behaviors.  As in past meetings, the meeting will consist of plenary lectures, topical symposia, young investigator symposia, and scientific poster sessions. A wide range of professional development and mentoring activities are also scheduled throughout the meeting targeting every career stage, including a half-day pre-meeting professional development workshop. The findings presented at this meeting will ultimately result in advances in the field of behavioral neuroendocrinology and in tangible benefits associated with training the next generation of scientists in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
