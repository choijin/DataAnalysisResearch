<AbstractNarration>A workshop for students and early career scientists will be held in conjunction with the annual conference of the Association of the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography in February, 2019. The workshop will provide a model that can be implemented in one day at any research conference and will focus on improving both oral and visual communication skills. Workshop organization and evaluation will be managed by Drs. Schiebel and Stone, from Suffolk University. The main speakers will be Dr. Jessamyn A. Fairfield, a physicist and Lecturer, National University of Ireland Galway's School of Physics and Dr. Echo A. Rivera, owner of Creative Research Communications, LLC. Both speakers are highly experienced and well qualified, with expertise in training scientists to give effective presentations to a variety of audiences. Evaluation of the workshop will be conducted by Dr. Rebecca Stone, Assistant Professor of Sociology, Suffolk University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will offer a group of approximately forty students and early career scientists an opportunity to improve their presentation skills. The plan for the workshop is solid, and the event is likely to be well-attended and highly successful because it will be held in conjunction with a large annual conference. The broader impacts of the workshop include training and professional development for a diverse group of participants. In addition to the training provided to participants, this award will support two early career scientists who will gain experience in workshop organization and grant management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Developing the Science of Science Communication in Early Career Scientists</em> (NSF project number 1911531) was the first proposal written (2 subsequent NSF proposals for similar work have been funded since) to address the lack of verbal and visual communication training for early career scientists (undergraduate, graduate, within 5 years of graduation). The goal of NSF project number 1911531 was to pilot a training workshop for early career scientists at a research conference and help them develop their verbal and visual communication skills. The workshop was held in conjunction with the annual Aquatic Sciences Meeting. One major outcome of the communication workshop (run in February 2019) was a high retention of the workshop materials (assessed through pre- and post-session assessments). For example, one question posed to participants about bullet points in presentations yielded 7.3% correct responses prior to the workshop and 100% correct responses after the workshop. Participants also felt that a workshop of this nature is highly needed at science conferences where students have an opportunity to get training outside of the laboratory and/or classroom in skill sets not often taught to early career scientists. At the final post-workshop evaluation,&nbsp;92.7% of respondents strongly agreed that they would recommend a workshop like this to their colleagues, mentees, or students, and 95.1% strongly agreed that other scientific conferences should offer similar workshops. 90% strongly agreed that the workshop material would be useful for advancing their career goals, and 87.8% felt that overall the workshop provided them with new information and skills to improve their science communication.&nbsp;Finally, participants also asked for additional skills in future workshops for non-English speakers (both how to present as a non-English speaker and how to present to a non-English speaker) and inclusive of poster design tools. The major outcomes of this workshop and NSF project have been used to run similar workshops in 2020 and 2021 (pending due to the global COVID-19 pandemic).<strong> </strong>This work allowed us to identify successes and criticisms of the pilot workshop in 2019. This project supported 2 faculty (in their first PI-led project) and 1 undergraduate student/1 faculty member to attend the 2019 conference and workshop. This was also the first NSF support for 2 subcontractors. This work is currently in preparation for publication (accepted to <em>Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography: Bulletin</em> November 2020).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/08/2020<br>      Modified by: Hayley&nbsp;Schiebel</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
