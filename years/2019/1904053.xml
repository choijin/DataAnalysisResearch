<AbstractNarration>The award will provide funding in support of participation by U.S. graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and early-career researchers at the Third International Symposium on Nanoporous Materials by Alloy Corrosion on February 24-28, 2019 in Philadelphia, PA.  The presentations and discussion/collaboration fostered at the symposium will highlight new aspects of nanoporous materials synthesis and properties, as well as develop the guiding principles that will outline future directions for the field in applications such as catalysis, fuel cells, plasmonic devices, and sensors.  The symposium will provide a rare opportunity to bring together a diverse group of industrial and academic researchers in a common setting under conditions that will promote research collaboration and identification of new technological opportunities for nanoporous materials. Key outcomes will be a journal article describing future directions for the field, and education of young researchers about career opportunities related to nanoporous materials.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoporous metals and nanoporous materials, in general, span many fields of basic science and they see utility in a broad range of applications. Full realization of the useful properties of nanoporous materials and development of synthesis strategies that facilitate control of those properties would create substantial impact over a broad range of applications. To this end, the conference will facilitate information sharing and collaboration that would not be possible outside of the meeting.  One of the keys to the impact of this meeting is the targeted involvement of graduate students and early career scientists. The combination of young scientist talks, nightly poster sessions, and a communal atmosphere between established scientists and young graduate students will have an important and lasting impact on the future careers of the younger attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The boundaries of functional materials development are continually being pushed where length scales down to the order of nanometers have introduced multi-functionality into the next generation of materials. Nanoporous materials, including metals and ceramics, represent an important subset of these nanomaterials as they exhibit unique and unusual mechanical, optical, and catalytic properties that are directly tied to their length scale and high surface-to-volume ratios.  Nanoporous metals, specifically those formed through an alloy corrosion process termed dealloying, are a unique and important class of materials with pore and ligaments sizes that may be precisely controlled over a wide range from 2 nm to &gt;10 &micro;m and tunable surface chemistry facilitating their application in the fields of heterogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis, plasmonics, sensors, etc.  The nanoporous metals and dealloying community has been a close and active group dating back to the mid 90?s. While seemingly narrowed and specific, dealloying and nanoporous materials are perhaps the only example of a scalable nanostructured metallic material.  As a result, they have seen broad applicability over wide topical areas including corrosion, catalysis, mechanical properties, radiation damage tolerance, biomaterials, surface science, etc. Therefore, presentations, publications, and other means of scientific research dissemination have been diluted over a broad range of symposiums at different scientific conferences and publication outlets. This dramatically lowers the probability of interaction among the dealloying and nanoporous metals community at these large conferences. For these reasons, the dealloying community hosts the International Symposium on Nanoporous Materials by Alloy Corrosion, with the current iteration being held in Philadelphia, PA. The specific topical focus of the conference will be: Catalysis, Corrosion Science, Topology and Morphology Evolution, Mechanics of Materials, Microstructure and Characterization, and Functional Applications.
