<AbstractNarration>This workshop brings together a group of approximately 40 experts from academia and industry, and an additional 60 experts, policy makers, and funders across US Government for a two-day workshop. The workshop is then be followed by a half day meeting of US Government experts, policy makers and funders. The anticipated end-result of the workshop is the refinement and eventual adoption of a synthetic biology roadmap for the United States government along with recommendations for future coordination. The workshop discussions contribute significantly to a broader comprehensive strategy that would establish the United States as a leader in the area of synthetic biology as well as promote the enhancement and improvement of scientific, engineering and educational activities by bringing together a leading group of experts from several scientific domains. The meeting establishes the foundation for increased collaboration and coordination among United States Government Agencies. The workshop includes attendees from underrepresented groups in Science and Technology and attendees who are at all stages of their career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synthetic Biology activities across all agencies in the United States Federal Government span from basic research into the biology of genetic mechanisms and cellular function; to evolution of synthetic organisms and their impact on the environment; to development of foundational tools that enable cell manipulation, design and control; to development of applications in health and disease treatment, remote manufacturing, bio-renewable fuels and chemicals, and adaptive living materials; to the robust and reproducible manufacture of products of synthetic biology in a commercial setting. This workshop brings together key stakeholders from academia, industry and funding agencies to help improve coordination in ways that will advance the field of synthetic biology. The workshop builds on the publication of the Engineering Biology Research Consortium roadmap, released in June 2019, and would identify opportunities for future collaboration and coordination in ways that will advance the field. This workshop represents the first examination of a United States technology-based roadmap, and as such, the workshop provides an opportunity for the US policy makers and researchers to strategically plan for the future of the field of synthetic biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
