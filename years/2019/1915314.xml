<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Mary K. Gaillard, Lawrence J. Hall, and Hitoshi Murayama at the University of California, Berkeley.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of particle physics and related areas in cosmology and astrophysics ask fundamental questions about the inner (and outer) workings of our Universe, how the Universe began, what it is made of, how we have come to exist, where we are going, and what laws govern everything.  This area of research is moving very fast, venturing into unprecedented energies in particle collisions, unprecedented sensitivities in rare phenomena, and unprecedented accuracies in precision measurements.  To accelerate the progress in this area, Professors Gaillard, Hall, and Murayama aim to develop novel ideas connecting deep theoretical concepts to experimentally measurable processes.   They also seek to use newly obtained data to shape theories of fundamental physics.   In particular, they aim to discover new pathways to connect theories and experiments which aid in designing the future experimental program in this area.  Understanding these deep and profound problems advances the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science.  Moreover, these kinds of profound questions excite the general public and young minds, and Professors Gaillard, Hall, and Murayama will be engaged in training junior scientists and in public outreach efforts through lectures, schools, public media, and popular science books.   They also actively aim to promote diversity at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, major advances are expected in understanding the laws of physics at energy scales never probed before, with strong connections to astrophysics and cosmology. Research in theory is needed to tie these areas together into a coherent framework and uncover deep secrets that span the range from the smallest scales of particles and strings to the largest scales of the Universe.  The research associated with this project includes a number of topics:  collider physics, dark matter, neutrinos, quark flavor, phenomenology and theory of supersymmetry, observational cosmology, field theory, string theory, and the multiverse.  This research will also have broader impacts on multiple fronts.  These researchers will continue their efforts as mentors and teachers, with strong attention to promoting diversity.   Through their QuarkNet involvement they will also reach out to high-school teachers and their students.  Finally, Professors Gaillard, Hall, and Murayama have been very active in giving public lectures and plan to continue these efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
