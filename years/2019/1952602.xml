<AbstractNarration>This workshop aims to bring together stakeholders from US universities responsible for curating, developing and delivering programming, education, and other resources relating to innovation and entrepreneurship.  This will better support universities on identifying and implementing best practices developed across the nation, help develop improved and more uniform practices for entrepreneurship education and for fostering entrepreneurship, and better inform the National Science Foundation on current activities and present and future needs of universities in the areas of innovation and entrepreneurship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 2020 Engineering Innovation Leadership Council (EILC) Report   On February 26, 2020, the first National Science Foundation-funded Engineering Innovation Leadership Council(EILC) workshop was held in Alexandria, Virginia, with more than 40 attendees from academia and government agencies. The workshop explored the role that engineering leadership plays in the Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E) ecosystems at universities, as well as their roles in the ecosystems of their state, region and the nation. Through four in-depth sessions across a day-long event, attendees discussed   (1) the role of an Engineering Associate Dean for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (ADIE) or similar positions.   (2) ecosystem building and campus policies on I&amp;E, conflict management and ethics.   (3) I&amp;E effects on faculty engagement, promotion and tenure.   (4) student engagement, curriculum development and co-curricular I&amp;E program, and   (5) outcomes and next steps for the workshop attendees and participants.    At the conclusion of the workshop, participants widely agreed it is of great value to gather I&amp;E academic leaders, policy and funding agency leaders on an annual basis to share best practices and further enhance entrepreneurship opportunities in engineering and science across the national innovation ecosystem.     Broader impacts of an annual I&amp;E workshop  An annual workshop focused on engineering innovation and entrepreneurship in US engineering colleges would benefit society in a number of important ways. Discussing best practices, trends, and opportunities among peer institutions would enable universities to enhance the workforce development activities in their respective regions, as well as help to fuel innovation and entrepreneurial activity among the students, faculty and alumni in the local region, across the state, and the nation.  There is clear evidence that engineering students ? often in collaboration with business students ? form companies soon after graduation, based on their innovation and entrepreneurship activities at the university.      Intellectual merit for an annual I&amp;E workshop  Gathering stakeholders from US universities responsible for curating, developing and delivering programming, education, and other resources can better inform universities on best practices developed across the nation, as well as help to better inform NSF on current activities and present and future needs of universities in areas of key interest to the IIP directorate at NSF. Entrepreneurship education has been a key focus of many programs in IIP, such as those in the I-Corps program, and such a workshop could enable a greater focus among peer institutions to discuss educational and translational research directions among peer institutions. Such a discourse could advance the state of-the-art of such programs at research universities across the nation.
