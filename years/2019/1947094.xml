<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Around 252 million years ago, a major mass extinction wiped out over 90% of species on Earth.  Coincident with this extinction, the Antarctic portion of the supercontinent of Pangea transitioned to a warmer climatic regime devoid of a permanent ice cap.  Compared to lower latitudes, relatively little is known about the survivors of the extinction in Antarctica, although it has been hypothesized that the continents more polar location shielded it from the worst of the extinctions effects.  As the result of a NSF-sponsored deep field camp in 2017/2018, a remarkable collection of vertebrate fossils was discovered in the rocks of the Shackleton Glacier region.  This collection includes the best preserved and most complete materials of fossil amphibians ever recovered from Antarctica, including two previously undescribed species.  This grant supports one postdoctoral researcher with expertise in fossil amphibians to describe and interpret the significance of these fossils, including their identification, relationships, and how they fit into the terrestrial ecosystem of Antarctica and other southern hemisphere terrestrial assemblages in light of the major reorganization of post-extinction environments.  Historical collections of fossil amphibians will also be reviewed as part of this work.  Undergraduate students at the University of Washington will be actively involved as part of this research and learn skills like hard tissue histology and CT data manipulation.  Public engagement in Antarctic science will be accomplished at the University of Washington Burke Museum, which is the Washington State museum of natural history and culture.  Specifically, a new exhibit on Antarctic amphibians will be developed as part of the paleontology gallery, which sees over 100,000 visitors per year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This two-year project will examine the evolution of Triassic temnospondyls based on a remarkable collection of fossils recently recovered from the Shackleton Glacier region of Antarctica.  Temnospondyls collected from the middle member of the Fremouw Formation are part of the first collection of identifiable tetrapod fossils from this stratigraphic interval. Thorough anatomical description and comparisons of these fossils will add new faunal information and also aid in determining if this horizon is Early or Middle Triassic in age.  Exquisitely preserved temnospondyl material from the lower Fremouw Formation will permit more precise identification than previously possible and will provide insights into the earliest stages of their radiation in the extinction recovery interval.  Overall, the Principal Investigator and Postdoctoral Researcher will spearhead an effort to revise the systematics of the Antarctic members of Temnospondyli and properly contextualize them in the framework of Triassic tetrapod evolution.  The research team will also take advantage of the climate-sensitive nature of fossil amphibians to better understand patterns of seasonality at high-latitudes during the early Mesozoic by subjecting selected fossils to histological analysis.  Preliminary data suggest that temnospondyls were exceptionally diverse and highly endemic immediately after the end-Permian extinction, when compared to their distribution before and after this interval.  If confirmed, this macroevolutionary pattern could be used to predict the response of modern amphibians to future climate perturbations.  Overall, this research will provide new insights into the vertebrate fauna of the Fremouw Formation, as well as shed light on the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems in southern Pangea in the wake of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction.  As part of the broader impacts, the research team will help to develop an exhibit featuring some of the best preserved fossils from Antarctica to explain to the public how paleontologists use fossils and rocks to understand past climates like the Triassic 'hot-house' world that lacked permanent ice caps at the poles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
