<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation of students and junior researchers in the Second Sectional Meeting of the Texas and Louisiana Section of SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) to be held in Dallas, Texas on November 1-3, 2019. The conference will be hosted by Southern Methodist University. The conference program is available online at  http://faculty.smu.edu/sxu/SIAMTXLA19/index.html The conference program contains three plenary talks: one on applications of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and two others on on the mathematics of imaging and seismology. There will be a wide-ranging list of minisymposia on applications to biology, medicine, computer science, materials, communications, and energy science, as well as current topics such as machine learning. In addition, there will be an industrial panel which will address job opportunities for applied mathematicians outside academia. The conference format makes it easy for undergraduate students, graduate students, and young investigators to directly interact with the leading mathematicians who work on interdisciplinary problems at the frontiers of science. Every effort has been made to ensure participation of women and members of other under-represented in mathematics groups, thus increasing the diversity of the regional applied mathematics research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific topics to be discussed at the conference include artificial intelligence in medicine, uncertainty quantification in hydraulic fracturing, inverse problems and their applications to medical imaging, numerical methods for nonlinear waves and turbulence, simulations of biological and complex fluids, graph regularization of high dimensional data, modeling population dynamics in ecology and epidemiology, as well as new research topics such as mathematics of machine learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

With a total of 244 participants from both academia and industry, including 70 women, this was one of the largest SIAM Sectional Conferences. Special efforts were made to ensure diversity and attract underrepresented minorities. For example, the conference attracted several hispanic participants  from University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, a public university with exceptionally high percentage of hispanic students. While most  participants were from universities and research centers in the Texas-Louisiana region,  several universities located in other geographic regions of the country were also represented.   The conference featured invited lectures, mini-symposia, and poster presentations. Invited lectures were given by distinguished researchers on the topics of machine learning in medicine, mathematics of imaging, and models of microseismic events due to hydraulic fracturing. Minisymposia covered a wide range of areas of computational and applied mathematics, including analytical and numerical methods for partial differential equations and inverse problems; algebraic,  geometric, and combinatorial methods for biology; nonlinear waves; data science and machine learning; graph regularization; applied statistics. Applications discussed covered many different areas of science and engineering including biology, geophysics, materials science, mechanical, electrical, and petroleum engineering.  Many discussions during the minisymposia reflected the interdisciplinary nature of the topics and provided perspectives from researchers of different backgrounds.  Graduate and undergraduate students, postdocs, and junior researchers were active participants of the minisymposia.   The grant provided travel support to 19 junior participants, 3 of them women.  Graduate students accounted for 13 travel awards, postdocs for  4. Two recepients were junior faculty.             Last Modified: 12/14/2020       Submitted by: Vladimir S Ajaev]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
