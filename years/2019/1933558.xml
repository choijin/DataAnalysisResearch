<AbstractNarration>This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project will apply engineering techniques in adaptive control to greatly expand the surface geometries accessible to inkjet depositing. Inkjet depositing is a valuable technique, with potential applications that vary from wound treatment to advanced manufacturing. However, this potential is currently limited by the practical restriction of inkjet depositing to printing on flat surfaces. This research will enable new classes of technologies, products, and services. The work will be done through a university-industry partnership between researchers at The University of Texas at Dallas and experts at MicroFab Technologies, a Dallas-area organization. The team will focus on two real-world applications: 1) printing customized wound treatments directly onto wounds arising from cancer tissue removal or traumatic injury, and 2) printing labels onto manufactured parts to increase assembly efficiency. Research outcomes will be integrated into engineering education workshops at UT Dallas, as well as exhibits at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in downtown Dallas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a lack of specific knowledge of droplet motion on curved surfaces after deposition/impact, necessitating methods to detect and alter drop placement to regulate final fluid distribution. This is a complicated problem incorporating estimation of surface geometry, surface chemistry, materials science, and estimation and control theory to regulate correct drop placement with a moving print head. This project requires innovative sensing and control strategies incorporating feedforward, feedback and adaptive control to address uncertainty in the surface measurement and models of the interactions between liquid and surface. Specifically, tools of information theory, nonlinear estimation, optimization, Lyapunov-based stability theory and geometric control will be used to establish a formal approach to conduct such printing with robot manipulators, along with understanding of liquid properties and surface chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

This is a valuable technique, with potential applications that vary from wound treatment to advanced manufacturing.  However, this potential is limited by the practical restriction to printing on level, planar surfaces.    Methods for printing on curved surfaces are often ad-hoc in terms of path planning and control of printer pose and output. This problem is complex interaction between surface geometry, surface chemistry and material science.   This research focused on novel theories and methodologies to print on 3D surfaces of arbitrary shape with desired line width.    There are three major research outcomes.  The first research outcome is a dynamic model of printed line width as a function of valve or motor duty cycle, nozzle velocity and the contact angle arising from chemical and physical properties of the liquid and surface.  Using the duty cycle as input and the line width as output, we can obtain control-affine dynamics.   The second research outcome is a novel adaptive control algorithm to regulate deposition rate, such that spot size and line width are as desired, given no knowledge of the interactions between the liquid and surface.   Our approach simultaneously determines the cumulative uncertainties as a single parameter and provides control to regulate drop diameter.  Stability of the estimator and control law were established through Lyapunov Analysis.  One advantage of our novel approach is that there is no need for a persistently exciting trajectory, which may be essential in printing to regulate a constant line width.  The third research outcome is a theory of surface fitting and mapping a pattern from 2D onto a 3D surface with minimum distortion, along with theories of robot motion control to guide a print head along the path while regulating the distance from the print head to the surface, keeping the print head normal to the surface, and maintaining the velocity of the print head.
