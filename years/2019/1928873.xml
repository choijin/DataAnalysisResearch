<AbstractNarration>The High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC) conference is the premier forum for presenting the latest research findings on the design and use of parallel and distributed systems for high end computing, collaboration, data analysis, and other innovative applications. The travel grant for HPDC 2019 will defray the costs of overnight accommodations, travel costs (e.g. airfare, public transportation), and food. The travel grant is very beneficial for the domestic PhD students. The travel grant supports the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support will be provided for student registration and travel. Support for 10-20 students is anticipated. Availability of support will be advertised and participation from under-represented communities in the travel grant application process will be encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
