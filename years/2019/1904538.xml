<AbstractNarration>Commutative Algebra is a ubiquitous mathematical subject whose techniques and results are utilized in Algebraic Geometry, Number Theory, and Representation Theory. Morgantown Algebra Days is a Commutative Algebra conference which is to take place at West Virginia University on the weekend of April 13-14, 2019. The main objective of the conference is to showcase new mathematical trends to a large group of mathematicians specializing in the subject of Commutative Algebra. Morgantown Algebra Days will feature eight research talks and poster session allowing for younger mathematicians to present their research.&lt;br/&gt;The website for the conference is https://www.math.wvu.edu/mad2019/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
