<AbstractNarration>Dr. Matthew Liebmann and Eric Johnson of Harvard University will investigate the relationship between production in the core of an expanding state and consumption on its colonial borders. Recent work in archaeology reveals the many ways that humans use "foreign-made" objects to forge meaningful social identities. Yet this focus on identity tends to downplay important economic interdependencies between production and consumption. Researchers will analyze the archaeological remains of shell bead manufacturing centers New Jersey between 1750 and 1900 CE. At these sites, Euro-Americans produced shell beads for export to Native American consumers on the Great Plains. How did interactions on the borders of an expanding American state impact industrialization in New Jersey? What factors led to the successes and failures of making and selling products to indigenous consumers? And how did Native consumers use Jersey-made beads to achieve their own social and political goals? Today, much of the American manufacturing sector relies on the tastes of consumers who live outside the country's boundaries. The forces that drive industry - and the success or struggles of workers - are often tied to distant political and cultural factors beyond the immediate understanding of producers. By investigating the effects of state policies on the fortunes of both early American industrialists and Native nations, this research offers key insights into the relationship between the economy, state policy, and international affairs. The archaeological excavations conducted by this project will provide opportunities for student training in scientific methods of archaeology. Researchers will engage publically with community stakeholders through local historical societies and the New Jersey State Museum in an effort to show how a local American industry was intimately tied to indigenous cultures, economies, and conflicts on the Great Plains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will examine changes over time between production and consumption in order to determine the factors that influenced the rise and fall of an American industry. Shell beads have been made in North America for thousands of years, but by the American Revolution, Irish and Dutch settlers in northern New Jersey became the major exporters of beads for the fur trade. Combined with analysis of existing museum collections, excavations in New Jersey will target "proto-industrial" and "industrial" shell bead manufacturing sites to gather archaeological data in the form of debris, waste, bead blanks, tools, and finished beads. These will be examined along with historical accounts, factory ledgers, and fur trade records to track elements of "industrialization" such as efficiencies, technologies, standardization, and scale of output. Archaeological, historical, ethnographic, and portraiture data will be used to track broad regional trends in Native uses of shell beads throughout the 19th century. How were beads worn by different tribes, genders, and ages? In what contexts, and to what end?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project sought to identify and analyze sites of wampum production in New Jersey that were owned or operated primarily by American settlers of European descent in the 19th century. Wampum is a style of shell bead originally produced by Indigenous artisans of Northeast North America. By the late 18th century, European settlers appropriated the manufacture of wampum as a cottage industry in the early American Republic. Beads were used in treaty negotiations and as trade goods on the frontier. This continued after the Civil War, when the trade was industrialized at a site called the Campbell Wampum Factory. The Campbell Factory and another wampum site - Stoltz Farm (1770-1820) - were both excavated by an archaeologist around 1920, but the artifacts from these investigations had never been analyzed, and previous excavations were not conducted systematically or scientifically. In 2018 and 2019, PhD Candidate Eric Johnson analyzed these museum collections and conducted an archaeological survey to identify other sites of household wampum production that predated the Campbell Factory.</p> <p>By the start of fieldwork, Eric had identified four potential sites in sites Bergen County, New Jersey based off archival and oral-historical leads. He surveyed these locations in 2019. Three of these yielded little-to-no evidence of beadmaking. The fourth - the David Campbell House - was positively identified as a site of wampum craft production. Property records and ceramic analysis helped date the beadmaking activity there from 1810-1850, predating the Factory. As a location of Euro-American household wampum production, this is only the third site of its kind that has been discovered in the country and the first of its kind that dates to the 19th century.&nbsp; The debris from shell bead production at the site was classified, cataloged, and analyzed according to count and weight, shell taxa, stages of production, and type of production debris (see Image 1 and 2).</p> <p>What effect did new Indigenous consumers, changing technologies, and centralization of production have on the surrounding region? First, ~90% of shell from the David Campbell House was Caribbean conch (<em>Lobatus gigas</em>). The remainder was Quahog shell (<em>Mercenaria mercenaria</em>). Compared to other sites, this suggests greater reliance on continental-scale commodity chains in the industry relative to previous periods of beadmaking. Second, oral-historical claims about the factory suggested that the introduction of the wampum drilling machine "reduced all waste" in the production process. However, archaeological data suggest much larger quantities of broken beads at the Campbell Factory relative to hand-drilled household production. Third, data suggest that workers in the Campbell Factory who worked at the water-powered grinding stones were at least 500 times over the modern workplace safety standards for calcium carbonate inhalation, putting them at risk of silicosis, a chronic lung disease that became a common side effect of industrialization in the 19th century.&nbsp;&nbsp;Archival research tied to the archaeological data help illustrate inequalities of gender and race in the wampum industry.</p> <p>Spatial analysis of artifacts at the David Campbell House suggests a correlation of domestic artifacts and worked shell (Image 3), providing no evidence that domestic refuse and beadmaking debitage was spatially segregated. This supports historic accounts that note women as primary household beadmakers, particularly in the first half of the 19th century. In the later 19th century, sources make no mention of women working in the space of the Campbell Factory (Image 4). This "change of place" from household to factory work might have entailed a gendered "change of hands" of beadmaking where industrialization helped redirect the control over profits and capital to men, a phenomenon not unique to wampum production. That said, the story of gender inequality in the 19th century is far more complex than the rhetoric of Victorian domesticity implied, as women actively participated in the emergent commercial, monetary, credit, and service economies of the Atlantic World, particularly in urban areas, and it is likely the women of the Campbell family played key roles in the industry behind the silences of the archival record.</p> <p>Finally, this project discovered the role of African American (or possibly Indigenous-descendant) wampum producers in Bergen County. No previous sources noted the presence of people of color in the industr in 19th century New Jersey, but archival research recovered at least four individuals in the northern Pascack Valley who are labelled as either "Black" or "Mulatto" in the U.S. censuses. Beadmaking outwork sustained the households of those such as Peter Sisco, who the 1850 U.S. census lists as a "Black Wampum Maker." By the later 19th century, some of these same surnames - such as James Williams - are found ledgers from the Campbell Factory, where they feature as waged bead grinders. These unacknowledged histories reveal the diversity of actors who participated in the wampum production economy, even if its profits were not evenly distributed.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/06/2021<br>      Modified by: Eric&nbsp;Johnson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1905092/1905092_10591276_1625596870069_Image4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1905092/1905092_10591276_1625596870069_Image4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1905092/1905092_10591276_1625596870069_Image4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photo and illustration of Campbell Wampum Factory.</div> <div class="imageCredit">(A) John C.
