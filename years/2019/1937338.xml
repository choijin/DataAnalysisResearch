<AbstractNarration>The Board on Life Sciences (BLS) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine serves as the Academies' focal point for a wide range of technical and policy topics in the life sciences. These include developments in genetics, including synthetic biology and "gene drives"; the biology of organisms and ecosystems and the conservation of biodiversity; biosafety and biosecurity; and basic biomedical research. BLS organizes and oversees studies that provide advice to the government and the scientific community on the life sciences and their impacts on society as well as on the improvement of biology education and the maintenance of a robust life sciences workforce. Throughout its 35-year history, BLS has produced numerous reports that have had major impacts on science and policy. Detailed information on BLS's many reports may be found at http://dels.nas.edu/bls/. For BLS to continue to produce significant results for the government, the scientific community, and the public, it is necessary to have "core support" so that BLS can carry out important basic functions: holding two meetings of its advisory board per year; allowing BLS to explore emerging areas of biological science and technology to monitor significant new scientific advances; and supporting the staff in their efforts to develop new study ideas and disseminate information about completed reports. The NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences also has interests in fostering the welfare of the life sciences community and promoting the highest quality research throughout the life sciences. Over the years, BLS has provided substantial support to NSF-BIO through the preparation of expert reports that have complemented NSF-supported research to advance the frontiers of biological knowledge, increase understanding of complex biological systems, and provide a theoretical basis for life sciences research. Core support for BLS is an investment that can provide returns across a wide range of NSF's biological science research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to acquire general ("core") support for the National Academies' Board on Life Sciences (BLS). This support will allow BLS to continue to hold two Board meetings per year; use various means (e.g., webinars, guest speaker seminars, planning meetings, etc.) to monitor and explore leading edge topics in the life sciences; and develop ideas for new studies and perform tasks, such as dissemination of completed studies, for which no project funds are available. Over its 35-year history, BLS has produced a large number of high impact study reports as well as conducting other activities with influential results. Some of these have provided impetus for the initiation of new science projects (e.g., sequencing the human genome), advancing new fields of science (metagenomics, glycoscience), fostering new methods of teaching biology (BIO 2010 and its follow on Summer Institutes), and reinforcing or affirming the value of both new and existing facilities and infrastructure (e.g. field stations and marine laboratories). BLS reports have resulted in the establishment of new funding programs or amplifications or directional shifts in existing programs; produced organizational change in funding agencies or research plans; highlighted new research areas or important issues that subsequently received greater emphasis; or established new policies that were adhered to by the scientific community or by funding agencies. Studies prepared specifically for the NSF Biology directorate by BLS have helped inform the Congress to about major investments like the National Ecological Observatory Network, provided two successive five-year plans for the National Plant Genome Initiative, and inspired research in new areas, such as metagenomics and theoretical biological research. BLS reports have also provided suggestions for ensuring the future of field stations and marine labs, and a current study to helping to chart a more sustainable future for biological collections. Because of the convening power of the Academies, BLS is able to access the best scientific minds to contribute to its projects and achieve their goals. Core support from NSF helps allow the Board members and staff to plan and execute studies to assist the Foundation and others with program planning, analysis, and assessment. BLS's capabilities benefit not only NSF itself, but also researchers in the large number of life science sub-disciplines that form NSF BIO's constituencies. More detailed information about BLS and its work can be found at http://dels.nas.edu/bls/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
