<AbstractNarration>The Third National Conference on Doctoral Programs in Mathematics Education will bring together a group of faculty members in mathematics education from a range of institutions that currently graduate doctorates in mathematics education.  The conference participants will learn about current issues that impact doctoral programs and they will have the opportunity to leverage common strengths to make improvements to their individual programs. The conference will focus on two goals: (1) articulate and update principles related to high-quality doctoral programs in mathematics education; and (2) identify and disseminate information about specific doctoral programs specializations in mathematics education. The conference will share the products with a range of audiences in mathematics, mathematics education, teacher education, and educational research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The products for the conference include: (1) an updated Principles to Guide the Design and Implementation of Doctoral Programs in Mathematics Education document which will be available in the website of pertinent professional associations; and (2) a mechanism for institutions and future doctoral students to search and connect with different program specializations. The project will organize more than 100 participants in working groups around the two goals during the conference. The working groups will have the opportunity to continue the work in subsequent meetings to collaborate on the products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
