<AbstractNarration>A severe gypsy moth outbreak began in 2015 in southern New England. By 2018, this outbreak had caused dramatic death of trees across thousands of acres of oak forest. It has been more than thirty years since this invasive insect caused such extensive tree damage and death in eastern North America. This event has created a fleeting opportunity to address a fundamental question in ecology: what are the immediate causes of tree death? Hardwood trees draw on stored starches and sugars in the spring to produce new leaves. Gypsy moths eat leaves, limiting a tree's ability to store enough sugars and starches, and if these drop below a critical level, the tree can die. During last year's outbreak, the researchers established a network of plots in oak forests that had experienced differing severity and frequency of gypsy moth activity. If they act fast and sample starches and sugars from oak trees that have experienced defoliation for 0 to 3 years before they leaf-out this spring, then follow these trees through the next growing season, the researchers can determine if starvation directly causes tree death. Better understanding of the timing and causes of tree mortality will inform forest and landscape tree management. This research will also provide student training in answering science questions and how to apply scientific knowledge to solving forest management problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temperate deciduous trees draw on stores of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in the spring to produce new xylem and foliage. The carbon starvation hypothesis posits that when NSC stores become depleted, secondary growth and flushing is impossible or inadequate, and the tree dies. Defoliation, such as occurs during gypsy moth infestations, is a straightforward mechanism for testing the carbon starvation hypothesis. This study will evaluate NSC levels in relationship to defoliation frequency and severity to determine if there is a critical NSC threshold below which tree mortality occurs. The researchers will sample NSCs by collecting small wood samples from the stem and root of oak trees with known defoliation histories. This study has the potential to offer a mechanistic understanding of tree mortality events and inform the models scientists and policy-makers rely on to forecast ecosystem responses to global change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) is among the most destructive non-native forest insects in North America. After thirty years of quiescence, a surprisingly severe gypsy moth infestation began in 2015 in southern New England, and by 2018 had created dramatic mosaic of oak (Quercus spp.) damage and mortality across thousands of forested acres. This event created a natural experiment to address a fundamental question in ecology: does carbon starvation cause tree mortality?   Carbon starvation posits that defoliation- and drought-induced mortality results from drawing down stored sugars and starches, termed nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs), but evidence is mixed, and mortality is often observed prior to full drawdown of NSCs. We tested the relationship between defoliation severity, NSC drawdown, and tree mortality by measuring NSCs in mature oak trees defoliated by gypsy moths across an experimental gradient of defoliation severity.   We collected stem and root samples from oaks (northern red oak, Quercus rubra; and white oak, Q. alba) in interior forests (n=34) and forest edges (n=47) in central Massachusetts, USA. Three undergraduate students (2 of whom were from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences) contributed to the work, and two graduate students led the research team. Total NSC (sugar + starch) stores were analyzed with respect to tree size, species, and defoliation severity, which ranged between 5 and 100%.   Trees along forest edges had higher total NSC stores that were less sensitive to defoliation than interior forest trees. However, total NSC stores declined significantly in both groups with increasingly severe defoliation. Furthermore, we observed a mortality threshold of 1.5% dry weight total NSC.   Our study draws a direct link between insect defoliation and total NSC reserves and defines a total NSC threshold below which mortality is highly likely. These findings advance understanding and improve model parametrization of tree response to insect outbreaks, an increasing threat with globalization and climate change.
