<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical description: This project aims to develop a new form of ultraviolet light-emitters. Through a detailed theoretical and experimental study of AlInN, this project will identify solutions for the growth of AlInN nanostructured ultraviolet light-emitters. The proposed new generation nanowire light-emitters are promising candidates in solid-state lighting sources, as part of data storage, high-speed communications, information processing, optical interconnects, optical recording sterilization/water purification, medicine and biochemistry, air purification equipment and zero emission automobiles. This research program will offer unique interdisciplinary research opportunities to students at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) to gain experience in epitaxial growth techniques, hands-on device fabrication and characterization of semiconductor devices. Located in Newark, New Jersey, NJIT has a diverse student populating with a large percentage of African-American, Hispanic and women students. This research program will provide strong opportunity to our undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, experiments related to this research program will be modified and introduced to the outreach program planned for K-12 students and teachers through the Center for Pre-college Program at NJIT. This research program encourages students from underrepresented groups, in particular women, minority candidates, veterans and individuals with disabilities to participate in developing new device applications of the III-nitride nanowire semiconductors. Furthermore, research activities will be developed throughout this CAREER program and will be introduced to students in the U.S. and globally to benefit the broader community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: Significant progress has been made in the area of InGaN and AlGaN semiconductors for near ultraviolet and ultraviolet photonic devices, respectively. Nevertheless, the approach of using different III-nitride alloys for ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is relatively unexplored. This CAREER program will focus on fundamentals and quantitative understanding of the epitaxial growth and properties of AlxIn1-xN-based nanostructured ultraviolet LEDs operating in the wavelength range of 210 - 355nm. These nanowire ultraviolet LEDs will be grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The specific research will include: (1) design and simulation of novel nanowire LED structures and geometries; (2) fundamental investigation of the molecular beam epitaxial growth of AlInN nanowire ultraviolet LED structures; and (3) development of AlInN nanowire ultraviolet LEDs implementing unique structures. Detailed structure, optical, electrical, and reliability characterizations will be performed. This research program will enable a first demonstration of nanowire LEDs operating in the ultraviolet regime using AlInN nanostructures. The success of the proposed project will establish a foundation to develop high efficiency and high-power photonic and electronic devices that utilize the full potential of III-nitride nanostructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
