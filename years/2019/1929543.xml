<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to attend the 2019 annual Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK) to be held on the New York University (NYU) campus in New York City, NY. The ESWEEK is a premier international event that brings together three leading conferences in the field, the International Conference on Compilers, Architecture, and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES), the International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS), and the ACM SIGBED International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT), as well as several co-located workshops, tutorials, and one co-located symposium, the International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip (NOCS). The ESWEEK conferences are traditionally attended by a large number of students, allowing them opportunities for interaction with peers from academia and industry around the world, and enabling their participation via paper and poster presentation. Beyond registration fees at reduced student rates, major expenses for attendance include travel and subsistence costs. These often prove  to be beyond limits of affordability of students including those from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide travel support averaging $500 for approximately 30 eligible students to defray their costs of attending and participating and thus increase both the number and diversity of the student population at ESWEEK. Priority will be given to students presenting their research work at ESWEEK and its accompanying (co-located) symposia and workshops, with preference given to US citizens and permanent residents as well as under-represented groups. Under-represented groups will be specifically reached out to and strongly encouraged to apply for this travel grant. This proposal will improve the conference because the increased attendance by students as well as a more diverse participation. It will help to attract under-represented minorities and women to the field of embedded systems and STEM research in general. Finally, students that receive support will benefit by interacting with other students as well as with experts in the field, enabling them to network and establish connections that can help their professional careers going forward, thus helping to create future generations of embedded system designers crucial to technological workforce of the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
