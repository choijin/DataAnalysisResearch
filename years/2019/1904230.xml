<AbstractNarration>Health education in U.S. schools is important, but the curricula and approach can differ across settings. While policymakers, school boards, and parents attempt to exert influence over health education policies, health educators must decide what and how to teach. Even when given mandated curricula, health educators sometimes find ways to repurpose health education for their students. Yet we do not fully understand what circumstances or characteristics allow for such action or how health educators negotiate gaps between curricula and what they believe their students need. Further, health educators are not a homogenous group. While some are full-time, certified health educators who teach in a variety of settings, others are school teachers who teach health education as one part of their job. Scant research describes health education from health educator perspective or compares the experiences of community and teacher health educators in schools. This study will provide needed evidence to address these gaps. Findings from this project will inform professional organizations that train and support health educators, thus promoting efforts to improve the quality and delivery of health education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This qualitative study will generate interview data from 50 school-based health educators, comprised of 25 community health educators and 25 teacher health educators. The project will recruit participants from health education conferences, professional directories, community health organizations, schools, and professional teacher associations. The interviews will describe teaching school-based health education from the perspective of health educators, particularly their experiences with challenges and opportunities. The project will assess how health educator experiences are shaped by employment context, comparing community and teacher health educators to identify how differences in training, employment, and years of experience structure these roles. The project will also consider how health educator personal characteristics, such as race, social class, gender, and age, and structural contexts such as geographical location and school characteristics, such as school size, shape their classroom experiences. The analysis will proceed in two phases. First, the project will code each interview line-by-line, noting any instances of new ideas, orientations, or experiences, and allowing the data to guide which themes emerge. Second, the project will engage in a close analysis of the relationship between the data and theory. The project will review and study the codes from the first phase to determine similarities and differences, reveal patterns that are defining features of the interviews, and identify instances that diverge from the expected themes or initial findings.  Findings will inform sociological theories regarding professionalization and professional autonomy, particularly in the key context of education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Body">As a result of completing data collection and analysis for this project, I find that the work of sex education is influenced not only by politicized curricula (Calterone Williams 2011; Donovan 2017; Fields &amp; Hirschman 2007; Garcia 2009; Irvine 2000; Wilson, Wiley, &amp; Rosen 2012) but also&nbsp;by individual, professional, and structural factors. I find that sex educators are not, as the literature has portrayed, a homogenous group. This study shows that sex educators have varied professional experiences that are shaped by several contextual factors: 1) job title (teachers v. community sex educators); 2) professional affiliation (certifications and organizational affiliations); 3) identities (race, gender, age, and sexuality); and 4) school context (type of school, community context, school administration). These factors have major implications for sex educators&rsquo; sense of curricular autonomy and shape their work in meaningful ways. These differences among sex educators also influence the particular constraints and challenges they face, such as grant requirements, time limitations, and the need to maintain good relationships with school staff and parents, as well as their strategies for navigating these obstacles.</p> <p class="Body">The findings of this study speak to a shift in school-based sex education: that while historically sex educators have been school teachers (usually a teacher of health and/or physical education), schools that lack willing or trained staff increasingly contract this work out to other non-school organizations who provide a community sex educator (CSE). Though both teachers and CSEs teach sex education in schools, no previous research compares their experiences in this context. These differing roles of teachers and CSEs are associated with distinct experiences, are a major factor influencing school-based sex education today, and have important implications for sex educators&rsquo; sense of curricular autonomy. I find that sex educators&rsquo; job titles have meaningful impacts on their sense of job security, their type and degree of expertise, and their autonomy to teach what they believe students need to know and in the way they believe is best. For instance, CSEs experience more precarity in their employment, but feel a greater sense of mastery in the subject matter and feel less bound by parent and administrative approval than teachers. Professional affiliations also have significant impacts on their work&mdash;our data show rifts developing between sex educators who do not have professional certifications or degrees in human sexuality studies, folks who work independently from organizations that rely on grant funding, and those who have degrees from prominent and respected institutions in the sexual health field. Some sex educators voiced their frustrations with the exclusivity that professional certifications, degrees, and organizational affiliations impose on the field; others described the need for and benefits of professionalization and legitimacy of the field through these markers. Finally, our study also shows how sex educators&rsquo; experiences of their work are shaped by their identities. Few prior studies have elucidated how sex educators&rsquo; identities shape their experiences of teaching about sex and sexuality and I find that their race, gender, age, and sexual identities impact their language use, the lessons they teach, and their reception by school staff and students.</p> <p class="Body">Recognizing these differences among sex educators is crucial for understanding how sex education varies across contexts and how sex educators shape sex education lessons in varying ways. School-based sex education remains the primary source of formal instruction on the topics of sex and sexuality for youth (Donaldson et al. 2013; Lindberg Duberstein, Maddow-Zimet, &amp; Boonstra 2016), but there is significant variation in what sex education classes look like from state to state, district to district, and even school to school (Landry et al. 2013; Fields 2008). My findings suggest that the variation in sex education lessons across the country involves more than just the different curricula &ndash; it is also a function of the heterogeneity of sex educators&rsquo; professional, personal, and structural contexts.
