<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support participation by about 13 U.S. graduate students in the Doctoral Colloquium workshop held in conjunction with the 2019 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW 2019), which will be held in Austin, TX, USA on November 9-13, 2019. The annual CSCW conference is a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research, design and practice of collaboration, collaborative systems and social computing. The goals of the workshop are to provide feedback and advice on current research and future careers to students who are nearing graduation; to foster creativity, communication, and collaboration across diverse topics of interest in CSCW; and to build a cohort of leading student social computing researchers. The organizers will make a particular effort to reach students from groups traditionally underrepresented in CSCW (and more broadly computer and information science and engineering) in order to broaden the impact of the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will take place November 9-10, 2019 with follow-up events during the conference's main technical program. Participants will be recruited with a wide net, with an emphasis on broadening participation and diversity of institutions, topics, and fields (including but not limited to from a variety of fields such as computer science/engineering, information science, psychology, cognitive science, and social psychology). The format includes oral and poster presentations by student attendees, a hands-on breakout session, a panel discussion, and an informal dinner and one-on-one conversations with mentors. This format enables students to share and receive feedback on their research while learning from senior and junior researchers in the field. Workshop participants will also gain knowledge of current research conducted by their colleagues, awareness of diverse interdisciplinary methodologies, and an understanding of emerging themes in CSCW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CSCW Doctoral Consortium is an annual event held in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing. In 2019, the conference took place in Austin, Texas, USA, on November 9-12 2019. The annual CSCW conference, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI), is a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research, design and practice of collaboration, collaborative systems and social computing.   The major goals for the Doctoral Consortium were consistent with those articulated by the ACM. Specifically, the goals of the Doctoral Consortium were to:  Build a cohort of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world. Guide the work of the new researchers by having the experts in the research field give advice. Encourage and support the selection of CSCW and Social Computing research topics. Enable promising new entrants to the field to attend this premier research conference. Illustrate the interrelationship and diversity of CSCW and Social Computing research. Make the new entrants’ experience at the CSCW and Social Computing conference an enjoyable and rewarding experience, encouraging them to return and submit papers, panels, demonstrations, and posters to the conference.   Through a two-day Doctoral Consortium coupled with an interactive poster session, we brought together 17 student participants and 5 mentors (excluding the Doctoral Consortium co-organizers). The students and mentors represented a diverse range of scholars across myriad dimensions (e.g. race, gender, topics of interest, and geographic location). Student participants were paired with mentors and peers to engage in conversations to help shape their scholarship and develop their scholarly network through a successful and highly engaging set of activities.
