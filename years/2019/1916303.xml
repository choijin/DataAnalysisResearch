<AbstractNarration>Under the direction of David M. Carballo, Mary Clarke of Boston University will undertake research to study the socioeconomic relationships that comprised ancient Maya economies, focusing specifically on labor relations and artisanal production. Previous scholarship on ancient economies has focused on a number of variables, including the organization of production, the level of commercialization, and the organization of marketplaces and marketplace exchange. While some contexts suggest that the work of producers was directly supported by consumers (they may have provided materials, subsistence goods, and, in some cases, housing for producers), others illustrate that producers worked independently and could directly profit from the commercial exchange or sale of the goods they produced. Commercial activities, however, can still be managed by representatives of the state: the price of goods can be fixed, entrepreneurial activities can be encouraged or prohibited, and financial institutions may control the means of and opportunities for exchange. The evaluation of commercialization in ancient societies requires knowledge of political organization and its strategies, which are reflected in the material records of marketplace exchange, such as marketplaces, household assemblages, and workshops. Archaeology is particularly well placed to provide relevant insight because it can evaluate the material evidence within these locations, which can then be compared across a community, a site, a region as a means of reconstructing ancient economies and economic transactions. Because this research will be conducted by MS Clarke as part of her doctoral dissertation research it will serve a valuable educational function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ms. Clarke will evaluate the ancient Maya economy through an investigation of limestone workshops and producer households. Limestone is a ubiquitous material in Mesoamerica that was used by the ancient Maya for a myriad of purposes, including the construction of monumental art and architecture. Stelae, altars, lintels, and temple stairways made of cut and carved limestone were inscribed with narratives documenting real and mythological events, as well as with depictions of key ritual performances and supernatural beings. At the site of Xultun, Guatemala, a stone production district was found where domestic architecture is integrated with quarry workshops wherein incomplete monuments were found still attached to the limestone bedrock. The limestone producers in this district were specifically producing materials for monumental state expressions, implying a single consumer, the state. Using this district as a case study, this project will assess multiple working hypotheses to address one broader question: how was limestone production organized, both socially and economically, at Xultun, and what does this tell us about labor and power in early societies? Through the analysis of chipped, ground, and pecked stone from Xultun, this project will establish the distribution and nucleation of limestone production work across the site. Moving from social to economic organization, this project will evaluate the systems of exchange visible in household consumption patterns to determine the commercialization of limestone and the extent of state involvement in its production and distribution. Results will be contextualized within the broader, multi-scalar frames of non-renewable resource management, commercialization and local exchange systems, and the production and projection of state identity in ancient society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This dissertation investigates the socioeconomic relationships that comprised Classic Maya economies (c. AD 250&ndash;900), focusing on labor relations and the artisanal production of limestone. A ubiquitous material in Mesoamerica, limestone was used for many purposes, though most notably for monumental art and architecture. Stelae, altars, temple stairways, and other elements of architecture began as limestone quarried from the landscape. Most existing scholarship considers the individuals engaged in these early stages of limestone production in general terms, identifying those who worked in quarries as laborers or non-skilled producers. This study assesses the identities and socioeconomic organization of limestone producers by investigating both limestone quarries and their neighboring residential groups at the site of Xultun, Guatemala (Figure 1).</p> <p>Archaeological survey of Xultun's quarries identified several abandoned quarry workshops where monuments were left unfinished alongside the tools used to produce them (Figure 2). Combined with lithic classification and the results of use wear analyses from other Classic Maya sites, these finds were included in a limestone production toolkit used to determine site-wide distributions. While tools related to quarrying have been recovered in other areas of Xultun, these results illustrate that 51% of the analyzed sample of limestone production tools correspond with populations living next to the limestone quarry workshops (Figure 3). These findings suggest that some households specialized in limestone production.</p> <p>In the Stone Production District, the notion of state sponsorship of limestone production was tested using a multi-proxy analysis of household consumption patterns and provisioning strategies. Comparing obsidian, chert, granite, quartzite, limestone, and pottery resource consumption by households engaged in limestone production, as well as those located outside of the district, this study identified provisioning strategies consistent with the operation of marketplace exchange (Figure 4). A pattern of surplus wealth conversion through marketplace exchange was also observed, whereas vertical exchange&mdash;a pattern suggestive of sponsorship&mdash;was not significant in the sample (Figure 5).</p> <p>This study concludes that Xultun's state institutions did not sponsor the work of specialist limestone producers. Households that quarried and shaped limestone directly profited from their work. This evidence indicates that the limestone resources utilized for monumental purposes by state institutions were also integrated into the economy. These findings offer new insights into the organization of labor and resources for monumental art and architecture, particularly as it concerns the participation of a supportive public and their collaborative investment in symbolic expression.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/27/2021<br>      Modified by: Mary&nbsp;E&nbsp;Clarke</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616854937629_Fig06-01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616854937629_Fig06-01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616854937629_Fig06-01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The site of Xultun with the areas of interest within Stone Production District indicated.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Map by Carlos Chiriboga, 2016; Elaborated by Mary Clarke</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mary&nbsp;E&nbsp;Clarke</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616855118131_Fig08-01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616855118131_Fig08-01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616855118131_Fig08-01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A cut block feature from Xultun: A) Photograph of the feature; B) A detail image of a quarry scar between blocks; C) An elongate biface recovered in this context; and D) A plan drawing of the feature..</div> <div class="imageCredit">A) Photo by Henry Vicente Perez; B) Photo by Mary Clarke; C) Illustration by Antonieta Cajas; D) Illustration by Rachel Gill and Mary Clarke</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mary&nbsp;E&nbsp;Clarke</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616855279432_Fig6.35--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616855279432_Fig6.35--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616855279432_Fig6.35--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Distributions of Stone Production Tools at Xultun, adjusted for an outlier that corresponds to an offering recovered at the sweat bath Los Sapos (Clarke et al. 2021).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mary Clarke</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mary&nbsp;E&nbsp;Clarke</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616855480411_Fig7.14--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616855480411_Fig7.14--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616855480411_Fig7.14--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A summary of the exchange networks among the examined Xultun households.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mary Clarke</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mary&nbsp;E&nbsp;Clarke</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616855637862_Fig7.3rev--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616855637862_Fig7.3rev--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 5."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916303/1916303_10602333_1616855637862_Fig7.3rev--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 5."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Shared Network with an asymmetrical distribution indicates wealth conversion and/or commercial activities.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mary Clarke</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mary&nbsp;E&nbsp;Clarke</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 5.</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
