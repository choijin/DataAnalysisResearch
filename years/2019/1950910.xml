<AbstractNarration>In order to address the increasing vulnerability of coastal systems wrought by climate change, greater scientific understanding of social, economic, and ecological processes is needed to inform decision-making. Texas A&amp;M University's Galveston (TAMG) campus will host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program that will pair ten students with TAMUG faculty mentors who have ongoing, research projects related to the sustainability of coastal systems. Proposed research opportunities emphasize, but are not limited to, the northern Gulf of Mexico. REU students will have access to state-of-the-art scientific facilities and engage in research and professional development workshops. The workshops are designed to enhance their research and metacognitive skills, especially for work in interdisciplinary environments. Workshop topics include: research design and analysis; scientific communication; ethics in STEM research; diversity in STEM; graduate school matriculation; and, careers in STEM. REU students will present their research in three different formats (i.e., oral, poster, and video presentations), which will enhance their research communication skills. Overall, the program is designed to advance scientific understanding of coastal system sustainability, while also training the next generation of scientists and engineers who are essential for making the scientific discoveries and technologies of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will be run each summer for three years, starting in 2021. Each summer, he program will engage ten undergraduates in research projects during a ten-week summer internship, eventually involving a total of thirty students. Mentors will be drawn from TAMUG faculty in the departments of Marine Biology, Marine Sciences, Marine Engineering Technology, Maritime Administration and Liberal Studies. REU students will engage in diverse research topics related to social, economic, and ecological sustainability, including coastal wetland response to climate change, reconstruction of extreme weather events from sediment cores, and use of augmented reality to inform for storm surge protection. Program objectives are: (1) provide a diverse cohort of students with high-impact learning experiences that enhance their research and metacognitive skills; (2) offer students opportunities to experience and establish strong collaborative ties and mentorship relationships with TAMUG faculty; (3) strengthen students' abilities to navigate the academic pipeline; and, (4) foster students' interests and retention in baccalaureate completion, graduate school matriculation, and STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
