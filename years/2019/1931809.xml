<AbstractNarration>Tropical forests store an enormous amount of carbon, with the Amazon alone accounting for 10% of the Earth's primary productivity.  Changes in tropical forest productivity in response to drought are an important feedback in the carbon cycle; yet, we currently have a very incomplete understanding of how biomass, productivity, and species composition of these forests respond to changes in temperature and water availability.  This project will take a new approach to understanding tropical forest drought responses by focusing on the relationships between plant functional traits, metabolic scaling theory, and climate drivers.  Functional traits are easily measureable metrics that allow us to better predict plant growth, reproduction, and forest change.  Metabolic scaling theory describes the relationships between the size of an organism, its growth rate, and temperature.  This project will attempt to significantly advance our understanding of how tropical ecosystems respond to changes in temperature and precipitation. Researchers will use scaling theory to provide a predictive framework that links forest responses to drought with well understood plant traits measured using novel ground and remote sensing technology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will assess changes in productivity in response to drought, as well as tree mortality and forest dieback.  This will be accomplished using both field measurements as well as pre-existing LIDAR and hyperspectral remote sensing data from forests across an elevation gradient in the Peruvian Amazon.  Specifically, researchers will use a suite of plant functional traits to provide detailed, 3D maps of forest canopy structure and the spatial distribution of traits.  The novel scaling theory developed with these data (Trait Driver Theory, TDT) will then be used to predict ecosystem function from changes in trait distributions over time in response to drought.  The project will also involve a field experiment to simulate drought with throughfall collectors to help parameterize TDT model functions.  The TDT results will also be compared to predictions from the ecosystem demography model ED2.  Model code, images, and algorithms will be made available in public repositories, and any new plant functional trait data will be added to global databases.  The project will provide training for several post-doctoral researchers, undergraduate students, and K-12 science teachers and will use the GEM Network Geoweb Portal for outreach to the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The carbon cycle is important for maintaining a stable climate and carbon balance on Earth.  One of the largest uncertainties in global carbon cycle predictions is the response of tropical vegetation to drought.  Droughts are increasing globally in frequency and severity producing documented changes in forest species composition.  A framework for translating these changes in forest community composition into carbon units, ecosystem biomass, productivity, and biogeochemical function that works across multiple scales and in high diversity tropical forest is urgently needed. To address this need, we utilized plant functional traits.  Plant functional traits are the structural, biochemical, physiological, and phenological properties of plants directly linked to the performance of organisms to the environment.  Functional traits capture core differences in the strategies plants use to acquire and invest resources and can be measured by a variety of methods, from in-situ field surveys to remotely sensed providing a link across multiple geographic scales and they can be integrated into models to scale up to their effects on the overall structure, function, and diversity of ecosystems. Determining how the functional composition of communities changes along environmental gradients is the first step toward developing a more mechanistic understanding of climate’s role in driving ecosystem structure and function. Beginning at a regional-scale along an elevation gradient spanning 3300 m in Southern Peru and ~ 16.5C temperature variation, we developed a theoretical scaling framework (Trait Driver Theory, TDT) to link plant function and ecosystem processes and tested the model with trait, productivity, and diversity data from 16 1-ha field plots.  The evaluation of field-data showed that except for the highest elevation forests the dominance and diversity of forest traits and variation in ecosystem productivity were consistent with local phenotypic optima and adaptive compensation for temperature along the gradient. Also, along this tropical forest gradient, single- and multi-trait remotely-sensed measures of functional diversity were shown to be important predictors of variation in rates of net and gross primary productivity. These findings highlight the potential of remotely-sensed functional diversity to inform trait-based ecology and trait diversity-ecosystem function linkages in hyper-diverse tropical forests and show that spatially continuous data on functional diversity, the diversity of traits within a community, can improve our ability to predict global change impacts on ecosystem properties and carbon cycling. Globally, the application of TDT revealed that observed patterns of trait shift across broad latitudinal and elevation gradients are consistent with the expectation that `adaptive/acclimatory’ shift in traits compensate for the kinetic effects of temperature on leaf photosynthesis and tree growth. Further, most of the traits measured showed significantly clustered and skewed distributions consistent with the importance of local filtering of optimal growth traits and recent shifts in species composition and dominance due to warming from climate change. Trait-based metabolic scaling theory provides a basis to predict how shifts in climate have and will influence the trait composition and ecosystem functioning of forests. Together, our results provide an opportunity to compare field and remotely sensed approaches with trait-based ecological studies. We have established that new approaches in remote sensing offer far more measurement coverage than can be achieved in the field and with the fidelity and accuracy reaching those obtainable from field and laboratory methods. As a result, we can test ecological hypotheses and theories on a spatial scale previously unachieved in ecological research.
