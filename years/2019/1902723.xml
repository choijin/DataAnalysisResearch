<AbstractNarration>Mr. Michael Johnson, a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago, will undertake research on how societies integrate new technologies socially and economically.  Early research typically treated technology as applied science with a predetermined developmental trajectory that predicted specific outcomes. Recent work contradicts this, suggesting that technologies and their structures are the result of complex social dynamics between producers, consumers, and other members of a society with a vested interest, often leading to conflict, cooperation, and compromise. These interactions produce unique and materially traceable patterns of specialization, organization, and consumption. Archaeology, with a material dataset spanning millennia, is well suited to studying the material aspects of these phenomena. When supported by ancient textual records, as in the case of the present research, it is also possible to investigate the social dynamics behind the material record, allowing researchers to look at the tension between what people say (texts) and do (material remains), which often reveals information about social ideals and the limits of power. Over the long-term, how do different societies come to terms with new and complex technological suites? Today, as societies grapple with the unforeseen consequences of technologies like the internet, labor automation, and machine learning, the importance of this question is clear - new technologies often do not have straightforward and predictable effects, and different groups, based on their unique priorities, will structure them differently and use them to meet a wide variety of goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Johnson and his collaborators will examine how metallurgical technologies were practiced, managed, and perceived during a crucial transformative period where metallurgy underwent a shift from a small-scale elite craft to a complex industry that facilitated the development of wealth-based economies and increased productive capacity, thereby laying part of the foundation for the formation of large territorial empires. Working with material scientists, geologists, and archaeologists, Mr. Johnson will utilize methods developed in the STEM disciplines to analyze metallurgical debris excavated from the ancient city of Alalakh in southern Turkey. As the capital of a small state with a diverse economic base that was frequently subservient to much larger regional powers, Alalakh is an ideal setting for studying these developments. Through these analyses, the researchers will develop a comprehensive assessment of metallurgical technologies in use over a 400-year period (1600-1200 BC), during which the production of iron was mastered and the manufacture of copper reached a truly industrial scale. Considered in reference to local and regional textual records and their archaeological contexts, the evaluation of these data will permit a thorough assessment of changing methods of production, management, and consumption at a local level and how these trends supported broader social developments. Using a robust interdisciplinary program, Mr. Johnson and colleagues will generate a more thorough protocol for the integration of STEM and humanities datasets, while the international nature of the collaboration with create a valuable venue for cross-cultural teaching and exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the great benefits of studying the ancient world archaeologically is the capacity to challenge aspects of human behavior and society that we often take for granted or to shed light on parts of the past that written records ignore or incompletely address. This project was designed to approach both issues, being originally conceived to shed light on the cooperative relationship between a complex technology like metallurgy and the development of large scale economic systems between urban centers of the ancient world. Because metals represented one of the single most valuable materials to ancient populations and its production and fabrication leaves plenty of durable remains, it is an ideal way to approach this question. By using the site of Tell Atchana, the 2nd millennium BC city of Alalakh, as a case study, we planned to see how ancient royalty - the economic elites of their day - controlled valuable resources and labor in economic systems stretching from modern Pakistan to the Mediterranean.</p> <p>By examining metal objects and production debris at a microscopic level, we were able to reconstruct what methods people used to produce and work with metals. Taking the same samples and looking at them with a scanning electron microscope, we can gain even more information, telling us specifically what kinds of metals they were working with and, sometimes, gaining clues on where the raw material may have come from. Finally, by combining these clues with information on the geochemistry of the samples including lead isotope ratios and elemental compositions, we can make relatively precise suggestions about sources of raw material. Using this information in concert, we can reasonably accurately reconstruct some of the processes people we using over 3,000 years ago.</p> <p>What we found was evidence for two parallel technological systems that had relatively little connection to one another. On the one hand, a wide-ranging system that linked together the kings and palaces of the time that was dependent on a limited set of resources and a limited pool of labor. Technologically it was characterized by efforts to simplify production and control valuable material. On the other, a locally based system that was probably operated by regular people. Here, they circumvented royal control of metals and other goods, using their own social networks to acquire materials they needed to build a life for themselves.</p> <p>This second system was a hidden economy that has rarely been confirmed in the archaeological record up to now. The focus by historians on documents written by political and social elites meant that this local economy was often ignored, assumed to have been under the domination of the textually attested systems, or considered irrelevant. Similarly, a traditional archaeological focus on palaces and temples meant that only part of the story was uncovered. This project has presented a research protocol and methodology combining methods from the natural sciences, archaeology, and history that allows us to start looking in more detail at the lives of everyday people and the ways they resist and cooperate with political power.</p> <p>Finally, although the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the implementation of several collaborations that had been planned within this project, it has still allowed for the establishment of ongoing partnerships and mentorships between institutions such as the University of Chicago, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the Cyprus Institute, the Field Museum, and Mustafa Kemal University. These relationships have already begun to bear fruit, leading to the preparation of student training initiatives involving American and Turkish scholars and future research projects in Turkish, Cypriot, and southeastern United States archaeology.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ultimately, this research has made several significant contributions to the role of archaeology as a historically and socially informative discipline. First, it has contributed to our understanding of some of the world's first gloabilizing systems and how they involved everyday people.
