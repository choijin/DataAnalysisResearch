<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve milk production efficiency of dairy cows by measuring individual cow feed intake, a vital datapoint not typically commercially available in the industry. This datapoint allows dairy farmers to optimize diet formulation which would result in higher milk production per cow and reduce illnesses by being able to provide sufficient nutrients to support the cow's level of milk production.  Using the data derived from this platform will also potentially improve the genetic pool of the herd.  The commercial impact of the project has the potential to result in significant cost savings for dairy farmers by providing the vital benefits of early detection of the five most common diseases and feed costs savings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project uses custom-designed radio frequency identification sensor platform that is installed on feeding alleys and bedding of dairy barns. The sensors are designed to distinguish a cow from consuming or sifting through the feeds to provide a new and efficient way of monitoring dry matter intake on a per cow basis. The sensors also capture individual cow's time spent lying down (rumination time) and the number of visits to the feeding alley. All data gathered by the sensors are sent to the cloud continuously and analyzed by unique machine-learning algorithms to determine a range of behavioral events per individual cow, including feed intake monitoring to identify the most/least feed efficient cows. Decrease in feed intake over a period of time also signifies the onset of illnesses which can be detected prior to becoming clinical cases to reduce the use of antibiotics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Initially, the team hypothesized that the research technology provides three main benefits to dairy farmers, which are 1) reduction in treatment cost and the use of antibiotics with early metabolic illness detection, 2) better management decision making with identification of most feed efficient cow, 3) reduction of labor and cost with automated cow monitoring system.  Through in-depth interviews with dairy farmers and understanding of their farms’ operations, the team learned that metabolic illness in cows is not a major problem in well managed farms, where farms have well defined protocols and KPIs for workers to follow that limit the occurrence of metabolic illness, so the team’s first hypothesis is invalidated. The team also found out that farmers relied on their nutritionists to make most of the herd and feed related management decisions, so the team’s second hypothesis was shifted to benefit nutritionists as the new customer segment rather than farmers. In addition, the team learned that farmers adopt technology not to save labor or save cost, but to improve management and efficiency. Manual laborers are always needed in farms to perform various tasks (feeding, insemination, vaccination, re-grouping), therefore the team’s technology can’t really replace their roles, which invalidated the team’s third hypothesis.  With new insights gathered from interviews, the team continued to form new hypotheses and identify new potential customer segments where the team continued to validate iteratively with additional groups, such as nutritionist, researcher at genetic or nutrition company, and director of innovations at dairy technology company.  The major goals of the project were accomplished, in which the team had gathered first hand evidence of customer needs and had determined a clear no go decision of the research technology for any customer segments identified in the dairy industry. The major reason that leads to this decision was that, even though there are some benefits of the research technology, it doesn’t address customer segments’ top most needs, which are qualified labor shortage, labor management, and low milk price.
