<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Isaac Garcia-Bosch of Southern Methodist University is studying new copper compounds and their interactions with oxygen and hydrocarbons.  The long-range goal is to discover new routes to compounds that could be useful as pharmaceuticals, polymers, and other industrially useful chemical compounds. The approach is inspired by the roles of copper catalysts in nature, which are known to promote the oxidations of hydrocarbons. These oxidations convert inexpensive hydrocarbons into high-value products.  The research examines how the structure of the copper catalysts influences their interaction with oxygen, which in turn influences the course of the reactions. Dr. Garcia-Bosch is introducing bioinspired experiments into the teaching laboratory.   The grant also supports outreach activities aimed at making chemistry attractive to Hispanic students, especially women. These activities include hands-on laboratory training and demonstrations, which are provided in Spanish and in English. These outreach activities are expected to increase the scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Isaac Garcia-Bosch of Southern Methodist University is developing copper complexes as oxidation catalysts.  Of particular interest are challenging transformations, such as the functionalization of carbon (C)-hydrogen (H) and C=C bonds, under mild conditions, using cheap and non-toxic reagents. Taking inspiration from natural metalloenzymes, the catalysts are designed to contain a redox-active ligand with tunable H-bonding donors, which allows for control of the reactivity of the intermediate species that are formed during these transformations. Through collaborations, the structure and spectroscopy of these copper complexes and the reaction mechanisms are being elucidated. In parallel with the research project, Hispanic high school students are invited to participate in one-day science fairs, which are conducted in Spanish and English.  The goal is to improve both the communication and scientific skills of the young students. A new training program is being developed (Hispanic Women Summer Research Program, HWSRP), in which Hispanic female students are provided mentoring and hands-on training in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
