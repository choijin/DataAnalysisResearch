<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of early-career US-based mathematicians in the 4-month program "Complex Analysis: Techniques, Applications and Computations'' to be held at the Isaac Newton Institute (INI) for Mathematical Sciences (Cambridge, UK) from September 2 to December 19, 2019. The program includes three workshops and sets of masterclasses (expository lectures given by leaders in the field), and will give junior scientists, at a critical career stage, a chance to participate in a workshop and masterclass in their research area. The workshops are "The complex analysis toolbox: new techniques and perspectives", from September 9 to 13, 2019; "Complex analysis in mathematical physics and applications", from October 28 to November 1, 2019; and "Computational complex analysis", from December 9 to 13, 2019. Complex variable and analytic function theory play an elemental role in a diverse array of applications and areas of mathematics. The classical work carried out over decades in traditional fields is now providing the foundations and inspiration for new and rapid growth in many exciting new directions. The INI program will advance the field by bringing together key researchers working at the frontiers of these new developments and will help steer future endeavors by identifying the most important scientific challenges arising from the new techniques, methodologies and insights. The program will also focus on elucidating the unexpected connections between different branches of complex analysis that have been emerging over the past few years. To this end, the program will encompass mathematicians as well as physicists and engineers working on theoretical aspects, computational methods, mathematical modeling and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will be aimed at supporting participation in the workshops and secondarily the broader program. The main impact will be the training and career development of junior researchers. Bringing together scientific leaders for extended periods will provide a synergistic forum for creative collaboration, which will be particularly beneficial to the early-career participants who will be supported. They will have the opportunity to learn from senior colleagues and to highlight their work to the community, and will bring new ideas for their research programs back to the US, thereby enhancing the mathematical sciences infrastructure as a secondary impact of the award. The organizers will also hold a moderated session discussing how complex analysis is taught, and exploring new innovations in the classroom, including demonstrations. This will be particularly useful for junior participants who may be embarking on teaching careers. A diversity committee has been formed to identify promising diverse participants (female or underrepresented minorities) and involve them in the program and workshops. The website for the program can be found at https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/cat and includes details about the workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
