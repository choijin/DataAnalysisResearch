<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Coastal wetlands are among the most valuable and threatened ecosystems across the globe. Given their declining status, significant effort has been devoted to conservation and restoration. However, most efforts fail to meet stated goals because of an emphasis on practices rooted in an incomplete understanding of these ecosystems. Due to traditional restoration approaches, a knowledge gap exists in our current understanding of the factors that maintain the health and functioning of coastal wetlands. Further, conservation practices that aim to protect ecosystems often fail to consider local values, knowledge systems, and needs (altogether known as 'biocultural values'), an oversight which can cause conflict and impact conservation outcomes. This project therefore aims to link the ecological values of coastal wetlands with the associated biocultural values anchored to the surrounding communities. This interdisciplinary approach endeavors to guide conservation practices towards just and sustainable solutions. The restoration and management recommendations that result from this work will thus have implications for conservation and restoration approaches in the various global locales where the need for environmental conservation and cultural preservation overlap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this study are to (1) address a biological knowledge gap in coastal wetland ecosystem ecology, (2) determine the social and biocultural values associated with coastal wetlands, and (3) incorporate ecological data and biocultural knowledge and values into coastal wetland restoration practice and land management decisions. These objectives will be addressed by (1) conducting a consumer presence-absence field experiment to determine impacts on various essential coastal wetland processes, (2) conducting focus groups and open-ended key informant interviews along with a systematic literature review, and (3) engaging with local environmental management officials to inform best-practices for restoration utilizing the results of the field experiment and interviews. This project also aims to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in conservation by engaging high school and undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds through various means, including the AMNH-sponsored Inclusive Conservation Community Initiative, the Science Research Mentoring Program, and Fellowship-sponsored research assistants. Additionally, specific training objectives include developing and piloting focus group interview procedures, engaging local government and land management agencies in data-driven restoration decisions, and combining ecological and sociocultural perspectives to improve conservation outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
