<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports conferences and workshops that seek to increase the research and education capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students and faculty at HBCUs.  Winston Salem State University will organize the 3rd NOBCChE Collaborative Conference to be held on April 9-10, 2020 at Hampton University. Undergraduate and graduate students from six institutions will attend this two-day conference to present their research and build a network of support by interacting with faculty and industry representative.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOBCChE is the National Organization for the Professional Advancements of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers, a professional organization dedicated to assisting black and other minority students and professionals in fully realizing their potential in academic, professional, and entrepreneurial pursuits in chemistry, chemical engineering, and allied fields. This conference will facilitate the creation of networks of underrepresented students and faculty members; offer technical and professional development opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students; generate potential collaborative research opportunities for faculty; and build long-term trustworthy relationships. This conference will build on and strengthen these relationships through frequent interactions, face-to-face encounters, and a thorough understanding of the uniqueness of each of the institutions - Auburn University, Hampton University, Jackson State University, Ohio State University, University of Pittsburgh, and Winston-Salem State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We formed the NOBCChE Collaborative roundtable in 2017 as an avenue to develop a pipeline of academic career opportunities for NOBCChE undergraduate, graduate, and post&#8208;doctoral members that helps to achieve NOBCChE?s overall mission and seeks to improve the representation of people of color in academia. The collaborative consists up of six institutions, and in 2018 the partner institutions established an annual conference that provides a novel means of fostering diverse and inclusive environments and opportunities in STEM through a collective impact model. The first annual conference met at Winston-Salem State University. Shortly after submitting an NSF proposal to fund our 2020 annual meeting, we organize the second 2019 annual conference at Jackson State University. The third annual meeting was scheduled for April 2020, with host Hampton University but was canceled due to safety concerns surrounding the COVID-19 crisis. The 2020 conference at Hampton University was to host the 1<sup>st</sup> Annual NOBCChE Collaborative Poster Competition for undergraduate and graduate students. These yearly meetings have fostered relationships formed with the Collaborative through frequent interaction, face-to-face encounters, and through understanding the uniqueness of each institution, its campus, departments, faculty, and students. Even though we were not able to organize the 2020 conference, we are reporting on the outcomes achieved until the point when we cancel the scheduled meeting. We report on the following results:</p> <ul> <li>The 2019 Annual meeting organized at Jackson State University was attended by faculty and students from Auburn University, Hampton University, Jackson State University, Ohio State University, the University of Pittsburgh, Vanderbilt University, and Winston&#8208; Salem State University. Discussions at the meeting included planning and strategizing research talks and discussions about on&#8208;going potential collaborative research projects, and increasing outreach activities and social media presence to increase student participation and recruitment.</li> <li>Shortly after the 2019 annual meeting, NOBCChE Collaborative establishes a newsletter to be published every semester. We published the first two newsletters before the COVID-19 pandemic hits.</li> <li>Dr. Bakarr Kanu of Winston-Salem State University visited the University of Pittsburg and presented a seminar on ?Developing Unique Identity for Drugs &amp; Explosives in Ion Mobility Spectrometry.?</li> <li>Dr. Vincent Ortiz of Auburn University visited Hampton University and presented a seminar on ?Diffuse Dyson Orbitals in Rydberg Anions and Solvated&#8208;Electron Precursors.? </li> <li>Dr. Raul Hernandez Sanchez of the University of Pittsburgh visited Hampton University and presented a seminar on Tubular[n]arenes.? Dr. Sanchez also spoke to graduate students about educational and career opportunities in the field of chemistry.</li> <li>NOBCChE Collaborative members and guests gathered for the fall 2019 NOBCChE Collaborative meeting in St. Louis, MO, on November 19, 2019, at St. Louis Union Station during the 46th Annual NOBCChE National meeting. During this gathering, K&#8208;12 Educational Consultant, Ms. Valorie Hutson, of Hutson Consulting Services discussed programming to provide underrepresented students with STEM-oriented pathways to prepare for college and careers through the development of STEM pipeline collaborative partnerships with Universities. Initial target universities would include those that have a NOBCChE presence.</li> <li>1<sup>st</sup> Annual NOBCChE Collaborative Poster Competition advertised among member institutions. Twenty poster abstracts submitted by undergraduate and graduate students from member institutions before the meeting was canceled.</li> <li>Travel plans initiated for faculty and students to travel to the 2020 meeting but were halted due to the COVID-19 crisis. Because of the halt, we will be requesting a no-cost extension to host this meeting in 2021.</li> </ul><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/30/2020<br>      Modified by: A Bakarr&nbsp;Kanu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933835/1933835_10614863_1596143075061_2019NOBCChECoollaorativeMeeting_JSU(2).jpg--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933835/1933835_10614863_1596143075061_2019NOBCChECoollaorativeMeeting_JSU(2).jpg--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2019 NOBBCChE Collaborative Meeting at JSU"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1933835/1933835_10614863_1596143075061_2019NOBCChECoollaorativeMeeting_JSU(2).jpg--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2019 NOBBCChE Collaborative Meeting at JSU"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Picture of faculty and some students touring the Jackson State University campus.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. A.
