<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the standardization, acceleration and optimization of process development in the biopharmaceutical industry. Currently, the production of biological molecules for human therapies is largely based on a non-standardized design of experiments that are often time consuming, labor intensive and expensive. This project develops an in-vitro / in-silico platform that standardizes the production process design following a specific framework, applicable to a wide variety of producer cell and product combinations. The in-silico mathematical model allows to explore the whole design space reducing the number of in-vitro experiments and the labor burden, and to apply model-based optimization techniques to select the best production conditions for new drugs. The acceleration of the process design has significant impact on reducing time-to-market for drugs that are needed in the market as soon as possible, for example for FDA fast track approval candidates. Additionally, the capital and operational cost reductions can help new biomanufacturers to make their businesses technically and economically feasible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project responds to the need for novel biomanufacturing approaches, including Quality by Design (QbD) principles and Process Analytical Technologies (PAT), which allow fast and effective process development platforms that ensure consistent product quality and reduced lot-to-lot variability. This platform incorporates QbD and uses PATs. The central component of the tool is a mathematical model that predicts dynamic nutrient uptake based on biochemical reaction networks, to quantify and characterize cell metabolism. The in-vitro component of the platform collects critical information to determine cell type/product/clone-specific parameters. These parameters give high predictive capability to the mathematical model to determine the specific media composition and feeding strategy to optimize the volumetric productivity of cell cultures producing biomolecules for human therapies. The precision of the media composition and feeding strategy reduces raw materials and operational cost, the increased volumetric productivity reduces equipment size and capital cost, and the capability to feed the exact nutrients demand for cell proliferation, maintenance and production, ensures product quality. This bioprocess optimizer represents a flexible and efficient tool that transforms, improves and accelerates conventional process development in biomanufacturing with wide applications, including biologics, cell therapies and gene therapies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

During the "Research and Development" stage, quality and purity of the product was the clear challenge. During, the manufacturing stage under "good manufacturing practices", productivity was the clear challenge. In terms of "Technology Transfer", the challenges were fast time-to market and cost reduction (capital and operational). Nonetheless, the most relevant parameter across the process development stages was productivity.   3) We defined our value proposition as a results of the interviews: Our intended product, BioProcess Optimizer, is a computational tool that assists bioprocess engineers in designing optimal processes for manufacturing of biopharmaceutical products to increase productivity by 50%. This was extremely appealing to industry.  4) We identified customer's need and we aligned appropriately our value proposition: Production process engineers were identified as the main customer segment. Our selected value proposition for this segment was "Increase cell number and productivity by 50%, while reducing costs". This was appealing to industry.  In conclusion, the customer discovery findings highlighted that "pains" in the human therapeutics market such as quality, purity, productivity, fast time-to market and cost reduction were aligned with our value proposition, and helped eliminating non-human competitors (primarily animal therapeutics) as potential market entry points. More specifically, the principle industry segments where our efforts should be concentrated were defined as biologics (monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, peptides), cell therapies (mesenchymal stem cells and CAR T-cell therapies) and clean meat (poultry, bovine, porcine). Specifically, during the I-Corps  program, we identified that the clean meat industry, as a novel new market in early stages of commercialization, would be a suitable collaborator during customer validation. The biologics market would be our key customer during customer validation, considering its market size.          Last Modified: 03/01/2020       Submitted by: Athanasios Mantalaris]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
