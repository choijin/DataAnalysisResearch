<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Xavier University will redesign two freshmen lab courses as Course Based Research Experiences (CUREs).  Impacts of the XULA CURE model will be assessed in multiple areas including affective gains and student retention rates in the department of Biology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CUREs are gaining attention for their ability to offer meaningful research opportunities to all students in a classroom setting, yet few undergraduate minority-serving institutions currently have established CUREs as part of their curricula. There is a great need to study classroom-based research experiences and outcomes of underrepresented minorities (URMs) and students who differ in factors like race and ethnicity.  This CURE-infusion project will infuse two authentic research projects in Biology foundational labs and will be the first of its kind at an HBCU where all freshmen in the high enrollment freshman courses will actively participate in real-world research.  This will also be the first time that data on impacts of CUREs on URM student-learning, self-efficacy, project-ownership and retention in STEM will be analyzed thus significantly advancing knowledge of science education at HBCUs.  The key objectives of the XULA CUREs include increasing students? scientific competencies, motivation and self-efficacy and broadening their knowledge of career options. In addition to the pedagogical contributions, scientific findings obtained by XULA students will also advance the knowledge of both Yeast ORFans and Aspergillus genetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
