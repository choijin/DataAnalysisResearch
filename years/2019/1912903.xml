<AbstractNarration>The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to make physicians more efficient and improve the quality of patient care.  Potential short term societal and commercial impact includes improved quality of life for physicians, increased capacity for physicians to see more patients, and greater ability for physician to focus on the patient thereby enhancing the quality of healthcare service delivery.  Physicians spend over half their day working with electronic health record systems and typically spend an additional 1.5 hours on clinical documentation at the end of their day.  In the long term, the potential societal and commercial impact is improved quality of care as this work develops a learning health system where the technology can learn from the care of each patient to inform the care of future patients.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps process will reveal the value that the intended product can deliver in making physicians more efficient and improving the quality of patient care across market segments (i.e., clinical specialty, care delivery method) as well as better understand the key opportunities, challenges, and stakeholders across segments.  The proposed technology captures clinical documentation in a structured format ready to be utilized by machine learning algorithms in order to enhance physician efficiency by reducing the documentation burden.  Additionally, the datasets can be used to support various needs of health systems including quality improvement, clinical research, operational efficiency, and billing support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our technology writes the doctor's note for the patient encounter using AI and human scribes. At the click of a button on a laptop or mobile device, we convert doctor-patient conversations into structured documentation using machine learning, natural language processing, and remote human scribes. Our AI-assisted scribes capture and structure the documentation in near real-time. This structured documentation is represented in a format ready for machine learning and mapped to common ontologies. This dataset can be used to automate more of the scribing process and reduce the human scribe workload over time.  The broader impact and commercial potential of this NSF I-Corps project is to make physicians more efficient and improve the quality of patient care.  Potential short term societal and commercial impact includes improved quality of life for physicians, increased capacity for physicians to see more patients, and greater ability for physician to focus on the patient.  Physicians spend over half their day working with electronic health record systems and typically spend an additional 1.5 hours on clinical documentation at the end of their day.  In the long term, the potential societal and commercial impact is improved quality of care as this work develops a learning health system where the technology can learn from the care of each patient to inform the care of future patients.   This I-Corps project has helped us understand the value we can deliver in making physicians more efficient and improving the quality of patient care across market segments (i.e., clinical specialty, care delivery method) as well as better understand the key opportunities, challenges, and stakeholders across segments.  Our technology captures clinical documentation in a structured format ready to be utilized by machine learning algorithms - this can help make physicians more efficient by reducing their documentation burden.  Additionally, we can re-use this clean documentation dataset to support the various needs of health systems including quality improvement, clinical research, operational efficiency, and billing support.  Preliminary testing of this technology focused on generating the physician's note has demonstrated time savings for the physician.  The I-Corps instructors provided training in entrepreneurship and business model development through two in-person sessions and weekly conference calls.  The curriculum is based on Steve Blank's lean launchpad course.  Through this process we developed a business model for taking our technology to market and began the process of building a sales funnel.  Model development was based on 124 customer and stakeholder discovery interviews including 102 in-person interviews.  We have continued to iterate on our business model after the completion of the NSF I-Corps program using the principles we learned.  Our sales funnel efforts helped us identify initial customers for our technology.  These efforts helped support the formation and growth of our startup company, PredictionHealth.  We have shared our experiences to encourage students and faculty at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine that are interested in entrepreneurship to apply for the NSF I-Corps program.
