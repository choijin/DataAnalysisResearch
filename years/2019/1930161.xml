<AbstractNarration>The National Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Service Conference supports community-based efforts contributing to the exploration of the nature, composition, and execution of NSF supported national scale coordinated cyberinfrastructure services that are responsive to evolving technologies, solutions and user needs, with the overarching goal of supporting the full range of computational- and data-intensive research across all of science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will enable the exploration national scale coordinated cyberinfrastructure services that support the next generation of science and research in light of rapidly evolving technology landscape and increases in capability, which have the potential to change and transform the future of science. The conference will also directly address critical issues regarding workforce development and preparedness to support next general science, including training, education, and developing the next generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching objective of the Conference was to rethink the nature, composition, and execution of NSF-supported national scale coordinated cyberinfrastructure services that are essential to 21st century science &amp; engineering research and education.   The Conference reviewed  a wide set of the state-of-the-art capabilities and services in scientific cyberinfrastructure and provided a set of six observations that can be used by NSF to develop the next generation of CI to support science in the coming decades.  The conference also identified the rapidly growing importance of the need to roll-out and support new CI capabilities to support science as well as accelerating services that focus on integration and coordination.  Observation One &ndash; Transforming Science: The growth in CI capabilities is significantly transforming all aspects of our lives, and we are rapidly approaching a new inflection point on how research and education are being conducted.  Observation two &ndash; Itâ€™s an Ecosystem: the core of CI is no longer just about HPC or Data writ large.  The evolving CI is an ecosystem that includes people, software, networks, data, and compute capabilities.  All are necessary components of the ecosystem.    Observation three &ndash; New Domains Served: The CI Ecosystem underpins today almost all scientific domains and frequently emerges as the pace-setter for advances in these domains.   Observation four &ndash; Spanning all Campuses: This CI Ecosystem is becoming a fundamental requirement and capability for all campuses.  CI has evolved to become part and parcel of the university structure supporting education and research for undergraduates, graduates, and faculty.   Observation five &ndash; Integrative Services: The rapidly evolving CI Ecosystem requires new approaches to offering effective services to sciences that covers all the CI components.  This in turn means a persistent focus and approach to provide integrative services and support across all the CI components and emerging technologies.   Observation six &ndash; Service and Resource Allocation: The emerging CI Ecosystem requires new approaches on how to allocate CI services, which includes computer, data, support, and other resources.
