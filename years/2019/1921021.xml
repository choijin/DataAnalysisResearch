<AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial travel support for 24 U.S.-based undergraduate and graduate students to attend the 2019 Meeting of the North American Membrane Society (NAMS) in Pittsburgh, PA on May 11-15, 2019. NAMS is a premier membrane conference, providing outstanding technical sessions across the full breadth of topics within membrane science and technology. The theme of the 2019 meeting is "Membrane Separations for Emerging Water, Energy, and Health Applications," which aligns with several Grand Challenges recently identified by the National Academy of Engineering. The meeting has a rich history of engaging graduate student researchers directly through targeted programs and award opportunities. The goal of this project is to extend these opportunities to undergraduate students interested in membrane science and technology but who are not yet committed to pursuing the field as a career. The targeted undergraduate mentoring program will ensure the students take full advantage of the technical, social, and networking opportunities available to them at NAMS 2019. Early engagement in a professional society/conference will provide students with motivation and encouragement to pursue advanced degrees in their respective fields and, subsequently, develop a healthy and diverse workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NAMS organizing committee is comprised of diverse North American researchers, and invited speakers from academia, industry, and government labs feature prominently in the program. The meeting will feature five technical workshops, over 30 technical sessions, daily plenary sessions, a poster session, and abundant unstructured discussion periods to catalyze new collaborative relationships and research ideas. The 2019 NAMS meeting will cover the following topics: (1) membrane materials - chemistry and characterization; (2) membrane processes - fundamentals and improvements; and (3) membrane applications - water treatment, energy, and biological/food. Historically, hundreds of graduate students participate in the NAMS meeting and engage in unique professional development and training opportunities. This travel supplement will extend these opportunities to undergraduate students through a targeted mentoring program. Undergraduate students will be paired with senior graduate student mentors who will serve as meeting guides. Throughout the meeting, the students will engage in immersive professional and technical development opportunities tailored to their needs. The program's effectiveness will be assessed through surveys and observation of student outcomes. It is anticipated that the award of travel subsidies will attract diverse young scientists in the field and enhance the membrane science and technology workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal provided support for the development of an Undergraduate Student Travel Award program for the 2019 Annual Meeting of the North American Membrane Society (NAMS).  A dozen undergraduate students from around the country were selected to attend the NAMS meeting in Pittsburgh in May 2019.  The undergraduates were each matched with a graduate student to help them navigate through the conference, including the Lunch with Legends, Student Workshop, Welcome Reception, and more.  This was a unique opportunity for the undergraduates to learn more about NAMS and the membrane field, while at the same time getting a chance to network with students and membrane researchers from around the world.   A student survey was conducted to assess the program immediately after the NAMS conference.  Every one of the undergraduate awardees specifically indicated that they would like to see NAMS continue to offer this opportunity in the future.   Selected (anonymous) comments from the students included: I didn't realize how huge the membrane community is and being immersed early into my education/career has definitely increased my interest. During several presentations I thought to myself "this is intriguing, I could see myself working on a similar project". Overall the NAMS Undergraduate Student Travel Award was an incredible opportunity. I am honored to have received it and to have attended the annual meeting.
