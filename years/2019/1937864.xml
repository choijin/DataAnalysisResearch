<AbstractNarration>The condensed matter and materials research sciences constitute a broad and diverse area in which research typically is carried out by small research groups. While the research of these groups is, for the most part, conducted independently, many of these groups interact through contractor meetings, at national laboratories and in Energy Frontier Research Centers, and some rely on national user facilities in conducting their research programs. The National Academy of Sciences' Condensed Matter and Materials Research Ccommittee 9CMMRC) has accepted responsibility for monitoring developments in and assessing the health of the fields that make up this area, and provides a unique and essential resource for these science communities. Its membership is drawn from universities, industry, and national laboratories, and its members' areas of expertise include condensed-matter physics and solid state chemistry, and materials research aspects of ceramics, electronic materials, metallurgy, polymers, and biophysics. The experts involved are broadly representative of the community and they provide their informed perspectives on issues that affect the progress and vitality of research in these areas. Participation by members in committee meetings and deliberations can lead to fresh insights and new perspectives on key questions that drive the forefronts of scientific research in these fields and support for that research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Condensed Matter and Materials Research Committee (CMMRC) is one of five standing committees of the National Academies Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA) and is charged with assisting the BPA in achieving its goals, monitoring the health of physics and astronomy, identifying critical new developments at the scientific forefronts, fostering interactions with other fields, strengthening connections to technology, facilitating effective service to the nation, and enhancing education in physics. CMMRC carries out its functions in several ways - providing expert advice on monitoring the health and providing perspectives on issues in condensed matter and materials research to the BPA; assisting other National Academies boards in developing proposals and initiating studies that impact these fields of importance to the condensed matter and materials research communities; and providing a means for dialog with federal agencies on these and related fields.  During the reporting and pre-award period, the CMMRC held three meetings on February 28-29, 2020, June 2 and June 4, 2020 and September 2, 2020; discussed possible project and future membership ideas; and iterated on topical subjects for its annual workshop. Much of the work necessary to prepare for the committee's next workshop occurring on 05/2021 was also during this reporting period.
