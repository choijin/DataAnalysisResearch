<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation for three one-week events during a semester-long program at the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques (CIRM), in Marseille, France. Specifically, the three events are: &lt;br/&gt;(i) Research School: Coulomb Gases, Integrability and Painleve Equations, 11-15 March 2019 &lt;br/&gt;(ii) Large Conference: Integrability and Randomness in Mathematical Physics, 8-12 April 2019 &lt;br/&gt;(iii) Research workshop: Integrability and Nonlinear Dispersive Waves, 24-28 June 2019 &lt;br/&gt;The award gives US-based early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of support a chance to attend and participate in this international meeting. The organizing committee will make major efforts to recruit speakers and attendees from these groups to promote diversity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in the field of mathematical analysis, especially in the subfield of mathematical physics.   The main topics will be integrable systems and random phenomena, and their relations to other fields of mathematics, including probability theory, operator analysis, representation theory, combinatorics, partial differential equations, and complex analysis.  More information can be found on the program's web site https://www.chairejeanmorlet.com/2019-1-grava-bufetov.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From January through June 2019, the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques (CIRM) in Marseille Luminy, France, hosted a research semester on Integrability and Randomness in Mathematical Physics. CIRM is the French equivalent of one of our NSF funded mathematical sciences research institutes, and this special semester brought together the top international researchers in this broad field spanning areas of mathematics, physics, and applications.  The semester was funded by French and European sources, as well as the Clay Mathematical Institute, and this grant. This grant facilitated US participation, primarily for students and early career mathematicians.      Intellectual merit: The programme brought together mathematicians and physicists that work broadly in the field of integrability and randomness. Contributions ranged across mathematical physics, probability theory, operator analysis, theoretical physics, representation theory, combinatorics, partial differential equations, and complex analysis.    Broader Impact: This project provided the opportunity for United States based researchers working in mathematical physics, probability, combinatorics, and partial differential equations to make new discoveries, exchange and foster new ideas, learn about new results, and create new mathematical techniques.  Special effort was devoted to the recruitment of graduate students and junior faculty, particularly women, to attend the research school and the conference so that they will be exposed to the front line of research in the field. The research semester attracted mathematicians and physicists towards multidisciplinary mathematical subjects, and fostered interactions between scientific communities working on different subjects.
