<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to support U.S. scientists to attend an international meeting about ranaviruses for their development as scientists. Ranavirus has triggered localized die-offs of amphibians.  It also has the potential to drive endangered populations to extinction.  Ranavirus infection is a worldwide problem. Thus, a solution requires expertise and collaboration with a wide variety of experts. The 5th International Symposium on Ranaviruses (5th ISR) brings scientists from North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia together to share research about ranavirus infections, host susceptibility to infection, immunity against infection, and improved diagnostic tests.  NSF funds will support the participation of early stage investigators.  This will provide an opportunity for US-based junior scientists to share their knowledge and to promote the progress of science (and NSF mission). This helps train the next generation of researchers, which is one of the missions of the NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports travel of junior investigators to the 5th International Symposium on Ranaviruses (5th ISR). This meeting will address multiple issues related to ranaviruses and the diseases they cause.  At the ecological level, the 5th ISR will address how to diagnosis, control, prevent, and (in a limited number of settings) treat ranavirus disease.  At the population level, the meeting will identify potential host species, ascertain the basis for susceptibility, and develop models to better understand (and hopefully predict) the outcome of infection.  Finally, identifying specific elements of the host immune response that correlate with protection from disease, and determining, at the molecular level, the basis for viral virulence, will provide insights into how ranaviruses trigger host die-offs and how the host combats infection.   Collectively, the meeting will bring together ecologists, modelers, immunologists, pathologists, and molecular virologists to address this multi-faceted host-virus system.  Because the problem of ranavirus-mediated disease is worldwide, any attempt at understanding the intricacies of this phenomenon require international collaboration.  This meeting encourages active participation of young investigators. Thus, this NSF award provides an opportunity for early career scientists to establish themselves in the field and to provide their input for future directions in ranavirus research. The strength of the 5th ISR is that it creates genius by bringing together individuals with complementary talents to resolve an issue that each by themselves can only partially address.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF travel grant support for attendance of five US investigators at the 5th International Symposium on Ranaviruses (ISR), James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, AU, June 4 ? 6, 2019  NSF funding partially supported the attendance of five US scientists (three faculty members and two graduate students) at the 5th ISR.  These individuals were active participants in the meeting serving as authors or co-authors on 10 of the 18 platform presentations and 13 of the 26 poster presentations.  The meeting brought together researchers from North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and permitted them the opportunity to exchange the latest information about ranaviruses, the diseases they cause, and their impact on commercially and ecologically important amphibians, fish, and reptiles.  The meeting covered topics such as antiviral immunity, viral diagnostic techniques, viral ecology, biosecurity, molecular biology, gene function, and pathogenesis.  Attendance at the meeting supported all the above areas of science and enhanced the education of young investigators by giving them a chance to present at an international meeting and to meet colleagues from around the world interested in viral disease.  Given the negative impact that infections by ranaviruses and other members of the family Iridoviridae have on farm-raised fish and ecologically important amphibians, having a strong US presence at meetings such as this is important in preventing disease outbreaks in the United States.
