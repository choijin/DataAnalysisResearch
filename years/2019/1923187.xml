<AbstractNarration>Optogenetics, the use of light-gated ion channels or pumps to excite or inhibit the transient activity of genetically targeted neurons by pulses of light, has proved its enormous potential for understanding neuronal circuit mechanisms underlying brain functions and behavior, and ultimately, for providing therapeutics to treat numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. Despite the rapid development of optogenetics tools over the past decade, tethered optical devices pose significant limitations in experimental animals and even more so in potential clinical applications. This proposed research will address fundamental challenges in tethered optogenetics systems, by developing a distributed, wireless (untethered and battery-less), implantable optical stimulator architecture that is more power efficient, significantly safer, and more practical for translation to clinical applications. The successful completion of the project will yield a new neural interface tool to significantly expand the utility of the rapidly growing field of optogenetics, which has become the frontier in brain science research, gene therapy, and new drug discovery for a variety of neural diseases. In addition, the project will train graduate students in multidisciplinary research and broaden K-12 education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) through integrated outreach activities, including the NSF sponsored Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Program at Michigan State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed wireless optogenetics stimulator will integrate a mm-sized, Parylene-coated system-on-a-chip (SoC) with an embedded receiver coil, surface-mount storage capacitors, and microscale light-emitting diodes (microLEDs) to selectively stimulate the target neural tissue. Researchers will tackle inefficiencies in wireless power delivery to the neural tissue using: 1) a four-coil telemetry link including an implantable high quality factor resonator to enhance wireless power coupling efficiency; 2) a built-in mirror to reflect backside illumination of microLED for improving light throughput; and 3) a switched-capacitor stimulation (SCS) structure of the SoC to directly charge an array of storage capacitors from the inductive link and periodically discharge them into a microLED without loading the inductive link. A single wireless stimulator enables localized optical stimulation of targeted neurons with high spatiotemporal resolution, while a cluster of such implants enables easy access to large-scale neuronal circuits with minimal invasiveness and movement restriction. The proposed device also enables a significantly safer and more practical solution for potential translation of optogenetics into behaving animal research and clinical applications. Removing the chronic physical trauma of tethering can effectively minimize tissue damage and enable efficient and stable chronic wireless optical stimulation. Moreover, the distributed, epidural implantation strategy permits selective stimulation of any desired area in the cortex. This new paradigm will offer neuroscience community an unprecedented level of flexibility with unlimited experiment duration in an enriched, untethered environment, without requiring small animal subjects to carry bulky batteries around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

While very promising, these approaches pose significant limitations in experimental animals and even more so in potential clinical applications. Therefore, the need for less invasive optogenetic manipulation of large neuronal volumes with millisecond temporal resolution remains to take optogenetics tools to the next level. To address this unmet need, our ultimate goal is to develop a distributed, scalable, non-penetrating array of small (1 mm<sup>2</sup>, &lt;0.001 cc), free-floating wireless implantable optogenetic stimulators for highly efficient optical modulation of large-scale cortical circuits with high spatiotemporal resolution and negligible footprint. For the pilot study of this NSF EAGER project, Li's team at Michigan Statt University has been focusing on design, implementation, and characterization of prototypes of the proposed wireless stimulator. In particular, her team has established an engineering approach to assemble microscale LEDs onto the backside of a silicon chip with the mm-size form factor. A four-channel, wire-tethered prototype was successfully implemented and tested <em>in vivo</em> using mouse models. In collaboration with Dr. Yaoyao Jia at North Carolina State University (NC State), the team also successfully designed and fabricated a miniaturized wireless stimulator that integrates 16-channel LEDs with CMOS system-on-chip circuitry and inductive telemetries on a flexible polyimide circuit board. <em>In vivo</em> experiments in the primary visual cortex of rats demonstrate that the integrated wireless stimulator can effectively evoke local field potentials when the cortical neurons were stimulated with light above the threshold intensity. Last but not least, the performance of different packaging materials and strategies were investigated to provide a complete understanding of the underlying factors that cause failures or complications of biomedical implant packages. Our preliminary results indicate that Parylene C is the most stable material among the three tested materials (Parylene C, SiO<sub>2</sub>, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) under the same reactive accelerated aging test conditions. Thicker Parylene films exhibit better reliability over time, as expected. Significant delamination and fragmentation occurred in SiO<sub>2</sub> and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> packages, mainly due to built-in mechanical stress from chemical vapor deposition. Delamination at the electrode-package interface is identified as the major failure mechanism, regardless of the integrity of the packaging films. New engineering techniques to further enhance the interface bonding strength is critical to improving the performance of thin-film packaging for biomedical devices.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/27/2020<br>      Modified by: Wen&nbsp;Li</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
