<AbstractNarration>This grant provides financial support for the workshop entitled "Uncertainty Quantification in Computational Modeling of Materials", to be held on January 17-18, 2019 at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. It is widely known that the performance of materials is strongly influenced by uncertainties associated with composition, constituent properties, and micro- or meso-structure. This is especially true as materials undergo large irreversible deformations, approaching failure through fracture or fatigue. Computational modeling of such behavior is further complicated by uncertainties in material models (e.g., uncertainty due to incomplete physics), and lack of data to quantify material micro- or meso-structure and property distributions. The computational cost of uncertainty analyses is an additional challenge. The aim of this 2-day thematic workshop is to bring together prominent scholars in solid and structural mechanics, materials science, and applied mathematics with a shared interest in uncertainty quantification and computational materials modeling to showcase the state-of-the-art, collectively identify existing and future challenges, and promote innovative ideas in the field.  Emphasis has been being placed on bringing together experts in seemingly disparate fields who face shared challenges related to uncertainty quantification and materials, but who otherwise have only limited opportunities to interact. Funding from this grant will support travel costs for 10 students/postdoctoral researchers to attend the workshop and present their work during a poster session as well as production of a report and a review journal article on the state of the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this two-day workshop, 29 invited leading experts in uncertainty quantification and materials modeling from across academia, government, and industry will present ongoing and future challenges related to uncertainty quantification facing the computational mechanics, applied mathematics, and materials science communities. The workshop will be comprised of 7, 2-hour sessions in a single technical track with each track having four presentations and a 20-minute discussion period. With each session covering a different topic, this unique format is intended to foster discussion around the most important technical challenges in each topic and avenues for their solution. The workshop will also feature a poster session where students/postdocs have the opportunity to share their work. The outcome of these presentations and discussions will be documented in a final report and a full-length review journal article discussing the themes of the workshop. These two documents will be widely disseminated to the research community and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
