<AbstractNarration>Cultivating Ensembles in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education and Research is a professional development conference that brings together people in STEM to learn from one another's practices in science communication, diversity and inclusion, outreach, creativity, and performance. Grown from efforts to develop creativity in computing, this biennial meeting integrates the arts and sciences to create compelling learning for students and engage people in developing an inclusive, inter- and trans-disciplinary STEM culture. The proposed initiative makes use of an established community to further the understanding and innovation that Arts and STEM integration can foster in broadening participation and workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Efforts to recruit volunteers for our Organizing Committee are ongoing. We are updating our website  www.cultivatingensembles.org and social media accounts with ongoing event and conference-related information. WHY do people attend?   Nurture inclusive and collaborative STEM/STEAM cultures Build relationships that redefine traditional boundaries Acknowledge and use the human lens to understand how we make, practice, and communicate science and research.   WHO attends and presents at the conference? Educators, researchers, performers, artists, students, activists, advocates and entrepreneurs from diverse areas   academia, the arts, community organizations, business, industry, and nonprofits are all welcome in Cultivating Ensembles. We come together to transform the human/cultural experience of professional and social identities in STEM/STEAM.  HOW we work to create diverse and inclusive events.
