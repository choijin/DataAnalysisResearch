<AbstractNarration>Gravitation Waves (GW) have recently been detected with LIGO/VIRGO and high energy neutrino events by  IceCube. The era of monitoring this emission in two  of the three (electromagnetic is the third) "windows"  is now open. The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN)  uses robotically operated telescopes at globally distributed observing sites to survey the visible sky on faster than a daily cadence and is ideal for discovering, identifying and monitoring  electromagnetic emission and in turn trigger observation across the electromagnetic spectrum. The coordination of monitoring these events in two or more "windows" will lead to identifying the objects and understanding the high energy physical processes giving rise to these events. The ASAS-SN program will continue to provide critical training for the next generation time-domain astronomers and postdocs by their participation in the research sponsored by this grant. A "Citizen Science" project will be undertaken to classify the 1,000,000 variable stars present in the ASAS-SN data.  An ASAS-AN inspired planetarium show will be developed initially for the OSU Planetarium and later, distributed to other planetaria.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This grant supports the operation of the ASAS-SN survey.  With robotically controlled telescopes distributed in both hemispheres it maps the visible sky on a daily basis, making it ideal for the study of variable optical phenomena such as Galactic novae, galactic transients, Supernovae, variable stars. The data is made available to the astronomical community and the public shortly after observation.  It has  already accumulated data over several years and will continue with its present operations.  With the detection of Gravitational Waves by LIGO/VIRGO and high energy neutrinos by IceCube, and followed by ASAS-SN's detecting, and localizing the electromagnetic counterpart and distributing its location to the astronomical community, ASAS-SN will make an invaluable contribution to obtaining the multiwavelength data needed to interpret the physical mechanisms giving rise to events in several "windows" and will lead to their understanding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big-Idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
