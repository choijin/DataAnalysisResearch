<AbstractNarration>Blue collar jobs are being replaced with "new-collar" jobs that use technology to solve multidisciplinary problems. Building on prior accomplishments supported by federal funding under the Department of Labor's Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training program, this project focuses the new-collar field of mechatronics, which combines mechanical, electronic, and computer technologies.  Mechatronics technicians work with 3D printers, electromechanical systems, robotic devices, and other technologies to contribute to sectors ranging from agriculture and advanced manufacturing to renewable energy and telecommunications.  The project will implement the Siemens Mechatronic Systems curriculum to develop a stackable, industry-recognized certification program and an Associate of Science degree. The Siemens curriculum uses a systems approach to mechatronics education that emphasizes how multiple technologies coexist and interact. This approach helps students learn how to troubleshoot, maintain, and operate an entire automated system, rather than just individual components.  As a result, students who complete the mechatronics certification and/or degree will be prepared for well-paying jobs in growing industries, thus contributing to the US skilled technical workforce and economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has four goals:  1) redevelop the curriculum to realign the current Advanced Manufacturing Mechatronics Certificate with the Siemens Mechatronics Level 1 Certification; 2) provide professional development and training for College faculty to earn Siemens Level 1 Mechatronics Instructor certification; 3) investigate the program enhancements needed to implement Siemens Level 2 certification at a later date; 4) raise interest in and awareness of an advanced manufacturing career involving mechatronics in the local area. The project will leverage the work of other NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) projects to build low cost mechatronics training kits and will disseminate the curriculum and materials it develops to the ATE community. As traditional manufacturing becomes more automated and dependent on computers, the need for technicians with advanced problem-solving skills is increasing. This project will contribute to educating this next generation of skilled technical workers.   This project is funded by the NSF ATE program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
