<AbstractNarration>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Norman B. Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism (LCAU) will host a Summer 2019 conference on Equitable Resilience. Equitable Resilience makes an important contribution to Sustainable Urban Systems by linking research on urban response to environmental stresses with research on the social distribution of those stresses and responses. Important examples include coastal city response to sea level rise, urban flooding beyond the 100-year floodplain, and planned relocation from hazardous areas. The conference aims to go beyond documenting linkages between resilience and equity, toward conceptual and analytical frameworks for re-designing those linkages. The workshops bring together scholars from urban design, urban planning, and building technology, along with urban environmental scientists. It has four panels: 1) Urban ecology, society, and resilient design; 2) Equitable access to urban information, technology, and resources 3) Equitable processes of urban relocation; and 4) Convergence between equitable resilience and sustainable urban systems. In each case, the workshops employ a network-of-networks approach for international knowledge dissemination and exchange, and makes that knowledge available through multiple scientific and educational platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2019 Summer conference will integrate research on urban resilience, equity and sustainability. The workshops employ an international network-of-networks methodology to engage scientists, planners, and designers associated with MIT labs and centers to wider research networks. The workshops consist of two substantive and two integrative panels.  The first integrative panel on urban ecology, social science, and design examines multiple levers for coordinating conceptual, analytical, and normative domains of equitable resilience through chains of modeled and non-modeled inquiry.  The first substantive panel assesses strategies for reducing widening gaps in social access to urban resilience data, technologies, and resources using statistical cluster analysis of participants? urban databases as well as innovative social media apps, mapping, and hacking methods. The second substantive panel addresses downstream impacts of environmental hazards by extending Nansen Principles on climate-amplified displacement to equitable strategies for voluntary resettlement from high hazard areas.  The final integrative panel revisits the workshops' hypotheses regarding the value of Equitable Resilience research, planning, and design for Sustainable Urban Systems. Each panel invites leading peer reviewers to critically assess the work presented and promising directions. The network-of-networks methodology helps ensure wider critical review and reception of the workshop process, outputs, and proposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Research on Equitable Resilience makes an important contribution to the study of Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS). MIT&rsquo;s Norman B. Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism (LCAU) hosted a workshop in June 2019 on four convergent and issue-oriented themes to integrate resilience and equity in metropolitan planning and design. A primary goal of this workshop was to go beyond acknowledging the linkages between resilience and equity, and develop conceptual and analytical design frameworks for strengthening those linkages.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual merit: </strong>This workshop explored the convergence among equity, resilience, and sustainability in metropolitan regions and networks by bringing together scholars from architecture, urban planning, urban design, building technology and related fields to examine principles and dynamics of these fields. The four workshop sessions analyzed gaps and linkages between: 1) urban ecology, society, and resilient design; 2) equitable processes of planned relocation; 3) equitable access to urban information, technology, and resources; and a summary panel on 4) convergence between equitable resilience and sustainable urban systems. The workshop employed a network-of-networks approach for knowledge exchange and dissemination. Summaries of the discussion and critical reflections on the substantive themes are posted at: <a href="http://lcau.mit.edu/conference/equitable-resilience-necessary-and-under-investigated-aspect-sustainable-urban-systems">http://lcau.mit.edu/conference/equitable-resilience-necessary-and-under-investigated-aspect-sustainable-urban-systems</a>.</p> <p>&nbsp;At the highest-level the workshop helped to identify new directions for research that are required in order to strengthen the framework for the convergence of equity, resilience and sustainability. These include: multi-hazard assessments, case-studies for successful adaptation planning, principles of justice for adaptation planning, and principles of scaling adaptation planning. These were identified as the most promising areas for convergence of ER and SUS research, and will be explored further through a new doctoral research assistantships and colloquia during the fall 2019 and spring 2020.</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts: </strong>The workshop provided a forum for knowledge sharing amongst faculty, student and researchers from different discipline groups and departments, as well as a forum to learn what colleagues are working on and to explore opportunities to collaborate. The goal is to continue building this community out further, and to enable collaborations whether through the sharing of resources, new knowledge/research, or future funding resources. Participants also identified and mapped out some next steps on how to strengthen the linkages between resilience and equity.</p> <p>The network of networks approach proved of interest to workshop participants, and workshop organizers were able to capture information for over half of the participants and their networks. This method will allow us to build an online resource, and create a digital map of connections, with the intention of seeding new opportunities for collaboration. During the fall 2019 the center will continue to build out a graphed database of parties and/or organizations, to allow connections and interactions across domains, and between people and communities working in this field. We will work to expand the fields and organizations represented in the network-of-networks mapping to facilitate interdisciplinary conversations that will push this field further.</p> <p>Participants expressed interest in building a collection of cases that exemplify equitable resilience and its principles. They spoke to the importance of comparative case study analysis, and creating a body of examples that accounted for the breadth of socio-cultural and regional contexts. Case-studies will focus special attention on community-led, bottom-up adaptation planning as these were deemed more successful than top-down, government led efforts by participants and co-chairs of the workshop. From case-studies, a set of principles and processes for adaptation planning will be developed in collaboration with the Resilient Cities Housing Initiative.</p> <p>Building out from the case-studies, we will continue to examine principles for scaling adaptation planning. Principles of scaling adaptation planning will look at what principles and best practices of adaptation can be shared between communities to ensure the maximum number of communities can plan and enact adaptation strategies in parallel.
