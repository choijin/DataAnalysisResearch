<AbstractNarration>This award supports work on the Organization of Tropical East Pacific Convection (OTREC) field campaign. The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign awards is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on "OTREC".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work supported under this award contributes to the campaign by adding a weather station in a region of interest.  The station provides continuous surface observations (winds, pressure, temperature, etc) as well as weather balloon launches to record vertical profiles of atmospheric conditions.  It is located at Nuqui (6N, 77W), on the west coast of Colombia.  The site is chosen for its proximity to the Choco' jet,  a low-level jet flowing northward over Choco' Province, which extends from the Serrania del Baudo', the western fork of the Andes in Colombia, to the Pacific coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The jet is of interest to OTREC because it extends significantly offshore and may contribute substantially to rainfall in the OTREC study area. It may also play a key role in the generation of easterly waves.  The PIs hypothesize that the diurnal cycle of heating and cooling over the western slopes of the Andes accounts for the diurnal cycle of offshore convection, despite differences in timing. They also argue that the Andean topography plays a role in organizing the rain-bearing mesoscale convective systems found over Choco' Province and the adjacent ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nuqui station will operate through August and September, with balloon launches four times per day when the OTREC aircraft is collecting data over the eastern Pacific (see OTREC award 1758513).  The station is also complementary to rainwater sampling under OTREC award 1759255, for which Nuqui is one of three collection sites.  The project is also a follow-on to ChocoJex, a Colombian-led field campaign focused specifically on the Choco' jet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of extreme precipitation and its relationship to low-level jets is desirable for societal as well as scientific reasons. Research under this award directly addresses these issues, with a particular focus on hazardous mesoscale convective systems.  The work also addresses easterly waves, which can spawn destructive hurricanes.  In addition, the award supports a partnership between US and Colombian scientists and thus promotes capacity building in the international research enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF RAPID project was funded to develop upper-air observations in Nuqui, Colombia as part of the Organization of Tropical East Pacific Convection (OTREC; August-September, 2019) field campaign program.  This site was established as a unique and systematic observational effort to fill surface and upper-air observational gaps over the far Eastern Tropical Pacific (EPAC) and western Colombia, and to support and complement the OTREC activities. The Nuqui site (Fig. 1) consisted in upper-air radiosondes launches spanning from 5th August to 25th September, 2019, with additional launches for the days of the 22 OTREC research flight missions. The main goal of the research flights was to observe the main characteristics of the storms with deep clouds that typically form in the region.  The aircraft platform helped to provide a three-dimensional structure of the atmosphere surrounding the storms, while a fix site like Nuqui, helped capture the vertical and temporal dynamics and thermodynamics evolution in the region.  The latest generation of satellite precipitation products show that these storms help create the rainiest spots on Earth over the far Eastern Pacific, which is located near Nuqui, just offshore the Colombian coast (Fig. 1).  This record-breaking rainfall hotspot sustains the Choco rainforest, regarded as one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world, and modulates the hydroclimate of Central America and NW South America.  Understanding the mechanisms that form these large organized storms is important because some of them can initiate tropical storms that can turn into hurricanes that can dangerously produce wind and flood damages impacting Central America and even Western Mexico and SW US.  The funded project gave rise to further advance our understanding of diverse phenomena involved in the region's hydrometeorology.  In our analysis of the OTREC data, we performed statistical composites by combining and contrasting wet and dry days.  Wet days were defined as those days with relatively more organization of convection and more precipitation, whereas dry days were those with less organized storms of suppressed precipitation.  Our results helped elucidate the following processes in relation to wet days:  (1) During wet days, we found that the low-level westerlies of the ChocoJet (0- 2000 m ASL) are stronger than during dry days (Fig. 2).  (2) Our results also show that wet days have stronger easterlies above the Andes mountains (2000 m ASL- and above), which increase the vertical wind shear, arguably a mechanism that help storms to become more organized and more intense.  (3) During the nighttime and early morning, a cooler mid-level (800 to 400 hPa or 2000-6000 m ASL) airmass emanates from the Andes and supports the maritime nighttime and early morning storm development (Fig. 3).  (4) Land breeze and ChocoJet help develop more intense offshore confluence, which supports the overall location of the record-breaking rainfall.  (5) We performed a three-dimensional analysis of an individual storm systems event observed during one of the OTREC research aircraft flights to help reinforce the above results (1-4).  (6) During the field campaign, we discovered that wet days have the tendency to occur every other day (like a  2-day wave). The robustness and significance of this feature is unknown an is illuminating new ideas for future research.  Both the composite analysis of Nuqui soundings and three-dimensional analyses using the research flight data provided an interesting set of mechanisms, not necessarily complete, that help understand the forces that trigger and modulate storms organization and duration.  Atmospheric models used for numerical weather predictions have limitations in the simulation of this precipitation maximum and overall intricate organization of the storms. The OTREC observations and their analysis are helping us to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that help create this precipitation hotspot, while providing valuable information to help constrain and evaluate the models, and even help in their development for better future predictions.
