<AbstractNarration>This project studies the impact of market reforms on household relations and women's work in agriculture. The project asks: how does economic change shape gendered institutions such as the household and related labor markets? A central problem is that a significant portion of agricultural work is not measured appropriately, and thus unrecorded in official statistics.  Four research questions guide this project: (a) how are official measures  of  women's  work constructed?  (b) what  is  the  impact  of economic  change in agriculture  at  the  local level  upon  one  measure  of women's  work?  (c) what  role  does  women's  unpaid  work play  in  the  explanation  of  the  links between economic  change in agriculture and paid  work? (d) how  does economic change  affect  intrahousehold power  relations  and gender norms?  This project examines the ways in which regulatory changes in agricultural policy affect women's work in agricultural production and marketing at interconnected levels of analysis: national, local, and household. At each level, the project seeks to show how women's paid and unpaid work is officially and unofficially defined in agricultural communities, and how this work is redefined under economic change. The findings from this project will contribute to a broader understanding of a) women's work--paid and unpaid activities undertaken within and beyond the household and b) how large-scale policy decisions translate into decisions made at the family and individual level. These findings will help generate recommendations on how households' and women's lives in agricultural areas may  be improved by change in formal policies including those focused on contract farming, deregulation of sales, and privatization of markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This  project will examine the  processes  by  which women's  work, particularly work in agricultural contexts, is  rendered visible  or invisible  in  the  market  economy.  The project will use a convergent mixed methods research framework to study the relationship between economic change and gendered institutions like the household and related labor markets. Within this framework, quantitative data from censuses and surveys and qualitative data from primary sources will be collected in the same phase of data production; both strands of data will then be analysed independently and merged at the stage of interpretation of results. To collect primary data, in-depth semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 60 women engaged in farm work and also associated with farmer producer companies, along with participant observation on farms and at agricultural markets around a larger urban area.  Findings from the project will inform sociological theories regarding gender in agricultural work, economic change, and household gender relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award helped the co-PI complete dissertation data collection. It enabled an interdisciplinary project that uses a convergent parallel mixed methods research framework to study the relationship between between state-driven liberalization reforms and gendered institutions such as the household and labor markets. The award was used to collect quantitative (secondary) and qualitative (primary) data in the same phase of data collection, analyze both strands of data independently and merge them at the stage of interpretation of results. Implementation of this mixed methods research framework is a major outcome of this award. It allowed the co-PI to adopt a research design approach best suited for addressing research aims; to understand the complexities, diversity and limitations in the articulation and measurement of women’s work.  The specific outcomes are as follows:  1.     Field study and travel: The award enabled the co-PI to make extensive field visits to work with members of 5 women-centric farmer organizations that have emerged in the wake of state-driven liberalization reforms, as well as other with representatives from the government and related organizations. In addition, it also allowed the co-PI to attend approximately 10 events including agricultural meetings, fairs and workshops and to visit 7 farmers’ markets for participant observation.  2.     Data collection: The award enabled the co-PI to collect quantitative data (from secondary sources) and qualitative data (from primary sources). Quantitative data sources include from national employment surveys, census data, regional language newspaper archives and academic journals from library archives. At the regional language newspaper and library archives, the co-PI collected articles on the history of agricultural market reforms from 1960-2005 as well as on the also on the history of measurement of women’s work.

Additionally, the award also permitted the timely transcription of interview data. Thus, the award enabled collation of information from disparate sources and bring together a unique collection of data in order to triangulate different theories of women’s work.  3.     Key findings: Some of the important findings and observations include  a.     Drawing on case studies of 5 women-centric farmer organizations that facilitate sales of agricultural produce, it was found that the burdens of climate change are being borne disproportionately by women in the context of small farms (less than 2.5 acres) and marginal farms (less than 5 acres) in dry and semi-arid regions. In this context, different organizational and individual narratives and strategies have emerged to cope with these conditions, for example, in terms of crop choices and diversification of livelihoods, both of which also have implications for gender division of labor.  b.     Institutional arrangements that have led to the emergence of women-centric farm organizations includes an ecosystem of interactions between well-established NGOs, state agricultural departments, foreign funders and women’s savings and credit groups. The 5 organizations can be viewed as extensions of savings and credit groups where group members have been encouraged to come together as shareholders and sell their produce to the organization. These arrangements also seem to have implications for the long-term sustainability of the companies, as well as decision-making in agricultural households.
