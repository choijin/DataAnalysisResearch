<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation-Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project includes ensuring the safety, security and efficiency of our nation's energy infrastructure by providing self-powered pipeline sensing and monitoring systems. This project will produce a novel approach to provide a reliable power source to enable continuous monitoring of pressurized steam distribution system in energy plants, with an estimated market potential of ~ $2.4 Billion. The technology has a high potential for later commercialization in other energy distribution systems, such as the oil and gas industry. The project will provide training and mentoring on innovation and technology translation to undergraduate, graduate students through a multi-faceted educational plan, including new curriculum development. The educational contributions of this effort include (1) provide students first-hand knowledge of how to translate fundamental scientific research into technology and product development; (2) enhance interdisciplinary education and research programs; (3) broaden the participation and success of underrepresented groups in innovation education through the PIs' ongoing collaborations with existing programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is to develop a self-powered sensing and monitoring system to enable continuous monitoring of pipeline operation for our nation's energy infrastructures. Most of these critical infrastructures are located in the areas with difficult access. This presents a significant challenge when using battery powered sensors or monitoring devices for continuous monitoring of pipelines. To solve this problem, a novel conformal thermoelectric generator is proposed in this program to harvest wasted heat in the pipeline for sensor powering. Three technical innovations will be used in this project at materials, devices, and system levels. 1) At the materials level nanostructured oxides will be used to replace conventional telluride-based materials which are toxic, expensive, and low temperature stability. 2) At the device level, a continuous production of thermoelectric devices will be used to reduce the cost of device fabrication and packaging at large-scale. 3) At the system level, new technology for thermoelectric voltage booster and energy storage devices will be used for integration of thermoelectric generator with sensors and monitoring devices. A multi-disciplinary research team will work with two industry partners on technology development to ensure the solutions are practical to the challenges that industry specific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
