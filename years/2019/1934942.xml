<AbstractNarration>The goal of this workshop is to advance thinking about social changes occurring at the human-technology frontier. Specifically, the workshop begins with transitions into adulthood when youth begin to establish themselves into the labor force and take on adult roles. The first day of the workshop will ask how developmental processes hinder or enhance the capacity of emerging adults to be accurate consumers of data. The second day will explore how contextual effects (e.g. rural locale, cultural inequalities, educational access, and generational disconnects) hinder or enhance broad exposure to social and technological skills. The third day explores institutional factors: technology, new media, and organizational learning. The workshop will invite industry partners and representatives to participate in discussions about ways to avoid brain drain in rural communities where youth are concentrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will address four technology and skills gaps: 1) data literacy among emerging adults (the capacity to be accurate consumers of knowledge created by data analytics; 2) workforce preparation (contextual factors that may affect exposure to updated social and technology skills); 3) high-tech communications (access to accurate and trusted knowledge to inform decisions); and 4) exposure of rural emerging adults to knowledge capital that sustains equitable solutions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Within the last decade, a number of important technological advancements have intensified the rate of social change. Notable technological advancements have personalized, digitized, and micro-sized communication in ways that have exacerbated existing technology and skills gaps.

Gaps in data literacy arise from technological advances in data analytics outpacing human skills in understanding data that are produced and harnessed by new technologies. In recent years, the rise of big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics have affected many aspects of society. Previous attempts to draw on large-scale datasets for social research, policymaking, and organizational operations were limited by availability and computing power, making analysis costly and time-consuming.

Data analytics impact the way organizations and institutions operate, illuminating the need for new or different skills in navigating how best to rely on data and machine learning in making organizational decisions. For all the ways that data analytics has positively altered human life, data analytics has also replicated existing systems of social inequality, imbued computer algorithms with human biases, and expanded the scope of errors from misinterpretation and misunderstanding.

Data literacy differs from simpler skills, such as math or numerical literacy, in requiring the ability to interpret and apply data.
