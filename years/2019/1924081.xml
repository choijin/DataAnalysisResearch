<AbstractNarration>This is a grant in partial support of the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS).  The aim of GRC-CCUS and GRS-CCUS is to create a forum for discussing the latest scientific and technological efforts at the forefront of carbon management encompassing the development of novel materials, integrated reaction and transport pathways in natural and engineered environments, and the implications of these developments for CCUS deployment at the process and field scales. The emerging role of negative emissions technologies such as Direct Air Capture and Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage in the context of carbon management will be discussed. In this context, system-level assessments of the role and potential of CCUS systems in decarbonizing electricity, transportation, and heating networks is an integral aspect of this meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organization of the GRC Power Hour and the poster sessions dedicated for scientific presentations by early career researchers, postdoctoral research scientists and graduate students are intended to foster engagement and the development of a future pipeline of talent capable of handling emerging challenges in the area of CCUS. The interdisciplinary nature and the openness of GRC/GRS format in terms of sharing unpublished data will ensure the broader impacts of this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Operational Summary   The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage was held at Les Diablerets, Switzerland. The meeting covered a variety of scientific topics and the content presented was highly rated by participants.  Gordon Research Conference (GRC) Participants    The Conference was well-attended with 185 participants. Scientists from academia represented 64% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 7% and those from industry totaled 11%. The meeting also attracted a strong mix of young investigators and senior scientists. Students and post-docs accounted for 39% of all attendees. Approximately 30% of the participants at the 2019 meeting were women.  Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) Participants    The Seminar was well-attended with 68 participants. Scientists from academia represented 77% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 4%. Students and post docs combined accounted for 76% of all attendees. Approximately 44% of the participants at the 2019 seminar were women.  Conference Program   Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage systems play a central role in political debates, technological efforts and scientific developments around climate change, as a consequence of two factors. First, with the Paris Agreement, countries have agreed to hold global mean warming well below 2&deg;C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5&deg;C. Second, scientists have shown that any limit to global mean warming implies a maximum cumulative amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the so called carbon budget. Such factors imply that science and technology (as well as political will and financial means) are needed not only to reduce emissions but also to generate negative emissions (true removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide), in case of carbon budget overshoot.   Are we - scientists and engineers - ready to deliver CCUS for large scale deployment? What are the challenges and hurdles towards implementation? What are the technical solutions and scientific breakthroughs emerged or about to emerge? We discussed these questions and many more in an interdisciplinary framework at the 2019 Gordon Research Conference on CCUS (the third of a series), where participants junior and senior were stimulated by the highly interactive atmosphere typical of the GRCs and inspired by the natural landscape surrounding the conference venue, for the first time in Europe.   Among the specific areas addressed by the conference there were the scientific breakthroughs in CCUS, the role of CCUS in enabling negative emissions, the systemic aspects of CCUS, and its role in selected industrial sectors.  Conference Budget  Support from NSF was used to facilitate the attendance of 24 U.S based researchers including graduate research assistants, postdoctoral research associates and faculty members to attend GRC and 21 U.S based researchers to attend GRS.   Conference Feedback   Participants had an opportunity to provide feedback at the end of the Conference. The feedback collected from the meeting was extremely positive. Evaluations included numerous positive remarks regarding poster sessions and questions, discussions between participants and networking. Evaluations from the GRS included positive comments regarding the poster sessions, presentations and the exchange of ideas.   GRC would like to thank the National Science Foundation for its continued support of the meetings. The contributions received have been critical to the success of the conferences and are having a measurable impact in advancing the frontiers of science worldwide.
