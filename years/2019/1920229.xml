<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemical Instrumentation Programs. Professor Jeffrey Rack from the University of New Mexico and colleagues Martin Kirk and Yang Qin are acquiring an ultra high-pressure, quadrupole, time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-QTof-MS). In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into ions and the ions' masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the structure of molecules in complex mixtures to be studied. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph can separate mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. Using the time-of-flight method of mass spectrometry, the mass-to-charge ratio of an ion is determined by the way of a time measurement in which ions are accelerated by an electric field of known strength. This acceleration results in an ion having the same kinetic energy as any other ion that has the same charge. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse groups of students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique and supports many users and underrepresented students. It also provides training opportunities to undergraduate students, many of whom are first-generation students. The instrument gives students experience using vital instrumentation that they carry with them into their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of this mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially useful for developing photoactive compounds and materials and for designing support magnetic materials for molecular electronics. The instrument is also employed in evaluating polychalcogenylene vinylene conjugated polymers for flexible optoelectronic applications and for developing platforms for screening libraries of bioactive species. The mass spectrometer is also utilized for the characterization of generic architectures that may be related to the Niemann-Pick C1 metabolic pathway associated with liver and spleen disorders and for deciphering the conformational control of nitric oxide synthases as well as labeling potential drugs with stable isotopes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
