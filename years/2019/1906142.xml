<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves the advancement of novel imaging modalities and improved surgical decision making allowing for earlier surgical intervention. This technology will advance science and medicine by providing a novel diagnostic tool to create a virtual biopsy. This eliminates the need to physically cut and remove tissue for assessment and imaging. This technology is particularly important in assessing tissues that cannot be removed without damage, such as neurologic tissue. By utilizing this technology, surgeons will have more information about a particular tissue or injury, allowing for improved early surgical decision making, potentially improved patient outcomes and decreased medical costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is intended to continue the development of a surgical laser microscope to image tissue intra-operatively.  Peripheral nerve injuries are complex pathologies that leave some mystery as to their prognosis at the time of injury. Often times, this leads to a clinical observation period of up to a year during which the nerve is non-functional. The ability to visualize, quantify and assess the prognosis of these injuries a priori would allow for earlier intervention and thus improved clinical outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Peripheral nerve injuries are devastating events causing loss of function, pain, decreased productivity and significant health care costs. The current treatment paradigm requires 10-12 months of observation due to the current lack of diagnostic tools capable of assessing nerve damage and predict recovery. An innovative imaging tool capable of assessing nerve injury could eliminate this 10-12 month delay. Through this proposal we sought to understand a commercialization pathway for a novel method to acutely assess neurologic injury. This product has the broad potential to change or eliminate the current observation period leading to improved patient outcomes, decreased loss of productivity and decreased discomfort. To accomplish this goal, over 100 potential customers, leading nerve injury specialists, health care administrators and others in the imaging space were interviewed. The results of the interviews were the primary motivating factors (pain points) experienced by our target customer. Furthermore, this allowed for insight into what aspects of early product development would be necessary to develop a minimal viable product. Finally, these discussion provided clarity into the hurdles that may occur both in product development and in products acceptance and purchase by clinical institutions. Overall, the project was successful in understanding the primary functions the early version of this product must accomplish and in providing a framework for moving forward towards product development and clinical utilization.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/05/2020<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;J&nbsp;Cagle</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
