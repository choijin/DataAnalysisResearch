<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project will acquire and deploy a heterogenous high performance computing (HPC) system. The instrument enables the dramatic expansion of a HPC capabilities in the state of Missouri. Located on the campus of the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, the center connects several partner institutions, and thus will have a transformative and broad regional impact on research and training activities across the state of Missouri. Partners include the full four-campus University of Missouri (UM) System, and other institutions including Missouri State University, Southeast Missouri State University, historically black Lincoln University, College of the Ozarks, and others. The facility will enable over a dozen research groups to advance state-of-the-art science in a variety of science areas. The project will also promote collaboration, training and educational activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investment provides new computational infrastructure (with a peak performance of more than 400 TFlops) necessary to advance science in several core areas relating to the study and design of advanced materials, spanning many length scales and ranging from fundamental to applied. Projects in the fields of Physics and Chemistry depend heavily on computation to understand and predict the quantum dynamics of systems of particles leading to the interpretation and prediction of the existence and behavior of exotic states of matter. Computational modeling in Mathematics and Statistics includes studying and optimizing charged plasma propulsion in space; it also extends into Biological investigations of DNA methylation which increases our understanding of a variety of diseases in plants (food sources) and humans (including cancer). Another area that will see immediate benefit is that of computation and data-driven Geophysics which involves the development of tools that are essential for the well-being of human society, including predicting and mitigating natural hazards such as earthquakes and volcanoes, as well as exploration and development of petroleum and other natural resources. Other projects include computational hypersonic fluid dynamics contributing to the design and optimization of high-speed aircraft and space vehicles. In addition to enabling and greatly enhancing a number of specific research projects, each of which benefits broad communities and society in general, a significant part of the broader impact of this project comes from the areas of training and education and increasing participation of communities underrepresented in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
