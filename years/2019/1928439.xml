<AbstractNarration>Particle physics is focused on understanding the most basic building blocks of the Universe and the rules that bind them. The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located near Geneva, Switzerland is the world's most powerful particle accelerator, able to reach the highest particle energies in a laboratory setting, and a platform for precision studies of the Electroweak interaction.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Standard Model of particle physics can be challenged using precise measurements of electroweak probes based on the large LHC data samples. This requires a higher level of accuracy and confidence on the inputs used in the analyses and in the interpretation of the results in addition to more advanced analysis techniques. This project provides support for a workshop at the Colegio de Fisica Fundamental e Interdisciplinaria de las Americas (COFI) in San Juan, Puerto Rico that will focus on bringing together particle experimentalists and particle theorists to address the challenges of precision electroweak physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using the current 13 TeV data sample.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current challenges include reducing uncertainties on the theoretical corrections (both electroweak and Quantum Chromo-dynamics) and the inputs needed to describe proton-proton collisions (parton distribution functions), and subtleties in combining and fitting the electroweak data. These issues must be understood for many of the crucial measurements, like the W and Higgs bosons and top quark masses, the weak mixing angle, di-boson scattering, and rare or forbidden decays of bosons. The workshop will bring relevant experts together to improve our understanding and perform the best possible precision electroweak measurements. A focus will be on the interplay between the various theoretical inputs needed to find deviations, if any, to the expected electroweak observables and the opportunities to exploit measurements to calibrate theoretical predictions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discussions between theorists and experimentalists in a workshop setting will lead to an improved understanding, which in turn will lead to more precise electroweak measurements, potentially expanding the reach of the LHC during the next run. This project also aims to support the local scientific community in Puerto Rico and establish significant under-represented group participation.  Another important goal is to foster the connections between Puerto Rican researchers abroad and the local community. Several postdocs and graduate students residing abroad will be participating in the workshop. COFI is a member of the UNITWIN/UNESCO Chairs Program, which involves 700 institutions in 116 countries to promote cooperation and networking to enhance institutional capacities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
