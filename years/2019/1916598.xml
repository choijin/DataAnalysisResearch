<AbstractNarration>Some of the most interesting and oldest unanswered problems in number theory ask how often prime numbers appear as the outputs of a polynomial.  Another intriguing set of questions surrounds the Riemann zeta function and similar functions, called L-functions.  These two areas are connected in analytic number theory through a formula of N.V. Kuznetsov.  This research project centers on generalizing and modifying the formula of Kuznetsov to investigate polynomials of degree higher than two and more complex L-functions.  The project is expected to develop powerful new analytic tools that will advance future research in number theory.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Exponential sums may arise in additive number theory problems that are not attached to subgroups of SL(2,Z).  The goal of this research is to address L-functions and moduli sums of exponential sums on higher rank groups via generalizations and modifications of the Kuznetsov formulae on SL(n,Z).  There appears to be a direct connection between hyper-Kloosterman sums on SL(3,Z) and the study of SL(3,Z) automorphic forms with non-trivial K-types, by a modification of the SL(3) Kuznetsov formula, so one immediate goal is to study such forms.  Studying the exponential sums and generalized Bessel functions occuring in the SL(3) Kuznetsov formula has led to significant advances in understanding the L-functions attached to SL(3,Z) Maass forms, so this research aims to continue this study in the level direction and on SL(n,Z) for n higher than three.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to construct the remaining Kuznetsov formulas for GL(3), to study the GL(3) hyper-Kloosterman sums, and to generalize the formulas and their applications to GL(n) and other groups.  All of the GL(3) Kuznetsov formulas were successfully obtained and some early applications were given.  Work on the GL(3) hyper-Kloosterman sums and extending the formulas to GL(n) and other groups remains ongoing.   Work supported by this grant produced eight journal articles and one book chapter.  The PI spoke at fifteen conferences/seminars and attended four more conferences as a participant both inside the United States and internationally.  The Kuznetsov formulas on GL(2) have been used extensively since their publication in 1980 and the formulas developed by this project should enjoy a similar, if more modest, usage as analytic number theorists attempt to generalize and expand results from GL(2) into higher rank.  Already, there are papers on the arXiv giving applications of the GL(3) Kuznetsov formulas by other researchers.  The work started in this project on generalizations of the Kuznetsov formulas to other groups will likely form a fundamental part of the PI?s research program throughout his career.  Similarly, the development of the GL(3) arithmetic Kuznetsov formula provides a basis for understanding the integral transforms related to the hyper-Kloosterman sum problem, and this will lead to much further study and, hopefully, an eventual resolution to that problem.
