<AbstractNarration>Information and decision systems are an essential part of many present-day systems in a vast array of domains, from engineering and operations to the social sciences and the life sciences. For example, communications and information technology is ever-present in many daily activities, while autonomous systems are also becoming ubiquitous. This two-day workshop will lay out the foundations for future research in the underlying information and decision sciences and will help identify critical open problems to be addressed by the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the spectacular recent advances in data science and machine intelligence are all about systems that process information, and then make inferences and decisions. Research in information and decision sciences provides much of the methodological core that underlies such developments, illustrating that despite tremendous changes in the technological landscape, many of the fundamental ideas and tools are timeless. This workshop will examine the past, present, and future of the field of Information and Decision Sciences, with focus on the following themes: Systems, Optimization, and Control; Communications, Information Theory, and Networks; Data, Inference, and Machine Learning; and Transitions from theory into practice or between fields. This intellectually significant event will act as a catalyst for opening new research directions along these themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    For 80 years, the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) at MIT has led the world in conducting groundbreaking research in the Science of Information and Decision Systems. On the occasion of the labâ€™s 80th anniversary, a workshop "LIDS@80: A Celebration" was held (November 1-2, 2019), to examine the past, present, and future of this field.     We welcomed over 400 people from around the world, bringing together LIDS alumni and students, members of the MIT community, friends of the lab from academia, government, and industry, and many others working in the field.      The workshop consisted of four half-day sessions, focused on the following themes: 1) Systems, Optimization, and Control 2) Communications, Information Theory, and Networks 3) From Data to Inference and Machine Learning 4) Transitions.     The key conclusion of the event was that many of the spectacular recent advances in data science and machine intelligence involve systems that process information, and then make inferences and decisions. Research in the information and decision sciences provides much of the methodological core that underlies such developments, illustrating that despite tremendous changes in the technological landscape, many of the fundamental ideas and tools are timeless, and have much to offer in exciting emerging directions in the field, e.g., in autonomy, networked systems, machine learning, among others.
