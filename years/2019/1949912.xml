<AbstractNarration>The Advanced Computational Research Experiences at Michigan State University offers undergraduate students from a wide variety of backgrounds the opportunity to conduct cutting-edge research in computational and data science.  In addition to research, students participate in a variety of technical training activities.  Such activities include Python programming, data analysis and visualization, supercomputing, and scientific software development. The program also provides a variety of professional development activities, targeting presentation skills, technical writing, and discussions relating to graduate school and a wide range of career opportunities.  This ten-week summer program trains students in computational and data science, gives them the freedom to explore a range of subject areas and career paths, and provides research opportunities to students from under-represented groups in STEM and from non-research-intensive colleges and universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced Computational Research Experiences Research Experience for Undergraduates (ACRES REU) at Michigan State University (MSU) offers students the opportunity to conduct cutting-edge research in computational and data science under the supervision of faculty who are recognized experts in their disciplines.  This 10-week summer residential program includes MSU faculty from a wide variety of STEM fields whose research focuses on algorithms pertaining to, and applications of, computational modeling and data science.  In addition, peer- and near-peer mentoring, professional development, and technical training are key components of the program.  One of the strengths of this REU site lies in the rich interdisciplinary collaborative research environment fostered between student teams consisting of pairs of REU students, their mentors who have expertise in conducting research in computational science, data science, and high-performance computing, and technical trainers.  These elements combine to empower undergraduates to conduct meaningful original research focused on the development and enhancement of algorithms for computational modeling and data science, as well as the application of these algorithms to cutting-edge applications in a wide range of STEM fields.  In addition, this project will broaden the participation of underrepresented populations in STEM research.  Furthermore, it will provide early exposure to high performance computing to students from institutions with limited access to HPC resources, especially women and other underrepresented groups, and will motivate students to pursue careers in computational fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
