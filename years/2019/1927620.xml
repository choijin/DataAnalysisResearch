<AbstractNarration>This award is to support a workshop convened by the National Academy of Sciences to discuss goals, strategies, and technical needs to facilitate research in functional genomics that will contribute to the advancement of basic knowledge and its translation into applications that would benefit society, e.g., conservation, evolutionary studies, agriculture, energy, defense, human health, and other sectors. The workshop draws on information and ideas from experts in this field and others. Workshop participants represent, primarily, the biological sciences, with additional input from genomically-relevant environmental sciences, bioinformatics and data science, and other pertinent communities. The workshop will delineate the current state of the science, what lessons have been learned thus far, what impediments there are to further progress, and areas where additional investments could help move the field forward. The workshop presentations and discussions will be documented in a proceedings report authored by rapporteur(s) in accordance with National Academies guidelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the release of the first draft of the human genome in 2001, the genomes of hundreds of organisms from all branches of the tree of life have been sequenced. The availability of these gene sequences, as well as a variety of new technologies, provide the ability to study genes, transcripts, proteins, and their interactions on a genome-wide level. Although this genomic information is of great value, there has been no broad systematic effort to understand the function of genes in the many sequences that have been generated as yet. Thus, the value of the gene sequences for application to basic science, conservation, evolutionary studies, agriculture, energy, defense, human health, and other sectors has not yet been realized. This project represents a step in the direction of establishing new approaches to understanding gene function. The workshop will foster a high-level discussion to identify new ideas on what additional research NSF can support to tackle the scientific unknowns of functional genomics and develop the needed tools and infrastructure to better connect gene discovery to an understanding of gene function. What are the challenges and opportunities and what are the next steps to advance the science? Could the ability to predict phenotypes from genotypes find common ground around a set of principles that characterize biological systems? These are among the most significant questions for the future of the life sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
