<AbstractNarration>This grant provides financial support for the 55th meeting of the Society for Natural Philosophy: Microstructure, Defects, and Growth in Mechanics to be held September 13-15, 2019, at Loyola University, Chicago. The ability to understand and model complex synthetic and biological materials has become an increasingly important topic of research. The understanding of the interrelated roles of microstructure, defects, and growth that are the focus of this workshop is central to a deeper understanding and development of these materials. This event will bring together researchers of international and national stature as well as recent PhDs and graduate students to present and discuss the latest advances. The meeting will differ from other similar events in that it will be without parallel sessions. This emphasis on a smaller, single-track meeting will be conducive to a more focused program and will also promote collaborations between engineers, mathematicians, and physicists for the creation and development of new mathematical methods and physical concepts. Funding for this workshop will go towards supporting speakers as well as 15 young researchers to attend and interact with leading researchers in the fields of mechanics and mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-day workshop will involve a total of 17 lectures. Eight of these will be one-hour lectures given by prominent leading researchers from the fields of mechanics and mathematical sciences. Another eight 30-minute roundtable discussion lectures will be given by a mix of leading researchers and promising young researchers, postdocs, and PhD students. About half of the roundtable lectures will be by invitation and the rest chosen from submitted abstracts. Finally, a "Clifford Ambrose Truesdell III Lecture" will be delivered by a senior researcher in honor of the founder of the Society. A one-hour open discussion on the future directions of research related to the subject of the meeting will also be conducted. Out of this discussion, a report of the proceedings will be generated that will include: (i) the identified challenges, (ii) the potential areas of research, and (iii) viable solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
