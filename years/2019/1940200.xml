<AbstractNarration>This award is to support the Workshop on Exuberance of Machine Learning in Transport Phenomena to be held on February 10-11, 2020 in Dallas, Texas. The workshop focuses on highlighting the current state-of-the-art and future directions on the application of Machine Learning on transport phenomena research. With the growth of Machine Learning in all areas of science and engineering, we have observed a rapid growth in the number of workshops, conferences, and summer schools all over the world. This workshop is unique in which it brings together national experts from all areas of transport phenomena research to exchange ideas, and to establish a better understanding on limitations and potentials of Machine Learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop program includes invited speakers who will offer their expert views of important directions in Machine Learning, transport phenomena, and their intersection. It will also involve panel discussions on related topics, exploring novel ways to advance the field, and to identify gaps across the curriculum for effective training and education of the future generation of scientists and engineers capable of tackling important problems at the intersection of these two subjects. A Final Report will be prepared at the end of the workshop which will include a summary of the workshop and the major recommendations made by the experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:The  objective  of  this  project  was  to  organize  a  workshop  to  assess  the  significance  andthe  potential  future  impacts  of  machine  learning  (ML)  in  transport  phenomena  (TPh).Distinguished scholars with expertise in both machine learning and transport phenomena,as well as in one of these fields were invited to discuss their recent results and elaborate onfuture trends and opportunities.  A two-day workshop was organized (www.mltp2020.com)with participation of over 150 researchers from various universities, research laboratories,government and industry.  A total of 11 Invited Lectures, and 32 Posters were presented.At the end of each day, there was a panel discussion to concentrate on challenges, questions,vision and to brainstorm about the potentials and future opportunities in machine learningin transport phenomena and to provide recommendation for National Science Foundationsfor announcement of future opportunities .  Intellectual Merits:The  outcomes  of  this  project  are  identification  of  the  paths  to  be  taken  in  future  cou-plings of ML and TPh for scientific discoveries, computational modeling and simulations.Traditionally,  physical  modeling  has  been  the  used  for  modeling  transport  phenomena,however, with the rise of novel deep learning and artificial intelligence, opportunities have been emerged to build more powerful models.  With the brainstorm among the mixture oftransport phenomena and ML experts, we have come up with the list of intellectual chal-lenges and how ML can potentially overcome those.  Transport Phenomena experts talked about unsolved challenges and problems in the field and ML experts gave some possiblesolutions  arose  from  recent  advances  in  ML.  The  PIs  believe  this  workshop  has  set  the stage to create new intellectual paradigms in transport phenomena through its intersectionwith ML. They also believe that this workshop will spark multiple collaborations acrossdifferent institutions in the country.  Broader Impacts:In recent years, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged in many areas of computer science which revolutionized fields such as vision,  autonomous systems andnatural  language  processing.   The  rise  of  deep  learning  and  automatic  feature  detectionthrough convolutional neural networks (CNN) has enabled engineers and scientists to perform complex classification and regression tasks that were not possible before.  The wave of change is steadily propagating into engineering &amp; applied mathematics, giving rise to novel breakthroughs at the interface of ML and classical physics based scientific methods&amp; algorithms.  In fact, this new viewpoint has been recognized as the fourth paradigm ofscientific  discovery and  offers  an  elegant  path  to  building  more  robust,  generalizable and powerful predictive models.  However,  this wave of change is very slow in transport phenomena compared to other computer science areas.  The workshop aimed to speed up the  integration  of  ML  into  TPh  to  open  up  new  avenues  of  research  in  this  area.   This aim was achieved through active participation of researchers and experts of both TPh andML in this workshop.  Students,  researchers,  and interested faculties participated in theworkshop to become familiar with the questions and advances at the intersection of MLand transport phenomena.
