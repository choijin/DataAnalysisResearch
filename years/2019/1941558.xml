<AbstractNarration>When they occur, major California earthquakes result in billions of dollars damage. Greater awareness of earthquake risk follows each event, and also accompanies scientific efforts to further understand seismic processes. This RAPID is motivated by the need to quickly deploy instruments on active faults near the July 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes to determine how the earthquake have stressed nearby active faults. The plan is to install six extensometers and to quantify the potential for present and future slip on nearby faults. Data will be acquired once per minute and stored for public access at UNAVCO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This works is motivated by the need to urgently deploy extensometers on active faults near the meizzocenter of the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence to determine whether, and how, stress changes in the earthquake have stressed nearby active faults. Stress changes tend to set up a logarithmically decaying creep rate on nearby faults following triggered slip that can be measured using sensitive extensometers. The seismic sequence itself was a cascade of conjugate ruptures with progressively greater magnitude followed by thousands of smaller aftershocks as a nearby lattice of conjugate faults relaxed epicentral strain. The dynamic stresses from the earthquakes had extreme reach, causing slip to be triggered on faults as far south as the Mexican border. The deployment of 6 new extensometers supplement and existing one  deployed across the surface rupture two days after rupture. The extensometers record slip with an accuracy of 2 micrometer over a range of 2-4 meters and sample once per minute for a year. The extensometers will record slip data for a year, which will allow for calculating rate changes and to search for episodic slip that can be used to determine rheological conditions in the fault zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two major earthquakes occurred near Ridgecrest California on 4 and 6 July 2019.  Seismologists were apprehensive that these earthquakes might lead to a nearby yet larger earthquake on the nearby Garlock fault.  With this possibility in mind, sevenf sensitive instruments were placed across surface faults near Ridgecrest.  The instruments revealed that slip was not occurring on these faults, thereby, reassuring local residents that a future earthquake was unlikely.  No nearby damaging earthquake has occurred in the year following the Ridgecrest earthquakes.  The initial apprehension was in part highighted by the observation of a fraction of an inch of silent slip of the Southernmost San Andreas fault, more than 200 miles from the earthquakes.  A rigorous study of the timing of this distant triggered slip showed it to have started at the time of passage of surface waves from the earthquakes.  This remotely triggered slip triggered subsequent additional slip of lesser amounts in the next few months on the southern San Andreas fault, which may have been responsible for a subsequent mircoearthquake swarm beneath the Salton Sea. The observation lends credence to the possibility that some large earthquakes are responsible for triggering distant earthquakes occurring many months later.  A graduate student was closely involved in the installation, analysis and interpretation of data from the instruments used in the project.
