<AbstractNarration>The Seminar on Stochastic Processes 2020 will be held at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, on 5-7 March 2020. These seminars have been held annually since 1981. They have become a crucially important regular conference series for probabilists in North America, bringing together a diverse group of accomplished researchers, early-career investigators, and graduate students in probability and stochastic processes.  The primary goal of SSP 2020 is to provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent significant progress in research, and to enable participants to discuss their work with others. The five scholars who will be the main speakers at SSP 2020 were chosen for their prominence as researchers in stochastic processes, and for the breadth of their research areas as a group, to maximize the participants' exposure.  SSP 2020 will include additional activities intended especially for new researchers and they will take the form of two 90-minute tutorial lectures delivered by a speaker selected by the Probability Subcommittee of the IMS New Researchers Committee and a panel discussion on topics of particular interest to early-career researchers. This conference will be an extraordinary opportunity for students and early-career researchers to learn the latest developments in probability and related topics, and to interact with leading researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and other under-represented or marginalized groups, as well as to early-career faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.  The topics covered in this edition of SSP will include Brownian motion and Levy processes, stochastic analysis, stochastic partial differential equations, random matrix theory, fractional Brownian motion and rough path theory, random media, and application to fluid mechanics, statistical physics, climate science, and mathematical biology. More information will be curated and kept at the conference webpage: https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/events/ssp2020/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

There were 98 registered participants in SSP 2020 and 64 of them received financial support from this grant from the National Science Foundation. Among the 64 participants who received financial support, 21 (about 33%) were female or from under-represented group. There were 39 graduate students, 11 post-docs, and 8 early career faculty members. The other 6 people were the lecturer for the tutorial and the 5 main speakers.  On March 4, 2020, Professor Ren&eacute; Carmona (Princeton University) gave two tutorial lectures (3 hours) on "The Probabilistic Approach to Mean Field Games".  On March 5&ndash;7, 2020, there were five invited one-hour talks:   Professor Martin Barlow (University of British Columbia, Canada) gave Kai Lai Chung Lecture: "Quenched and Annealed Heat Kernels on the Uniform Spanning Tree".  Professor Ioana Dumitriu (University of California, San Diego) gave a talk of the title "Spectra of Regular Graphs and Hypergraphs: Theory and Applications".  Professor Martina Hofmanov&aacute; (Universit&auml;t Bielefeld, Germany) gave a talk of the title "Non-Uniqueness in Law of Stochastic 3D Navier--Stokes Equations".   Professor Firas Rassoul-Agha (University of Utah) gave a talk of the title "Geometry of Geodesics Through Busemann Measures in Directed Last-Passage Percolation".  Professor Samy Tindel (Purdue University) gave a talk of the title "The Parabolic Anderson Model in a Rough Environment".  Two poster sessions were held on March 5&ndash;6, 2020. Twenty-nine early career researchers gave poster presentations. Each of them gave a 5-minute talk to introduce their research before the poster session.  On March 5, 2020, a panel discussion for beginning researchers was held. Four professors shared their experience with early career researchers and graduate students, provided suggestions about career development, and answered various questions from the audience.  Two open problem sessions were held on March 5&ndash;6, 2020. Several participants gave blackboard presentations, of between 10 and 15 minutes in length, and raised open problems of current interest. These sessions were informal and interactive.  On March 4, 2020, Women in Probability hosted a dinner for female participants of SSP 2020.  The Seminar on Stochastic Processes 2020 provided young specialists and accomplished researchers an excellent opportunity to discuss and work on recent advances in stochastic processes.
