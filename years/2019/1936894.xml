<AbstractNarration>The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and show potential for deliverables in the near future.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/ potential benefit of this Convergence Accelerator Phase I project is to increase the number of affordable digital technology (DT) pathways for upskilling/reskilling so American workers can improve their careers and American companies have access to a highly skilled, diverse talent pool. This work will examine how three organizations &amp;#8213; the Business-Higher Education Forum, the Greater Washington Partnership, and the Business Roundtable &amp;#8213; can bring together two dozen employers and higher education institutions in the Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia region to develop a partnership model which will deliver new DT upskilling/reskilling pathways at scale. These pathways will be focused on increasing the skills of American workers in the areas of cybersecurity, cloud computing, networking/IT, and artificial intelligence/machine learning in order to the meet the demands of employers. Given the rapid pace at which technology changes, there is tremendous need for a model that brings together education and workforce stakeholders to develop new DT upskilling/reskilling pathways rapidly and at scale.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Convergence Accelerator Phase I project will address how intermediary organizations can accelerate the speed and impact of upskilling/reskilling efforts in DT by aligning and coordinating companies, higher education institutions, third-party education/training providers, and STEM professionals. The majority of studies done to date in this field are narrowly focused on intermediaries working between education policymakers and implementation partners, or between employees and employers. DT upskilling/reskilling for STEM professionals requires collaboration between a broader group of education and workforce stakeholders, which can be coordinated through trusted intermediaries. This research will examine the intermediaries? effect on: addressing gaps and opportunities; conducting relevant research in order to provide recommendations on how to address these gaps and opportunities; communicating with all stakeholders to create a common framework for action; supporting aligned efforts and mobilizing resources; establishing shared metrics and identifying success; and disseminating the results of the collaboration on DT upskilling/reskilling efforts. The proposed effort will result in a replicable model for collaborations to support DT upskilling/reskilling rapidly and at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The grant supported BHEF, the Greater Washington Partnership, Business Roundtable, and two dozen university and employer partners in the DMV region as they generated digital technology upskilling market intelligence.     A labor market analysis of roles requiring digital technology upskilling/reskilling, encompassing digital technology supply and demand, current and trending skills needs, gaps, convergent and divergent skills, and upskilling pathways in the DMV. A national survey of 600 managers to learn how companies? help employees develop and enhance the skills needed for working in digital technology fields. Focus groups and structured interviews of higher education faculty and staff, business partners, and adult learners in the DMV. Higher education landscape analysis of upskilling/reskilling digital technology pathways including 298 digital technology-related credentials from 12 universities in the DMV.      Through this research, BHEF identified the needs that must be met for employers to support workers seeking skills required for 21st-century work related to technologies of the future, including:     Better information on employees? current DT skills and the skills employees need most to improve performance and maximize productivity; Improved understanding of job pathways for employees to grow their careers or move into another role (adjacencies); and  Easily identifiable upskilling opportunities that are trusted, provide just-in-time content, affordable, short term, and largely delivered asynchronously online.      The grant resulted in data-driven insights and recommendations for business and higher education. In particular, BHEF found that a tighter upskilling ecosystem connecting businesses, higher education, and individuals with labor market information and tech-based tools could:     Allow employers to overcome upskilling barriers by providing a better understanding of their skill needs, their employees? current skills, and identifies career pathways and role adjacencies for employees;  Help workers find training programs to close current skills gaps, support advancement, or facilitate transitions and allow them to better understand career pathways and the skills required to enhance their marketability; and  Support higher education in developing better upskilling opportunities and micro-credentials with improved skills-demand data and employer feedback.       By connecting employers, workers, and education providers with labor market data and applications and tools, the ecosystem would generate clearer skills-demand signaling and build transparency around upskilling credentials that increase ROI for employers and accelerate the attainment of DT skills for workers.     BHEF and its partners shared these learning and insights with a broader audience through conference papers and presentations, reports, social media, a video, and participation in an NSF-sponsored expo to inspire others to take action in meeting the nation?s upskilling needs; join BHEF and its partners to build a wider network of companies, higher education institutions, training organizations, government agencies, research and development centers, associations, professional societies, and other organizations on this effort; and ultimately re-envision an economy that can provide ample opportunities to upskill in order to remain competitive in the job market.
