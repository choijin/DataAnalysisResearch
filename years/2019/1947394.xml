<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be that it can save hundreds of thousands of dollars in health assessment costs by reducing costs associated with manual labor for the individualized care required at biometric screenings and the amount of time spent by medical experts. It will allow practitioners to "triage" their screenings by identifying people who are at high risk of developing metabolic and cardiovascular diseases for further in-depth evaluations. Moreover, this I-Corps project can reduce legal liability and risk associated with biometric screenings as the technology relies on 3D optical scanning technology, which is non-invasive and non-intrusive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will be one of the first to commercialize a non-invasive, non-intrusive, and fully automated health pre-screening tool based on 3D optical scanning. It is a web application that analyzes a 3D optical scan of a human subject and provides a detailed report on the subject's fitness and wellness status. A unique feature of the web application is that it can accommodate data from most currently available 3D optical scanners whose current system outputs are machine-specific and whose outputs are now very limited in their contents. More specifically, the technology quantifies a subject's body size and shape by applying geometrical mathematics on the subject's 3D optical scan and then uses machine learning approaches to estimate the subject's fitness and wellness status including the subject's body composition and risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

As we reached our last series of interviews we captured the interest of a foundation that is supporting the next phase of our research and product development.              In sum, we:             -Learned through the training offered by the NSF I-Corps program the major steps to think "as an entrepreneur" instead of focusing on a technology developed in a laboratory setting; Evaluated the team cohesion and to established personal and professional relationships between team members.              _ Developed a working methodology, including planning for cost and time, management and reporting while being in a startup-like, fast paced environment.              -The Escowell (our company name) team successfully completed 102 interviews, among which 97 were in-person interviews. Team members traveled throughout the entire program to many exhibitions and conferences during which they were able to perform the interviews.                The key activities of Escowell are (1) to develop a platform for researchers  to collect data and to publish papers to the results of the pilot tests to validate the value-proposition hypothesis.              The key resources are: (1) intellectual including the clinical data and academic publications, (2) physical including online cloud services and data storage and (3) human including the data analysists, mathematicians, software developers and technical support experts.              Many opportunities have been offered by NSF I-Corps program for training and professional development. Thanks to the weekly trainings, the team members were able to learn all key points as well as many techniques to approach and communicate with different stakeholders of the project. This intensive training allowed the entrepreneurial and co-entrepreneurial leads to discover what was never taught in their academic journeys as well as mentors that also developed their professional business skills.             Finally, the I-Corps journey has also been a personal experience for all members, and all team members were grateful to be emerged during the seven weeks into this intense program that brought them outside of their comfort zone, to be fully immersed in a start-up pace.
