<AbstractNarration>This award will support the participation of U.S.-based researchers at the Eighteenth Latin American Symposium on Mathematical Logic (the Simposio Latino Americano de Logica Matematica, or SLALM) at the Universidad de Concepcion in Chile on December 16-20, 2019.  The SLALM series was conceived by Abraham Robinson in the 1960's, and SLALM meetings have been held intermittently since then, usually every two to four years, always in Latin America.  These meetings have been instrumental in the growth of the discipline of logic in the region during that time, and also in encouraging cooperation between the logic communities in North and South America, as researchers from the U.S. and Canada frequently attend the SLALM.  With the expansion of this contact has come fruitful exchange:  the very top ranks of logicians in the U.S. these days include researchers born in Brazil and Uruguay, while U.S.-born logicians have taken permanent jobs in countries such as Colombia, and a substantial further number of researchers have traveled between the regions for postdoctoral positions. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This particular NSF award will support the attendance of eight to ten US-based logicians at the 2019 SLALM, with an emphasis on students and junior researchers, and with preference for researchers from groups underrepresented in mathematics.  The award will be administered by the Association for Symbolic Logic, which has supported the SLALM series since its inception and which recently made the SLALM an official ASL meeting, providing financial support for it to invite prominent speakers, in recognition of the growth of logic in Latin America.  The 2019 SLALM will include eight plenary talks, four mini-courses, and four special sessions: computability and computer science; model theory; philosophy and non-classical logics; and set theory.  The special sessions include prominent invited speakers and also contributed talks in which younger researchers will have the opportunity to present their work. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;SLALM website: http://slalmxviii.udec.cl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
