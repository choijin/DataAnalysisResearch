<AbstractNarration>Promoting progress in science and building a globally competitive workforce, a core part of the National Science Foundation's mission, requires increasing diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This project is supported by the Divisions of Chemistry and Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems in the Engineering Directorate. The GEM Consortium aims to improve diversity in the STEM workforce through a two-pronged approach. First, GEM encourages selected underrepresented minority (URM) students to pursue graduate degrees in STEM fields by ensuring that the students receive a living stipend and tuition while enrolled in a GEM member-university program. Next, GEM provides access to paid internships for the selected students, providing the students with work experience and networking opportunities. Ultimately this project works to illustrate and provide pathways for advanced STEM education and careers for URM students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides training pathways for both Ph.D. and Master's level students in STEM fields, particularly in Chemistry, Chemical and Environmental Engineering, and Physics. GEM consortium-selected URM students apply to the university-member programs, and upon acceptance, GEM provides a stipend towards living expenses and tuition. The universities cover the remainder of the tuition, and in the case of Ph.D. level students, a living stipend (through teaching or research assistantships or other methods) for the duration of the degree. This encourages member universities to accept URM students, while assuring students of the economic feasibility of an advanced degree. Students also participate in a paid internship that GEM helps to arrange, which enables students to build a career network and provides them with work experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The cohort of graduate students participated in internships at a variety of national labs working on chemistry related projects. Several of the internships were completed in a remote format due to the pandemic. During this grant period a comprehensive evaluation was conducted among the participating interns to understand how the internship was impacting their professional development. Intern supervisors also provided data on how the intern they were working with was gaining and applying knowledge as well as developing career related goals. Interns reported that they were applying technical information in new ways and learning about how the organization that they were part of functioned. They noted they were gaining valuable insights by attending meetings, making presentations to groups, networking with organizational employees, and participating in one on one conversations with their organizational mentors. Intern supervisors mentored participants throughout the experience and reported in the surveys that they felt the interns were learning new technical skills and were gaining experience that would make them attractive candidates for future full-time positions with their organization or at others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/06/2021<br>      Modified by: Marcus&nbsp;A&nbsp;Huggans</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
