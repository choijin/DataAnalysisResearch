<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Analysis in Missouri: a Midwestern symposium" that will be held September 5-8, 2019 at the University of Missouri, Columbia. The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of Harmonic Analysis and Functional Analysis and their applications.  Participants in the conference have contributed significantly to recent developments in the fields of elliptic partial differential equations, Anderson localization, asymptotic geometric analysis, non-commutative L^p spaces, singular integral operators and the two-weight problem, convex geometry, and the interplay of harmonic analysis, additive combinatorics, and combinatorial geometry.  We anticipate that these topics will be presented by the participants in plenary talks and in shorter talks.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at a url to be established soon that will be accessible via: https://www.math.missouri.edu/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
