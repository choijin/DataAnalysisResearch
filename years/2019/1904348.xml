<AbstractNarration>In this project it will be investigated how authoritarian regimes can survive ideological crisis in the social media era through the combination of coercive and non-coercive media control strategies. Scholars interested in democracy have observed the growth of social media with anticipation as they imagined it to be a potential source of free communication and democratization, particularly in authoritarian states. However, in many cases, authoritarian governments have been able to maintain their positions or even to use social media to strengthen them.  This proposed research will shed light on the puzzle of authoritarian resilience by investigating the potential for using non-coercive means to re-orient public attention in officially approved directions. Findings will contribute to national security by furthering understanding of the connection between development, in particular, adoption of new information and communication technology, and political change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on one important case, two main questions are asked in this research: 1) How a pro-democracy wave furthered by officials has affected discussion on democracy in the microblog-based public sphere? 2) Who is winning the ideological battle between the officials and the public?  These questions will be addressed through a longitudinal analysis of microblog posts with the keyword "democracy" from 2009 to 2018 and contents that have been censored. Computer-aided text analytic techniques, alongside more conventional content analysis methodologies, will be used for discovering topics within the text, constructing semantic networks and comparing the contents generated by the state agency, the individual user and the censored user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>At the dawn of the social media age, many people celebrated it as an emerging public space for freedom of expression, with potentially far-reaching implications, especially for authoritarian regimes. In their view, social media could facilitate the public to hold the authority accountable, thus broadening the base for democracy. However, authoritarian regimes have proven themselves capable of adapting to these digital technologies. In many cases, authoritarian governments even use social media to strengthen their positions. The key question led by such a dystopian phenomenon is: how has the authoritarian state used social media to reinforce their rule, instead of being weakened by it? Most explanations describe it as a result of authoritarian governments' repressive strategy, including activities like censorship and internet crackdown. However, recent evidence shows that repressive strategy is only effective at a limited scope, and it may backfire by worsening citizens' opinions of the regime and increasing their wiliness to escape its control. Moreover, even the repressive strategy is effective in blocking anti-authoritarian messages, it is unlikely to bring volunteer voices favoring authoritarianism at the individual level, which is, on a rising trend, the case in China's social media.&nbsp;</p> <p>I argue that the hegemonic strategy is the key to explain this puzzle. The hegemonic strategy indicates the use of activities that elicit consent and foster discourses that present incumbent officials as benevolent. It is usually conducted by propaganda apparatus and pro-government mouthpieces, such as Party- or state-affiliated news outlets. Since the early 2010s, Chinese authority started to include digital media as the infrastructure for social control. The authority also expands its influence in cyberspace by increasing the official and semi-official social media accounts. In practice, officials have incorporated social media marketing tactics in their hegemonic strategy. For instance, there is an increase in using 'cute cat propaganda' that mixes propaganda messages with eye-catching entertainment to attract attention. The hegemonic strategy not only reduces the resistance but also increases users' interest in officially promoted messages.&nbsp;</p> <p>The purpose of hegemonic strategy is to make the official interpretation of certain issues the 'common sense' to the society. In China's case, rather than counting on repressive strategy in blocking undesired information, such as liberal ideas of democracy, the authoritarian regime uses hegemonic strategy, such as launching a propaganda campaign, to promote messages that justify the authoritarian rule. This study analyzes China's 2013-2016 propaganda campaign (see Figure 1) to examine if the hegemonic strategy influences how the Chinese discuss democracy. I evaluate its impacts on the digital public sphere by tracking how the official version of democracy, the 'Core Socialist Values' (CSV), was adopted by social media users and to what extent it replaces the liberal democratic ideas in the public sphere. The CSV is a set of twelve values representing the official interpretation of Chinese socialism, and 'democracy' is listed as one of the national values. It provides an alternative value system to the Western ones by highlighting Chinese official's interpretation of democracy. By measuring how the CSV is spread from the official mouthpiece to regular social media users, it shows how the public was influenced by the authority's voice in political discussion.</p> <p>Findings reveal that the mouthpiece has generated considerable impacts on the public discussion on democracy: the more interaction the mouthpiece triggered in the public discussion, the more likely the public replicated the official discourse. Meanwhile, the public increasingly adopts the official discourse in discussing democracy, which replaced the existing liberal interpretation of democracy with a socialist version (see Figure 2). Regular people's social media posts also became more similar to the messages promoted by the mouthpiece in its language (Figure 3). The findings answered the key question: why did discourses favoring authoritarian regimes increase? I argue that the regime can shape the public discussion on democracy through their mouthpiece's social media activities. The ideological campaign effectively promoted the official interpretation of democracy and created a meaning system that strengthened the regime's legitimacy.</p> <p>China's case expanded the understanding of authoritarian resilience and hegemony in the social media era. Resilient authoritarianism utilized a two-fold strategy that combines repressive and hegemonic activities: the repressive activities are proactive efforts to redirect the public attention, and the hegemonic activities are used to mobilize the public to engage in official desired activities. In this way, the regime makes their interpretation of the world 'common sense' to the society. It is easier to exercise power if the public cannot imagine an alternative to the current situation or perceives any proposed alternative as inferior to the status quo. This study shows how social media has empowered the authority to reach what Gramsci called 'the consensus protected by the armor of coercion.' It also reveals how social media can be used in anti-democratic campaigns, and moreover, to benefit authoritarianism.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/02/2021<br>      Modified by: Muyang&nbsp;Li</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1904348/1904348_10595523_1619837810706_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1904348/1904348_10595523_1619837810706_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1904348/1904348_10595523_1619837810706_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The ideological campaign, captured by the media coverage index on Core Socialist Values</div> <div class="imageCredit">Figure 1</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Muyang&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1904348/1904348_10595523_1619838513781_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1904348/1904348_10595523_1619838513781_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1904348/1904348_10595523_1619838513781_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The public discourse on democracy before (upper right) and during the ideological campaign.
