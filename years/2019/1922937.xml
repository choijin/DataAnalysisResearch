<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop silicon(Si)-based rechargeable batteries that can simultaneously provide ultrafast charging capability, high specific energy and long-lasting cycle life. Such rechargeable batteries will allow cell phones to be charged to their full capacity within 20 min (rather than 2 hours offered by the current battery technology available in the market) while extending the usage time to 3 days (rather than 2 days of current technology) before recharge is needed. These ultrafast charging and high energy batteries can also find a market for other consumer products, such as cameras, laptops, drones, power tools, electric forklifts in warehouses, and military devices, to improve work productivity and life quality for consumers. Furthermore, Si-based high energy batteries can be utilized to reduce the cost and weight of electric vehicle battery packs by 60%. These advancements will pave the way for broad market penetration of electric vehicles and support a more environmentally sustainable mode of transportation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project employs a novel, simple and low-cost manufacturing method that can synthesize a new type of Si-based anode powder which exhibits unusual properties with ultrafast charging capability, high specific capacity and long-lasting cycle life. This new Si-based anode is termed as Si@void@C because it contains three distinct features simultaneously: (i) nanostructured Si building blocks, (ii) a conductive carbon shell outside the nanostructured Si core, and (iii) engineered void space inside the Si core. Together these three features offer the much-needed properties for Li-ion batteries: ultrafast charging capability, high specific energy and long-lasting cycle life. Based on these unique properties, the Si-based rechargeable batteries are designed in two general categories, one being "ultrafast charging batteries" that can shorten the charging time to 20 min while still allowing cell phones to be used for 3 days before re-charge and the other being "high energy batteries" which require 2 hours charging time, but allow users to recharge batteries every 6 days. Furthermore, "high energy batteries" can enable a reduction in the cost of the battery packs by 60% for electric vehicles, removing a critical barrier to consumer acceptance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
