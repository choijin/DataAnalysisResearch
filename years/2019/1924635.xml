<AbstractNarration>This grant is to provide travel support for ~30 US-based researchers to attend The 10th USA-China Joint Chemical Engineering Conference, Chengdu, China, May 25-29, 2020. The theme of the conference is Chemical Engineering for Clean and Sustainable Energy and a special emphasis will be placed on not only the role of chemical engineers in the development of clean and sustainable chemical and energy processes, but also exploring the frontiers for developing fundamentals needed to tackle these enormous challenges. This is an important topic of global interest and, as such, a priority area of research for the PRM program and CBET. The organizing committee, which consists of distinguished researchers with a broad range of skills in chemical engineering, will provide for a vibrant and diverse atmosphere that will foster exchange of ideas on research and education. It is anticipated that approximately 35 US-based researchers will receive partial travel support to attend this conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motivated by the global challenges in energy, resources, and the environment, the 10th USA-China Joint Conference of Chemical Engineering aims to serve as a platform for scientists, engineers and technologists from China, the US and around the world to communicate the latest developments and share knowledge across the field of Chemical Engineering. The theme of the conference is Chemical Engineering for Clean and Sustainable Energy and a special emphasis will be placed on not only the role of chemical engineers in the development of clean and sustainable chemical and energy processes, but also exploring the frontiers for developing fundamentals needed to tackle these enormous challenges. With all the exciting developments taking place worldwide and particularly in the US and China, this conference promises to be an exciting gathering for all participants.  The US-based conference participants supported by this grant will have the opportunity to network with leading researchers from China and exchange ideas about present and future directions in research and education. They will benefit from state-of-the-art reviews and presentations by leading experts and by debating controversial points with their peers. The meeting will also provide an opportunity for interaction and cooperation among industrial and academic researchers. The organizers plan to give special consideration to young or junior faculty members from U.S. Universities. Female and under-represented minorities will also receive special consideration. The conference will address global challenges with potentially significant benefits to society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
