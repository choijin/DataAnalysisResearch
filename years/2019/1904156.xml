<AbstractNarration>North Carolina has experienced 11 major disasters due to hurricanes or tropical storms over the past 20 years. Moreover, one tropical cyclone has hit the state every two years since 1851. Although natural disasters are frequent, efforts to understand and support public schools' responses to such disasters are rare. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is an exploratory mixed methods study investigating the impact of vulnerability and resilience in the recovery of North Carolina schools affected by both Hurricanes Florence (2018) and Matthew (2016). Specifically, the study assesses whether schools that were impacted by both storms used organizational learning strategies to recover faster than schools that were impacted by either Hurricane Florence or Matthew alone. The project pursues three research questions: (1) What characteristics predict school district resilience? (2) How does prior disaster experience aid/hinder a resilient recovery? (3) Do students in resilient districts show less learning loss or rebound from learning loss more quickly?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mixed methods project will involve interviews, focus groups and surveys with school and district personnel in a purposive sample of 15 districts across North Carolina that were heavily impacted by both storms and those that were affected by only one. These qualitative data will be used to derive markers of resilience that will then be used in quantitative analyses. Quantitative comparisons of state-wide data on student outcomes (e.g., achievement, attendance) will also be made across three kinds of districts: those that were affected by both storms, those that were affected by only one storm and those that were not affected at all. Quantitative data will be taken from an existing longitudinal database that includes individual student characteristics, attendance, suspensions and academic performance for all students in North Carolina. The purposive sampling of 15 districts in North Carolina allows for a novel comparison of impact, recovery and organizational learning across two disasters and over time. Disasters can create an opportunity for organizational change leading to greater resiliency in future crises; however, little extant research has focused on whether and how schools recover and remain resilient in the aftermath of natural disasters, such as hurricanes. This project can benefit schools in crisis by providing lessons learned and a roadmap for action to schools that are singularly and repeatedly impacted by natural disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Over half of respondents said their district was more prepared for Hurricane Florence than Matthew; whereas less than 10 percent said they were less prepared.  While interviewees gave mostly positive feedback about the changes in districts’ crisis management during the hurricanes, principals noted one important continued theme: how schools are used as emergency shelters for the local community. School administration is required to oversee shelter operations at their schools&mdash;a task that needs more logistical clarity and guidance from district- and county-level leaders. For this reason, respondents suggested that future crisis planning at the county level involves school leaders who can provide insights about the challenges encountered with operating emergency shelters.  The second key theme that emerged from the qualitative analysis was that teachers and staff in areas hit by both hurricanes often experienced prolonged stress and fatigue&mdash;both from personal trauma and loss from the storm and from helping students navigate the emotional impacts of these disasters. An overwhelming majority of surveyed teachers were concerned about their mental health after the storm and expressed concerns about their colleagues’ mental health. Following a disaster, teachers often sacrificed personal time and well-being to help students and their communities. Some participants worried about the long-term emotional toll the crisis would have on teachers. In summary, thorough preparation and emotional support are critical in the mitigation of disasters.  Quantitative analysis of student outcome data revealed negative impacts of hurricane exposure on student test scores in elementary school reading and math; middle school reading, math, and science; and high school English and Biology.  The size of these effects were generally between 1.5 and 3 percent of a standard deviation.  In the years following Hurricane Matthew, the hurricane’s effect on test scores began to fade out.  Analysis of outcomes in the participating districts revealed similar results.  However, among participating districts, those that were impacted by both hurricanes saw smaller effects from Hurricane Florence than those districts only affected by Hurricane Florence.  If anything, suspension rates were reduced following exposure to hurricanes, and absences were increased following Hurricane Matthew but not Hurricane Florence.  These findings may reflect a greater willingness of school personnel to accommodate students after the hurricanes.
