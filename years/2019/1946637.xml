<AbstractNarration>The Association of the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Undergraduate Consortium and Mentoring Program aims to help prepare a workforce of future artificial intelligence (AI) researchers that is representative of broad societal diversity. The project plans to increase the number of undergraduates who attend the annual AAAI conference and to increase the diversity of conference attendees.  Supporting undergraduates at top-tier international academic conferences is important for their academic and professional growth.  However, conferences typically offer limited opportunities for undergraduates to make the most of their conference experiences.  This project intends to reinforce the research identities of future AI researchers across diverse backgrounds.  It will do so by providing undergraduates with an enhanced conference experience.  Enhancements will include opportunities for undergraduates  to practice written and verbal presentation skills, to build mentoring relationships with AI experts, to construct a diverse network of peers, and to explore graduate school and careers in AI research. The long-term objectives are to broaden the pipeline of students pursuing AI graduate education and research careers  and to produce tools and materials that researchers and educators can use to enhance the undergraduate experience at other academic conferences.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The programming objectives of the AAAI Undergraduate Consortium and Mentoring Program are to offer undergraduate students an enriched conference experience as they (1) present and receive critical feedback about their work in a professional, academic setting; (2) meet prospective graduate advisors; (3) receive mentoring about the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing graduate studies in AI as well as practical early career advice; (4) expand their professional network to include AI experts, graduate students, and undergraduate peers; and (5) receive advice, tools, and resources for successfully applying to and attending graduate school in an AI-related research area.  In partnership with AAAI, data will be collected on undergraduate participation at AAAI and participants will be invited to complete optional pre-/post-consortium and longitudinal surveys.  These data will be used to measure changes in participant perceptions and behaviors related to their identity as researchers, as well as changes in the AAAI-Undergraduate Consortiumâ€™s efficacy and pipeline effects over time.  Analysis of these data will be used to assess the outcomes of the AAAI-Undergraduate Consortium and to improve future recruitment, programming, and retention efforts. The project will maintain and disseminate a repository of undergraduate programming opportunities that can be used in conjunction with any professional computer science conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
