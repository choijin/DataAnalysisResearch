<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves improvement in the standard of care for patients suffering from retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. Vision loss or decline imposes a significant socio-economic burden on populations afflicted by these debilitating diseases. The proposed product aims to reduce the frequency of intraocular drug injections for treating these conditions, which may lead to improved patient compliance. Commercially, the product may replace current therapeutic approaches based on antibody technologies. The customer discovery and preparation of a business model canvas through the I-Corps program will determine a clear go/no-go decision for clinical translation of the product. Success of the business strategy may increase the well-being of millions of Americans suffering from diabetic retinopathy. The translation of the technology from the bench to the bedside would pave the way for market approval of peptide-based hydrogels in particular and implantable biomaterials in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project would enable customer discovery and preparation of a business model canvas for the development of an anti-angiogenic hydrogel intended for the treatment of intraocular posterior segment diseases. The current standard-of-care, intraocular injections of inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor, cause patient discomfort and increased risk of infection due to the high frequency of dosage (monthly) required. The proposed product is a shear-responsive hydrogel, and thus it can be injected into the vitreous humor of the eye. The constituent peptide contains an anti-angiogenic domain and self-assembles in aqueous media into supramolecular nanofibers. The biological activity as well as the favorable material property of the product has led to the current I-Corps proposal. The proposed product may enhance technological understanding of the response of intraocular neovascularization to injectable anti-angiogenic hydrogels, facilitating future therapies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The goal of this project was to develop a better understanding of product market fit through a series of customer discovery interviews for our novel drug.  We developed a treatment for the leading causes of blindness (diabetes, DR, and wet-AMD).  The major goals of this work are to:  Developed a strong business thesis: Injectable hydrogel that can reduce dosing frequency by 6x and cost by 10x for treatment of eye diseases:  - interviewed over 100 customers face to face, and over 140 face-to-face. Continued interveiwing and using the lessons learned to better approach understanding product market fit.  - worked on SBIR proposal currently in review at NSF - worked on expanding team to include business and scientific advisors for the work.   - established collaborations as a funciton of interviews and mentorship.  Through this process, we have built a start-up company, SAPHTx, that has since applied for an STTR grant, and is currently applying for more SBIR/ STTR opportunities. We are exicted about the potential of this platform and have found this experience to be invaluable.  On a personal note - i have changed the way i do research, conduct laboratory research and the value of LinkedIn (CUSTOMER DISCOVERY). This NSF I-Corps program is my new mantra and has revolutionized my way of thinking.              Last Modified: 06/01/2020       Submitted by: Vivek A Kumar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
