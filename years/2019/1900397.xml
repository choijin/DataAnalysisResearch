<AbstractNarration>The Second Northeast Conference on Dynamical Systems will be held in the third weekend of September 2019. The conference is a part of a biennial conference series that periodically provides a forum for the dynamical systems community in the northeast area. The goal of this conference is to promote progress in dynamical systems by bringing together researchers in dynamical systems, presenting latest research progress, exchanging ideas, encouraging collaborations, and fostering young researchers and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invited speakers and participants come from many areas of dynamical systems with an emphasis of connections between dynamical systems and statistical physics. The conference will also arrange many short talks for young researchers to announce their recent results. More information can been found at: http://people.math.umass.edu/~yaoli/UmassConference-Overview.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Many local unregistered students also attended some conference talks. Eight plenary talks were given in the conference by distinguished researchers in dynamical systems. Nine short talk opportunities were given by graduate students and post-docs. Topics of conference talks addressed the recent progress of many important problems in dynamical systems, especially the connection between dynamical systems and statistical physics. This activitity benefits the dynamical systems community, mathematicians whose research interests are influenced by dynamical systems, and researchers in many applied sciences that are related to dynamical systems.  The conference created an integrated, collaborative event whose purpose was to significantly increase our understanding of dynamical systems, with an emphasis on its connection to statistical physics. The organizing committee is dedicated to promoting the work of advanced graduate students, post-docs, and young scientists in an effort to maximize their exposure. Short talk opportunities were reserved for young people who has not started their tenure-track position yet.
