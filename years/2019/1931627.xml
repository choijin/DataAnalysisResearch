<AbstractNarration>The ACM International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services (ACM MobiSys) is a premiere event for presenting innovative and significant research of mobile systems, applications and services. The research topics of MobiSys span multiple disciplines, including wireless networks and communication, mobile sensing and crowdsourcing applications, wearable computing, vehicular and robotic wireless systems, operating systems, distributed algorithms, data management, energy management, sensors, security and privacy. ACM MobiSys brings together academic, industry, and government professionals to a single-track, highly selective forum, and thus provides an ideal venue for researchers pursuing technological advances of mobile systems, applications and services. The goal of this student travel support is to promote research engagement of students, especially ones who are not well-funded, under-represented, or otherwise not likely to be able to attend high-profile conferences on mobile systems. The grant will highly encourage such students to become active and then take the lead in the latest research directions in the related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the funds is to support approximately 20 student participants at recognized US institutions of higher education. They will be selected by the conference student travel grants committee to maximize their potential benefits from MobiSys, while prioritizing support for under-funded or under-represented communities. The support of NSF will be highly recognized by all the conference organizers and attendees, and its impact will be reported along with students testimonials, as well as all the significant information including announcement and selection process. The student participants will have opportunities to exchange innovative ideas in a vibrant field, which will significantly impact their future research directions. Their ideas will offer momentum to the future of mobile systems and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported (in part) ten US students to attend the MobiSys 2019 conference in Seoul, South Korea. MobiSys 2019 was a high caliber forum to present innovative and significant research on the design, implementation, usage, and evaluation of mobile systems, applications, and services. Students who participated received a unique educational experience and were encouraged to become active in the latest research directions around mobile systems. Students in attendance were also exposed to a worldwide view of the research area, and engaged in discussions with both distinguished researchers and fellow graduate students that will potentially shape their future careers. This award sought to encourage underrepresented students and students who had no previously attended MobiSys to attend. A third of the grants were reserved for first time attendees, and another third of the awards were reserved for students from under-represented groups. Solicitations for applications to apply to the award were distributed to several groups with diverse memberships. Ultimately, 20% of the attendees were from under-represented groups and 20% were first time attendees. Students who attended MobiSys 2019 with support from this award were asked to help volunteer during the conference to further their involvement at the event. After the conference, every awarded student reported that attending MobiSys 2019 was valuable for their career.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/15/2021<br>      Modified by: Bradford&nbsp;Campbell</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
