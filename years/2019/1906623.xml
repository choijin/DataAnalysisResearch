<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will help disease researchers better understand how oxidative stress impacts a variety of disease states.  Specifically, our products will show how illnesses such as cancer and Alzehimer's progress over time and, most importantly, how to more effectively treat these conditions.  Preliminary research indicates one of our proposed products can differentiate the effectiveness of a proposed Alzheimer's drug, conduct protein studies that image dithiols and quantify oxidative stress through a determination of glutathione.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is focused on ascertaining the marketability of these products within the biotech research market, ascertaining market size and gaining a thorough understanding of the competitive landscape of the oxidative stress market.  Through this understanding, we will insure that our products fill a market need and, if necessary, can pivot to better tailor our products to customer need.  As this project offers the opportunity to improve oxidative stress research and could also be used to differentiate disease states, the company's potential products offer significant commercial and societal impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report summarizes the outcomes from receipt of an NSF I-Corps grant, which was granted to Concordia to support customer discovery of a new oxidative stress research tool.  After interviewing over 100 prospective customers through attendance at BIO, the Society for Laboratory Automation Scientists (SLAS), the CYTO flow cytometry conference and direct visits with prospective customers in Seattle, Chicago and Tucson, it was determined that there was sufficient interest to support the development of a new product within this space.   As a result of this interest, the company secured a licensing agreement to synthesize, market and sell a patented product within the space.  This product was licensed from Dr. Daniel Sem.  Non-dilutive funding from the city of Milwaukee and the state of Wisconsin was obtained to aid in the development of our minimally viable product.  The technology was developed via an industrial- academic partnership run through the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.   Procedures were put in place to appropriately scale-up the synthesis of the product described in the patent so that commercial quantities could be produced.  This led to the development of approximately 2 grams of product, or 2000 1mg units, which Concordia internally validated to ensure that it would perform in an appropriate manner.  After internal validation was completed, Vivid Microscopy LLC began working with prospective customers on external validation.  This led to developing a relationship with a mid-sized pharmaceutical company, which is running an analysis against competing products.  As most of our prospective customers are involved in neuroscience research, Vivid is also forming a relationship with a group that specializes in the production of human neurologic cells.         During the I-Corps program, the company found several individuals that expressed interest in our product.  Vivid has started giving formal sales presentations to those groups.  Both had specific requests involving additional validations.  Vivid is working with Concordia to complete those analyses as well as with some of the partnerships that were developed during the I-Corps to complete those requests.   At this point, Vivid is working on improving the speed of its packaging while starting to market and sell its minimally viable product to key customers.  Additionally, we are also pursuing both local and federal non-dilutive grants (STTR/SBIR) to aid in the development of a later stage product, which could include a diagnostic targeted to ALS.
