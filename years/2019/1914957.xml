<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a low cost and reliable torque sensor for use with automotive and related applications. As the proposed torque sensing method is based on the speed, it can be used with most of the engine/transmission systems.  However, this technique requires modifications to make it suitable for use with electric engines.  This will enhance its applicability over a larger range of vehicle applications.  Automotive manufacturers also need the comparison of input torque at the engine and the torque delivered after the differential to the wheels.  This knowledge further helps in reducing possible losses in torque, and improving the efficiencies. This torque sensing method can meet automobile industry requirements of improved efficiency, low cost, while also providing accurate engine torque measurements. The total available market could include all automotive engines and transmissions in the medium and heavy duty vehicles, off-high way vehicles and others in the transportation sector. The long-term goal of this project is to expand the use of this method in other sectors, where instantaneous torque measurement can help to improve the process efficiency.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps Project will help to investigate the commercialization potential of low cost torque sensors in different engine/transmission driven applications.  Relying on a virtual torque sensing concept, the proposed method requires minimal additional hardware, which makes it an economically attractive concept for automotive manufacturers.  Currently, automotive engine and transmission manufacturers use estimates for torque values.   The company found that the current engine ECU torque estimation has an accuracy of 5-30%.  Commercially available torque sensors cost $500 to $10000, making them non-viable for commercial transportation vehicles. Overall, the goal of the project is to seamlessly integrate the sensor along with the existing mechanical and electronic systems. This sensing method is being tested in a commercially available test facility.  An improvement in the accuracy of torque sensing can result in improved fuel efficiency, better driving comfort and reduced wear of gears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
