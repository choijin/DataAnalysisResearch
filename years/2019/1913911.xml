<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase 1 project will develop novel technology to more efficiently train surgeons and reduce the risk to patients in the operating room. Current surgical education is inadequate, and as a result inexperienced surgeons inevitably end up operating on live patients during their training. The proposed work will be performed outside of the operating room and allow them to train in a simulated, educational environment on non-patient specific models. This work carries enormous potential for public benefit as it seeks to reduce surgical error and increase the health and safety of all patients undergoing surgery. The proposed work will integrate technology with surgical simulation in an unprecedented manner, combining educational hardware/software packages with physical anatomical models to create an immersive, highly effective training experience. The project carries high potential to broadly improve training for all medical fields, as the educational hardware/software packages developed can be used to teach any complex task or procedure. The commercialization of the prototype developed in the project will generate substantial income for those involved in its production, sale, and usage; additionally, the project will improve both the well-being of the public as well as the educational and training of the healthcare industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a prototype hardware and software training system that delivers educational content in real time, guiding a training surgeon through a simulated surgical procedure. The developed prototype will visually recognize state changes and objects in three-dimensional space, using these cues to trigger prompts and deliver instructions, guidance, and medical curricula in a timely manner as the surgeon interacts with a non-patient specific physical models; this product will require the integration of physical models with software and augmented reality technology on a level unparalleled on the market today. The project will directly test and validate the assembled hardware and programmed software and apply statistical testing to develop an initial product that performs within acceptable parameters. The proposed work will yield an assembled prototype, a combination of hardware and software that can guide a surgeon through a complete training procedure performed on a synthetic anatomical model. This prototype will have undergone technical validation and an initial round of educational validation, in preparation for the broader clinical and educational validation planned in Phase 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

We designed and tested a hardware and software platform that detects user progress during a simulated procedure and provides appropriately timed curricular content. The hardware consists of an augmented reality headset and wired computer that permits delivery of curricula in a hands free, heads up display and provides a continuous recorded video feed througha simulated endoscopic camera for determining users progress. Two separate software elements were developed; 1) to detect user state through the use of machine learninig and 2) to display appropriate instructional content based the current state of the procedure. A custom deep learning architecture was deployed in real-time to analyze the video feed and determine user progress. A gaming engine was implemented to provide the user with appropriately timed multimedia instructional prompts through the heads up display based on output from the machine learning model.</p> <p>We focused on a critical step of the partial nephrectomy procedure to provide proof of concept and demonstrate a minimum viable product for our augmented reality training system. The machine learning model was trained to determine application of a bulldog clamp to a blood vessel in order to advance curricular content. In our simulation prototype, the participating user must place the surgical clamp correctly on the artery and not the renal vein or ureter. Instead of simple binary classification between success and no success, the computer determined one of four states based on the object clamped (off or no-clamp, and clamp on vein, artery, or ureter) to simulate real circumstances, provide appropriate instructions and track errors committed. Using machine learning to determine users progress allows the system to provide accurate real-time instruction and also permits objective assessment of performance for grading.</p> <p>The output from the machine learning model is delivered to a secondary software element called Workflow Automation (WA). The WA uses the Unity gaming engine and provides decision tree processing that decides which instruction to display to the user. For our generalized system, each type of procedure has a unique Surgical Training Scenario (STS) that is built with specific curricular content for the particular training scenario. Based on the machine learning output, the WA displays appropriate User Interface (UI) prompts and training material through our custom AR glasses. The Workflow Automation software effectively provides a simple approach for non-technical users to generate their own procedures and have full access to its technical capabilities.</p> <p>We initially attempted to use off the shelf augmented reality headset to run our educational system. We ran into several issues including cumbersome USB driver, limited field of view and insufficient computing power.
