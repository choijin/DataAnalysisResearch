<AbstractNarration>This project funds a three day conference to be held in August, 2019 in Philadelphia, PA. The goal is to improve an understanding of the role of equity and well-being across the urban-rural gradient. The event will develop new models of knowledge development among researchers, communities, industry, practitioners, and government to understand interactions and feedback mechanisms between infrastructure and surrounding environmental, economic, and social systems. The conference focuses on the Philadelphia metropolitan region to ground the discussion because it provides a compelling site as one of the most populous, oldest, and poorest cities in the US. The conference also considers the scalability of the research frameworks and models to other cities and regions in the US and globally. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to improve urban sustainability which will save lives and economic losses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference assembles 40 individuals including academics (with interdisciplinary research expertise on sustainability in Philadelphia and beyond), representatives from local government, nonprofit and community  organizations (environment, regional planning, education). The results will be disseminated to a broad group of stakeholders through the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, the Franklin Institute Science Museum, Planet Philadelphia radio show and podcast, and the publication of a special issue in the Current Opinions in Environmental Sustainability&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this project was to bring together multiple stakeholders from academia, municipalities, industry, and non-profit and community organizations to discuss how infrastructure shapes equity and well-being across the urban-rural gradient for Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS) in the Philadelphia metropolitan region.  The objectives of the workshop were to:                              Identify      methodological challenges and data gaps and develop new conceptual      frameworks and research questions for a convergence science of equity and      well-being for SUS across the urban-rural gradient.                                                   Identify      challenges and develop new models of co-production of actionable knowledge      for SUS.                                                             Determine      the scalability of the conceptual frameworks developed in the Philadelphia      metropolitan area to other cities and regions in the US and      globally.           The workshop consisted of a combination of formal presentations, a keynote address, panel discussions, and breakout group discussions. Each day addressed one of the workshop objectives and advanced a research agenda about how infrastructure shapes equity and well-being across the urban rural gradient. The workshop concluded with a positive outlook on the future of the development of a science of equity and well-being across the urban-rural gradient. Recurring themes that we will center future work around and continue to elaborate on are:  How to      create and evaluate models for knowledge co-production: Participants      agreed that co-production of knowledge (between academic researchers,      policymakers, educators, and nonprofit workers, etc.) must be a priority      for developing a science of equity and well-being across the urban-rural      gradient.

How to      bring analysis of health into infrastructure research: Participants      discovered that there is very little research that looks at the impacts of      specific infrastructures on health outcomes and proposed that this should be      a key area of future research. Possible      re-conceptualizations of the urban-rural gradient: Participants      debated the usefulness of the concept of ?urban-rural gradient? and      whether the terms ?mosaic? or ?network? might be more accurate.

The academics included women and underrepresented groups at all stages of careers (faculty at all ranks, post-docs, and graduate students). The practitioners that served on the Organizing Committee and attended the workshop represented a diverse group in terms of gender and race. Additionally, there were representatives from environmental and social justice organizations who are members of communities that are historically disenfranchised.  The broader impacts of the workshop include:   Dissemination      of the outcomes to a broader group of stakeholders through the Franklin      Institute Science Museum, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning      Association, the Planet Philadelphia radio show and podcast, and the      development of journal publications. Building      a transdisciplinary conceptualization of issues related to infrastructure,      well-being, and equity that can serve as an initial model for broader      applications in the NE region and globally. Influencing      policymakers to use a broader understanding of equity in their planning      activities for sustainable infrastructural development.
