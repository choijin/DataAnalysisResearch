<AbstractNarration>This travel award will provide support for six early career scientists from the U.S. to attend an international Chapman conference on Arctic magmatism. The purpose of the conference is to synthesize understanding of geology and geophysics of the Arctic Ocean and the surrounding continents and to identify areas ripe for future research. To inform the broader scientific community, the organizers will publish a white paper summarizing these points and also will hold a post-conference session at the American Geophysical Union's Fall 2020 meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project ensures early career scientists from the U.S. will be able to participate in an upcoming AGU Chapman Conference in Selfoss, Iceland, Large-scale Volcanism in the Arctic: The Role of the Mantle and Tectonics. It will focus on five themes: 1) Pre-breakup rifting; 2) seafloor spreading; 3) mantle-derived heterogeneity (including plumes and large-igneous provinces); 4) subduction related volcanism; and 5) High Arctic Large Igneous Province and environmental effects extending from the Paleozoic to the present day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
