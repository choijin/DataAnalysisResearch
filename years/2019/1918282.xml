<AbstractNarration>The management of social differences within and across human collectives has posed unique challenges for policymaking and civic participation. Socially constructed ideas about difference continue to exert a powerful influence on how individuals interact. However, although social scientists and historians have connected notions of alterity to events and processes in the historical past, few empirical studies have paid attention to how everyday actors themselves participate in making links between identity and history over the course of daily social life. Accordingly, this research project asks how the ordinary experience of temporal change or continuity shape ideas about cultural and national identity, and how these shifting notions of individual and collective identity in turn impact the cultural significance of historical narratives. This project, which trains a student in methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, conducts a case study of informal economic site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral student Jesus Gutierrez, supervised by Charles Briggs at the University of California-Berkeley, will explore how notions of social difference are mediated by conceptions of temporality, memory, and history. The research will take place in southern Brazil, an ideal site as this is a context where ideas about race have been pronounced in informing public attitudes toward national belonging and local history. As a case study, the research will be focused around a network of artists who work across a variety of popular and outsider art forms in the city of Porto Alegre. Through research methods that include participant observation, media and document analysis, network mapping, and ethnographic interviews, the researcher will examine both the significance of race and the emergence of historical elements in each artist's craft and social life. Through extended ethnographic engagement with proximate audiences, customers and government officials, he will determine how the circulation of artworks and performances participates in shifting perceptions of racial and national identity that reach far beyond the individual and the local. Findings from this research will advance scientific and popular understandings of the relationship between history, race and national identity, and it will contribute to the production of more precise theories about the historical and socio-political significance of folk art forms around the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
