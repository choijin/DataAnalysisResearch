<AbstractNarration>Research studies do contain errors, but reproducibility problems in research cannot always be explained as a function of innocent human errors. The reasons likely range from mistakes in daily research practice to misconduct and fraud. Better ethics education is one mechanism that can lead to better conduct in science. Mandatory courses such as “Responsible Conduct of Research” (RCR) serve to teach topics in the field of science ethics and integrity at most institutions. Much has been published on improving the pedagogy of research ethics education, however, many RCR courses still focus on describing flawless ethical practice on the one hand and denouncing cases of outright misconduct or fraud on the other. The large grey zone in between, the so-called questionable research practices (QRPs) are rarely taught in a formal manner. Yet they play an important role for ethical decision making in day-to-day scientific practice. This National Science Foundation Innovation in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the Johns Hopkins University will fill that critical gap in graduate research ethics education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this award, the RCR course that is currently offered at Johns Hopkins will be supplemented with an established, online learning module on principles and applications in scientific error analysis with a focus on QRPs, which has been tested in a low-enrollment setting.  The Rigorous, Responsible and Reproducible Practice in Science and Engineering (R3ISE) module utilizes a novel error analysis and quality-improvement approach. The goal of this research comprises assessing the learning outcomes of the R3ISE module in a large and diverse student population across the life, natural, and social sciences, as well as engineering and technology. The study will appraise students’ critical thinking, scientific reasoning and collaborative communication skills around analyzing and avoiding scientific errors in general and QRPs. The R3ISE module is a collaborative, staged case study approach enhanced by illustrative practitioner interviews, that advances students in interdisciplinary groups from the learning level of recognizing QRPs in retracted articles to the level of evaluatively reviewing preprints. Sustained reasoning and communication skills are practiced and reinforced in annual workshops including poster competitions and preprint journal clubs. Using historic controls for comparison, researchers will test the hypothesis that the implementation of the R3ISE online companion module on scientific error analysis and reduction methods will influence students’ conceptual understanding, application, and evaluation skills of QRPs. A mixed-methods design will yield quantitative and qualitative data from concept inventories, checklists on case study analyses, descriptive rubrics on reviewing performance and structured observation guides on poster and preprint presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
