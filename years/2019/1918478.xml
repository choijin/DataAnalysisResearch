<AbstractNarration>This award will partially support the 2019 Interior of the Earth Gordon Research Conference (GRC). The GRC is the 12th in a series of Interior of the Earth conferences that focus on the structure, dynamics and evolution of the Earth's interior. The PIs have requested funds to help support travel costs of conference participants. The GRC will be held at Mt. Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts from June 2-6, 2017) and the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) from June 1-2, 2017 at the same venue. The GRS provides a unique environment for early-career individuals including students, post-docs, and early career faculty to present and exchange state of the art ideas and results. This support will help fund early career individuals to attend the GRS and GRC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Interior of the Earth GRC alternates between a deep and shallow focus, and the 2019 GRC meeting, which has a shallow focus, has the theme "Processes and Outcomes of Material Recycling Between Earth's Surface and Interior". The 2019 program will bring together scientists from a wide range of subdisciplines within Earth science, ranging from biogeochemistry, mineral physics, geophysics, geodynamics, geochemistry, geology, mineralogy, and planetary science, to address questions related to material recycling on Earth and other planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
