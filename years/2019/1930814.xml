<AbstractNarration>The 2019 ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SoCC) is the tenth in an established series of symposia that bring together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners interested in cloud computing. The SoCC is co-sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Groups on Management of Data (SIGMOD) and on Operating Systems (SIGOPS).  As the premier conference on cloud computing, and through the continuous efforts of the community, ACM SoCC is today a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction. In particular, the program includes research and industrial papers, poster sessions, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. The scope of SoCC is broad and encompasses diverse data management and systems topics, such as software as a service, virtualization, scalable cloud data services, and data management and analytics at scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To increase participation from a diverse array of students, the funds through this grant will assist approximately 25 US-based graduate students to attend the 2019 ACM SoCC.  The conference provides a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research works with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry. The conference also offers an excellent environment for participants (especially students) to interact with industry (such as such as Oracle, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Salesforce, VMWare, and Facebook, and others) leaders during regular program sessions. These opportunities will have a long-lasting impact on the future career of the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
