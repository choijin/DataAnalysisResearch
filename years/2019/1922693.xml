<AbstractNarration>The University of Hawaii requests $501,697 for the purchase, fabrication, and installation of a CTD winch for the Research Vessel Kilo Moana.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is providing funding for an accompanying launch and recovery system (LARS).  The Kilo Moana is a general-purpose research vessel operated under a charter party agreement with ONR as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF) which is supported by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). Ship time is made available to academic researchers funded by the NSF, ONR, NOAA, NASA, and other federal and state agencies. The R/V Kilo Moana conducts a substantial portion of CTD operations in deep water, up to 6,000 meters depth in the mid-Pacific Ocean.  These operations require a safe, efficient, and reliable means for transporting the CTD rosette from the deck of the ship into the water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by NSF/GEO/OCE/IPS and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A modern research vessel requires a variety of dedicated equipment to support investigations at sea.  One of the fundamental operations aboard the R/V Kilo Moana is the need to conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) casts.  This done by deploying electronic sensors that measure fundamental ocean water properties, lowering those sensors to near the seabed and then recovering them back aboard ship.  This results in a profile of measurements from the water surface, to depth and then back to the surface.  Some of these water properties include conductivity (a function of salinity), temperature, pressure (a function of depth), and oxygen content.  These data are telemetered to the ship via an electrically conductive cable.  In addition to collecting these data, water samples are also collected at partucular depths and is used to conduct physical biological, chemical and microbial oceanographic investigations.    This grant provided funds to purchase a new oceanographic winch that was installed aboard the R/V Kilo Moana so that it can more efficiently conduct CTD casts.  One of the important features of this winch is that it can automatically compensate for the ship?s heave, or linear motion up and down, caused by waves passing underneath the ship.  In order to safely conduct CTD casts the tension of the cable must be kept within acceptable limits and the winch?s ability to compensate for the ship?s heave helps to minimize spikes in the cable tension.  Bad weather often results in higher wave action and the winch?s ability to compensate for heave results in less tension on the cable and thus increases the ship?s ability to safely conduct CTD casts as the weather deteriorates.
