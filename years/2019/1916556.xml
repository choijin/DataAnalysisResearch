<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Building on the success of previous sustainability-themed MRS meeting symposia, Symposium ES13 will encourage an integrated approach toward the importance of considering sustainability in the development of materials and will provide a medium for technically based, interdisciplinary discussions of core materials technologies and their connection with societal, ecological, and economic drivers.  MRS has scheduled a two-day symposium and poster session (morning of April 23 through afternoon of April 24, 2019) that will illuminate the path toward sustainable development of materials.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  This new Materials Selection and Design (ES13) symposium will address the fundamental research challenges associated with properly understanding, assessing and reducing the materials footprint of current products and commodities that drive our economy and meet the needs of humanity. The symposium will provide a platform for materials researchers and related interdisciplinary experts from industry, academia, and government to present research on sustainable materials development from a life cycle and design perspective, including topics on sustainability-focused materials selection and design tools; data needs, collection and&lt;br/&gt;management; and incentivizing change to promote sustainable materials development and integrated research to move toward a circular economy. Twelve invited speakers, who are world leaders in sustainable materials development and represent industry, academia and nongovernmental organizations from around the world, will be giving presentations at the symposium.  One of the symposium sessions will include a provocative 1-hour panel discussion and a joint session with Symposium ES14: Materials Circular Economy for Urban Sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, the funds supported an additional symposium and tutorial session at the 2021 MRS (Virtual) Spring meeting: Symposium BI01, "Incorporating Sustainability into Materials Science Education, Training and Public Outreach," and Tutorial BI01, "Industry's Current Approaches to Sustainable Practices and Strategic Planning for a Sustainable Future." The FoS subcommittee has provided support in the development of these activities. This grant provided funds to support travel and registration expenses for speakers and participants at these events. The presenters were all well-known experts in the field of sustainable development of materials. They practice in this field of discovery and knowledge creation, as scholars and scientists. These symposia and the ancillary activities advanced the field of sustainable development of materials by giving these experts the opportunity to share their discoveries, and for the audience to learn more about this area of scholarship.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/08/2021<br>      Modified by: Julie&nbsp;M&nbsp;Schoenung</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916556/1916556_10594440_1625701861607_IMG_9280--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916556/1916556_10594440_1625701861607_IMG_9280--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MRS Public Outreach Center and Focus on Sustainability Banner"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916556/1916556_10594440_1625701861607_IMG_9280--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MRS Public Outreach Center and Focus on Sustainability Banner"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Focus on Sustainability Subcommittee members Richard Souza, Isabel Gessner and David Graff volunteer at the Public Outreach Center, providing hands on demonstrations and educational activities to educators, scientists and students.</div> <div class="imageCredit">MRS Staff Photographer</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Julie&nbsp;M&nbsp;Schoenung</div> <div class="imageTitle">MRS Public Outreach Center and Focus on Sustainability Banner</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916556/1916556_10594440_1625697395650_DSC02920--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1916556/1916556_10594440_1625697395650_DSC02920--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2019 MRS Spring Meeting &amp;
