<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award will fund 15 US students attending the 18th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2019), held in Auckland, New Zealand from October 26 to 30, 2019. ISWC is the premier international forum for state-of-the-art research on all aspects of the Semantic Web - the next generation World Wide Web. Student Fellowships will help cover the travel costs for US students, making it possible for them to attend the conference and discuss and disseminate their work. They will also provide an opportunity for them to interact with future national and international scientific collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Semantic Web Conference, which is now in its seventeenth year, is an interdisciplinary conference that includes work on Data Management, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation, and Reasoning, Ontologies and Ontology Languages, Semantic Web Engineering, Linked Data, User Interfaces, and Applications. It regularly has several hundred attendees. In addition to the main technical tracks, the conference includes a variety of events that provide opportunities for more in-depth interaction amongst researchers at different institutions who are at various stages of their research careers, and researchers who are interested in many different aspects of Semantic Web Research. Students benefit from the Doctoral Consortium - a full day event where students can get critical, but encouraging, feedback on their work from senior members of the community. They also benefit from the career mentoring lunch, where experienced members of the community from both academia and industry answer questions in an informal setting. For further information see the conference web site at: http://iswc2019.semanticweb.org&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The 2019 edition of the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) took place in Auckland, New Zealand.</p> <p>The selection was carried out by the conference student coordinators, Oshani Seneviratne (RPI, US) and Bruce Chiu-Wing Sham (The University of Auckland, New Zealand). Students had to submit their information such as University, program, undergrad/grad, whether they had a paper at the conference/related workshop, whether they had any funding from their University, and total funds requested.&nbsp; We also collected letters of recommendation from their advisors. We ranked students based on their participation at the conference. First, students with a full paper at the conference were given the highest priority. Second, students with a paper at a workshop or a proposal at the doctoral consortium were considered. Third, students with a poster were considered. Also, special consideration was given to first-time attendees from minority groups with no funding from their academic institutions. The top students based on this categorization were awarded their travel costs.&nbsp; We supported six graduate students to attend the conference and thus submit and present their research. Out of the six students, three students had a paper in the main conference, and the other three had papers in one or more of the associated ISWC workshops.</p> <p>The following list details the awardees' names, their organizations, the initial amount awarded, and the final disbursed amount.</p> <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="606"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="144" valign="top"> <p><strong>Name</strong></p> </td> <td width="276" valign="top"> <p><strong>Institute</strong></p> </td> <td width="90" valign="top"> <p><strong>Amount Awarded</strong></p> </td> <td width="96" valign="top"> <p><strong>Amount Disbursed</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="144" valign="top"> <p>Steven Haussmann</p> </td> <td width="276" valign="top"> <p>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</p> </td> <td width="90" valign="top"> <p>$3000</p> </td> <td width="96" valign="top"> <p>$3308.91</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="144" valign="top"> <p>Majid Ghasemig Gol</p> </td> <td width="276" valign="top"> <p>University of Southern California</p> </td> <td width="90" valign="top"> <p>$2500</p> </td> <td width="96" valign="top"> <p>$2401.29</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="144" valign="top"> <p>Cogan Shimizu</p> </td> <td width="276" valign="top"> <p>Wright State University</p> </td> <td width="90" valign="top"> <p>$2500</p> </td> <td width="96" valign="top"> <p>$2459.53</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="144" valign="top"> <p>Ismini Lourentzou</p> </td> <td width="276" valign="top"> <p>University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign</p> </td> <td width="90" valign="top"> <p>$2500</p> </td> <td width="96" valign="top"> <p>$2631.22</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="144" valign="top"> <p>Avijit Thawani</p> </td> <td width="276" valign="top"> <p>University of Southern California</p> </td> <td width="90" valign="top"> <p>$2000</p> </td> <td width="96" valign="top"> <p>$2055.45</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="144" valign="top"> <p>Binh Vu</p> </td> <td width="276" valign="top"> <p>University of Southern California</p> </td> <td width="90" valign="top"> <p>$2000</p> </td> <td width="96" valign="top"> <p>$2012.63</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Two students (who are not on the list above) were awarded $3000 and $2500, respectively. Unfortunately, they did not travel to the conference due to visa issues and the inability to secure the remaining funds for their travel. Regrettably, they did not inform us about their absence from the conference in advance to reallocate the funds to other students.</p> <p>The students who attended the conference using the travel award had an excellent experience.</p> <p>There were two events at ISWC explicitly designed for Ph.D. students, the Doctoral Consortium and Mentoring lunch.</p> <p>The ISWC Doctoral Consortium is a full-day event that takes place before the main conference. Students receive feedback on their research from mentors who are senior members of the Semantic Web research community. Students also learn about academic and research careers, build relationships with other Semantic Web Ph.D. students from around the world and senior colleagues, and gain experience in presenting papers and formulate research questions.</p> <p>The ISWC Career Mentoring Lunch is an essential complement to the doctoral Consortium and is explicitly geared to students and early-career researchers. In 2019, 31 students (including the 6 who were awarded the travel grant from US institutions) signed up to attend the mentoring lunch. The mentorship lunch organizers, who also handled the travel awards, made a particular effort to recruit mentors from academia and industry and ensure gender diversity among the mentors. There were 22 mentors at the mentoring lunch. The high number of mentors invited allowed the students to have one-on-one conversations with the community's senior members. Among them were very senior members of the ISWC community such as Prof. James A. Hendler, as well as scholars from premier academic institutions such as Stanford University, University of Manchester, University of Liverpool, The Alan Turing Institute, The Open University UK, University Of Zurich, Linkping University, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, University of Innsbruck, STI Innsbruck, Australian National University, Universidad de Chile, and from industrial semantic web powerhouses such as IBM Research, and Google AI. Several photos from the mentoring lunch are attached to this report.</p> <p>The US-based student participants supported by this NSF travel grant were extremely appreciative of the financial support received. Many noted that travel support had allowed them to share their research ideas in a critical yet supportive environment. Without this funding, many of the students would have been unable to travel to ISWC 2019 due to the high cost of traveling to the conference's location (Auckland, New Zealand). The students supported by the grant contributed various papers to the different tracks of the conferences and the workshops, thereby making ISWC 2019 a success. This travel grant also allowed participants to interact with senior researchers through various activities to improve their research and communication skills. Students who attended and presented their work were able to gain experience presenting their work, reacting to questions, and discussing their's and other research with the leading Semantic Web researchers.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/26/2020<br>      Modified by: Oshani&nbsp;W&nbsp;Seneviratne</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1934240/1934240_10637023_1606431892728_IMG_0361--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1934240/1934240_10637023_1606431892728_IMG_0361--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1934240/1934240_10637023_1606431892728_IMG_0361--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch</div> <div class="imageCredit">Oshani Seneviratne</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Oshani&nbsp;W&nbsp;Seneviratne</div> <div class="imageTitle">ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1934240/1934240_10637023_1606431943035_IMG_3121--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1934240/1934240_10637023_1606431943035_IMG_3121--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1934240/1934240_10637023_1606431943035_IMG_3121--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch</div> <div class="imageCredit">Oshani Seneviratne</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Oshani&nbsp;W&nbsp;Seneviratne</div> <div class="imageTitle">ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1934240/1934240_10637023_1606431831145_IMG_4316--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1934240/1934240_10637023_1606431831145_IMG_4316--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1934240/1934240_10637023_1606431831145_IMG_4316--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch</div> <div class="imageCredit">Oshani Seneviratne</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Oshani&nbsp;W&nbsp;Seneviratne</div> <div class="imageTitle">ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1934240/1934240_10637023_1606432100904_IMG_3221--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1934240/1934240_10637023_1606432100904_IMG_3221--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1934240/1934240_10637023_1606432100904_IMG_3221--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch</div> <div class="imageCredit">Oshani Seneviratne</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Oshani&nbsp;W&nbsp;Seneviratne</div> <div class="imageTitle">ISWC 2019 Mentoring Lunch</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
