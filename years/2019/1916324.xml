<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $5,000 are requested for Scholarships to cover the registration fees and travel of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, attending the two day Division of Polymer Physics of the American Physical Society workshop on ?X-ray and Neutron Scattering for Polymer Science? to be held on March 2-3, 2019, in Boston MA in conjunction with the annual APS March meeting (March4-8, 2019). The Course will provide an overview of scattering techniques that probe the structure and dynamics of polymers. It will also highlight ways to integrate scattering data with molecular simulations and microscopy, as well as approaches to manage the large data sets typical of scattering measurements. The majority of attendees at the workshop are expected to be graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The 2019 APS DPOLY short course introduced X-ray and Neutron Scattering to 50 participants, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, scientists from national labs, and industry scientists, in addition to nine speakers and one organizer. The short course was organized by Gila Stein from the University of Tennessee. Funds from NSF were used to support student attendance at the conference by reimbursing the short course registration fee. The curriculum included the following topics, with presenters noted in parentheses: Small angle scattering (Karen Winey, Mark Dadmun), Reflectivity (David Bucknall), Grazing Incidence X-ray Scattering (Eva Herzig), Soft X-ray Scattering and Reflectivity (Dean DeLongchamp, Eliot Gann), X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (Sunil Sinha), Neutron Spin Echo (Rana Ashkar), Machine learning/big data (Alex Hexemer), and Quasielastic Neutron Scattering (Chris Soles). The presenters reflect the growing diversity of the DPOLY community, including three women, one early career faculty, and two international scientists. Course materials were distributed to all participants via a shared Google drive (presentations for each module, prepared by the speakers). A related symposium was held during the APS meeting that highlighted the research of several course instructors (Mark Dadmun, Eva Herzig, David Bucknall, and Rana Ashkar). Both the short course and related symposium were well received and well attended.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/03/2020<br>      Modified by: Gila&nbsp;E&nbsp;Stein</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
