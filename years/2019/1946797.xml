<AbstractNarration>This grant will support the Environmental Sciences: Water Gordon Research Conference at Holderness, New Hampshire. The theme of the conference is Innovative Science for the Grand Challenges in the Aquatic Environmental Sciences. The week-long conference will focus on sustainable water quality under stress from global change, fate and transport of persistent chemicals in the environment, and data science innovations to improve water quality. Benefits to both human and ecological health will result from the focus on improving water quality. The immersive format of the conference will facilitate networking and collaborative exchange among participants. The development of the next generation of environmental science leaders will be fostered through interactions with leading researchers in academia, industry, and government. Diversity and inclusion of the discipline will be enhanced through scholarships for attendees from underrepresented groups. Educational and career development success will be assessed by surveys of all participants at the end of the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to support the Environmental Sciences: Water Gordon Research Conference, to be held June 27-July 3, 2020 in Holderness, New Hampshire. The 2020 conference theme is Innovative Science for the Grand Challenges in the Aquatic Environmental Sciences and will feature a program of thought-provoking research that strives to address today's most pressing environmental challenges. The conference will focus on 1) Sustainable water quality under stress from global change, 2) Exposures and effects of persistent chemicals in the environment, and 3) Technological and data science innovations to improve water quality. Benefits to both human and ecological health will result from the focus on improving water quality. Such solutions rely on research at the intersections of traditional disciplines. These efforts will be fostered by bringing together 190 participants to discuss cutting-edge water quality science. The immersive format enables meaningful networking and collaborative exchange of ideas between conference participants. Student and post-doctoral research trainees will be fully engaged in this immersive scientific conference. Their development as researchers will be fostered through interactions with leading researchers in academia, industry, and government. All invited presenters will be first time speakers at the meeting to develop the next generation of environmental science leaders. The meeting will foster diversity and inclusion in the discipline through scholarships for attendees from underrepresented groups. The success and impacts of the conference will be gauged by surveys of all participants at the end of the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
