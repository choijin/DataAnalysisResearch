<AbstractNarration>This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) grant will explore the effects of varying ambient conditions on microplasma discharge for accelerating the pace of microplasma discharge device-based system development. Microplasma discharge devices, which are based on non-thermal or cold plasmas, have been receiving growing interest for various applications in the food, biomedical and health care industries. The performance of the devices is dependent on a stable and uniform microplasma discharge. To maintain a uniform distribution of microplasma discharge, the devices are often operated with high input voltages along with the use of inert gases such as argon, neon, helium, xenon and nitrogen. However, the use of high voltages and inert gases are a safety hazard and prohibits the development of portable microplasma discharge devices. To overcome these limitations, the microplasma discharge devices are operated in controlled environments and specialized chambers, under stable atmospheric conditions, thus making the systems complex, bulky, non-portable and expensive. Even though novel microplasma discharge devices that operate in atmospheric air can be developed to address these drawbacks, the devices are exposed to varying ambient conditions including dynamic temperature, pressure and humidity changes. This further multiplies the challenges associated with the development of optimum microplasma discharge devices because of the changes in electron density, electron mobility and electron temperature due to the varying ambient conditions. The EAGER grant is used for developing a deep understanding of the microplasma discharge dynamics such as electron density, electron mobility and electron temperature under varying ambient conditions. The research has the potential to advance the development of adaptive control systems for microplasma discharge devices. This could have a profound technological and economic impact on the emerging flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) and wearable biomedical industries. The results obtained from this project will be disseminated through research publications in peer reviewed journals as well as in presentations at regional, national and international conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research under this EAGER grant aims to radically reduce the risk associated in developing novel microplasma discharge devices and study the microplasma discharge performance that has not been investigated before. Numerical two-dimensional fluid simulations and finite element analysis will be performed to model the microplasma dynamics of different microplasma discharge device configurations with varying electrode designs, electrode gaps and overall device dimensions, at varying ambient conditions. The results will enable optimization of the microplasma discharge device parameters for consistent electron density and electron mobility. This will facilitate uniform voltage distribution across the surface of the electrodes resulting in uniform generation of microplasma discharge. The dielectric barrier discharge and breakdown voltage analysis will be performed on the optimized electrode configuration to understand the optimum breakdown voltage required for microplasma discharge. Finite element modelling and simulations of the microplasma discharge dynamics such as electron density, electron mobility and electron temperature will be completed for varying ambient temperature, pressure and humidity. The results will be utilized to generate a detailed database that can be used for designing and fabricating novel microplasma discharge devices which can be integrated with adaptive control systems for the development of novel microplasma discharge device based systems. The fundamental breakthroughs from this research will eliminate the risks associated with optimizing microplasma discharge devices for applications such as sterilization, wound disinfection and surface treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The red dotted circle indicates the perimeter of petri dishes, to illustrate the coverage of each designed MDD. 2D simulation in COMSOL Multiphysics was performed using magnetic and electric field modules. An input voltage of 2000V at 20kHz was applied to the terminal electrode and the voltage distribution across the different electrode designs to sterilize the surface of petri dishes were simulated (Fig.2). The honeycomb-structured MDD not only has uniform voltage distribution across the terminal electrode, but it also improves the scalability over the other patterned MDDs and provides relatively large microplasma discharge area.</p> <p class="Abstract"><strong>Input Voltage - Electron Density and Electron Temperature</strong></p> <p class="Text">Electric potential distribution across the terminal electrode, dielectric and ground electrode was varied from 1500V to 3500V (Fig.3(a) and (b)), respectively. For varying voltages from 1500V to 3500V, maximum electron temperature decreased from 4.39eV, to 4.08eV, respectively. Similarly, maximum electron density per cubic meter increased from 1.21x10<sup>13</sup> to 2.01x10<sup>14</sup>. From Fig.3(c), it was observed that the electron temperature is inversely proportional to electron density. In addition, the breakdown voltage for 200&mu;m dielectric was observed at &asymp;2000V. If the voltage distribution across the electrodes is uniform and above the breakdown voltage (2000V) of the dielectric layer, uniform microplasma can be generated across the surface of MDD.</p> <p class="Abstract"><strong>Dielectric Thickness - Electron Density and Electron Temperature</strong></p> <p class="Text">The dielectric thickness was varied from 100&mu;m to 300&mu;m with 2000V at terminal electrode (under 300K and (1atm) (Fig.4). As the dielectric thickness increased from 100&mu;m to 300&mu;m, the maximum electron temperature decreased from 5.95eV to 3.59eV, and the electron density per cubic meter increased from 0.01x10<sup>14</sup> to 1.79x10<sup>14</sup>, respectively. For a constant voltage at the terminal electrode, the dielectric thickness of a device is inversely proportional to electric field. The electric field is directly proportional to the drift velocity of the electrons, and the drift velocity in turn is proportional to the square root of electron temperature. The electrode gap distance is inversely proportional to the to the electron temperature and directly proportional to the electron density. Therefore, to achieve similar levels of plasma discharge for increased dielectric thickness, a higher voltage needs to be applied at the terminal electrode to increase the electron temperature. However, if input voltage is kept constant as the dielectric thickness increases, then the voltage at the terminal electrode will not be enough to breakdown and dissociate the discharge media, thereby limiting the generation of microplasma.</p> <p class="Abstract"><strong>Electrode Thickness - Electron Density and Electron Temperature</strong></p> <p class="Text">Similarly, the effect of varying electrode thickness (100&mu;m to 300&mu;m) on electron temperature and electron density was investigated with 2000V at terminal electrode under 300K and 1atm (Fig.5(a-e)). For increasing electrode thickness, the maximum electron temperature increased from 4.06eV to 4.41eV, respectively. Similarly, electron density increased from 2.28x10<sup>14</sup>m<sup>-3</sup> to 0.11x10<sup>14</sup>m<sup>-3</sup>. The electron temperature is directly proportional to the electrode thickness and, electron density is inversely proportional to the electrode thickness. If the electrode is too thick, the voltage drop across the electrode will be higher and this will result in lower voltages (less than breakdown voltage in the discharge medium) across the dielectric. Therefore, the choice of electrode thickness is an important parameter for microplasma discharge.</p> <p class="Abstract"><strong>Ambient Temperature and Pressure - Electron Density and Electron Mobility</strong></p> <p class="Text">Figure 6(a) shows the effect of varying ambient temperature on electron density and mobility. The electrode and dielectric thickness were fixed at 200&mu;m with 2000V at terminal electrode. It was observed that the electron density and mobility varied from 2.03x10<sup>14</sup>m<sup>-3</sup> to 4.54x10<sup>13</sup>m<sup>-3</sup> and 0.14[m<sup>2</sup>/(V.s)] to 0.19[m<sup>2</sup>/(V.s)], respectively, as the ambient temperature increased from 250K to 350K, at 1 atm. As the atmospheric temperature decreases, the electron mobility decreases and electron density increases, thereby decreasing the electron temperature and vice-versa. Therefore, at lower ambient temperature, the input voltage supply must be increased to maintain constant electron temperature. Similarly, Fig.6(b) shows the effect of varying ambient pressure on electron density and mobility. It was observed that the electron density and mobility varied from 9.64x10<sup>13</sup>m<sup>-3</sup> to 2.64x10<sup>14</sup>m<sup>-3</sup> and 0.23[m<sup>2</sup>/(V.s)] to 0.15[m<sup>2</sup>/(V.s)], respectively, as the ambient temperature increased from 0.7atm to 1.1atm, at 300K. The results indicate that the electron density is inversely proportional to electron mobility for varying atmospheric pressure conditions. When the atmospheric pressure increases, the electron mobility reduces, thereby reducing the electron temperature. To maintain the electron temperature constant, the input voltage can be increased, which would also increase the collisional energy transfer between electrons and background gas. Therefore, it can be concluded that the change in electron density and mobility due to variations in the ambient conditions will have a direct effect on the microplasma discharge, influencing the sterilization efficacy of the MDD towards harmful pathogens.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/30/2021<br>      Modified by: Massood&nbsp;Z&nbsp;Atashbar</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1917144/1917144_10604650_1627667089525_NSFEAGERProjectOutcomesReport_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1917144/1917144_10604650_1627667089525_NSFEAGERProjectOutcomesReport_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1917144/1917144_10604650_1627667089525_NSFEAGERProjectOutcomesReport_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Comb (a)(b), H-tree (c)(d), and honeycomb (e)(f) structured microplasma discharge device for 35 mm and 100 mm diameter standard petri dish, respectively.

The red dotted circle indicates the perimeter of petri dishes, to illustrate the coverage of each designed MDD. 2D simulation in COMSOL Multiphysics was performed using magnetic and electric field modules. An input voltage of 2000V at 20kHz was applied to the terminal electrode and the voltage distribution across the different electrode designs to sterilize the surface of petri dishes were simulated (Fig.2). The honeycomb-structured MDD not only has uniform voltage distribution across the terminal electrode, but it also improves the scalability over the other patterned MDDs and provides relatively large microplasma discharge area. Input Voltage - Electron Density and Electron Temperature Electric potential distribution across the terminal electrode, dielectric and ground electrode was varied from 1500V to 3500V (Fig.3(a) and (b)), respectively. For varying voltages from 1500V to 3500V, maximum electron temperature decreased from 4.39eV, to 4.08eV, respectively. Similarly, maximum electron density per cubic meter increased from 1.21x1013 to 2.01x1014. From Fig.3(c), it was observed that the electron temperature is inversely proportional to electron density. In addition, the breakdown voltage for 200&mu;m dielectric was observed at &asymp;2000V. If the voltage distribution across the electrodes is uniform and above the breakdown voltage (2000V) of the dielectric layer, uniform microplasma can be generated across the surface of MDD. Dielectric Thickness - Electron Density and Electron Temperature The dielectric thickness was varied from 100&mu;m to 300&mu;m with 2000V at terminal electrode (under 300K and (1atm) (Fig.4). As the dielectric thickness increased from 100&mu;m to 300&mu;m, the maximum electron temperature decreased from 5.95eV to 3.59eV, and the electron density per cubic meter increased from 0.01x1014 to 1.79x1014, respectively.

Electrode Thickness - Electron Density and Electron Temperature Similarly, the effect of varying electrode thickness (100&mu;m to 300&mu;m) on electron temperature and electron density was investigated with 2000V at terminal electrode under 300K and 1atm (Fig.5(a-e)). For increasing electrode thickness, the maximum electron temperature increased from 4.06eV to 4.41eV, respectively. Similarly, electron density increased from 2.28x1014m-3 to 0.11x1014m-3. The electron temperature is directly proportional to the electrode thickness and, electron density is inversely proportional to the electrode thickness. If the electrode is too thick, the voltage drop across the electrode will be higher and this will result in lower voltages (less than breakdown voltage in the discharge medium) across the dielectric. Therefore, the choice of electrode thickness is an important parameter for microplasma discharge. Ambient Temperature and Pressure - Electron Density and Electron Mobility Figure 6(a) shows the effect of varying ambient temperature on electron density and mobility. The electrode and dielectric thickness were fixed at 200&mu;m with 2000V at terminal electrode. It was observed that the electron density and mobility varied from 2.03x1014m-3 to 4.54x1013m-3 and 0.14[m2/(V.s)] to 0.19[m2/(V.s)], respectively, as the ambient temperature increased from 250K to 350K, at 1 atm. As the atmospheric temperature decreases, the electron mobility decreases and electron density increases, thereby decreasing the electron temperature and vice-versa. Therefore, at lower ambient temperature, the input voltage supply must be increased to maintain constant electron temperature. Similarly, Fig.6(b) shows the effect of varying ambient pressure on electron density and mobility. It was observed that the electron density and mobility varied from 9.64x1013m-3 to 2.64x1014m-3 and 0.23[m2/(V.s)] to 0.15[m2/(V.s)], respectively, as the ambient temperature increased from 0.7atm to 1.1atm, at 300K. The results indicate that the electron density is inversely proportional to electron mobility for varying atmospheric pressure conditions. When the atmospheric pressure increases, the electron mobility reduces, thereby reducing the electron temperature. To maintain the electron temperature constant, the input voltage can be increased, which would also increase the collisional energy transfer between electrons and background gas. Therefore, it can be concluded that the change in electron density and mobility due to variations in the ambient conditions will have a direct effect on the microplasma discharge, influencing the sterilization efficacy of the MDD towards harmful pathogens.
