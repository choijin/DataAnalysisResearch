<AbstractNarration>The award supports travel grants for students to attend 5th Career Workshop for Women and Minorities in Computer Architecture (CWWMCA-2019) to be held in Columbus, OH, USA, in conjunction with the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO). The Workshop for Women and Minorities in Computer Architecture provides a forum for sharing advanced academic and industrial research work focused on computer architecture and career development advice for women and minorities in academia, industrial and government labs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will cover a wide range of topics with leading experts in the filed attending MICRO as keynote speakers, invited talks and panel focused on career development for women and other minorities in the field of computer architecture. Students attending this event will be exposed to the latest developments in the field, as well as benefit from personal interactions in a small-group setting with leading researchers from the domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
