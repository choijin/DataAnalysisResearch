<AbstractNarration>The APQC workshop will help define Quantum Performance Assessment, an emerging research field that seeks answers to the overarching question "How do we assess, probe, measure, quantify, and report the quality or performance of quantum computational devices?". Experts from diverse subfields of physics, computer science, and quantum information will discuss aspects of quantum tomography, benchmarking, algorithms, compilation, hardware design, computational complexity, error correction, and experimental physics. The APQC scientific program will include talks in four areas of interest to quantum performance assessment: (i) Quantum characterization, verification, and validation, (ii) Quantum algorithms, (iii) Quantum error correction, (iv) Quantum "supremacy". Participants will share best practices, identify gaps in knowledge, and nucleate interdisciplinary collaborations to address challenge problems in quantum performance assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the objectives of two of 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments: "Quantum Leap" and "Growing Convergent Research at NSF". The 10 big ideas will push forward the frontiers of U.S. research, provide innovative approaches to solve some of the most pressing problems the world faces, as well as lead to discoveries not yet known. This project also advances objectives of the National Quantum Initiative (NQI), a coordinated multiagency program to support research and training in Quantum Information Science (QIS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the 1st Assessing Performance of Quantum Computers (APQC) workshop, held in Estes Park, CO from Sep 25-27, 2019.  APQC's goal -- which it achieved with flying colors -- was and is to encompass and help define a new emerging research field called quantum performance assessment.  This field is focused on the question "How can we evaluate as-built quantum computing devices and determine how well they work?"  Continued progress in experimental quantum computing hardware and software -- a major United States R&amp;D priority -- depends on progress in quantum performance assessment.  This emerging field has outgrown and outpaced its own community, and APQC was created to serve as a home and nucleate a community.  APQC attendees came from many subfields, including world-leading researchers in:   - quantum characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV)   - statistics   - quantum algorithms   - computer science and computational complexity   The workshop hosted 81 participants, even though planned participation was only 35-75 attendees, because there was overwhelming interest from the research community.  Almost half the participants were early career (students and postdocs), with a smattering of senior participants who were new to the field.  Roughly 35 of the participants were experienced senior scientists.  10 were women, and one was non-binary.  The workshop included 9 invited talks, 16 contributed talks, 2 panel discussions, 3 lunchtime "Perspective" talks by representatives from IARPA, DOE, and NIST, and a "Dinner with an Expert" event.  Post-workshop reviews were extremely positive.  The most common complaint was that despite the beautiful surroundings, there weren't enough opportunities for outdoor recreation because we had so many great talks!  Other than that, most of the 45 participants who responded were excited about the scientific content, the amount that they learned, the opportunities for networking, and the overall experience.
