<AbstractNarration>The American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) proposes to host a second convening of key stakeholders engaged in and committed to improving Computer Science education for Native students. The first convening, held in March of 2019, focused primarily on understanding challenges and identifying areas for improvement by convening a small group of stakeholders. Based on the responses of those participants, AISES proposes to advance the effort by engaging an expanded set of stakeholders to not only identify barriers but to begin developing solutions, building networks, and realizing resources both by connecting those with limited access and by creating new, more appropriate resources to meet the needs of Native students and Native-serving teachers and schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This second convening will take place October 13-14, 2019, immediately following the 2019 AISES National Conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. AISES will recruit convening attendees, targeting key stakeholders, previous attendees, and conducting outreach to its networks and extending invitations to partner networks. The objectives of the proposed convening are to: (1) expand the set of engaged participants to include additional teachers and administrators, representatives of CS education non-profit organizations, and other members of the tribal education community and (2) develop detailed plans of action and create a road map for implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
