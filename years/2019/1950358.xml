<AbstractNarration>REU Site: Ithaca College REU in Dynamical Systems. Each summer of 2021-2023, the Research Experience for Undergraduates at Ithaca College will support nine undergraduate students for eight and a half weeks in professional mathematical research in the field of dynamical systems.  Participants will engage in all aspects of the mathematics research process and will develop skills in mathematical and computational thinking, communication, problem-solving, and collaboration.  They will be provided with graduate support and mentoring to foster individual gains in competence and independence regarding research activities.  Mentors’ goals include harnessing students' strengths while addressing areas that could use improvement.  Specific training will be provided in computational simulation, data visualization, mathematical typesetting, and presentation of results.  The program will target students from historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and schools where student access to research opportunities is limited, such as community colleges and primarily undergraduate institutions.  Participants will work in groups of three on original research problems in three distinct areas of dynamical systems: species interactions across a spatially segregated environment, the dynamics of the trajectories of particle flows on surfaces of revolution, and topological structures of attractors on fractal trees.  The three projects are designed to be accessible to undergraduates with an intermediate background in mathematics, enabling them to explore the central questions of the projects while encouraging them to expand their knowledge in order to make progress.  Student groups will meet daily with mentors to determine the day’s research activities.  Each week students will attend faculty talks and gather for lunch with the mentors.  Throughout the summer, REU students will also have opportunities to network with approximately 60 Ithaca College students and their mentors who participate in annual summer research in an array of fields at Ithaca College.  Participants will be encouraged to present their research at a regional or national conference and will continue to be supported by their mentors after their summer experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research mentors have created research projects in the field of dynamical systems that are accessible to undergraduates with an intermediate background in mathematics (multivariate calculus and introductory linear algebra are prerequisites) to enable them to begin exploring immediately the central questions of the projects while requiring them to deepen their knowledge in order to make progress. The specific research topics include (1) the costly dispersal of species through fractured environments, (2) the dynamics of trajectories of particle flows on surfaces of revolution, and (3) the topological structure of attractors of pruned fractal trees.  The proposed REU projects will provide students opportunities to develop computer simulations, to visualize and analyze the associated data, and to improve on skills that are most in demand by employers, such as analytical thinking and innovation; creativity, originality, and initiative; technology design and programming; critical thinking, problem-solving, and analysis; work ethic; and oral/written communications.  This REU experience will provide students with a strong foundation for future graduate studies or employment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
