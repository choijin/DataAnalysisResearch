<AbstractNarration>This research is aimed at development of mathematical tools for understanding and predicting behavior of a variety of important and apparently dissimilar biological phenomena and sociological processes, such as the spread of diseases, ecological changes, or the distribution and prevention of crime. Some salient features of these diverse phenomena can be described by mathematical models based on reaction-advection-diffusion equations that have been used extensively to investigate fundamental and ubiquitous phenomena in several areas of biology, and more recently in the social sciences.  While these models are simplified versions of reality, their mathematical analysis has contributed to the understanding of many important phenomena. At the same time, the underlying equations can be extremely interesting and challenging from the mathematical point of view as their solutions can exhibit rich behaviors, e.g., pattern formation and traveling wave structures. The behavior of solutions reflects critical features of the system that mathematics models and have clear and convincing parallels with the evolution of real-world systems. However, there is still a large gap between real world systems and their more tractable mathematical models.  One of the goals of this project is bridging this gap through the use of accumulated concrete data and the corresponding calibration and modification of mathematical models.  Of particular importance is the analysis of systems which include heterogeneous environments, the understanding of the effects that non-local dispersal has on the behavior of the solutions, and the validation of these models with real-world data.  Efforts will be focused on four reaction-advection-diffusion systems where the heterogeneities are due to: climate change in an ecological context, non-local and asymmetrical spread of information in the context of riots, income heterogeneities in the context of social segregation, and environment heterogeneities due to specific concentrated inputs.  The primary goal of the project is to understand how heterogeneous environments and non-local dispersal impact solution patterns in both a general class of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations as well in specific ecological and social contexts.  Throughout this project the investigators will maintain and foster contacts with social scientists in order to conduct the much needed discourse between the mathematical theory and the applications.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on the development of an extensive theory for reaction-advection-diffusion systems in heterogeneous environments with applications in ecology and sociology.  In particular, the objective of this research is three-fold: to expand the current mathematical theory for local and non-local reaction-advection-diffusion systems in heterogeneous environments, to gain insight into various (ecological, sociological, and biological) complex systems by modeling them using these types of systems, and to  take an initial step toward bridging the gap between basic mathematical models and the complex real-world systems they aim to describe by incorporating the use of data. From the qualitative perspective, this work will be mainly concerned with exploring the effects that various dispersal mechanism have on the propagation (and lack thereof) of a solution in a heterogeneous environment: for example, determining the spreading speed, the existence of traveling wave solutions, pulsating fronts, traveling pulses, or generalized fronts in heterogeneous systems.  Additionally, the fundamental issues of the global well-posedness of solutions to these systems, intermediate and long-term asymptotics, and existence and uniqueness of non-trivial steady-state solutions will be rigorously analyzed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many wildly diverse complex systems, from different field, can be modeled within the framework of reaction-advection-diffusion equations.  These seemingly simple models can have an incredibly complex and rich mathematical structure and have already proved to be great tools for exploration.  The universality of processes that fall within this framework makes any theory developed for such models far reaching.  Two important aspects to consider when modeling certain complex systems are non-local dispersal and spatial heterogeneities.  We can incorporate these aspects into models within the reaction-advection-diffusion framework, bringing us two steps closer to reality, at the expense of adding mathematical complications.  The work funded by this grant set out to expand the mathematical theory of non-local reaction-advection-diffusion equations in heterogeneous environments. In particular, the goal was to push the theory in directions that were driven by particular applications in ecology and sociology.  Our work brought understanding of how different reaction terms affect the propagation of solutions in a medium that has a gap, which prevents propagation, under classical diffusion.  This has applications in criminology, the propagation of signals in neurons, and invasions of species.  We have also pushed some of these results to consider what changes when the dispersal is non-local.  Furthermore, we proved a maximum principle for non-local diffusion equations when the medium is allowed to have jump discontinuities.  In this work we were also able to model social outbursts of activity, such as rioting, and to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of the propagation of the activity.  Additionally, we were also able to develop new, more realistic, models for plant dynamics and other phenomena when birth and dispersal cannot be separated into two distinct processes.  This is a perfect example of how moving towards more realistic models can lead to the need of the development of new mathematical theory.  Another objective of the work funded by this grant was to verify the models we developed through the use of data.  In the vast majority of cases, the study of these types of models are phenomenological.  We aimed to see if we could push this further to get quantitative (semi-quantitative) understanding.  With regards to this aim, we were able to fit a parsimonious model for rioting activity, which incorporates both temporal and spatial dynamics, to data of the 2005 French riots.  Interestingly, the parameters that best fit the data worked in many scales, speaking to the universality of the phenomena.  The techniques developed here can be generalized to other models.  In fact, they have already been used to understand the spread of COVID19 in France.  Finally, when developing models, it is important to work with experts in the field of applications.  This work led to multiple collaborations with ecologists and criminologists that helped guide the models and the directions taken with regards to the mathematical theory developed.    A total of ten undergraduate students worked on various aspects of this grant.  Four have gone on to graduate programs and a few continue to work on projects related to this grant.  One graduate student was funded by this work, she received her PhD from UNC Chapel Hill in 2018.  Funds from this grant also allowed students to travel and present their research in national and international workshops.
