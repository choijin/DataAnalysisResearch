<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project will advance the development of a bioabsorbable tissue sealant for use in the closure of internal surgical site wounds. Wound care is associated with significant healthcare and economic costs. Surgical wounds account for the majority of acute wounds, as there are over 100 million surgical incisions a year globally, where approximately 80% require a closure product. Improper or ineffective closure of surgical wounds can result in a number of complications, including infection, scarring, improper healing, and blood loss. Currently available products for use in closing internal surgical wounds are often limited in their effectiveness due to low versatility, safety concerns, and slow curing times. An ideal tissue adhesive would provide sufficient strength and be bioabsorbable, thus providing for effective wound closure for internal and external applications. Bezwada Biomedical seeks to meet this unmet need through the development of a polyurethane-based adhesive for internal surgical wounds that is biodegradable, easy to use, and biocompatible. Successful commercialization of this technology will provide clinicians and surgeons with an effective and versatile wound closure product for surgical applications, thus decreasing the likelihood of complications that significantly impact patient outcomes and increase the costs of care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a polyurethane-based tissue adhesive incorporating hydrolyzable linkage bridging using safe and biocompatible compounds through an innovative chemistry approach. The hydrolyzable feature differentiates the technology from existing absorbable polyurethanes and is the result of highly reactive aromatic isocyanates with a hydrolyzable link connecting the aromatic rings, allowing for safe and tunable degradation. The overall goal of the proposed program is to identify a single lead polyurethane formulation with two Technical Objectives:  1) synthesis of monomers and development of formulations; 2) assessment for physical, mechanical, functional, biocompatibility, and ease-of-use properties to identify the optimal formulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
