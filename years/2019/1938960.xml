<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to extend advanced manufacturing beyond prototyping to enable higher productivity throughput in digital-to-physical processes.  Combinatorial algorithms, including machine learning, manage both the digital thread and the physical creation workflow of direct digital manufacturing applications, while retaining open-ended (change-friendly) design evolution and agile part creation.  From entrepreneurial activities to military applications, the dynamic nature of customer/mission needs requires quick reaction in both design and end-product roll-out.  Synchronizing the rapid design process with an agile manufacturing process is required to minimize response lags.  The algorithms developed in this SBIR project solve the end-to-end communication inconsistencies across the digital-to-physical threshold while increasing productivity and reducing the negative impact of costly unplanned downtime.  The desired result of this SBIR project is to enhance throughput and deliver the needed logistics to intelligent advanced manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to validate the combinatorial algorithm solving the inventory management and production queueing needed to ensure that the digital design evolution and on-going production via additive manufacturing remain in synchronicity.   Rapid manufacturing is achieved when the counter-intuitive part creation queueing is adequately solved so activities downstream of the point of fabrication, like assembly and integration, occurs in sync with the long lead fabrication of larger parts.  Essentially, workers downstream remain productive as longer lead parts are being fabricated/printed.  However, the problem is compounded when the design of the product is open-ended and creates ongoing disruption to the production queueing and downstream post assembly/integration.   The dynamic impact of open-ended design evolution on physical fabrication evolution creates significant management difficulties; therefore, the combinatorial algorithm and its machine learning capability is the key enabler to creating smart manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cybermanufacturing is the combination of cyber-physical systems, like those used in advanced manufacturing, that enable an effective levering of the needed throughput via information-transparency. This NSF SBIR Phase I project addresses the Advanced Manufacturing topic under the subtopic of Cybermanufacturing.  Additive manufacturing (AM) promises the ability to quickly convert digital information into a physical object(s) but, the management and logistics between rapid (change-friendly) engineering and final physical part delivery is a complex problem best solved via algorithms. Classical manufacturing management, such as those employed in metal machine shops or injection molding, do not service the coexisting digital and physical workflows inherent to additive manufacturing pre and post printing. Moreover, physically intensive manufacturing processes have escaped the internet of things economic value proposition captured in internet-enabled market sectors. Rapid manufacturing is achieved when the counter-intuitive part creation queueing is adequately solved so activities downstream of the point of fabrication, like assembly and integration, occurs in sync with the long lead fabrication of larger parts or higher quantities of parts typically found in complex assemblies. The main objective of this SBIR Phase I was to develop and validate the combinatorial algorithm solving the inventory management and production queueing needed to ensure that the digital design evolution and on-going production via additive manufacturing remains in synchronicity.  We have achieved this by connecting the starting point (or existing state of production) with the (desired) end goal of the final assembled products using AI/non-AI algorithms while remaining flexible to intentional and unintentional disruptions that are typical with part creation and physical assembly of the product.   The outcomes of this project benefit numerous industries leveraging additive manufacturing.  Such industries range from advanced pharmaceuticals via custom printed drugs to advanced aerospace applications.  By allowing the algorithms to solve and queue the tasks that lead to the best path to final assembly, while recalculating the workflow due to changes in the design, a design freeze can be avoided. As a result, rapid prototyping, from an iteration, logistics, and time-to-final delivery point of view, can achieve higher rates of production while retaining open-ended design in the digital side of cybermanufacturing.  The combined result of the Phase I and a future Phase II is the ability to raise advanced manufacturing from prototyping rate of productivity to mainstream low/med rate of productivity while retaining a dynamic change-friendly (un-locked) design.
