<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa, located in Honolulu, HI, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020- 2022. Field work for student research projects will occur in the watershed of Heeia, O‘ahu. Recruitment in this program focuses on native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders from Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Sāmoa, Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  It is anticipated that most students will be Pacific Islanders from community colleges and teaching universities across these island groups. Students will learn to conduct biological research that confronts challenges facing Pacific Island communities and return this knowledge to their home islands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this REU Site program is to develop a cohort of culturally-connected Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders who are well-trained in the conduct of scientific research, their engagement of indigenous communities throughout the scientific process, and in disciplines of greatest importance to their islands and their future, including ecology, environmental biology, and conservation science. Faculty mentors for this REU Site are spread across several schools and institutes at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa, including the Center of Microbiome Analysis through Island Knowledge and Investigation, Center of Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education, Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology, the Economic Research Organization, the School of Life Sciences, and the Departments of Natural Resource and Environmental Management and Tropical Plants and Soil Sciences. Student projects will focus on using systems biology research to solve issues identified by the community within the watershed of He‘eia in O‘ahu, including work on fishery science, sustainable agriculture systems, ecological restoration, invasive species science and management, and disease ecology. Student participants will engage community members, stakeholders, and landowners as they conduct cutting-edge research in He‘eia. They will be trained in research ethics and responsible conduct, lab safety procedures, scientific writing and publication, and graduate school application procedures. Assessment of the program will be done thru the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. This award is jointly supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) in the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) and the Division for Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biosciences (BIO).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
