<AbstractNarration>This Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate special project supports part of the core operations of the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the National Academy of Sciences for the next 3 years. It also funds three CSTB studies of issues and technologies emerging in the field of computer science. The CSTB provides objective, nonpartisan, scholarly analysis, blending expertise in computer science, electrical engineering, telecommunications, and various applications and impacts of information technology (IT). CSTB's work is known and used by a wide and growing circle of agencies, officials, and experts in the field. CSTB has come to be seen as an authoritative source on IT trends, IT policies, and their implications for broader public policy. CSTB delivers its reports and provides briefings to key decision-makers and practitioners in the research, education, and policy-making communities. Its study groups engage significant numbers of women, minorities, and people from across the country. Core support enables it to plan for, oversee, and follow up on projects and to be forward-thinking and proactive in formulating new activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a source of strategic thinking for researchers, educators, and research funding agencies on research and education needs, computing and communications trends and issues, and their implications for broader public policy.  Through its membership of national leaders and industry, CSTB engages experts from CISE research and technical communities in mixed collaborative groups, developing ideas, explanations, assessments, and recommendations reflecting diverse points of view and rigorous peer review.  The CSTB studies produce reports that represent the consensus views of an expert committee and leverage deep insights into computing and communications technologies, including future directions and insights from other related fields.  CSTB is a focal point for engaging the research community in the development of new research agendas and in raising the level of policy debate.  Core support enables the CSTB to plan, oversee, and follow up on projects and studies and to continue to provide strategic leadership in an area of critical importance to the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
