<AbstractNarration>Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Majority of the deaths is due to disease spreading to other parts of the body (metastasis) and impairment of vital body functions. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer remains a challenge despite the widespread use of mammography, due to limited sensitivity and specificity. The study proposes to develop an integrated system with two novel screening technologies to identify cancer cells among a cell population at very early stages of the disease. The first technology uses two identical laser beams to trap and stretch cells without any mechanical contact to characterize their elasticity which changes in presence of cancer. The second technology is to identify cancer-related biomarkers by using the principles of light scattering from the cell or tissue samples, called Raman effect. The proposed technology aims to predict the onset of cancer early enough to allow effective preventive treatment and reliably differentiate between deadly vs. non-deadly, or localized vs. metastatic breast cancers. In terms of educational impact, the study offers experiment-centric teaching methodologies for high school teachers which may help in attracting high caliber students to STEM disciplines. Innovative senior undergraduate design projects will be developed aiming at student retention and recruitment to graduate programs. The project will provide minority students an invaluable experience and exposure to modern research practices and will prepare them for successful STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study envisions a novel strategy to integrate two optical screening technologies on a microfluidic platform to identify cancer cells among a cell population at very early stages of the breast cancer disease. The investigators hypothesize that by performing two independent but complementary cell characterizations, it is possible to identify the presence of breast cancer in cells even before the structural disease manifestation begins to show up. The following two screening methods are proposed: a) biomechanical characterization of cytoskeletal elasticity as an indicator for malignancy using optical tweezer (OT) cell-stretcher, and b) biophotonic characterization of cell biomarkers using Surface Enhanced Raman Spectrometry (SERS). The project has two specific aims: 1) OT/SERS profiling device development to produce a portable microfluidic platform capable of performing bioelectric characterization of cells based on SERS imaging and mechanosensitive characterization using a laser tweezer microstretch assembly, and 2) Identification of non-invasive, pre-invasive, and invasive breast cells from triple-negative, hormone receptor positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive models to test the ability of the OT/SERS profiling device to distinguish early cellular changes that occur in cancer progression. Instead of individually screening for numerous morphological and biochemical markers of breast cancer, the investigators propose an innovative approach to screen their combined phenotype by quantifying cell's cytoskeletal elasticity and biophotonic signatures. The technology can be adapted for early cancer detection in clinical setting using blood, saliva, and other bodily secretions samples containing live cells. The study has potential to significantly impact the field of cancer diagnostics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
