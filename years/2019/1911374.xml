<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps Project is to conduct customer discovery interviews to identify initial customers that can support a universal medication autoinjector platform technology that can democratize accessibility to medications.  A direct ampule autoinjector system can leverage the existing global medical infrastructure of the ampule-based medication cartridge while expanding accessibility of medications.  From a cost effectiveness and cost minimization perspective, an equally safe and efficacious drug delivery platform technology will require complex advancements in the scientific and technological understanding of injection systems that can deliver a consistent dose of medication free of particulate contamination, air bubbles, and is also user intuitive with little to no technical training.  The potential societal impact of this technology can save many lives since having wider access to this technology can prevent death or disability that can arise if patients undergoing medical situations are not treated quickly.  This platform technology can also protect emergency responders, civilians and military personnel exposed to biological or chemical threats.  The potential commercial impact of the project can disrupt the multi-billion-dollar health care market, democratize health care access, while being capable of expanding into global markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will further the development and commercialization of direct ampule-based autoinjector technology through customer discovery.  Technical results of the feasibility of the technology under development have been proven through the development of a proof of concept that can consistently deliver a volume of medication.  These results have been further refined to the publication of a patent undergoing review.  The NSF sponsored customer discovery program will help the team develop the framework for conducting customer discovery interviews in a structured format while incorporating interview responses and data into a commercialization strategy for product to market execution.  The intellectual merits of the proposed activity will help the team identify how current needs are being addressed regarding the administration of medications while more importantly identifying if those needs are truly met and or if there are other needs that can be met which currently are not met.  The I-Corps customer discovery training program can help the project team identify stakeholders, key opinion leaders and develop a customer segmentation profile that can more accurately identify actual customers and payers in the health care medical device ecosystem while seeking avenues for collaboration in the healthcare industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for the General Public  NSF Award Number 1911374  Project Title: I-Corps: MedsForAll Autoinjector for Low-Cost Universal Access to Rescue Medications  Project End-Date 12/31/2020  PI Dr. Andreas Stergachis, University of Washington School of Pharmacy  This NSF award is to train researchers in the formal process of customer discovery through the NSF I-Corps Program Bay Area Cohort with instructional support from Venture Well, the University of California Berkley Haas School of Business, University of California San Francisco and Stanford University in a rigorous 7-week field based training program.  Teams lead by researchers serving in the role as entrepreneurial leads (ELs) work collaboratively with guidance from a PI, technical lead (TL) and industry mentor.  A major goal of this training program is to help researchers identify customers in their respective field and to determine if the venture is feasible and should be executed.  Team MedsForAll with support from the University of Washington are developing a universal modular autoinjector for use with high cost medications in emergency situations.  There are many medications that have been substantially rising in cost but are still needed to save lives during emergencies. This team sought to identify an initial primary market that would be differentiated from other segments.  We identified markets with high cost medications that are affected by rising drug costs that have adversely affected patient access due to cost, product shortages, and product failures. The NSF I-Corps program helped team MedsForAll with formal training in the practice of customer discovery and entrepreneurship.  With a wide range of options, MedsForAll joined the I-Corps program to help narrow down an initial beach head market and customer segment.  During the I-Corps training program, our team was able to interview 180+ potential customers from a wide range of backgrounds and positions in the public health system (e.g., Medical Directors, Physicians, Nurses, EMTs, Fire Fighters, Law Enforcement) and the health care industry (pharmacists, purchasers, account executives, retailers, distributors, insurers, etc.).   With the ongoing iterative customer discovery interview process, our team was also able to invalidate an initial market segment due to the potential risk of transmission of blood borne pathogens.  Risk of transmission of infectious diseases does not eliminate the potential use of a medication on its own but from the interview process the team was able to identify that the target audience for this type of medication had viable existing alternatives that eliminated this risk of infection.  In person interviews with medical directors, police chiefs, narcotics officers and firefighters identified the need of this medication and attainable alternative delivery options. These interviews helped our team understand the market structure and decision makers whiling allowing our team to strategically pivot to other market segments.  At the end of the training program our team developed a systematic approach to conducting customer discovery interviews.  With experience and practice, our team’s ability to conduct meaningful interviews improved as we were able to identify specific hypotheses to test, validate and invalidate that could help shape and impact our business plan.  By approaching meetings with a specific objective and by being open to adapt to the circumstances of each interview our team was able to extract meaningful insights into the industry, identify appropriate customer segments and expand on our network of contacts to conduct further interviews.  At the end of the I-Corps training program our team decided to continue with our commercialization efforts.  Our team is comprised of 2 core members and co-founders specialized in healthcare (PharmD) and engineering (PhD).  Our team is continuing to improve our technology and business plan based on information collected from interviews.
