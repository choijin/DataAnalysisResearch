<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the ability for both companies and municipalities to more quickly and easily find insights inside their large geospatial datasets.  Existing 2D-based tools have struggled to keep up with the demands of modern datasets.  Within the targeted industries, the result of this project will accelerate the deployment of next-generation 5G networks, help improve situational awareness during capacity and emergency planning, and allow for the real-time monitoring of large-scale infrastructures like utility grids.  Additionally, local, state, and federal governments will gain a greater understanding of their data with minimal additional training or staffing costs, leading to more effective and impactful policy decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses three critical challenges faced when working with geospatial data: volume, variety, and accessibility. Geospatial information is often bulky and created faster than it can be processed.  Further, GIS data comes in many different formats that aren't inherently compatible and is siloed so much that collaboration is difficult.  The objective of this research is to enhance a non-technical person's ability to search for, find, and communicate insights.  Specifically, this project fuses immersive display technologies with advanced visualization techniques to form a new type of data experience.  Using virtual reality, a user will be able to load large, complex geospatial datasets and explore them naturally.  The anticipated technical result will be a proof-of-concept application that allows someone to literally step inside their data, discover hidden meanings, and invite others to share the same experience and takeaways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
