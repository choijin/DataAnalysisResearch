<AbstractNarration>The Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh and the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research at Carnegie Mellon University will host Engineering Sustainability 2019: A Climate for Change (ES19) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from April 7-9, 2019. This conference will bring together engineers and scientists from academia, government, industry, and non- profits to share results of cutting-edge research and practice directed at development of environmentally sustainable buildings and infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plenary talks and concurrent oral and poster sessions will be organized around the following themes: regenerative built environment, one water in the urban environment, sustainable mobility, circular economy, engineering sustainability learning and engagement, and behavioral science for sustainability. There will also be numerous planned opportunities for informal exchanges and networking. The conference will have significant participation from students and young faculty members, as these groups are so important to the next generation of innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh and the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research at Carnegie Mellon University hosted Engineering Sustainability 2019: A Climate for Change (ES19) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from April 7-9, 2019.   We had 258 attendees: 49 different Universities, 161 students, 5 Post Docs, 49 faculty, 15 industry representatives; 3 government representatives, 11 non-profit representatives, and 3 Media representatives.  Intellectual merit includes that this conference brought together engineers and scientists from academia, government, industry, and non-profits to share results of cutting-edge research and practice directed at development of environmentally sustainable buildings and infrastructure, especially urban water infrastructure.   The conference, held biannually since 2005, is unique in its focus on environmentally sustainable engineering for the urban environment, and its ability to bring together engineers, architects, economists, and urban planners and managers.     Plenary talks and concurrent oral and poster sessions were organized around the following themes: regenerative built environment, one water in the urban environment, sustainable mobility, circular economy, engineering sustainability learning and engagement, and behavioral science for sustainability.  There were also numerous planned opportunities for informal exchanges and networking, e.g., group luncheons, which have been very effective in the four previous conferences.   The broader impacts include that Engineering Sustainability 2019 furthered the public interest in sustainable community infrastructure by advancing the state of scientific knowledge of issues around sustainability.  This conference also enhanced interdisciplinary dialogue on environmental sustainability research with cross-cutting applications in both basic and applied sciences. The conference has had significant participation from students and young faculty members, and we aimed to expand participation from these groups which are so important to the next generation of innovations.  The interdisciplinary presentations on cutting edge research in sustainable engineering, the mixture of disciplines and backgrounds represented among the participants, and the networking opportunities provided by the conference enabled participants to leave the conference with new information and ideas about research needs and opportunities.  This strengthened the ability of the participants to develop novel and impactful proposals to NSF and other organizations funding research in sustainability science and engineering.
