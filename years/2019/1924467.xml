<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on the design and testing of a new aquatic instrument, the Pelagic Laser Tomographer (PLT). The PLT is a miniature, high-resolution optical instrument that combines the latest in high-resolution optical imaging with the latest high-performance image processing, analysis, and 3D volume visualization software to provide a new way to quickly scan the water column, then analyze and visualize data showing the distribution in space of suspended particles in the open ocean and lakes.  These particles play a critical role in structuring aquatic ecosystems. They influence the transmission of light, control animal/plant interactions, and mediate the transport of nutrients. In addition, they are a key factor in moving organic matter (importantly carbon) from near surface waters into the deep sea and to the seafloor. Consequently, understanding the abundance, composition, and distribution of particles is essential to understanding the biogeochemical cycling and physical transport of elements through aquatic systems. This research will create new tools for understanding particle dynamics that will aid research in aquatic ecology, biology, geochemistry and geology and allow the tracking of man-made pollutants (i.e. plastics) in the water. The new instrument will initiate the creation of a new generation of small, inexpensive sensors easily replicable by other scientists and will be shared with the scientific community through publication and presentation, and with the public through work at the Birch Aquarium, the public exploration center at Scripps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PLT instrument, is designed to be a small, light-weight (&lt;5 kg), and inexpensive tool for aquatic scientists investigating both marine and freshwater environments. It makes use of recently developed optomechanical and electronic components and the latest high-performance computing algorithms for data analysis and 3D visualization. The PLT will provide a tool for pelagic research that has previously been limited by high cost, data storage, low resolution, small sample volume and mechanical constraints, all necessitating bulky instrumentation and subsequently rare deployment from a large research vessel. This new instrument will allow aquatic scientists to study the distribution of pelagic particulates with unprecedented spatial resolution in a routine manner from vessels (from small boats to autonomous vehicles and large ships) and in locations previously unreachable (like the shallow nearshore or under the ice). The PLT will be capable of withstanding the rigors of oceanographic field deployments, within a small inexpensive package that is capable of being duplicated by other researchers and deployed both as a stand-alone instrument and as part of a suite of standard scientific instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
