<AbstractNarration>Big data processes require the storing of substantial amounts of information. For this reason, single molecule magnets have great potential to be a vehicle for high-density information storage. Currently, single molecule magnets remain limited to operating under temperatures of minus 190 degrees Celsius. This award supports furthering the fundamental understanding of the design principles needed for increasing the operating temperature of single molecule magnets. Because of the need to understand the fundamental properties of these molecules, the PI from Louisiana Tech will utilize the resources and expertise available at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU). With this fellowship, the PI and collaborators will synthesize new single molecule magnets and characterize their structure and magnetic properties. The facilities of TAMU will be critical to the success of this work. TAMU has the necessary air-sensitive equipment and the characterization facilities needed to achieve the scientific objectives of this project. With further collaborations sustained between the PI's laboratory at Louisiana Tech University (LATech) and TAMU, there will be increased publication output and research productivity at LATech. This award will also enhance the training, education and research opportunities for students in the Northern Louisiana region in the chemical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific objective for this fellowship is to rationally design single molecule magnets (SMMs) with higher blocking temperatures through systematically increasing magnetoanisotropy and reducing quantum tunneling of the magnetization (QTM). The PI plans to probe the structure-function relationship of single molecule magnets through systematically investigating the electronic effects of the ubiquitous beta-diketonate family of ligands on the magnetic properties of SMMs. New radical anion ligands with terpyridine and quinone moieties will be coordinated to both 4d/5d metals and 4f metal ions. Azophenine derivatives, with increased magnetic coupling to metal ions, will also be synthesized and used as ligands to reduce QTM. The first examples of full spectroscopic and computational investigations of mixed metal complexes will enhance our understanding of the design principles needed for increasing uniaxial magnetoanisotropy and for reducing QTM. Ultimately, this knowledge will lead to the rational design of new SMMs that have increased energy barriers and higher blocking temperatures. TAMU will provide the glove boxes and Schlenk lines needed to conduct air-sensitive chemistry necessary for synthesizing and characterizing the complexes for this project. TAMU also has the necessary characterization equipment, such as a SQUID magnetometer, single crystal X-ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers, on site. The advanced facilities at TAMU are crucial to the success of the project and to the rational design of SMMs with higher thermal energy barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
