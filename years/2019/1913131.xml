<AbstractNarration>With the advent of multiple large-scale networks' such as biological networks, power networks, and many social networks' the control of these networks has become an increasingly important topic. The research objective of this proposal is to address fundamental questions that arise naturally in network control theory from a probabilistic perspective. In particular, the investigators will address questions such as: how likely is it that a broadcast signal can control a large network. Can media shape public opinion. Can a single leader move public opinion from one state to any arbitrary desired state? The investigators will use state-of-the-art tools in probability and random matrix theory to study such fundamental problems.  One emphasis of the proposal is the synergistic relationship between probability and control theory.  To encourage and assist other researchers, the investigators plan survey works that will emphasis particularly useful probabilistic tools and techniques that one needs to address these types of problems.  Based on this duel relationship, many of the problems discussed by the investigators have the potential to lead to interesting new questions and directions in random matrix theory, which has many applications outside of mathematics including statistics, mathematical physics, combinatorics, and theoretical computer science. The proposal also has several educational components including support for graduate study in engineering and mathematics and promoting participation of minorities in higher education in science and engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to address fundamental problems and questions in network control theory using recently developed tools from probability and random matrix theory.  Specifically, the investigators plan to analyze the general phenomenon that most systems "even those of a very discrete nature" are controllable. One specific motivating example is the question of controllability for Laplacian-based leader-follower dynamics on a large network. The investigators plan to analyze such systems by studying the case when the underlying graph or network is random.  To address such problems, the investigators plan to use and extend a number of diverse and involved techniques from probability and random matrix theory including analytic techniques (e.g. resolvent techniques, concentration of measure), algebraic tools (e.g. linear algebra), and probabilistic methods (e.g. Littlewood-Offord theory). Additionally, the investigators also expect the proposed work to be useful to mathematicians, as it will highlight precisely what types of problems and applications exist in other scientific areas.  Besides for the case of Laplacian-based leader-follower dynamics, the investigators also plan to address systems formed from directed and weighted graphs as well as a minimum-energy control problem for systems whose parameters are random.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding dynamics and control of large complex network systems was the main research focus of the proposal. In particular, we proved a conjecture of Godsil on controllability of large random undirected networks and extended this result to directed networks. The PIs have also investigated several other related questions including the dynamics over random time networks and the structural properties of several random objects pertaining to complex and large random networks.  For dynamics over networks, we studied opinion dynamics over complex networks where we investigated the convergence properties of Social Hegselmann-Krause dynamics, a variant of the Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model of opinion dynamics where a physical connectivity graph that accounts for the extrinsic factors that could prevent interaction between certain pairs of agents is incorporated. As opposed to the original HK dynamics (which terminate in finite time), we show that for any underlying connected and incomplete graph, under a certain mild assumption, the expected termination time of social HK dynamics is infinity. We then investigated the rate of convergence to the steady-state, and provided bounds on the maximum &#1013;-convergence time in terms of the properties of the physical connectivity graph.  We also studied distributed optimization over random networks. We showed a general result for the averaging-based distributed optimization solvers over random networks and showed a meta-theorem that implies and extends many of the previously known results on this domain, and further show the robustness of distributed optimization results to link-failure. Also, it provides a new tool for synthesizing distributed optimization algorithms.  Controllability properties of network systems are determined by the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system.  For directed random graphs, the PIs investigated properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in order to show that the system is controllable with high probability.  Specifically, we established that the system is controllable, with high probability, with respect to many vectors via a small ball probability bound for linear combinations of the coordinates of unit eigenvectors.  Other properties of the eigenvalues have been investigated by O’Rourke and collaborators for various models of non-Hermitian random matrices that generalize the adjacency matrix of directed random graphs.  For example, O’Rourke and Luh showed that the eigenvalues of a directed random graph (and more generally, iid matrices) are simple with high probability.  Other examples include a generalization of some earlier results of Tao and Vu for products of random matrices and a description of the limiting fluctuations of partial linear eigenvalue statistics.
