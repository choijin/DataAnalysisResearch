<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the 39th annual&lt;br/&gt;Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium that will be held May 28&lt;br/&gt;to June 1, 2019 at Texas A&amp;M University. The conference focuses on&lt;br/&gt;recent developments in Operator Algebras and Operator Theory.  This symposium&lt;br/&gt;aims to be a conference covering broad areas with large participation,&lt;br/&gt;including many young people, who are encouraged to give talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of distinguished mathematicians have already agreed to attend&lt;br/&gt;and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career&lt;br/&gt;researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded&lt;br/&gt;by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this&lt;br/&gt;conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding&lt;br/&gt;opportunity known to target groups through a number of different&lt;br/&gt;activities.  More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.tamu.edu/~kerr/gpots2019/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant provided the vast majority of funding for the Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS) of 2019, held at Texas A&amp;M University, during the dates May 28 to June 1.  GPOTS is an annual conference taking place at various venues.  The 2019 edition was an extremely successful one, and one of the largest ever.  Here are some features of the conference:  1. Eighteen plenary talks by eighteen eminent mathematicians from around the USA  and Canada.  The plenary talks covered a broad range of topics on the cutting edge of the theories of operator algebras and operator theory, including (but not limited to): Classification of C*-algebras; Dynamical Systems; Free Analysis; Free Probability Theory; Noncommuative Geometry.  2. Fifty-nine shorter talks given by fifty-nine mathematicians from around the world. These talks covered a very wide range of topics including (to mention just a few): Invariant Subspaces; Quantum Computation; Subfactor Theory.  3. Approximately 150 attendees from around the world, including at least 62 faculty, 20 postdoctoral fellows and 65 graduate students.  The talks and the researchers'  areas of expertise were united by the theme of operators on Hilbert space and on Banach spaces, and algebras of such operators, but were also characterized by diversity and breadth.  This provided optimal conditions for researchers to deepen their knowledge about their own areas of expertise as well as to gain insight into further flung areas, and to interact and foster communication with researchers from near and far.
