<AbstractNarration>Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is a bi-annual interdisciplinary international conference supporting advanced research in learning technologies in support of collaborative learning. Providing doctoral student and early-career support for attending this conference in prior years has had a significant impact on the career and research of participants from diverse domains such as computer science, information science, education, psychology, and cognitive science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides travel stipends for 5 doctoral students and 5 early-career researchers from U.S. universities to attend CSCL 2019, held in Lyon France, June 2019. Participants attend a Doctoral Consortium and an Early Career Workshop. The intellectual merit of this proposal hinges on the selection of top-quality doctoral student research and early-career researchers, potentially improving the dissertations of these graduate students and the research of early-career academics. As such it is an important capacity-building project that leverages the expertise of the CSCL community and the outcomes of previous workshops held. The broader impacts include multiplying opportunities to develop international collaborations in the field of learning sciences and advanced learning technologies, and supporting the career development of some of the best and brightest researchers in multiple disciplines who work in this interdisciplinary area. By supporting a pipeline of high-quality US scholars from multiple disciplines into this interdisciplinary field, this proposal helps ensure US participation and parity in this productive and vital area of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal funded Cyberlearning capacity building to support doctoral students and early career professionals to attend the Doctoral Consortium (DC) and Early Career Workshop (ECW) at the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) conference in Lyon, France in June, 2019.     With the increasing ubiquity of collaboration technologies, new online learning platforms, and advances in the study of learning analytics, the US faces a pressing need to support the growth of young scholars who are going to represent the next generation of leaders who will research, design, and develop in the area of computer-supported collaborative learning.  In the view of the organizers of CSCL, and the sponsoring professional society (the International Society of the Learning Sciences), those futures are embodied, enactive, extended, and embedded as well as collaborative. The work to map out those ?4E? and collaborative futures must begin now so that we can lead rather than play catch-up with new developments. By bringing together creative and energetic young minds to envision how cyberlearning research relates to collaboration and CSCL we hope to change the future of work at the human-technology frontier and harness the data revolution.     The DC hosted doctoral students who are working with their dissertation research, while the ECW was designed for early career scholars who have doctorates (post-docs, faculty in early tenure track, and others) and are in the midst of shaping their career paths. Holding these workshops in conjunction with the ISLS conferences - CSCL in particular - gave workshop participants access to new research, other researchers in the field and prospective employers, and revitalized the community.     This grant funded conference registration and a subsidy of travel and housing costs to support a group of 11 US-based researchers who attended the CSCL 2019 DC and ECW Additionally, the grant partially supported compensation for two US-based mentors (one for each workshop), and a shared social event for networking between the ECW and DC delegates.     Major Activities     Workshop Activities: Both the DC and ECW participants presented in an informal format to all other participants and faculty mentors in their cohort, who provided feedback. Participants were invited to address those aspects of their research that could be intriguing problems for CSCL generally, or could be issues other doctoral students are likely to be confronting, or issues with the potential for stimulating discussions of methodological and theoretical importance.       Subsequently, small-group discussions in interest-driven cohorts led by leading researchers in the field allowed participants to delve more deeply into specific methodological issues and helped to build professional networks in specialized areas of research.     Shared Program Activities: So as to build community horizontally and vertically across experience levels and leverage the presence of mentors and other senior professionals, the DC and ECW participants came together for several sessions:      Career panel: In this activity, 3-4 workshop participants and mentors presented autobiographies, lessons learned, and advice to workshop participants. This was an interactive event in which participants asked questions of the faculty researchers.       Meeting with Journal Editors: Because publishing is such an important part of academic life, DC and ECW participants attended a session with journal editors to talk about the publishing process. Editors from several learning sciences journals including JLS and ijCSCL participated in an interactive discussion. The first portion of the event entailed short presentations by the editors on general expectations and submission requirements. Participants had submitted topics and/or studies that they could envision submitting to the journals and had a chance to discuss their ideas with the editors in small groups for feedback in the second portion of this event.     Informal reception: The workshops provided students with an opportunity to form a professional peer community with whom they will likely be interacting with throughout their careers.  To support this process, an informal reception was held on the evening of the first day of the workshops between the Doctoral Consortium students and the participants of the Early Career Workshop.  This event provided the students (and workshop mentors) an opportunity to network with the early career researchers and engage in additional discussion about professional issues with regards to the students? future academic and professional endeavors.        Informal network: Throughout the workshops, a break room was reserved to allow for informal discussions among participants. Key conference speakers were also invited to meet with early career participants after their sessions.     Post-Conference Online Forums/Discussions: Participants from the DC workshop set up a shared drive to share information about job searches, research, and to create a space to explore possible collaborative projects.  Participants from both workshops have continued to reach out informally to mentors and their peers.  In addition, once we are able to return to face-to-face gatherings, we hope to continue to create spaces at ISLS conferences to both deepen and broaden participant networks through bringing them together with past and future cohorts.
