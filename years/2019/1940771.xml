<AbstractNarration>A five-day Technology Entrepreneurship and Commercialization Workshop for domestic and international STEM researchers (graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and junior faculty) to be held at Brown University in August 2019.  The objective of the Workshop is to provide processes and frameworks to encourage researchers to engage in the commercialization of their research, through direct venture creation or engagement with companies. It includes assistance to researchers in understanding career choices, discussions of commercialization resources available to them, including those provided by the Federal government such as I-Corps and SBIR/STTR. The Workshop especially encourages the participation of individuals from under-represented groups in Science and Technology, with Workshop discussion topics focusing on under-representation challenges, and providing mentors and role models. In alignment with the NSF mission, it will increase the number of researchers who are focused on the creation of economic and social value from their research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach in the workshop is via the provision of tested tools, mental frameworks and processes for commercialization that are cognizant of the mindset of researchers.  It has a limited experiential project component, with researchers utilizing the research from their own research groups to engage in: evaluating their research for unique capabilities; formulating product concepts; determining customer and user needs; and building a business case. The experiential components not only advance the early stage of commercialization but allow the researchers to imagine the full process. Significant time is devoted to discussion of topical issues, led by subject matter experts. Topics include: realities and challenges of representation in STEM research, and in commercialization processes, particularly technology entrepreneurship; career path options, and balancing fundamental research with appropriate attention to commercialization activities; resources available to support commercialization activities.  Role models and mentors will engage with the participants. Faculty from US universities will participate in the Workshop to observe and evaluate the methods used in order to adapt for their own curricular use. Faculty will engage in discussions on this topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A five-day Technology Entrepreneurship and Commercialization Workshop for domestic and international STEM researchers (graduate students and post-doctoral scholars) was held at Brown University during the period 19-23 August 2019, one of a series of such workshops.  The 18 participants represented universities from Australia, Europe and the USA, and provided a rich diversity by including men, women and groups traditionally under-represented in science and technology.    Intellectual Merit:  The intellectual merit of the workshop was in providing mental frameworks and processes for active researchers in STEM research for the translation of novel, exciting and emerging science and technology into products, processes and services that provide economic and social value. Engaging in the value creation processes in a 5-day immersion experience also encouraged researchers to more objectively evaluate the potential impact of their present (and future) research.  It also provided insights to help them to assess various career paths that they could follow, including academic, industrial, and entrepreneurial (startup creation).  From a curriculum development perspective the Workshop provided some insights into the length of training interventions on the effectiveness of entrepreneurial and commercialization skills development.   Broader Impact: The Workshop addressed broader impact objectives by especially encouraging the participation of individuals from under-represented groups in Science and Technology. According to NSF studies (2017), "The representation of certain groups of people in science and engineering (S&amp;E) education and employment differs from their representation in the U.S. population. Women, persons with disabilities, and three racial and ethnic groups&mdash;blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians or Alaska Natives&mdash;are underrepresented in S&amp;E. While women have reached parity with men among S&amp;E degree recipients overall, they constitute disproportionally smaller percentages of employed scientists and engineers than they do of the U.S. population. Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians or Alaska Natives have gradually increased their share of S&amp;E degrees, but they remain underrepresented in educational attainment and the S&amp;E workforce." Workshop participants from these groups had not had the opportunity to participate in technology entrepreneurship, and the Workshop provided a safe environment for them to examine how they could more actively create value from their science research endeavors. Moreover, the Workshop provided role models and mentors to help them consider future career paths and challenges. The diversity discussions during the workshop created greater awareness among participants of the challenges faced by different groups entering STEM fields.
