<AbstractNarration>This award supports student attendance at the 60th IEEE Annual Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) in Baltimore, Maryland from November 9 through November 12, 2019, as well as to support attendance by some qualified postdoctoral fellows who do not have other sources of travel funding. FOCS and its sister conference, the ACM STOC meeting, are the premier broad-based conferences on the Theory of Computing. FOCS has a record of strongly encouraging participation by students, for whom the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides. In recent years, the annual FOCS conference has been attended by eighty to one hundred students who have comprised more than a third of all attendees. This award will provide partial support to about 20 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         The main goal of this grant, written in my role as the Vice Chair of IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Mathematical Foundations of Computing (TCMF), is to assist students and postdoctoral fellows for travel to attend the Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) 2019. It has also been a wonderful experience interacting with many talented young researchers in theoretical computer sciences and their advisors in many universities to understand their excitement about the research fields and their needs. I hope these experiences will contribute to future collaboration between NSF and TCS conferences, particular in areas of supporting NSF's goals for recruiting a diverse spectrum of participants.      Intellectual Merit:   With the rise of Internet, Big Data and AI, computer science is now at the center of the many disciplines, from natural sciences to social sciences, from medicine to art, from engineering to policy. As these interactions emerging, the theoretical computer scientists, particularly the younger generation, have taking great strides in advancing algorithmic/computational thinking beyond our traditional field. The NSF travel award have been making direct contribution to this generation.   IEEE FOCS is one of the two premier annual research conferences that covers the breadth of theoretical computer science. It is a conference of very long standing that has continued to played a formative role in the field; it is also at the leading edge of connections made to other fields.   Because many advisors indicated that they would find ways to support their students -- particular those with FOCS 2019 papers &ndash; in case they didn’t receive any travel award, we were able to partly support all students who had papers in FOCS 2019 and wanted to attend the conference.  We are able to support  We also partially supported all three postdocs, each made small amounts of requests because they had some start-up grants.  We managed to essentially fully supported the travel of two students, whose advisors wrote that they would not support their students' travel because these students' FOCS papers (including one with a solo paper) did not involve the advisors. We were also was able to partly support a few relative senior students without FOCS papers, but with workshop papers.      We believe that the resultant discussions will expose the awardees to a broad set of fundamental questions and ideas. With strong aim to support young research from underrepresented groups and talented students beyond traditional TCS powerhouses, our goal is to broaden the participation to make FOCS an even more robust TCS conference. We expect the research community to benefit in turn, as such junior researchers have contributed substantially to the growth of theoretical computer science over the years.   Broader Impacts:   This year, we received 32 applications, which included four more than ten applicants from underrepresented groups. We supported or partly supported all of them, many indicated that this was the first time the attended FOCS. By supporting Ph.D. students and postdocs from more than 15 universities, the funds were widely distributed among many universities beyond just traditional TCS powerhouses.  Working with NSF and young researchers in this selection process provided us valuable experience to be more proactive in reaching out to (1) Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, (2) CRA-W, (3) Hispanics in Computing, (4) iAAMCS (Institute for African-American Mentoring in Computing Sciences), and (5) TAPIA communities. These connections will also helps us  to reach out to theoretical computer scientists more broadly about future NSF FOCS travel grants.  Many of the Ph.D. students and postdocs supported by this NSF FOCS travel grant will be the future leaders in theoretical computer science. Several have already made breakthrough discovery in algorithm design and computational complexity by solving long-term fundamental open questions. The NSF travel award, particular at this stage of their professional career, are critical support to their growth. In addition to help them to participate the premier conferences to benefit them and the research community, the application process also helped them to recognize how much their research are supported by not just their advisors/institutes, but by society in large.
