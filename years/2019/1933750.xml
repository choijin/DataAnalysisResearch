<AbstractNarration>The Quantitative Studies of Diversity and Inclusion Center (QSDIC) will convene the Second Annual Diversity and Inclusion Research Conference at the Graduate Center of the City College of New York (CCNY). CCNY and QSDI aim to establish Diversity &amp; Inclusion (D&amp;I) as a field of interdisciplinary academic rigorous research. In 2018, the first annual conference took place with this aim in mind as well as to foster academic and industry collaborations.  The funding for this conference will be used to support the planning and implementation of the 2019 conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF grant supported planning and execution of the 2019 Diversity &amp; Inclusion Research Conference (DIRC), which was held on November 7, 2019 at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.  The goal of the DIRC series is to establish Diversity &amp; Inclusion Research as a field of academic and applied research, and in particular to bring together researchers who use scientific approaches to study D&amp;I as a way of identifying problems, pinpointing root causes, and exploring solutions.  In its second year, DIRC drew a substantial in-person audience, roughly doubling its size compared to the first event in 2018.  Organized by the Quantitative Studies of Diversity and Inclusion (QSDI) initiative at the City College of New York, DIRC brought together academics, researchers and professionals from various industries to discuss how to leverage diversity and inclusion research to create more inclusive workplaces and promote greater inclusion and equality throughout society.  Current D&amp;I research initiatives were shared through a full day of TED-style talks, panels, VR experiences and other activities. DIRC19 created opportunities to learn, interact and collaborate with others from a variety of sectors and disciplines.  The event was characterized by a significant level of diversity. Out of 31 presenters, we had:  Gender: 7 men, 24 women Race / ethnicity: 14 white, 11 Black or African American, 3 Latinx and 3 Asian Industry sectors: 12 members of academia, 6 nonprofits, 7 startups, 2 corporate, 2 media and 1 government   Similarly, while demographic information about attendees was not collected, the audience was visibly much more diverse than typical research conferences.  One unique aspect of DIRC19 is the strong representation of speakers from STEM backgrounds or doing work using STEM-based approaches. This is perhaps the aspect of DIRC that most differentiates it from every other event: typical STEM events dedicate minimal or no time to Diversity &amp; Inclusion, while most Diversity &amp; Inclusion events focus primarily on practical advice, opinions, narrations of individual experiences; to the extent that research is included in these other events, it tends to be limited to reports of statistical data to highlight inequities.  Through a combination of talks and panels, the audience was able to gain significant knowledge on how research can support the field of Diversity &amp; Inclusion. The audience was also able to find information and in some cases visit staffed booths from the partner organizations. Intellectual Merit:  The DIRC events are advancing Diversity &amp; Inclusion Research as a field of academic inquiry, showing the power of leveraging scientific methodology to address meaningful societal issues. Broader Impacts:  The DIRC events impacts society in two complementary ways: first, it draws people from diverse background into scientific disciplines where women and members of minorities are often underrepresented; second, it demonstrates how scientific methods themselves can be used to address significant societal problems related to issues of diversity, equity and inclusion.
