<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from bringing AI-driven decision making to the fingertips of anyone who can use Excel. In particular, through Excel Macros, this product enables the following capabilities: Predictive Analytics, What-If Scenario Analysis, and Optimized Decision Recommendations. This enables teams of all sizes and capabilities to utilize data-driven decision making without the need for expensive infrastructure or highly skilled data scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to bring together Graphical Model driven prediction and optimization to solve generic reinforcement learning. This will be an important innovation since a decision-making framework that uses Graphical Models as the substrate to solve generic reinforcement learning / AI problems at scale is non-existent and very challenging. To this end, the innovation is twofold: in efficiently representing Excel data as Graphical Models, and in the data substrate to compute over Graphical Models in a scalable and seamless manner, on a single machine (e.g. a laptop), as well as multiple machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Project Title:  SBIR Phase I: Ikigai: One-Click-AI For Intelligent Decision Making    Intellectual Merit: Ikigai’s innovation is in enabling purchasing managers to utilize reinforcement learning within Excel. In particular, through Excel Macros, this gives them the following capabilities: Predictive Analytics, What-If Scenario Analysis, and Optimized Decision Recommendations. To this end, Ikigai’s innovation is twofold: in efficiently representing Excel data and in the data substrate to compute in a scalable and seamless manner, on a single machine (laptop), as well as multiple machines. Through these, Ikigai realizes the ability of bringing reinforcement learning within Excel. The enabler for this is a novel computational framework based on Factor Graphs.   Factor graph computing allows for performing data transformation, predictive modeling, and optimization at scale to enable data-driven decisions. Such a platform eliminates the need for data engineering, provides flexibility to build predictive models instantly, allows for seamless evolution by bringing in new datasets in the mix, and requires minimal support to maintain the infrastructure and allow for generating prescriptive decisions at scale.    The goal of the proposal is to bring together Graphical Model-driven prediction and optimization to solve generic reinforcement learning, on top of the FactorCompute framework. More broadly, this will be an important innovation as no one has used or built a framework that uses Graphical model as the substrate to solve generic reinforcement learning / AI problems at scale. Key Outcomes or Other Achievements Discovery of Customer Segments The team found a clear value proposition for its technology, with application to direct purchasing managers at small to medium manufacturers. In particular, based on the team’s 100+ customer discovery interviews, the manual and time-consuming nature of the negotiation planning process results in purchasing managers failing to realize significant cost savings during vendor negotiations due to a lack of data-driven insights for informed negotiation decisions.   Technical Feasibility During Phase I, we primarily tested the feasibility and accuracy of our graphical model approach for prediction. To accomplish this, we built an initial product with user interface to import data, build predictive models via graphical models, and export the results. In particular, we demonstrated the following: 1. Feasibility of scaling the technology (ingesting, transforming, and combining multiple data sources &ndash; determined the scaling behavior as the complexity and amount of data increases.) 2. Graphical Models can maintain accuracy as scale increases 3. System architecture design to support findings of the above   Other significant outcomes   Continued relationships with customers from interviews to help with customer validation stage   Provisional Patent   Both EL and TL are still working together on this via SBIR and other funding sources   Continued application of I-Corps methodology to discover new use cases for our technology in areas such as healthcare and retail   Initial customer traction   Hired team of engineers to build the product based on this technology      Broader Impacts:  Direct Purchasing involves purchasing items that contribute directly to Costs of Goods Sold. Reducing direct purchasing spend and realizing additional cost savings can thus directly impact the price at which manufacturers sell their products, and greatly increase the margins at which manufacturers operate, thus greatly increasing their profits and competitive advantage in the market. Beyond the business itself, we hope that through the use of product and innovation we democratize the ability to utilize data to make better data driven decisions, and ultimately, increase data literacy. The ability to utilize data for day to day work is becoming required, yet, the tools and knowledge to do so are inaccessible, hard to use, and ultimately out of reach for the professionals who stand the most to benefit. By helping improve data literacy, we aim to help develop a more competitive workforce. The factor graph computing infrastructure, invented at MIT, provides such a low/no-code environment for running the most complex of decision-making algorithms to democratize the power of machine learning and predictive analytics to help non-engineering business personnel realize the full value of their data.
