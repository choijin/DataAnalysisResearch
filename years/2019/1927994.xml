<AbstractNarration>This workshop proposal is to provide travel support for 20 US-based researchers to attend an international workshop. The workshop brings together researchers from U.S., Japan and Norway to share research outcomes and explore potential collaborations, and it focuses upon fundamental issues in reliable integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), resilient and efficient operation of electricity grid, and secure infrastructure systems.  The workshop covers such topics as monitoring, modeling, data analytics, learning, control and operation of transmission and distribution networks, especially those integrated with PV generation, wind generation, storage, demand responses, and other DERs. Research advances will be presented in relevant areas including but not limited to robust estimation, real-time optimization, distributed control, and defense mechanism for cyber and physical attacks. Electric vehicles, their interaction within microgrids, and interdependence of infrastructure systems will also be considered in the context of enabling smart and resilient communities. &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;Unlike a traditional grid based on large-scale centralized generation remotely located from consumers, a modern grid has hierarchical information and control structures with a wide range of generation and demand responses resources, including renewables, energy storage and adjustable loads, as well as numerous intelligent electronic devices. Renewable sources are inherently intermittent and uncertain. To become reliable, resilient and secure, the grid must be capable of operating itself by incorporating distributed computing, communication and control, rapidly detecting and mitigating disturbances, robustly coordinating diverse generation sources and demand responses, dynamically optimizing grid operations and distributed resources, and effectively providing strong protection against physical and/or cyber attacks. U.S., Japan and Norway all have made significant strides in integrating DERs at high penetration levels, and the proposed workshop aims to have global impact by bringing together top researchers from the three countries, by showcase their extensive research and demonstration portfolios in grid modernization, and by identifying key topics of power systems reliability, security and resilience for further collaborative research. The two-day workshop will be held at Bellesalle Roppongi, Tokyo, Japan, June 20th-21st, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
