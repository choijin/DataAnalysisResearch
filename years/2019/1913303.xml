<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable safer and more economical nuclear power.  This project will help increase the safety of nuclear power plants by reducing radiation damage to reactor components and reducing radiation exposure to power plant workers and personnel.  In addition, it will reduce overall plant life cycle costs by reducing the cost of spent fuel management and decommissioning.  By these means, this project will support the public benefit from continued and expanded use of nuclear power as a clean energy source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project goal is to reduce the thermal expansion properties of a lightweight, high-temperature neutron shielding material.  The key value proposition provided by this material over existing products is the unique increase in the operating temperature without producing a notable increase in weight or reduction in neutron stopping power. However, to enable its practical use, the material must be further adapted to reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion to meet reactor design requirements.  With success, the proposed project will overcome the technical hurdle of reducing the coefficient of thermal expansion without altering other key material properties such as neutron stopping power, radiation resistance, density, and maximum operating temperature.  Three approaches applied separately and in combination, if necessary, will be explored for reducing the coefficient of thermal expansion.  These strategies may also be applicable for reducing the coefficient of thermal expansion in other neutron shielding materials with design limitations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this NSF SBIR Phase I Project entitled ‘Thermal Expansion Reduction Study of Neutron Shielding Material’ is to reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion of NE-300, a lightweight, high-temperature neutron shield.  NE-300’s competitive advantages are the following: 1) it has a significant increase in operating temperature without producing an increase in weight or reduction in neutron stopping power 2) it is castable, instead of requiring extrusion molding or machining and 3) it is cost competitive with current low-temperature neutron shielding materials.  The coefficient of thermal expansion in the original version of the material was approximately six times higher than the design requirements for commercial nuclear applications. Since the material was also designed to withstand higher operating temperatures than existing neutron-shielding materials, its total volumetric thermal expansion was significantly higher than applications allowed.  In order to have a viable, commercial material, Phase I research work was used to perform the critical and technically challenging task of reducing the coefficient of thermal expansion without reducing the radiation resistance or without increasing the density while maintaining neutron shielding properties.   An additional constraint within the technical milestones was to minimize the production of secondary gammas to provide the maximum feasible total dose reduction.    The basic approach to the Phase I research was first to computationally examine different material combinations and then to physically test the most promising formulations.  Monte Carlo N-Particle software was used for the initial neutron shielding investigations across the four technical strategies proposed to reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion.  The material with the highest likelihood of success resulted in the transition from the use of a silicone elastomer base material to a thermoset olefin base material.  Subsequently, samples were fabricated using the thermoset olefin base material with varying levels of nanoparticles that computationally met the required attenuation criteria.  Iterative testing and material adjustments were performed until the tests confirmed a satisfactory combination.    Over the course of testing the olefin based matrix materials, additional problems were encountered.  Through the initial radiation testing, it was revealed that there were unacceptable levels of emitted radioactivity post irradiation.  Furthermore, in detailed discussions with key customers, new constraints for fire resistance were presented that are required for some neutron shield product applications.  Both of these problems were investigated and resolved allowing Phase I work to ultimately result in the development of the NE-300 material formula that, when produced at the benchtop level, meets customers’ technical specifications for a lightweight, high-temperature neutron shielding material. The intellectual merit for the Phase 1 development is the achievement of the reduction of NE-300’s coefficient of thermal expansion without altering its other key material properties such as neutron stopping power, radiation resistance, density, and maximum operating temperature.  The strategies developed are applicable for adjusting the material properties in other radiation shields with design limitations.     NE-300 development was completed to technical readiness level 4 in Phase I (8 oz batches) and will be scaled to commercial pilot production (55-gallon batches) to reach a technical readiness level 9 in Phase II.  The broader and commercial impact of this project is the development of a technology that can be used domestically and exported globally to expand the supply chain for the nuclear industry, the largest, most reliable source of clean energy.  Reactor system designs can be improved to reduce radiation exposure to plant components and operating personnel. Additionally, over $100 million can be saved in a single reactor’s life cycle costs through the more efficient management of spent nuclear fuel.
