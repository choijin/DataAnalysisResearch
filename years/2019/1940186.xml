<AbstractNarration>The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project will advance the development of embedded sensors to support treatment for the most prevalent form of spinal deformity, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).  AIS complications cause more than 440,000 office visits, 130,000 hospital visits, and 17,000 emergency room visits each year in the United States. This disorder is addressed by reducing spine curve progression through passive brace treatment, which is painful for users and does not correct the deformity, and eventually, over one-third of brace users stop wearing the brace. To improve use, comfort, and effectiveness of braces at halting curve progression, this project will develop a brace that applies corrective pressure to the spine to treat AIS with integrated sensors measuring the duration of brace use and the corrective forces applied to the spine in real time. This sensor will allow parents, patients, and clinicians to monitor compliance; more importantly it will trigger an alert when corrective forces fall below a threshold so that clinicians can schedule adjustments in a timely manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development of an accurate method to measure corrective forces in a sensor for a scoliosis dynamic brace. The technical hurdles that will be addressed in this proposal are the development of an embedded brace methodology for accurate measurements of corrective forces, as the sensor system of the brace must be able to reliably detect a change in the direction or magnitude of corrective force delivered to the patient's torso. This will require the development of a system of sensors that can accurately resolve these forces. The first technical objective will be  to optimize the number and pattern of force sensors on each pad. The second technical objective will develop a method for identifying and acquiring meaningful force measurements. These aims will develop a novel dynamic scoliosis brace for further enhancement through addition of a sensor in the prototype and use in human subjects in Phase II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a spinal deformity that  appears in late childhood. For reasons we haven't figured out yet, in AIS the spinal column develops twists and curves where it shouldn't. The disease affects 2-4% of the population  and is second only to appendicitis for financial impact to the US  healthcare system for children 10-17 years of age.  Not all of the children who develop scoliosis will require treatment. Those who do are treated first with a rigid brace that covers their torso. If their scoliosis curves get too bad then patients have to have a surgery where a large section of their spine is straightened and fused together. Each surgery costs more than $100,000 on average, takes months to recover from, and can impact quality of life and health care needs for many years.  Studies have shown that rigid bracing can work really well at preventing the need for surgery but that not many patients actually wear their brace enough to get that benefit. Some common problems these children have with their braces is that they don't like the way they look, they can't bend their back and they are uncomfortable.  The Green Sun Whisper Brace&trade; looks to improve on the technology of  rigid bracing in two areas: comfort and technology. The Whisper Brace&trade; is designed to increase comfort by allowing motion, improving breathability and minimizing the appearance of the brace. Technologically, the Whisper Brace&trade; utilizes  sensors and apps to encourage brace wear, enhance the relationship  between the patient and their health care provider, track efficacy of  treatment and discover new ways for braces to be more effective.  For this project the goal was to develop a smart pad that not only helps to track when and how much the brace is worn, but measure the forces the brace generates to make sure patients are getting the most effective treatment possible.  Through this project our team iterated through pad designs, sensors and algorithms until we had a systme that could accurately detect changes in the force applied to a pad.  Soon we will be able to provide real-time information to physicians, patients and their families about how much patients are wearing their brace and if there has been a change in the force the brace applies to the patient.  As we collect more data we hope to figure out better ways to reduce the number of children who need spinal fusion surgeries every year. This not only saves money for the healthcare system but improves the quality of life for these young patients.       Last Modified: 09/09/2020       Submitted by: Matthew Thompson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
