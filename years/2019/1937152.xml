<AbstractNarration>The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and show potential for deliverables in the near future.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts and potential societal benefit of this Convergence Accelerator Phase I project will be to forge the new convergent relationships necessary to respond to the grand challenges of space weather and fuse new capabilities that connect space weather and societal impacts. "Space weather" is the colloquial term used to describe the conditions and variability of the near-Earth space environment and its tangible impacts on technology, including critical infrastructure like the power grid, satellite services, navigation and communication systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Phase I, this project will focus on one of the most important and immediate impacts of space weather disturbances: disruptive and potentially catastrophic induced currents in the electric power grid known as geomagnetically induced currents (GICs); however, the outcomes will be more broad, providing a foundation for the growth of a space weather Open Knowledge Network in which new data providers can join and become a node in the network. The project intends to embrace a diverse community: diverse in discipline, in sector of society (i.e., across academia, industry, and the public sector), and in representation, and propose to adopt an ethos of 'open by default' by facilitating broad participation in this work through open source efforts and community engagement. The outcome will be extended capabilities of existing data resources, robust and efficient approaches to answering important research questions, and a practical framework to capture and access knowledge - each of which will be freely available. The experience gained through the project activities will provide lessons learned that will be used to help create a newly capable data literate workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work will be to respond to three barriers that stand in the way of an understanding of space weather impact on the power grid commensurate with society's needs: (1) the lack of a cohesive community, due to the wide variety of subject matter experts working on topics related in various ways to space weather, (2) the lack of effective data sharing, coordination, and analysis (e.g., data science) to leverage existing resources and knowledge efficiently; and (3) the diversity of physically dominant processes in each section of the space weather environment, making it difficult to relate various models and observations. The Convergence Hub for the Exploration of Space Science (CHESS) plans to create new modes of data-driven discovery. The power grid will serve as a valuable first use case to cultivate a convergent community of space scientists, geophysicists, data scientists, and the industries most affected by space weather. By embracing a data science-driven perspective, that addresses the full data lifecycle from collection to management to processing/analysis and visualization, CHESS has the potential to have lasting impacts across each community. A specific goal of this effort is to respond to the central goal of the Heliophysics decadal survey to "determine the dynamics and coupling of Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere and their response to solar and terrestrial inputs" and the most pressing need identified in the 2019 Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan to "enhanc[e] the protection of critical infrastructure and national security assets."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Convergence Hub for the Exploration of Space Science (CHESS) was the first space science project awarded in the National Science Foundations Convergence Accelerator Program. Our power grid is a complex system with many vulnerabilities, one of which is the threat posed by space weather. This is due, in large part, to the lack of data sharing across the multiple disciplines involved&ndash;from space scientists, to earth scientists, to power system owners and operators, and power consumers. CHESS became the next-generation approach to bring resilience to the power grid.    The overarching product of CHESS was an Open Knowledge Network (OKN) that converges data, individuals, and knowledge, across the space weather-to-power grid divide, providing our  utilities with a new tool for situational awareness, prediction, and decision support for their operations. The OKN lives beyond the project in a number of ongoing initiatives and a community of practice that cuts across these domains.    Over the course of just one year, CHESS established an end-to-end pipeline that resulted in a functional working tool, a prototype, that aligns data sets from space weather, geomagnetic, and power grid (e.g., GIC) sensors, layers on new predictive models for GICs, and permits interactive visualization and manipulation of the observational and simulation data. Our prototype generated significant interest within the broader GIC community. We organize the progress in three  stages:    Foundation-building. We engaged a vast stakeholder community (&gt;50 hours of user interviews; &gt;100 hours of stakeholder workshops; 7 dedicated customers) identified and built a network from which knowledge can be linked and utilized to scale.   From prototype to implementation. Our prototype engaged our partners to grow the feedback and advance the prototype to implementation. Our partnership with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the SUNBURST project, and our numerous power grid utility collaborators positioned this prototype to be operationalized into power grid technologies and a maturation of the OKN.    Positioning the product for insight and resiliency. We leveraged the CHESS OKN and stakeholder network to identify areas for high impact on power grid resiliency. We curated trustworthy, linked data sets (connecting more than 10 disparate data sets) for exploration/model development.    The CHESS OKN opened and combined voluminous and diverse data from space weather with geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) and electrical fault data kept by power grid utilities, and achieved convergent breakthroughs in prediction and fault mitigation.    The outcomes of CHESS are decidedly broad, serving as a foundation for the growth of a space weather OKN in which new data providers such as the NSF-funded Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) and communities such as the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and the oil/gas industry can join and become a new node in the network. This project forged new convergent relationships necessary to respond to the grand challenges of space weather and fused new capabilities that connect space weather and societal impacts.     During an ambitious Phase I effort, we achieved four foundational tasks of critical importance to the creation of an OKN encompassing space science, geoscience, data science, and power grid operations that can be amplified and implemented operationally in follow-on activities:   Identify key, foundational data types and sources, such as transformer-level power grid data from utilities and space-/ground-based observations of GMDs, that are needed as a first step for quantifying space weather impacts on the electrical grid.   Bring these data together in a scalable and structured resource that ensures the data are calibrated, quality controlled, time synchronized and geolocated to enable convergent analysis.   Create a data ecosystem that provides a natural machine-human interface to these diverse data and enables a robust and efficient approach to posing and answering questions.   Use the new ecosystem along with techniques from the increasingly sophisticated field of machine learning to examine case studies of the impact of GMDs on the grid and then to predict GICs at the transformer level due to GMDs.
