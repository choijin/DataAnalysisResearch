<AbstractNarration>Mystic Aquarium will hold a science based educational and cultural exchange workshop for Alaska Native youth and local Connecticut Native American youth. A total of 14 individuals including tribal and community leader chaperones will participate in activities for eight days at the Aquarium and local natural and historical sites. The main goals of the workshop are to stimulate excitement about science, inspire high school youth to pursue education and careers in science with the realization that they can be a resource to their communities for the management and sustainability of marine resources. Opportunities will be provided throughout the workshop for the cohort to learn and share culture and traditions.  Activities include hands-on laboratory and animal experiences, field trips to local and historical sites and cultural activities in which dance, song, art, stories and native foods will be shared and exchanged. These activities will promote learning science in the context of Native culture. The workshop and field opportunities for students leading up to the workshop promotes the progress of science by investing in future scientists. For the Alaskan Native and Native American students and community, the workshop serves to advance their knowledge and hopefully inspire students to continue their education and careers, contributing to national health, prosperity and welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arctic is "ground zero" for climate change with rapid changes posing threats to arctic animals and ecosystems including humans.  Mystic Aquarium in Mystic, CT, in collaboration with the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management, AK, and the Alaska Native community of Point Lay, AK, are studying beluga whales which serve as sentinel species for ocean health given their top-level predator status and their distribution across arctic and subarctic ecosystems.  Importantly, belugas offer food security for Alaska Natives and understanding the health status and natural history of belugas is critical to ensure their future sustainability as well as the cultures and traditions of the people that rely on them.  For several years, Alaska Native and Native American youth have assisted with live capture, tagging, sampling and release studies of belugas and collection of data and samples from subsistence harvested belugas.  This workshop will educate the participants in the importance of research on beluga whales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
