<AbstractNarration>The award supports a Square-Table workshop, the second of its kind, to explore the intersection of synthetic biology, biomaterials, and soft matter. Following the success of the first workshop on Living Interfaces held in Alexandria, VA in December 2018, the theme of this workshop, Square-Table 2 (ST2), is on Programmable Interfaces. Despite significant growth over the years in the areas of synthetic biology and biomaterials / soft matter as independent subjects, there exists relatively untapped potential to harness synthetic biology for design and synthesis of novel biomaterials. Synthetic biology promises to design new functionality in natural cells (both microbial or mammalian cells) as well as constructing de novo systems from the bottom-up. Biomaterials, whether chemically synthesized, engineered, or naturally secreted by cells may have a range of biotechnology and biomedical applications.  The myriad of biomaterials in the natural world, arisen from evolution and natural selection, provides a rich testbed for understanding biomaterials / soft matter design. Combined with the ability of synthetic biology approaches to program desirable biological outputs, the timing to explore the programmable interface of synthetic biology and biomaterials is fitting. Square-Table 1 (ST1) identified a need for computational capabilities to analyze materials composition-property relationship in this space and ST2 will attempt to enrich the continuing discussion at this interface by also bringing in computational modelers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

In particular, we envision a powerful and relatively untapped potential to utilize synthetic biology approaches for the creation of next generation dynamic biomaterials that may have properties / features beyond those that are manufactured by conventional means. We envisioned the Square-Table workshop on Programmable Interfaces to provide a venue for more discussion at the interface of synthetic biology and biomaterials that also includes the unique roles that modeling / deep learning / control theory / data science could bring to this emerging area. In fact, much of the earlier and present work in synthetic biology builds on the advances that we can model genetic circuits that explain transcriptional and translational outputs. With this considered, we included several computational scientists who work on biomaterials / synthetic biology. The workshop brought together ~ 40 PIs from the US and Europe who work on biomaterials and synthetic biology. Through breakout sessions, participants were able to exchange ideas and develop new research directions. The NSF awarded several EAGER awards based on the topics generated at the Square-Table workshop. The PIs organized a perspective article with contribution from a large fraction of the workshop participants.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/01/2021<br>      Modified by: Allen Po-Chih&nbsp;Liu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939310/1939310_10631829_1627821349177_ST2-participant--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939310/1939310_10631829_1627821349177_ST2-participant--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Square-Table Workshop Participant"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939310/1939310_10631829_1627821349177_ST2-participant--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Square-Table Workshop Participant"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">PIs and NSF Program Offices at the Square Table Workshop in October 2019.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Probably taken by a Holiday Inn staff</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Allen Po-Chih&nbsp;Liu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Square-Table Workshop Participant</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
