<AbstractNarration>In this era of pervasive multicore machines, GPUs, cloud services, big data, machine learning, and the Internet of Things, there is a critical need for an institute to create a sustainable, discipline-wide ecosystem for incorporating parallel and distributed computing (PDC) into undergraduate computing curricula. Such an institute would support the community of educators, students, and other stakeholders, with the goal of developing a workforce that is ready to meet the challenges of working with current and future computing fabrics. The investigators propose planning for such an institute (iPDC) that can help eliminate the longstanding barrier of the sequential computing paradigm such that, analogous to the establishment of the object oriented paradigm, the PDC paradigm is naturally integrated into Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CE) curricula across various institutions as recommended by the 2013 ACM/IEEE Computer Science Curricula and now by ABET.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the network of funded and unfunded collaborators, established contacts with instructors at institutions serving underrepresented groups, and outreach efforts, the project will robustly engage with stakeholder communities through four well-structured planning workshops, weekly teleconferences, and feedback and dissemination activities to formulate the key attributes of the institute.Broadening PDC education will further enable advances in science and engineering, which depend increasingly on PDC systems, by providing the next generation of practitioners and researchers with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively exploit them. The curriculum standards, adoption, and dissemination activities will have synergistic international components. Overall, this project will facilitate a rich exchange of ideas within the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project sought computing community input for the purpose of planning the design of an institute to advance undergraduate computing education in the United States, to address the needs of 21st century technology, which relies heavily on parallel computation (where multiple processors work in coordination) and distribution (where computational and data resources are geographically distant from each other and are coordinated across the Internet). Current instruction relegates parallel and distributed computing (PDC) to advanced or niche coverage, leaving most graduates unprepared for the different kind of computational thinking and problem solving associated with PDC, which modern careers depend upon. A PDC-knowledgeable workforce is essential for the United States to remain competitive in the global information technology arena, and also to be able to defend against cyber threats. Three meetings were held to gather input from stakeholders, including academia, industry, government, accrediting bodies, and professional societies, with 117 total participants, who generated over 300 pages of notes, via a carefully designed small group inquiry process. The results were collated, and presented to 31 participants in a fourth meeting, as lists of initially identified goals, strategies, and activities for the institute, with the purpose of gathering additional input on the design of the institute. The resulting 122 pages of notes from that meeting address those three aspects of the institute's design for twelve identified stakeholder groups: students, faculty, academic administrators, textbook authors, publishers, industry, professional societies, accreditation bodies, government labs, federal funding agencies, related PDC and computing education projects, and international education agencies. Due to the COVID pandemic, the meeting schedule was delayed, so that delivery of the institute plan had to be deferred until after the original end date for the grant. Two of the collaborating institutions received no-cost extensions that will enable the input from the fourth meeting to be condensed into a report for presentation to the National Science Foundation at a meeting planned for the fall of 2021. This institution will participate in that meeting using participant support funds that remain available from the lead collaborator.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/13/2021<br>      Modified by: Ramachandran&nbsp;Vaidyanathan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
