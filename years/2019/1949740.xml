<AbstractNarration>The Maker movement is touted as being able to positively impact learning because Making will generate interest and engagement in STEM. Yet, there is a paucity of educational research that has actually examined if, when, how, and for whom Making is engaging or a space for interest development. Also, very little connection has been made to established psychological models of how interest develops from triggered moments of situational interest to sustained personal interests. Drawing on existing interest research, this work develops and tests new methods for capturing moments of high youth engagement during Maker learning activities and tracks their change over time with new wearable technologies. The use of wearable technologies is especially well suited for Maker activities where youth are often in constant motion and must complete immediate tasks that prevent them from being able to offer conscious reports of their engagement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of the work is the use of wearable sensor bracelets and still image cameras to measure psychophysiological indications of heightened engagement. The work is well positioned in the existing knowledge-based of human centered computing and appropriately references existing research. The work overs a creative intellectual step in experimenting with artifacts of human centered computing in the assessment of student engagement in making.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project examined the combined use of wearable devices and skin sensors as a way to identify when students were engaged and interested in activities at a makerspace. Two afterschool makerspace programs for youth, one in a rural area and one in a more heavily populated suburb of a large city, provided participants and sites for this research. Using the two wearables as research data, it was determined that peer social interaction was where more youth were consistently engaged, along with some occasions of interactive instruction with an adult facilitator and challenging physical assembly of objects. Just doing the manual work of making alone did not consistently produce greater engagement, especially if there was something else that youth could pay attention to that kept them from actively talking and working with each other (such as watching television or videos). Group discussion about the upcoming experiences in the makerspace and the anticipation of what could be made on the given day or in the future also appeared to elicit higher levels of engagement. Some specific difficulties with using these data have been identified that will be instructive for other researchers who may use similar methods in the future. This project has contributed to the field?s understanding of what increases youth engagement in makerspaces and some of the trade-offs of using these kinds of data and equipment for future analysis. It has generated evidence that skin sensor devices can generate information related to youth engagement that is consistent with other approaches. However, more work would be needed in the future for this to better verified and expanded to more diverse groups of youth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/19/2020<br>      Modified by: Victor&nbsp;R&nbsp;Lee</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1949740/1949740_10433123_1605837020788_breadboardtesting--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1949740/1949740_10433123_1605837020788_breadboardtesting--rgov-800width.jpg" title="breadboard test"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1949740/1949740_10433123_1605837020788_breadboardtesting--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="breadboard test"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Youth testing breadboard in a makers-ace activity</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anonymous</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Victor&nbsp;R&nbsp;Lee</div> <div class="imageTitle">breadboard test</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1949740/1949740_10433123_1605837229811_B-8B6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1949740/1949740_10433123_1605837229811_B-8B6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Paper Circuit in Makerspace"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1949740/1949740_10433123_1605837229811_B-8B6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Paper Circuit in Makerspace"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Youth producing a paper circuit as part of an after school makerspace activity</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anonymous</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Victor&nbsp;R&nbsp;Lee</div> <div class="imageTitle">Paper Circuit in Makerspace</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
