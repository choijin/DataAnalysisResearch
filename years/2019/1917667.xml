<AbstractNarration>We live in a world where material goods and products are moving at an ever-increasing speed and scale. In the United States, approximately 90% of everything we consume on a daily basis is now shipped to us by sea. The stability of maritime commerce depends on a workforce of over 1.6 million international seafarers, the dynamics of which have yet to be fully mapped. In particular, we know little about whether the trends that we associate with the globalization, industrialization, and automation manifest within the maritime commerce industry. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous, scientifically grounded fieldwork, asks how the labor market that services this critical, yet understudied commercial space, is changing with increased automation, acceleration, and globalization of production. Research findings will be published in professional journals and presented at maritime conferences to create media exposure and foster exchanges between academia and the shipping industry regarding labor relations. Based on his findings, the researcher will also develop college-level curricular materials aimed to innovate higher education pedagogies and to disseminate critical anthropological knowledge of global supply chains to a diverse body of business, international law, and global studies students, thereby engaging a wider audience with the scientific process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liang Wu, under the supervision of Dr. Karen Strassler from the Department of Anthropology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, will explore labor dynamics, human and capital mobility across maritime circuits of commerce. He will study contemporary seafarers working on board ocean-going container ships of the international shipping industry, the majority of whom are now outsourced from China, the Philippines, Indonesia, India, Russia, and Ukraine among other labor exporting countries. Research will be conducted with seafarers on board a container ship and in the ports of New York and Hong Kong as hubs of transatlantic and transpacific trades. Drawing on wide-ranging language skills and more than a decade of field experiences, the researcher will investigate seafarers' work routines and relationships on board, backgrounds and aspirations, job cycles, port duties, shore leave, port-based welfare facilities and services, and shipping infrastructures and logistics management. Methods include combination of ethnographic fieldwork on board a container ship and at the ports of Hong Kong and New York, as well as social network, geospatial, and other methods of data analysis. The project will make theoretical contributions to scientific understandings of the terraqueous circuits of global capitalism, mobilities, and labor dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Liang Wu's project on international shipping and seafaring has called our attention to the maritime world and shed light on the 1.6 million multinational seafarers who are responsible for transporting 90% of global trade including raw and semi-processed materials as well as everyday commodities consumed around the globe. Through studying the lived experiences and meanings of contemporary seamanship, Wu's empirical work has reshaped our understanding of globalization that is commonly defined as increasing and intensifying global interconnection and integration. Wu complicates this notion by underlining the contradiction and interaction of mobility and immobility, connectivity and dysconnectivity, politics and dynamics embedded in the daily operation of globalization. His research allows him to show how shipping developments in the modern era such as containerization, port securitization, and international legislation have inadvertently produced the sea-blindness of societies and the invisibility and immobility of seafarers, and how interport social infrastructures endeavor to mitigate such social repercussions.</p> <p>Based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted on board container ships and at the ports of Hong Kong, New York and New Jersey, archival studies, and online ethnography, Wu's project examines the technoeconomic, infrastructural, and legal developments of shipping in the postwar era, the changing society and culture of port cities and shipboard communities, hydropolitics generated by the global expedition of material goods and products, and the mechanisms and mediations through which seafarers navigate their overseas relationships, job conditions, state administrations, and international law. Wu's work maps out the lifeways of seafarers as humans at sea, illuminates their role as essential workers sustaining societies and economies worldwide, and reflects on the complex reality of logistics, techno-capitalism, and labor.</p> <p>Through face-to-face interactions in the field, industrial reports, scholarly publications, digital podcasts, public talks at schools and museums, and professional presentations at and participation in national and international conferences, Wu has been sharing his research findings on different platforms with various audiences from intellectuals to industrialists, from policymakers and other maritime stakeholders to the general public.

At the dawn of what is touted as the 4th Industrial Revolution that prioritizes technological communication, connectivity, and circulation, Wu's study of seafarers as vanguard transport workers offers us critical insights into the labor conditions and industrial relations that undergird logistical processes of societies in the world. Living at this unprecedented time of multiple crises from public health to humanitarian emergency and planetary existence, Wu's project has not only sought to raise academic and social awareness about the conditions and complications of globalization, including the human costs and social, environmental limits associated with perpetual pursuits of commercial productivity and efficiency, but it has also provided a knowledge base upon which practical, evidence-informed suggestions can be made on maritime policy e.g. building and strengthening industrial partnerships, and adopting a structural, holistic approach of care for "the human element" of shipping and other related and relevant industries.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/02/2021<br>      Modified by: Liang&nbsp;Wu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1917667/1917667_10638058_1627876356115_Shipvisitatanchorage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1917667/1917667_10638058_1627876356115_Shipvisitatanchorage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ship Visit at Hong Kong Anchorage"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1917667/1917667_10638058_1627876356115_Shipvisitatanchorage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ship Visit at Hong Kong Anchorage"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ship visit by a connecting boat and a rope ladder at the anchorage of the Port of Hong Kong, where merchant vessels and the crews on board were docked in the middle of the ocean.</div> <div class="imageCredit">author</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Liang&nbsp;Wu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ship Visit at Hong Kong Anchorage</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1917667/1917667_10638058_1627876530222_ScreenShot2020-02-20at6.14.57PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1917667/1917667_10638058_1627876530222_ScreenShot2020-02-20at6.14.57PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Screenshot of MarineTraffic - Global Ship Tracking Intelligence"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1917667/1917667_10638058_1627876530222_ScreenShot2020-02-20at6.14.57PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Screenshot of MarineTraffic - Global Ship Tracking Intelligence"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Through the automatic identification system (AIS), MarineTraffic tracks in real time the movement and location of every registered vessel on the planet.
