<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to provide partial travel support for 20 graduate students to attend the 3rd World Congress on Micro-Nano Manufacturing (WCMNM); Raleigh NC, 10-12 September 2019. The congress focuses on new developments in the field of micro and nano manufacturing science and engineering. The students present their research at the conference, exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from U.S. and international institutions and visit companies involved with nano-micro manufacturing in Raleigh's Research Triangle Park. Travel grants for the students are based on acceptance of their paper for presentation at the conference and a short vision statement. Priority is given to student participants who are women or who come from underrepresented groups. This approach promotes diverse participation at the conference. This award benefits the nation through the education and training of a skilled and diverse engineering workforce better prepared to provide transformative solutions the challenges of their chosen fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This participation support is expected to benefit the students' professional, scientific and technical development. Participants are given an opportunity to nurture a global vision in nano-micro-manufacturing and learn about the latest developments in the field. A wide range of topics are presented to stimulate learning and training. These include mechanics and dynamics of processes at the micro and nano-scale; miniaturization of machines and equipment; micro-factory paradigm; micro- and nano-scale metrology; materials handling; multi-scale modeling and simulation; design for micro- and nano-scale manufacturing; micro and nano additive manufacturing technologies; and others. Participating students learn by attending technical presentations by leading international experts in micro and nano manufacturing, and by interacting with fellow researchers from around the world. These experiences foster new ideas and a deeper fundamental understanding, which help shape future of research in manufacturing science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
