<AbstractNarration>This grant funds a conference to be held August 7-8, 2019 in Greensboro, North Carolina, titled the Southeast Urban Sustainability Summit (SEUSS). The objective of the conference is to develop a collaborative group comprised of academics, municipalities, industries, and advocacy groups who share the vision of advancing research in urban sustainability specific to the state of North Carolina.  The resulting research agenda for the group developed at the conference will have implications for the entire southeast region due to similarities of cities and towns in North Carolina to those across the greater region. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to improve urban sustainability which will save lives and economic losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEUSS will form a diverse network of stakeholders across the state committed to identifying and addressing the state's most pressing sustainability and resilience issues associated with: energy, water, waste, transportation, housing, health/safety, and food/agriculture. SEUSS will be led by North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University, in collaboration with leadership from University of North Carolina Greensboro, Appalachian State University, and North Carolina State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NC Agricultural and Technical State University, the University of NC at Greensboro, and Appalachian State University planned and hosted a SouthEast Urban Sustainability Summit in Greensboro, NC on 14-15Aug2019.  The Summit was attended by ~150 stakeholders from across NC and from a few surrounding states.  These stakeholders represented academia, industry, not-for-profit community-based organizations, and governmental groups.  This was later the foundation for a SEUSS Research Network that continues to work together to solve the vexing problems of sustainability, particularly for Urban communities.  The Summit was a facilitated discussion that led the participants through the topic of sustainability, helped the group develop 18 Grand Challenges in urban sustainability and finally converged on 6 key research areas that were prioritized to be explored in coming months and years by the SEUSS Research Network.  The sustainable urban systems that were discussed at the Summit included:  energy, water, agriculture/food, waste, housing, health and safety, and transportation.  It was felt by the majority of stakeholders that the issues of sustainability are primarily in engagement of the entire community; empowerment of that community; development of an integrated systems model; development of metrics and best practices, and development of resilience and adaptation to stressors.  After the Summit concluded, the research network continued to collaborate and submitted a number of proposals to continue the research effort that began at the SEUSS event.    The network is converging on an approach to sustainability that involves a set of metrics that measures the well-being and Quality-of-Life for each individual in a community, and the environment, together.  From the set of metrics which intends to measure the socio-economic status of each citizen and the community, data can be gathered and analyzed in an integrated system to optimize the urban systems that affect every citizen.  From that detailed analytical approach, new tools can be delivered to policy makers to improve the fundamental urban systems to the socio-economic benefit of everyone living in a community; from poor to rich.  The SEUSS research network remains committed to the following societal outcomes:  addressing equity issues; improving the well-being of people from all socio-economic backgrounds; increasing development of a diverse and competitive workforce; increasing partnerships between academia, industry, govenment, community organizations, and the public; increasing the economic strength and competitiveness of the US; and increasing the infrastructure for research and education in NC.  A full summary of the Summit was prepared in a 120 page document that can be requested from the Principal Investigator, Dr. Greg Monty.
