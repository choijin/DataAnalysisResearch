<AbstractNarration>This award will support graduate student, postdoctoral and early career investigator attendance at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) meeting at Steamboat Springs, CO on July 14 - 19, 2019. This meeting focuses on Genetic Recombination and Genome Rearrangements and is co-organized by Xiaolan Zhao and Scott Keeney, both at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The format of the meeting is a combination of 49 invited talks, 15 talks selected from submitted abstracts and several poster sessions. A keynote lecture and two "concepts and challenges" lectures by three leading recombination researchers will begin the meeting. There is a dedicated 1-hour session for trainees to interact with leading experts at the meeting and three separate poster sessions. Two concurrent career-workshops will be held for trainees and early stage investigators. This meeting affords many opportunities (both formal and informal) for sharing recent research findings and exploring collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a premier meeting on recombination and genome rearrangements, now in its 18th iteration. Recent advances in chromosome rearrangements, mitotic and meiotic recombination will be highlighted in this conference, which will bring together diverse scientists from across the country and internationally. The session topics include recombination initiation, chromatin substrates for recombination, meiotic recombination, telomeric recombination, DNA damage responses, mutations and chromosome rearrangements, genome instability, homologous pairing and strand exchange, and finally, recombination during DNA replication. The conference primarily highlights unpublished research findings and provides many experiences for young researchers to learn about the field and devise future avenues for research. The meeting will encourage career development of a new generation of researchers, including those who are underrepresented in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
