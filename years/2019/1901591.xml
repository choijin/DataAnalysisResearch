<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for U.S. participation in the Young Topologists Meeting 2019, held at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, July 22-26, 2019. The Young Topologists Meeting (YTM) is an annual European conference which focuses on the work of graduate students and early career researchers in topology that brings together participants from all over the world. At the YTM, junior topologists present their work to a large international audience and also attend mini-courses taught by senior topologists. The conference provides opportunities for the participants to meet new colleagues and mentors, to form research collaborations, and to learn about current developments in the field. Its open and supportive atmosphere encourages early career mathematicians, including those from underrepresented groups, to pursue research careers in topology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The YTM is an annual event, first started in 2007, which traditionally alternates between Copenhagen, Denmark and Lausanne, Switzerland (with an exception in 2017 when it was held in Stockholm, Sweden). The conference features parallel sessions of contributed talks by graduate students and early career researchers covering a broad spectrum of topics in topology. In addition to these talks, there will be mini-courses by two senior topologists on two current threads of research in pure and applied topology. This year, Julie Bergner (University of Virginia) will give a mini-course on the homotopical notion of 2-Segal spaces, while Vidit Nanda (University of Oxford) will give a mini-course on topological data analysis. More details are available on the conference web page: https://ytm2019.epfl.ch/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
