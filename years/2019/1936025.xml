<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for support of a travel to the 25th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS), to be held in Lausanne, Switzerland, March 16-20, 2020. ASPLOS is a leading forum for multidisciplinary systems research spanning computer architecture and hardware, programming languages and compilers, and operating systems. Research papers selected for ASPLOS often target a wide spectrum of important goals such as performance, energy and thermal efficiency, reliability, security, and sustainability. The funds requested from NSF will help support 20 students who currently study in US universities and institutes to attend the ASPLOS conference, and hence get chances to presenting their research ideas and to get advice from leaders in the community. Moreover, part of the funds will be reserved to support undergraduate student applicants and students belonging to under-represented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of forum such as ASPLOS continues to grow as we come to the end of Moore's Law, experiencing the explosion of big data, the wide spectrum of computing scales from ultra-low power wearable devices to exascale parallel and cloud computers, and the need for sustainability. ASPLOS embraces systems research that directly targets these new problems in new ways. Historically, the conference has attracted top research papers from both academia and industry, and many innovations published in the proceedings have been influential in the history of the systems and hardware industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
