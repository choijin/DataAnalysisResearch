<AbstractNarration>This award supports attendance by 20 graduate students and postdocs affiliated with US institutions at the Summer School and Conference on Homotopy Type Theory to be held August 7-17, 2019 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy type theory is a new field of mathematics that draws on logic, homotopy theory, category theory, and computer science to create a new foundational system for mathematics that can be implemented in a computerized proof assistant.  Students and postdocs attending the summer school will be introduced to the basic mathematical theory and trained in the use of the associated computer systems.  They will also be exposed to current research and open problems, and provided with the necessary tools and resources to begin their own research, independently and in collaboration with others.  The summer school will take place over four days, followed by a research-oriented conference of 6 days.  Further information can be found at the website: https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Public Outcomes Report for:  Student Support for Summer School on Homotopy Type Theory  (HoTT 2019 Summer School)  Overview  This proposal provided funds to support attendance by 20 graduate students and postdocs affiliated with US institutions at a Summer School and Conference on Homotopy Type Theory, which was held in August 2019 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Homotopy type theory is a new field of mathematics that draws on logic, homotopy theory, category theory, and computer science to create a new foundational system that can be implemented in a computerized proof assistant.  Students and postdocs attending the summer school were introduced to the basic mathematical theory and trained in the use of the associated computer systems.  They were also exposed to current research and open problems, and provided with the necessary tools and resources to begin their own research, independently and in collaboration with others.  The summer school took place over four days, followed by a research-oriented conference of 6 days.    Intellectual Merit  The development of homotopy type theory as a new foundational system for pure mathematics promises to provide not only a secure alternative to today's set-theoretic foundations, but one which is both closer to everyday practice and better suited to computer implementation.  This combination has the potential to provide foundational methods that can serve as an aid in theoretical research, by supplying new principles of reasoning, such as univalence and higher inductive types, that fit well with current mathematical practice.  Just as axiomatic set theory codified, systematized, and made rigorous the use of the Axiom of Choice, Zorn's Lemma, and the Well-Ordering Principle one hundred years ago, modern foundational research investigates and makes rigorous the frontiers of today's mathematics, including higher topos theory, the theory of (infinite dimensional) stacks, and the many applications of abstract homotopy theory throughout modern mathematics.  Broader Impact   The recent development and increasing use of new computational proof assistants for everyday research in mathematics represents one of the most noteworthy developments in the interaction between mathematics and computer science.  Originally developed for the purpose of verification of software for critical control systems, these computational proof systems are now almost at the point that they can be used for the purpose of interactively constructing and verifying  proofs in everyday research mathematics.  With only a small amount of further development, such systems will soon become a practical tool for the discovery and increased certainty of mathematics.   In such a foreseeable future, every young mathematician will learn to use a proof assistant, in the same way that learning to typeset mathematics in latex now belongs to the graduate educational experience.  Participants in the summer school are among the ``early adopters'', joining the ranks of pioneering researchers who already use  experimental, ``beta'' versions of such systems to discover and formalize their research---a practice that is certain to be welcomed by editors and referees.  Another broader impact of the program is in the training and advancement of the individual participants, who were mentored in mathematical research and collaboration.  By familiarizing them with both the theoretical content, open problems, and proof techniques of this new field, they were invited and enabled to contribute to its future development.  Moreover, they were introduced to the social and scientific network of current students and researchers, online resources, and international research centers to support such future work.  Finally, the postdoctoral instructors teaching the courses were also enriched by the interaction with students, educational training, and conceptual systematization that come with preparing and delivering a course of introductory lectures in a new field of research.  All of the educational materials accompanying the lectures and tutorials have been made publicly available online at a site hosted by CMU, along with other materials associated to the Summer School.
