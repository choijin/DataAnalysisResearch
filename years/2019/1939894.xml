<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project introduces a disruptive solar power-generating window design capable of generating clean, on-site, and abundant electricity directly to commercial buildings and homes. While utility solar energy offers off-site generation to urban centers, up to 10% is lost simply due to heat dissipation. And with evolving legislature imposing stricter requirements on building energy codes, power-generating windows offer to be one of the most promising avenues for attaining net-zero energy levels. We plan to scale-up our laboratory-level power-window technology through close industrial partnerships with individual component manufacturers and customer segments discovered through the I-Corps award. Through initial relationships with window manufacturers, our beachhead market will service large-scale commercial projects in Southern California, shifting the energy landscape toward a future of abundant, clean energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project uses improved luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) technology to create a highly efficient power-generating window, indistinguishable from large-area windows. LSCs absorb incident light via nanoscale particles, called luminophores. Luminophores (e.g. quantum dots) are a class of particles that, when exposed to a broad range of light, absorb the high energy portion of the spectrum and re-emit the light again at lower energies - this re-emitted light is known as photoluminescence (PL). The target quantum dot in our innovation consists of InAs/InP/ZnSe - a material that absorbs light across the visible spectrum (400-700nm) and re-emits as PL at wavelengths in the near-infrared (NIR) regime (900-1000nm). As such, the re-emitted light is visibly transparent and well designed for a power-generating window. Luminescent Energy power windows employ an innovation that consists of four fundamental components: (1) a grid of micro-scale silicon solar cells, (2) a polymer waveguide with (3) embedded InAs/InP/ZnSe quantum dot luminophores, and (4) selectively reflecting filters to trap the majority of the photoluminescence generated by the quantum dot luminophores and enable competitive window U-values. Our design has been optimized using experimentally-verified modeling tools, and we have begun fabrication of each of the four device components independently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As can be the case in much of applied science research, technology intended to one day enter a specific market subsegment often fails to garner commercial traction owing to an incomplete understanding of the customers and individuals within that market subsegment, their unique needs, and correspondingly, how the proposed technology can meet those needs.  In this NSF I-Corps grant, our team of scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), together with business mentor Jason Hartlove at Nanosys Inc., investigated the competitiveness of a photovoltaic (PV) solar power-generating window aimed at bringing solar energy electrical generation to the commercial building and windows market.  Through the I-Corps process of getting out of the laboratory and interviewing potential customers and decision makers, we interviewed nearly 150 individuals across the commercial building and windows value chain &ndash;&ndash; ranging from presidents of major building development firms, chief architects and engineers at some of the largest groups, window and glass manufacturing engineers, to building occupants and management.        Through the I-Corps grant, we not only accomplished our goals of understanding the needs of existing commercial window decision makers and economic buyers but, moreover, the full scope and intricacy of this market ecosystem.  Rooted in unbiased interviewing practices, our team drew two, vital conclusions about this space: first, we identified the major decision maker within this market (the building developer).  Second, we uncovered the needs of this decision maker and, more specifically, how existing power-generating PV solar windows in their current form fail to meet these needs.  The data acquired suggested that, while such PV window technology may benefit the end-user or occupant of a building (i.e., lowered utility bills for the tenant), no such benefit impacts the decision maker (building developers).   As a direct result of this grant, we conclude the optimal pathway to commercialization for integrated PV windows manifests as self-powered electrochromic or dynamic windows (i.e., windows that can change visible transparencies and thermally insulative properties upon demand with electricity generated by the PV).  Beyond the technical outcomes of the NSF I-Corps project with respect to technology development, this grant also equipped a prominent research group at a leading institution with tools to better evaluate the potential market opportunities for a given technology &ndash;&ndash; with the lessons learned widely applicable.
