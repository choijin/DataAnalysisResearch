<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative research, approaches and resources for use in a variety of settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Teen Science Cafe Network is an adaptation for teens, of the popular adult science cafe model, which brings people together in a social setting to have an animated conversation with a scientist on some interesting and timely topic. Since its inception in 2012, the Network has grown at a rapid rate: it is now in 130 sites in 45 states, the District of Columbia, and British Columbia. Multiple evaluations have documented its impact. Teens are shown to have increased STEM literacy, a more realistic picture of scientists as real people leading interesting lives, and a better understanding of the nature of science.  This two-and-a-half-day conference is designed to review the state of this model of teen engagement in science and science communication. Participants will examine lessons learned from this and similar networks to consider the features needed to expand this model to other audiences (e.g., rural teens, teenage college students, teenagers on military bases, and teens served by local chapters of professional societies based on ethnicity and gender).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaders of the Teen Science Cafe Network, along with an advisory committee comprised of individuals who are successfully managing networks, will explore these fundamental questions: 1) How can the field best take advantage of this large and growing network? 2) How can the current community of practice be leveraged for growth?  3) What are some of the most effective strategies for achieving and maintaining effective, long-term partnerships with organizations such as 4-H, science centers, networks of afterschool providers, science festivals, professional societies, and libraries? 4) What are possible outcomes for promoting discipline-specific cafes in areas such as ocean science, astrophysics, geoscience, and polar science?  Outputs from the conference include a refined set of guiding principles for the current network and a white paper describing the features of strong and effective networks and recommendations for scaling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We invited a diverse group of experts in informal science education to be part of a committee that would provide critical feedback on our vision of future pathways for the Teen Science Caf&eacute; Network and offer novel ideas based on their own experience with other organizations and large networks. Their views helped to shape the content of this proposal. What new directions and what new structures should we be considering? The committee provided guidance in these general areas:  What kind of structure makes sense for maintaining effective management of a Network that is already large and will likely become much larger, while maintaining a shared sense of a community of practice?  What mechanisms can ensure robust professional development for our adult leaders and maintain intimate ongoing relationships with them, while maintaining a strong sense of a community of practice?  What other organizations and networks should we seek to partner with to mutual benefit, while taking advantage of such partnerships to expand our Network?  Can and should we take advantage of our large and diverse Network to promote "thematic" cafes that would engage subsets of the Network members as communities of interest?  In terms of broader impact, the committeeâ€™s advice provided a solid foundation for building the next phase of the Teen Science Caf&eacute; Network. The long-term goal is for the Network to become a widely recognized and self-sustaining movement within American culture, such that it provides many thousands of high school teenagers across the country each year with an understanding of the nature of science, an appreciation of scientists as real people leading interesting lives, the possibility of a life in science for themselves, and a motivation to internalize lifelong learning in science as adult citizens.
