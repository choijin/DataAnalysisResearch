<AbstractNarration>This travel grant supports students and early career researchers to participate in an interdisciplinary workshop. The meeting will stimulate discussion between the geophysics and mechanics/engineering communities. They will identify outstanding problems and advance the state-of-the-art in mechanical models for geophysical problems. Scientific areas for collaboration include rock mechanics, seismology, physical volcanology and fracture mechanics.  Dealing with big data and more realistic models will be a focus of the effort. The meeting will take place at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
