<AbstractNarration>This award partially supports the participation of approximately 25 US-based graduate students, postdocs, and early-career participants without grant support in the STATPHYS-27 conference that will take place in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July 2019. This is an instance of a series of established and successful international triennial conferences on statistical physics that attract a diverse group of approximately 1500 US and international researchers in statistical physics and related fields. Leading researchers and students from around the world will meet at the STATPHYS-27 conference to discuss the latest advances in statistical physics and related&lt;br/&gt;fields, and to identify the most important and promising new directions for future research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
