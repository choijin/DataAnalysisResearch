<AbstractNarration>An accident at the Fukushima  Dai-ichi nuclear  power  plants  (FDNPP)  in  northern  Japan  resulted in the release of large quantities of radio-isotopes in  2011.  As the water containing these tracers spreads across the Pacific Ocean, it presents a unique opportunity to view the transformation and  evolution  of  mode  waters, a thick layer of nearly homogenous properties within the typically layered structure of the interior ocean. The collected radio-isotope measurements from 7-years of observation across the N Pacific basin will be combined with other water properties either measured simultaneously with the isotope measurements or by the Argo network of autonomous profiling floats and augmented with simulations from a high-resolution numerical model to  investigate  the  transport  pathways  and 3-D distribution of the isotope-tagged water masses formed in 2011. The study moves beyond the question of how far  and  fast  various  levels  of  radioactivity  have  spread,  to employing  the  knowledge  this unique  tracer  can  provide about  underlying  physical  processes  and  the  role  of  North Pacific mode waters  in  transporting,   mixing  and  storing  the  characteristics  they  gain  from  the  atmosphere  and  surrounds  at  the  time  of   formation.  Conclusions drawn about  the  patterns  and  timing  of  basin-scale  upper-ocean  mixing  and   advective  processes  will  be  relevant  to  those  seeking  to  understand  ocean heat content, nutrients, biological production, CO2 uptake and ocean acidification. The  study  will  have  4  science-related  impacts: 1) improved understanding of ocean transport processes in 4-D; 2) clarifying the role of mode waters in  physical,  biological,  chemical  cycles,  and  ultimately,  climate  change;  3)  assessing  the  reliability of a high-resolution data-assimilating model; and 4) providing insight for future radionuclide sampling in the North Pacific.  This project  will  continue  to  support  three  PIs  who  have  formed a team combining their varied  expertise  and  backgrounds  including  theoretical,  observational  and  model-based  oceanographic  research.    During  the  2nd year  of  the  project, a guest student will be mentored and encouraged to participate in the physical analysis of cesium observations  and/or  a  simulation  experiment.  The  group  will  continue,  as  in  the  past, to  offer  potential  projects  and  mentoring  to  WHOI  Summer  Student  Fellows and   mentor  science  fair students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This  project  will  use  the  information  provided  by  the  one-time  release  of  radio-isotopes (Cs 134, Cs 137,  and  Sr  90 with  ~2,  ~30  and  ~29 year  half-lives, respectively),  as  measured  across  the  Pacific  between  2011  and 2018 to investigate the evolution of North Pacific mode waters (NPMW) from their formation in the  west to their circulation around the gyres. The goal is to carry out a targeted analysis of the now 7-year-long   international   basin-wide   FDNPP   observed   record   of   radionuclides,   combined   with   other   simultaneously  observed  water  properties  (e.g.  temperature  (T),  salinity  (S),  oxygen,  other  tracers, velocity etc. as well as T &amp; S from profiling floats) and augmented with numerical simulations based on a state-of-the-art   high-resolution   data   assimilating   model   to   investigate   the   4-dimensional   transport  pathways  and  evolution  of  NPMW  tagged  with  the  FDNPP  radionuclide  signal.  In  particular,  the analysis will  examine: a)  the  extent  to  which  these  waters  keep  their  key  oceanographic  properties,  specifically  their  potential  density  and  potential  vorticity,  over  the  course  of  7  years;  b)  the  extent to which the movement of NPMW are constrained by along-isopycnal advection; c) the intensity of diapycnal  mixing  across  a  range  of  potential  densities  from  the  surface  to  1000  m;  d)  the  origins,  residence  times,  and  fate  of  the  various  varieties  of  mode  waters;  e)  the  importance  of  the  timing  of  the  radionuclide  discharge  to  the  eventual  basin  scale  patterns  of  the  signal;  and f)  the  extent  to  which  the  high  resolution  model can  be  trusted  to  reproduce  the  4-dimensional  movement  and  evolution  of  these  water  masses  on  interannual  to  decadal  time  scales  in  the  Pacific  Ocean. These  scientific  goals  seek  to  extend  the  findings  from  prior  research  that  has  employed  the  unique  cesium  signature  from  the  2011  FDNPP  accidental  injection  of  radionuclides  to  the  ocean  to  better  understand  circulation  pathways  and  mixing in the western and eastern North Pacific. In this new study, the tools honed in previous efforts will be  used  to  expand  the  focus  to  include  the  full  breadth  of  the  North  Pacific  Basin  wherever  FDNPP  cesium  observations  are  available  and  to  press  forward  in  time  to  7  years  after  the  accident  through  the  inclusion of the many data sets recently made publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
