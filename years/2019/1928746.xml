<AbstractNarration>The SERYM annual meeting provides a unique opportunity for yeast researchers from states in the Southeastern region of the U.S. to come together to share their preliminary research findings, and discuss new research tools and emerging technologies. Yeasts are an important model for the study of complex molecular, cellular, biochemical and evolutionary processes.  The requested NSF support will fund the travel expenses of student participants in an effort to maximize the number of undergraduate and graduate students that can attend this meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeast researchers have made significant contributions in areas as diverse as fungal evolution, DNA damage/repair, gene expression, RNA processing, cell cycle progression, chromosome segregation, prion propagation, autophagy, and organelle biogenesis/maintenance.The SERYM 2019 conference organizers are placing particular&lt;br/&gt;emphasis on fostering science discussions during the meeting and promoting exchange of new ideas among participants, with a particular focus to stimulate undergraduate and graduate attendees in making presentations during the meeting and engaging in interactions with more senior scientists. This meeting,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
