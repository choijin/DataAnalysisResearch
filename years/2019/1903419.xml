<AbstractNarration>Technology use among teenagers has greatly increased without a concomitant increase cybersecurity skills in this population. Several factors, including lack of standard high school cybersecurity curricula, and lack of cybersecurity awareness among teens, have contributed to teenagers becoming targets of cybercrimes such as cyberbullying. This research aims to leverage the increased technology use of teens to (a) develop a security mindset at the high school level, (b) spread awareness of the risks and threats associated with use of smartphone/tablets and other tech, and (c) inculcate interest in cybersecurity careers (with a long-term goal of addressing the national shortage of cybersecurity workforce). The project seeks to achieve these goals by providing cybersecurity training through interactive, animated visualizations so that students develop an interest in cybersecurity careers. Educators will have access to the educational materials developed which may lead to the better assessment of students' cybersecurity skills. This new interactive animated visualization framework for high school cybersecurity education has the potential for wider, nationwide adoption. As cybersecurity continues to become a national and global security threat, this research will facilitate the development of a new generation of workforce and a safer cyber-environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop an innovative teaching plan and pedagogical methods for high school cybersecurity education. The framework will be designed and used in a summer camp setting to help students understand cybersecurity threats, defense, and prevention mechanisms. Open-source smartphone app development tools will be integrated into the curriculum to determine if the framework aids teens in understanding the cybersecurity risks. A series of research questions will investigate the extent to which the "new" curriculum promotes a better understanding of cybersecurity. The effectiveness and rigor of this curriculum will be measured in several ways, including (a) using a task load index to quantify rigor, (b) administering surveys to gain insight about students' motivation and perceptions of cybersecurity, and (c) analyzing students' learning using analytical course rubrics. Deliverables of this project will involve (a) interactive animated visualization based cybersecurity tutorials for summer camp mode delivery to high school students, (b) availability of all tutorials for accessibility to other educators, and (c) publications and meeting presentations to share project outcomes more widely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
