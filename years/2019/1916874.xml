<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;Molecular electronics is based on the quantum properties of nanoscale materials and offers unique potential for high density electronic circuitry. This project seeks to advance the science and technology of a basic building block of molecular electronics - the molecular tunnel junction. Tunnel junction devices have a wide range of applications, including detectors, high frequency circuits, and quantum computing. This project will develop molecular charge rectifiers with functionality complementary to commercial silicon diodes. The project encompasses fundamental studies in physics and chemistry as well as device engineering in a broad range of experimental conditions. This project is well-aligned with current national efforts on quantum technologies as well as the Quantum Leap NSF Big Idea. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students on the interface between inorganic chemistry and applied physics. They will be involved with an interdisciplinary and international group of collaborators developed by the principal investigator. The project will integrate research with educational activities such as a Physics Summer Camp and a Capstone Research Program for undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at investigating the transport properties of metal-molecule-metal junctions, with the goal to understand charge current rectification in molecular tunnel junctions and pave the way towards developing molecular charge rectifiers with functionalities complementary to commercial silicon-based diodes. The project encompasses chemistry, physics, device engineering, as well as fundamental studies in a broad range of experimental conditions. The proposed studies will lead to a better understanding of molecular rectification and transport in molecular junctions, in view of advancing knowledge enabling future technological applications in molecular electronics. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) investigate and quantify the conduction of charge carriers through molecular junctions of the form metal-molecule-metal and (2) elucidate the design of highly efficient molecular charge rectifying devices for future use in molecular electronic applications. This project will advance the fundamental understanding electrical charge and spin conduction in molecular junctions. The projected studies will help elucidate the design of operative and highly efficient molecular charge rectifying devices for future use in molecular electronic applications. Several students will be trained at the interface between inorganic chemistry and fundamen-tal and applied physics and exposed to a highly interdisciplinary international net of collaborations that the PI has established over many years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aligns well with current national efforts on quantum technologies, as illustrated by the National Quantum Initiative Act and the Quantum Leap NSF Big Idea. The PI will integrate the proposed research with three main educational activities: (1) a Physics Summer Camp offred at no cost to high-performing high-school students in the Orlando metropolitan area, (2) a Service-Learning Nanoscience Minor, where undergraduate students outreach to middle schools in the area to disseminate research in nanoscience, and (3) a Collaborative Physical Science Capstone Research Program, a one-of-a-kind multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary junior/senior capstone research experience to facilitate transition into the profession to physical science undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
