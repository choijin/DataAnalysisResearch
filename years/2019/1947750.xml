<AbstractNarration>This funding renews a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Montana State University.  A team of experienced faculty mentors will guide undergraduate students in summer research projects focused on cybersecurity algorithms, particularly algorithms to defend against cyber-attacks.  They will use a unique environment called the Software Factory that helps them apply sound software engineering and development techniques as they develop and test their algorithms.   The site will recruit a cohort of 10 students each summer with a focus on students from non-research-intensive institutions as well as students from groups traditionally under-represented in the computing fields.  The students will also participate in other professional development that will help prepare them for graduate studies and other careers in computing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the intellectual focus on cybersecurity algorithms and the strong faculty group guiding the research as well as the state-of-the art facilities the students will use.  The research focuses on the important area of cybersecurity attacks, in particular: source code analysis and detection of software weaknesses and vulnerabilities, attack pattern detection through machine learning, anomaly detection, and blockchain based reporting of threats.  The objectives of the site are to expose undergraduate students to real-world and innovative cybersecurity algorithms research grounded in modern software engineering environments, to encourage more undergraduates to continue their academic careers and seek graduate degrees in computer science and related disciplines, to develop research skills and improve communication and collaborative skills, and to foster collaboration and entrepreneurship in the development of demonstrable prototype software through the Software Factory environment.  This site has the potential to contribute to the body of knowledge of cybersecurity research and to help develop the future cybersecurity workforce, an area of critical need within the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
