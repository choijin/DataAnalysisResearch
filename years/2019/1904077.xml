<AbstractNarration>The core objective of this project is to evaluate whether, in an era of market-based, choice-oriented urban policy, parents' cognitive and socioemotional skills facilitate access to neighborhood and school contexts conducive to their children's skill growth and educational attainment. Highly skilled parents deploy distinct strategies to cultivate their children's intellectual and socioemotional development, which in turn promotes intergenerational mobility. Yet we know little about whether and how parents' skills facilitate their children's access to two domains that also shape intergenerational mobility: neighborhoods and schools. In an era of housing market and educational enrollment changes that foster increased choice and information access (e.g., Section 8 housing vouchers, school choice policies), do parents' intellectual and socioemotional skills predict entry into neighborhood and school contexts conducive to their children's skill growth and educational success? Armed with more choices and more information than ever before, parents with higher cognitive and socioemotional skill levels may be more likely to raise their children in higher-quality neighborhoods and place them into higher-quality schools, even when comparing parents with similar demographic backgrounds, economic circumstances, and educational attainment levels. In turn, access to higher-quality neighborhoods and schools may meaningfully shape children's subsequent cognitive and socioemotional skill growth and their likelihood of high school graduation and college enrollment.  Findings from investigation of these propositions will contribute to debates over opportunity and urban policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To investigate the questions of this project, two kinds of statistical models will be built: (1) discrete choice models of neighborhood and school selection and (2) value-added models of neighborhood and school effects on children's cognitive and socioemotional growth.  The primary data source includes approximately 1,000 time-varying, geocoded residential and school enrollment histories, collected over about ten years in the 2000s. These data will be combined with individual-level measures of cognitive and socioemotional skills, demographic characteristics, and educational attainment, as well as time-varying household-level measures of income and wealth and neighborhood- and school-level quality data derived from census, geographic information system, and administrative (i.e., state and local government) sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Race and class continue to play central roles given the durability of residential and educational segregation. However, the context of urban inequality is changing in ways that might amplify new drivers of neighborhood and school sorting. The ascendance of choice-based urban policies and the saturation of housing markets with digital information may enable parents who more frequently and deftly process large amounts of complex data to have a leg up in accessing high-status neighborhoods and schools.</p> <p>Jared N. Schachner and Robert J. Sampson tested this possibility as part of an NSF-funded doctoral dissertation research project entitled, "Structural and Skill-Based Sorting into Neighborhoods and Schools." They used a unique dataset tracking over a decade's worth of residential histories for a sample of families in Los Angeles County. Results suggest that even after confirming the important roles of race and class, parents' cognitive skills independently predicted which families ended up in the most affluent and educated neighborhoods.</p> <p>This research builds on a large body of work showing that despite the enactment of policies aimed at reducing racial discrimination in the housing market, racial segregation in America's metropolitan areas remains stubbornly high, and income segregation may be increasing, especially among households with children. While studies have tended to focus on institutional and preference-based discrimination to explain these patterns, they have overlooked other potential factors shaping residential sorting, like cognitive skills, especially in a context of increasingly complex and data-saturated housing markets and school enrollment processes. To clarify, cognition here refers to acquired knowledge reflecting a variety of social and environmental conditions, not to genetically transmitted, immutable ability (e.g., IQ).</p> <p>Sampson and Schachner hypothesized the information explosion saturating urban housing markets and transforming how Americans navigate them may intensify highly-skilled parents' preferences for neighborhoods they perceive as conducive to their children's success. The benefits of affluent neighborhoods are more tangible than ever, with popular websites like NeighborhoodScout, Zillow, and Redfin offering constantly proliferating quantitative measures of neighborhood quality (e.g., school quality, crime, housing value appreciation).</p> <p>Highly-skilled parents may not only be more likely to seek out and employ this information in decision-making, but may be more likely to secure first-mover advantages in accessing units in high-status neighborhoods. Just as real estate agents and landlords have long engaged in race- and class-based steering, these important gatekeepers may reward people with perceived market knowledge and deft communication skills by prioritizing them when desirable dwellings in highly-coveted neighborhoods emerge.</p> <p>To test these possibilities, they developed a fine-grained residential selection model based on an original follow-up of the Los Angeles Family Neighborhood Survey, which provided residential histories for ~250 families from 2001-2012. They linked these histories to census, geospatial, and educational administrative data and developed a discrete-choice model that tests whether parents who score more highly on a reading comprehension test (as a measure of cognitive skills) were disproportionately likely to reside within neighborhoods containing more highly-educated and affluent residents.</p> <p>As predicted, parents with higher cognitive skill scores were more likely to sort their families into the most advantaged neighborhoods even after accounting for the unique spatial structure of Los Angeles County and confirming the expected effects of race, income, housing market conditions, and spatial proximity on residential selection.</p> <p>One could counter that highly-skilled parents with economic resources are selecting neighborhoods not on the basis of residents' income and education but instead on the basis of perceived school quality. Indeed, among middle/upper-middle class families, parental skills predict selecting neighborhoods with higher-scoring local public schools specifically, rather than those with more affluent residents generally. Supplementary analyses show that within this middle/upper-middle class group, more highly-skilled parents are more likely to report neighborhood school quality as a driver of residential mobility.</p> <p>The researchers conclude that parental cognitive skills may be an emerging axis along which intergenerational inequality is unfolding.
