<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The Fellow is being mentored by two sponsoring scientists, James D. Bever and Joy K. Ward at the University of Kansas. The research presented by the Fellow has the potential to broaden our understanding of soil microbes, as a counterbalance to atmospheric CO2 enrichment, especially in prairie ecosystems. In these habitats, monarch butterflies depend on milkweed for carbon-based chemical extracts that protect them from predators and may also have implications for cancer therapy. However, little is known as to how these carbon-based chemical extracts, termed cardenolides, may be altered in response to increase in CO2 influx. These changes may have consequences on monarch survival and food-web structure. Understanding how soil microbes may help mitigate outcomes of atmospheric CO2 enrichment, could provide insight into ecosystem sustainability. The experiments being executed by the Fellow also allow for training of undergraduates, including TRIO McNair Scholars at the University of Kansas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under growth-chamber conditions, atmospheric CO2 will be manipulated for a broad range of native milkweed species, native AM-fungal species and a microbial control. Response variables, including milkweed chemical extracts, will be measured using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Examination of multi-trophic responses, including native milkweed quality, native monarch larval performance, and native AM-fungal colonization rates; will reveal how CO2 enrichment may impact plant-microbe-insect interactions. This project also affords an interdisciplinary approach for mentees seeking experience in environmental microbiology, global change biology or chemical ecology. Additionally, the Fellow can inspire mentees of similar origin, including first-generation Americans (Haitian-American), community college students, as well as minorities from the inner-city (Mattapan, Boston). Through the opportunities afforded by the National Science Foundation, the Fellow will broaden participation and our understanding of microbes in global change biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
