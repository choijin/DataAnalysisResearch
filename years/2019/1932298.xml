<AbstractNarration>This grant provides support for the workshop entitled "Computational Mechanics Vision and Future Challenges", to be held on October 31-November 1, 2019 at the University of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Computational mechanics is a diverse field with different methodologies and techniques that are used to solve fundamental and important problems in various application areas. Because of the constant need for predictive computational modeling in both established and newly emerging research fields, computational mechanics plays a key role in many future scientific developments. However, it faces new challenges and opportunities from the rise to prominence of artificial intelligence, complex infrastructure, additive manufacturing as well as a newly urgent focus on health. This has created a significant need to identify the future challenges and research and educational opportunities facing the computational mechanics community in these areas. The objective of this workshop is to solicit and synthesize directions for computational mechanics research and education in the United States over the next decade and beyond. Funding from this grant will support planning activities, production of a report, and travel of invited participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this one-and-a-half-day workshop, leading experts across a wide cross-section of the computational mechanics community will convene in an interactive setting to discuss ways to address emerging challenges in the areas of data-driven modeling/machine learning, additive manufacturing, risk and uncertainty-based engineering, and medicine. We will ensure the participation of a diverse audience through various means, including specifically targeting women and underrepresented minorities and early career professionals, along with mid-career and senior faculty and representatives from industry and government, such that all stakeholders participate in the future directions of the computational mechanics community. The product of the workshop will be a report with recommendations for NSF and the larger computational mechanics field, which will be widely disseminated across the spectrum of academia, government, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop objective was to solicit and synthesize directions for computational mechanics research and education in the United States over the next decade and beyond.     Four themes were selected for discussion, two vertical and two horizontal.

As scientific advances in these emerging areas are coming to the forefront, it is an opportune time for the computational mechanics community to face research and educational challenges and opportunities, and for NSF to make investments to accelerate progress in these areas. Therefore, each of these focus areas was discussed in detail to identify critical gaps and problems that need to be addressed to move the field forward, and to identify other areas where cross-fertilization may be particularly impactful.     A workshop report was produced based on the extensive discussions by both breakout groups and all participants, which was co-authored by the workshop PIs, with input from all participants.  The overarching themes and recommendations can be summarized as:     A first issue that arose in all focus area discussions is the need to establish field-relevant and field-specific open source repositories that house benchmark data, which is essential for challenge, benchmark and validation problems.

Finally, it is important to incentivize the sharing of codes and data that result from federal funding, to enable the growth and visibility of these open source repositories.     A second issue concerns the fact that as computational mechanics becomes a convergent discipline in the sense that it is needed in nearly all emerging and critical scientific disciplines, there is considerable difficulty and confusion that arises from the lack of common language and terminology across disciplines.  This confusion hinders or significantly delays researchers from considering these multidisciplinary scientific challenges.

Third, many discussions centered around the need for new funding models that reward truly interdisciplinary teams involving engineers, biologists, mathematicians and statisticians, computer scientists, etc., that are needed to tackle the complex technical challenges that emerged from the workshop.  Furthermore, there are opportunities for the NSF and other federal funding agencies, industry and National Labs to formulate and support research challenges and open questions; for example, a common theme between all focus areas was the challenges involved in modeling material fracture and failure.  Existing funding possibilities that could enable such projects include NRT or GOALI calls, though it seems likely that new, interdisciplinary funding mechanisms may be most effective in meeting this objective.     Finally, participants recognized the need for new educational paradigms given the current disconnect between current undergraduate and graduate curricula, and the emerging focus areas discussed at the workshop.

Furthermore, the complex, multidisciplinary nature of these problems also points to a need to educate current researchers.  Focused tutorial-based workshops that are meant to educate attendees represent one possible approach to help achieve this objective.
