<AbstractNarration>The 2019 Gordon Research Conference and associated Gordon Research Seminar on the topic of Micro and Nanoscale Phase Change Heat Transfer is the third such Gordon Conference and is held in Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco, Lucca Italy. The conference brings together leading experts in the field of micro and nanoscale phase change heat transfer as well as experts outside the field whose work is of great relevance to the overall heat transfer community. The goal of the conference is to present the latest in fundamental research, and to highlight the most promising future research directions. The meeting also provides a unique forum where graduate students, postdoctoral associates and other young researchers can interact informally with established members of the field. This year, for the first time, a separate Gordon Research Seminar is included, organized and run entirely by young researchers, for young researchers, offering them an opportunity to present their work, interact with one another, and participate in mentoring activities to help them advance their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall field associated with the conference is of critical importance to a number of areas including the HVAC, power generation, and chemical process industries, electronics cooling and process intensification efforts, space exploration, the development of extraterrestrial habitats, the generation of pure water in inhospitable areas and climate change. This Gordon Research Conference also hosts a Power Hour, a mentoring experience specifically targeted to women. All women from the GRS or GRC are invited to attend, share their experiences, and interact with senior women mentors in the field. Here they can discuss issues of unique importance to women, helping to train the next generation of female leaders in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Micro and Nanoscale Phase Change Heat Transfer was held at the Renaissance Tuscany II Ciocco Resort from February 2 through February 8, 2019.   The meeting covered a variety of scientific topics ranging from adsorption fundamentals and water harvesting to condensation and frost formation.  The content presented was highly rated by participants.  Intellectual Merit  The conference was quite interdisciplinary with particpants from multiple engineering and scientific fields and four continents exchanging their latest research on phase change heat transfer.  As in past conferences, the majority of the discussions revolved around liquid/vapor phase change but there were timely sessions on advanced modeling and experimental techniques that were quite unique and informative. Several new research directions and new topic synergies were identified at the conference though details of what was discussed remain confidential, as in all Gordon Conferences.  The conference program is made public by GRC and can be found at:  https://www.grc.org/micro-and-nanoscale-phase-change-heat-transfer-conference/2019/  The conference chair sent a synopsis of key findings presented at the conference, potential future research directions driven by those findings, and topics for the next conference to all registered participants and government program monitors who supported the conference.  Broader Impacts  The Conference was well-attended with 113 participants. Scientists from academia represented 90% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 2% and those from industry totaled 2%. The meeting also attracted a strong mix of young investigators and senior scientists. Students and post-docs accounted for 43% of all attendees. Approximately 19% of the participants at the 2019 meeting were women.  Sufficient funds were raised from government and private sources to cover conference registration fees for the organizers and speakers, to support the conference social program, and to provide a registration rebate to every participant, especially students, young researchers and session moderators.  This was the first time a Gordon Research Symposium was held with the conference.  Two students, one from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the other from the University of Maryland, organized and ran the entire symposium.  Several other students served as session moderators.  Entire symposium was free of senior personnel influence so that all thos participating in the symposium got a feel and introduction to how to run a scientific meeting.  The conference also hosted a well-attended Power Hour designed to address the particular concerns and challenges faced by women in the research workplace.  A number of isues were discussed including work-life balance and lessons kearned from the #MeToo movement.  We decided that the scope of the conference should be broadened beyond the liquid-vapor phase change phenomena and associated heat transfer characteristics that has dominated this and past conferences.  This decision is an attempt to attract a much wider audience and to capitalize on much of the common phyiscs associated with all manner of phase change phenomena.  These changes would broaden the impact of the conference as a whole.  The next conference will be called Micro and Nanoscale Phase Change Phenomena.  We also decided to try and hold the next conference in California, within the month of January, so that the dates of the conference would not be as affected by the start of academic terms as was the case this time.  This should boost attendance and the ability of more students and young researchers to attend.             Last Modified: 10/06/2019       Submitted by: Joel L Plawsky]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
