<AbstractNarration>Data + Computing = Discovery (DCD) combines faculty from many programs at Stony Brook University to work with enthusiastic undergraduate students and advance knowledge in many disciplines, including life sciences, social sciences, engineering, and physical sciences. The unifying themes for the REU site are computational and data sciences, which are inherently interdisciplinary and becoming complementary avenues for scientific investigation alongside experiment and theory. Furthermore, the number of students, particularly undergraduates, who develop the required skills for success in computational and data sciences without access to training is very small. Thus, DCD offers resources and training to undergraduate students in computational and data sciences, which will drive new lines of scientific inquiry and research. Once at DCD, participants will learn computer programming skills, apply these skills to research, practice communicating ideas for broad audiences, and meet other outstanding young students. The primary impact of DCD is the lifetime of contributions to many fields of study from the participants that DCD helps assemble, train, and inspire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish these goals, DCD will host undergraduate participants for a 9-week program every summer. Participants will be matched with Stony Brook faculty who are expert in the physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, and social sciences and have established records of high productivity both in computational research and in fostering student engagement. In addition to working on an original research project with these faculty members, every DCD participant will (i) participate in a course on computer programming with Python, (ii) complete a research methods workshop on the practice of research from ideation to publication, (iii) learn about careers and graduate school opportunities in computational and data sciences, (iv) practice communicating their ideas to a variety of technical and non-technical audiences, (v) present their research in a poster symposium, and (vi) enjoy social and networking activities with other students to form long-term collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
