<AbstractNarration>Concentrations and source assessment of black carbon across tropical Atlantic air and sediment&lt;br/&gt;PI: Lohmann (URI); co-PI: Pockalny (URI)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black carbon is formed during the incomplete burning of fuels (e.g., the black clouds of smoke emitted by buses and trucks). Black carbon does not degrade easily in the environment and can be transported long distances, even reaching the seafloor. Yet the fluxes of black carbon in the environment are not well known, particularly in the oceans. Rivers are considered the dominant source of black carbon to the oceans. However, recent results suggest that there may be regions of the ocean where the atmospheric delivery of black carbon may be important. This study investigates whether biomass burning (e.g., wildfires) in Africa is a source of black carbon to the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The unique molecular and isotopic properties of black carbon will be used to identify black carbon  in the atmosphere, water and sediment in the study region. Sediment, water column and atmospheric particles will be collected during a 3-week research cruise across the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Two different approaches will be used to quantify black carbon in the environment. The research is relevant and timely for our understanding of the carbon cycle, a key component of our ability to forecast climate and its change. The project supports a graduate student and provide opportunities for high school students participating in the SMILE Program (Science and Math Investigative Learning Experiences). This project is jointly funded by the Chemical Oceanography Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surface sediment samples will be collected at ten sites across the tropical Atlantic Ocean in a region known to be impacted by biomass burning events (wildfires) in Africa. Appropriate locations for sediment sampling will be identified using state-of-the-art ship equipment to ensure a successful coring operation. Once collected, the black carbon and organic carbon fractions of the sediment will be isolated and measured. A range of isotopic and molecular marker approaches will be used to identify the likely source of these carbon fractions. The central hypothesis is that the black carbon residing in the sediment of the tropical Atlantic Ocean is derived from biomass burning and delivered through atmospheric deposition. Carbon derived from recent biomass burning contains C-14 isotopes that indicate ?young? (or recently produced) carbon, while carbon from fossil fuels (?old carbon?) has no C-14 due to radioactive decay. To further assess the origin of the black carbon in the region, water column and atmospheric particles will be collected during the research cruise. The origin of the atmospheric black carbon particles (biomass burning or fossil fuel emissions) will be established through a collaboration with colleagues in Sweden. The broader impacts of this research include the engagement of high school students through The SMILE Program (Science and Math Investigative Learning Experiences) at the University of Rhode Island. The project also provides training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, with a focus on recruitment of students from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
