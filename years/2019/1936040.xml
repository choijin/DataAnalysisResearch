<AbstractNarration>System-on-Chip (SoC) is the driving force behind computing and communication in a wide variety of electronic systems, ranging from simple devices in smart homes to complex systems in satellites. Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a commonly used solution for on-chip communication between components in complex SoCs. To meet cost and time-to-market constraints, SoCs are designed using various hardware components, often gathered from untrusted third-party vendors. Despite increasing importance of trusted communication in overall system security, NoC security is relatively under-investigated. This project will develop a secure NoC architecture to enable trusted communication between components in NoC-based SoCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two important objectives. The first objective is to develop automated tools and techniques that work across diverse communication technologies including electrical, optical and wireless NoCs while meeting energy and performance requirements as well as real-time constraints.  The second objective is to develop a secure and lightweight on-chip communication architecture that enables secure data communication, anonymous routing to maintain communication privacy, finding trusted paths in the presence of malicious components, real-time detection and localization of denial-of-service and buffer overflow attacks, and validation and evaluation of NoC security architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project are three-fold: bridging computation and communication security, integration of research and education, and involvement of undergraduates and minority students. Secure NoC architecture will enable trusted SoC design with untrusted components when combined with existing security solutions. Ongoing collaboration with different companies will enable the application of the security solutions on industrial SoCs. This project will integrate research and educational activities by developing modified courses with an NoC security module, as well as dissemination of research results through publications, seminars, tutorials and panels. This project will involve female and under-represented minority students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to produce a wide variety of data that would be immensely helpful for future research and education in the engineering community. Knowledge, tools, methodologies and data generated in this project will be made publicly available through the project web page (https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/cad/NoC.html). The web page will include all the relevant materials related to NoC security architecture as well as associated tools and techniques to enable incremental encryption and authentication, trust-aware routing, anonymous routing, and real-time attack detection and localization, in a wide variety of on-chip communication architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
