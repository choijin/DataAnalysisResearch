<AbstractNarration>This project uses funds, under the auspices of the EArly Concept Grant For Exploratory Research (EAGER) program, to focus on ways to take advantage of recent advances in mass spectrometry and data analysis in order to produce quantitative measures of temperature and precipitation from the paleoclimate record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An initial analytical finding suggests that the 88Strontium/86Strontium ratio in carbonates is sensitive to changes in temperature.  This ideal relationship has been found to be complicated by limited experimental data that suggest that other factors, such as growth kinetics may play a role in this value.  The researcher made some initial measurements using high temperature and low temperature carbonates and the data are encouraging to the extent that there seems to be a strong relationship between 88Strontium/86Strontium and temperature.  There is no data on hand, however, to convincingly demonstrate temperature dependence in the range of temperature relevant for paleoclimate.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) coupled with the "double spike" method could allow enough accuracy and precision to test the idea.  In addition, stalagmites from Fort Stanton Cave that grew through the full climate swings that took place from the Last Glacial to the Early Holocene are ideal for analysis and are in-hand.  The Strontium isotopic work will be attempted in a laboratory that houses a new generation of amplifier that would make it possible to obtain very accurate and precise 88Strontium/86Strontium ratios, sufficient to resolve potential changes in temperature at a scale relevant for paleoclimate.  The researcher will also work on the design of a sample chamber that can accommodate long stalagmite samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another aspect of the project that holds promise is the combined technical achievements in high-throughput and high-quality elemental data using newer excimer lasers coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instruments and new ways to look at data using machine learning. Initial results by the researcher show that some trace elements, especially alkali and alkali-earth elements, may coherently vary with stable isotopes, thus providing the multidimensional data needed for machine learning applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities are scientifically important and fit well into the potentially transformative, high-risk but potential high payoff research attributes of the EAGER program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
