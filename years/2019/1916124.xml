<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Blue Heron, an 86-foot Coastal research vessel owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large Lakes Observatory as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF). Built in 1985 for fishing on the Grand Banks, the Blue Heron was purchased by the University of Minnesota in 1997. She is outfitted with state-of-the-art research equipment, has berthing for 11 crew and scientists, and can operate 24 hours per day for up to 21 days in between port calls. The Blue Heron is part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) and is available for charter by research scientists on any of the Great Lakes. In 2018, the vessel completed 44 funded days where 21 (48%) were for NSF. In 2019, Blue Heron is currently scheduled for 75 days, 60 of these (80%) will be for NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) ADCP 150 kHz system upgrade $68,000 &lt;br/&gt;2) ADCP 600 kHz system upgrade $35,000 &lt;br/&gt;3) Pole mount for interim         $14,000 &lt;br/&gt;     $117,000 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Minnesota Duluth purchased an upgrade to the acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) on the research vessel Blue Heron using funds provided by the National Science Foundation award OCE#1916124 "Oceanographic Instrumentation 2019 RV Blue Heron".  The upgraded ADCP will help the scientists that use the vessel by ensuring that the ship is able to collect data into the future reliably.  The upgrade was necessary since the 21-year-old unit that was installed on the vessel was starting to have intermittent failures and was no longer supported by the manufacturer.      The upgraded ADCP is available to all users of the R/V Blue Heron, including the four National Science Foundation funded projects that will use the vessel in 2021: Jay Austin’s ‘Radiatively driven convection in a large freshwater lake’ project (OCE-PO-1829895), Sergei Katsev’s ‘Does Organic sulfur make a significant and overlooked contribution to sediment sulfate reduction in low-sulfate environment?’ project (EAR-GG-1754061), Sam Kelly’s ‘Coastal inertial-band dynamics: separating forced and free responses in a natural laboratory’ project (OCE-PO-1635560), and Josef Werne’s ‘Cyanobacteria, nitrogen cycling, and export production in the Laurentian Great Lakes’ project (OCE-CO-1948739).  Besides the NSF funded projects, we are supporting several other science projects in 2021: two Great Lakes Observing System (NOAA) cruises, two Sea Grant cruises and multiple research and educational cruises funded by the University of Minnesota.  The educational cruises will allow close to 160 undergraduate students to be exposed to scientific research on Lake Superior.
