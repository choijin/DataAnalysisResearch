<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses one of the largest problems facing the aging U.S. power grid: integrating distributed energy assets to proactively supply clean energy to the electricity grid to supplant peak power derived from expensive fossil-fuel generators.  The proposed innovation, a blockchain-enabled "Virtual Power Plant" (VPP) network that autonomously aggregates power from distributed energy assets, will allow retail consumers to sell excess power (derived from clean energy) to promote decentralization without sacrificing grid stability, with potential for saving upwards of $10 B/year on transmission and distribution losses alone.  This innovation fosters a sustainable value proposition to the entire grid ecosystem, while enabling the utility and/or grid operator to maintain observability, retain grid control, and obviate regulatory hurdles that other grid modernization efforts may encounter.  The further benefits of a blockchain-based VPP are inherent cybersecurity, full transparency over how much electricity comes from renewable sources, as well as an immutable record of how much energy is stored/available in Behind-the-Meter systems at any given time.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create a distributed ledger for grid-tied Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), wherein the blockchain environment establishes a transactive energy marketplace, designed for drop-in readiness for interoperability with commercially-installed infrastructure.  The core objectives are to: i) build the database comprising operational data from power electronics components representative of the nearly 2 million residential solar installations in the US; ii) develop the energy tokens that are ascribed to the energy unit data from the database; and develop the smart contract framework to effectuate the transactive energy marketplace, where rules can be implemented to enable customers to participate in the $35.9 B market for demand-response services (2025 estimate).  The database and transactive energy environment will be designed such that Phase II efforts surrounding data analytics to maximize the value of grid services revenue streams, as well as AI-driven optimization of aggregation mechanisms and energy utilization, can drive the enterprise value of the solution.  An open-source private, permissioned blockchain architecture will be leveraged for Phase I efforts, such that the work can focus on designing a concept demonstrates that emulates transactive energy environments, to refine the value proposition under various scenarios for market validation and driving customer acquisition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for the General Public  Award #: 1938132  Company: EnerBlock LLC     Intellectual Merit  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project successfully designed and built a high-integrity distributed ledger framework for managing distributed energy resources (DERs) that can be connected to an electricity grid.  This blockchain-based "Virtual Power Plant" framework was able to monitor and track energy flowing from a programmable power source to an energy storage system, and from the energy storage system to a programmable power load.  This Phase I bench-test system successfully emulated a residential battery module that could provide backup power during a power outage, and was also able to participate in a simulated Demand Response program while the emulated grid was active.  The overarching technical objective was to determine whether energy could be tokenized and tracked throughout any power electronics hardware configuration, thereby enabling an energy auditing tool for energy generation, storage and consumption.  The development of blockchain tokens that correspond to energy also allowed an external entity (i.e. the Utility or grid operator) to observe how much power was stored and available to request, without sacrificing privacy or cybersecurity for the participating resident in a demand response program.        Broader Impacts  EnerBlock has determined that an asset-based blockchain is an extremely efficient way to operate and monetize a residential demand response program to reduce costs for the Utility while expanding the role of distributed green energy solutions such as rooftop solar.  Moreover, this framework is well-suited to expand the role residential grid batteries can play in providing backup power to lower income neighborhoods that bear the economic brunt of power outages.  The ability to provide grid resilience and energy security to those most adversely affected will deliver substantial socioeconomic benefits when coupled with the many state and federal programs focused on providing energy efficiency to low income neighborhoods.     This Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.
