<AbstractNarration>Innovations in consumer finance offering consumers choices in financial products have not increased consumers' ability to take advantage of these choices. Surveys show low financial literacy rates among US adults, resulting in financial mistakes that hurt consumers' financial well-being.  Financial education to improve financial literacy have failed because of the false assumption that consumers are aware of the benefits of learning to make financial choices.  This research project will use experimental methods to study how information on the benefits of financial education affects consumers' financial decision making.  Specifically, it addresses three questions:  (i) Are consumers aware of the benefits of learning? (ii) how does awareness (or lack thereof) affect financial decisions?, and (iii) How can policy-makers complement consumers' awareness using benefit disclosure with financial education to improve financial well-being?  The results of this research will provide inputs into financial decision making, which will lead to efficient financial decision making, increased savings and investment, hence economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal will investigate how benefit disclosure affect consumers' financial decision making.  The project first proposes a simple theoretical framework incorporating the cost of incentive perception to complement the standard costly-thinking approach. The project then tests the predictions from this framework in two experiments. The first experiment tests the precise mechanisms using incentivized choices in hypothetical controlled scenarios. This experiment manipulates three aspects of the decision environment independently: incentive levels, information about incentives, and education. While the first two variations are aimed directly at understanding the cost of incentive perception, the education treatment both links this project to existing research and more importantly, allows a test of the potential complementarity of the two information interventions. The second experiment focuses on information about incentives and education in a randomized control trial conducted. These two variations allow an investigation into the applicability of benefit disclosure and education, which are policies derived from the framework, in affecting naturalistic choices.  This results of this research will improve financial decision making, increase savings and investment and economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">Research in household finance has shown that consumers make financially sub-optimal choices, thus, leaving a substantial amount of money on the table in various types of financial decisions from loans, insurance to investment. One common explanation that has been offered is that consumers lack the financial skills to make these decisions well. Yet, attempts to improve financial literacy through financial education have yielded, at best, mixed results. Why do consumers choose financially sub-optimal products even though mistakes are highly costly and education is freely available?<br /> <br /> Through two experiments simulating financial decisions, this project looks at the obstacles to educational effectiveness and investigates alternative explanations to sub-optimal choices. On education, despite the availability of education, consumers may lack the time and energy to study the materials, rendering them ineffective. Thus, in the experiments, we measure the time subjects spend reading the extra materials to understand their level of engagement, and whether that engagement translates to better choices.<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, we recognize that providing education ignores two other potential factors affecting choice quality: (1) information about the stakes underlying choices and (2) numerical mistakes. First, research has revealed that financial decisions involve high stakes; but it is unclear whether the general public is aware of this fact. If they are not, then it is natural for them not to put in effort in the decisions or accessing education, thus, making poor choices. Second, because financial calculations are not straightforward and that variation in incentives often changes how easily calculations can be done, it is easy to make numerical mistakes in evaluating products. Large numerical mistakes may then explain why consumers choose the wrong products. While these alternative explanations are not directly related to financial education, they can offer complementary solutions (disclosure for (1) and calculation simplification for (2)) to education.<br /> <br /> To address both education and the alternatives, we recruit adult subjects from Amazon Mechanical Turk to choose health insurance plans for different health scenarios, and savings accounts, taking into account the interest rates and duration of savings. In these settings, we vary their access to financial education, their information on incentive levels, and the numerical range they face.<br /> <br /> The results from subjects&rsquo; choices confirm a major obstacle of education: subjects tend not to use the materials even when they are available. In both experiments, only a small minority of subjects access the additional information; when they do, they spend very little time reading those. Notably, we find that even when we increase the rewards for good choices, subjects do not spend more time on education. Furthermore, in our experiment on savings, we find evidence that those who obtain education forget how to apply this new knowledge, limiting any impact of education on long-term choices. Given this evidence, financial educators will need to invest more in methods to attract the attention of consumers to attain information not just once but also repeatedly, as and when they make decisions, to increase the effectiveness of education.<br /> <br /> Of the two alternatives, we find strong evidence for numerical mistakes. Subjects facing a larger numerical range make fewer mistakes without having to spend more time. Moreover, this result is present in both types of financial decisions and robust to tweaks in experimental design. In contrast, we do not find that information about stakes has an effect on subjects&rsquo; time or choices. This is notable because when this information is not available, subjects are unable to guess the stakes underlying their choices. This suggests that the problems may be too hard for stakes to matter.<br /> <br /> In summary, this project suggests that to improve decisions, choice simplification may be the fruitful next step. Simpler choices entail fewer numerical mistakes and require less attention to learn the steps to solve them. There is also a higher possibility to motivate consumers to put in more effort into simpler decisions.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/11/2020<br>      Modified by: Khanh Ngoc  Han&nbsp;Huynh</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
