<AbstractNarration>This project is developing a new open-source software platform and ecosystem, called OpenCilk, which is based on the award-winning Cilk parallel-computing technology.  As Moore's Law comes to an end, application performance will cease to improve - denying science, the national defense, and society the fruits of increasing performance - unless software can be engineered to run fast, especially through the use of parallel computing: the running of applications on multiple processors.  OpenCilk provides an easy-to-modify software platform to enable parallel-programming researchers to explore new ways to compute on modern parallel hardware.  Since parallel-programming research provides the technology that allows domain experts to program computationally intensive applications - including emerging national priorities such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computational engineering and science - this project fosters next-generation research in both parallel computing and computationally intensive application domains.  This project also supports Cilk Hub, a community-driven organization charged with maintaining and enhancing OpenCilk, as well as developing educational materials for parallel computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OpenCilk is a complete, robust, open-source, and easily accessible task-parallel programming system.  It provides a technology-transfer conduit to enable research contributions created by the parallel-computing research community to advance parallel programming as practiced by application developers.  Over time, this project aims to consolidate proven parallel-computing research results from the areas of languages, compilers, runtime systems, productivity tools, libraries, and application benchmarks, and then integrate them into OpenCilk.  The Cilk Hub organization develops and releases OpenCilk software, upstreams parallel-computing technology to mainstream codebases, and provides teaching materials and ancillary documentation.  It offers workshops and tutorials for researchers and developers, evaluates community satisfaction with the OpenCilk technology, and manages the integration of community-proposed enhancements to OpenCilk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
