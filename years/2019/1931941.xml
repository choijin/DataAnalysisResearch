<AbstractNarration>Micropollutants are chemical compounds that can cause harm to human and aquatic health, and due to their stability, they are persistent in the environment.  A few examples of such compounds include pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and many chemicals present in household products.  Micropollutants are often found in water at very small concentrations, which makes them difficult to remove via conventional water treatment processes.  Electrochemical treatment is a method that potentially can remove micropollutants more effectively and without generating waste. However, there are two major barriers preventing this technology from being deployed more widely.  First has been the lack of selectivity for this method in capturing and removing micropollutants. Second is that electrochemical treatment typically requires high energy inputs. The objective of this research project is to develop more selective electrochemically-driven micropollutant removal systems that have lower associated energy costs.  As part of this project the research team will undertake educational outreach at a Chicago K-8 charter school and develop tools for the formative assessment of middle schooler's understanding of relevant scientific knowledge.  In addition, the researchers will incorporate electrochemical water treatment cases into a new undergraduate elective course to train the next generation of water treatment professionals.  These educational aims will be closely aligned to the research carried out in the proposal to leverage intellectual merit and broader societal impacts.  The results of this project will increase STEM engagement and better prepare the next generation of leaders to improve our nation's water security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research project is to develop an electrochemically-mediated system that selectively removes micropollutants at low overpotentials.  The removal of micropollutants from water is an ongoing challenge due to their high chemical stability and persistence in the environment.  Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms and chemical pathways of the electrochemical degradation of micropollutants remain largely unexplored.  The proposed system is based on functionalized Faradaic electrodes that have high ion selectivity and fast electron-transfer properties within the aqueous stability window.  During this project the researchers will explore the effectiveness of Faradaic (redox-active) electrodes for the removal and conversion of selected micropollutants and will use transformation product analysis to elucidate mechanisms for ion-selectivity and electrochemical degradation.  The researchers also will develop a continuous flow system and parametric model to enable a comparative technoeconomic analysis of the process.  Micropollutants to be studied include heavy metal oxyanions, pharmaceutical and nitrosamine precursors, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The outcomes of this research are expected to lead to new insights into the role of Faradaic processes for micropollutant degradation and potentially lead to a practical treatment technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
