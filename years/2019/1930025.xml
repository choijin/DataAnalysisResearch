<AbstractNarration>Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is essential to the advancement and transformation of science and engineering. Over the last decade, the CI community has focused on developing secure, advanced, scalable, and global CI resources, tools, and services, creating an interoperable and collaborative CI ecosystem. In order to move forward strategically, it is critical to understand the impact that CI programs have had on the scientific research community. This award supports an effort to develop an understanding of this impact, by working with the Cyberinfrastructure community to understand and enhance the impact of programs such as NSF's Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) program and its predecessors. To this end, the PIs will gather relevant information, conduct a targeted survey, and prepare a report describing findings and mapping out the future directions of CI research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide new understanding of the impact of recent Data and Software Programs, through a systematic cross-cutting survey-based assessment. The assessment will seek to evaluate the impact of the activities funded under the Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBs), Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2), and Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) programs. The approach is to (1) determine the scope of the activity and establish a framework for design of the survey (2) design and administer the survey and (3) analyze the results and synthesize the findings into a report. The outcomes will benefit the scientific research community broadly, by providing insights into the most effective methods of research support in Cyberinfrastrucutre, and broadening the impact of advanced Cyberinfrastructure research on the science and engineering domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This technical report describes the methodology and results of a survey of Principal Investigators (PIs), co-PIs, and others in the Cyberinfrastructure (CI) research community. The survey had two primary purposes:   To inform decisions about changes to be made to the National Science Foundation(NSF) Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) solicitation. To inform decisions about the future direction and focus of the NSF CSSI umbrellaprogram.     The outcomes include:  Need for Change: Solicitation    The survey results clearly identified four aspects of the solicitation where change is needed and would make the most difference:  Types of awards ? the two classes of CSSI awards and the size, duration, and timing of the funding associated with each type. Combined software/data umbrella ? the inclusion of both software and data perspectives under a single umbrella scope Presentation of domain-specific interests ? the number of areas, the clarity of the descriptions, and the level of specificity and amount of detail provided Solicitation-specific criteria ? the appropriateness and number of additional solicitation-specific review criteria and the clarity and detail with which they are described      2. How to Change: Solicitation  All change options were selected by a significant portion of respondents (Please see the report for the detailed findings).   3. Need for Change: CSSI Direction &amp; Focus  The need for change was assessed from three perspectives:  Relevance of program assumptions for the next 1?5 years CSSI success in achieving its objectives CSSI success in implementing its guiding principles   4. How to Change: CSSI Direction &amp; Focus  This area was assessed by having respondents indicate what they think CSSI?s investment priorities should be for the next 1?5 years. Based on a thematic analysis, the rank order for the top investment priorities was:  Data Software Learning/Workforce Development Networking AI/Machine Learning Collaborations Security/Resilience     The outcomes will benefit the scientific research community broadly, by providing insights into the most effective methods of research support in CI, and broadening the impact of advanced CI research on the science and engineering domains.
