<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to University of Oregon, located in Eugene, OR, supports the training of a total of 26 students for 10 weeks over the summers of 2021-2023. In this program, supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, students engage in research projects in the fields of chemistry, physics and materials science. In addition to conducting publishable research using state-of-the-art instrumentation, the students participate in research seminars, weekly research meetings, and social events. Weekly webinars with established scientists and their students from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East afford students a global environmental perspective. Workshops focused on career science communication, applying for fellowships, and responsible research conduct complement the research experience and prepare students for graduate school and careers in the chemical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of the students' projects are focused on topics broadly related to the environment. From the development of new solar materials, to the synthesis of new catalysts, to the creation of greener nanoparticle systems and the increased fundamental understanding of oil dispersants, these projects allow students to address scientific problems of current national need.  While open to all students, this site targets students that are less likely to have research and mentorship opportunities at their home institutions, particularly students from primarily undergraduate institutions and underrepresented groups. Ultimately, the research training and professional development offered by this site serve to broaden participation in the sciences and strengthen the technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
