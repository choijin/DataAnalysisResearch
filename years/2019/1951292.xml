<AbstractNarration>This award to the Materials Research Society supports mainly the participation of  US based-scientists at the Tenth African Materials Research Society (A-MRS) Conference. The A-MRS conferences bring unique value by pulling together leading international scientists and engineers to discuss recent advances in broad areas of materials research and to help define future research priorities including in areas of critical need for Africa. The themes for the 10th A-MRS conference include materials for energy; health, nanoscience/nanotechnology; agriculture/Environment; sustainable buildings and constructions; computational materials science;  and materials for mining and mineral processing. The conference also includes sessions on education/networking in materials science and engineering curriculum development, web-based learning, exchanges, summer schools on manufacturing and structural materials. The themes of the conference appropriately address topics of interest to the global community as well as issues specific to Africa.  The funds will support travel and participation costs of students and young scientists currently working in American universities, some support will also be used to bring in leading senior international scientists and African graduate students. The Conference will be held at the Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) in Arusha, Tanzania in December 2019.  Organized by the African-MRS with strong support of the Materials Research Society (MRS), the heart of the Conference is to build knowledge, foster relationships and promote action to further the understanding in the broad fields associated with materials science and technology. Similar to past African-MRS Conferences, participants will come from around the world, with an anticipated attendance of 500. The award is from Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The AMRS conference is the primary venue for African Materials Scientists to meet and discuss their basic and applied work. Their work should have major long-term impact on helping Africa transform from a primarily resource-based extractive economy in which raw materials are shipped abroad to generate value added final products, to a region where final products are made and a knowledge-based economy develops. This will have enormous impact on the local and regional economies, employment and social development.  A plenary presentation given by Prof. Askwar Hilonga (NM-AIST) and a special session on the Future of Work both highlighted these impacts and their importance for African scientists.  During the meeting, both basic and applied research was discussed, bringing together an international community of scientists focused on the materials research relevant to the African materials community. Keynote addresses given by world leading scientists, including Prof. John Rogers, added considerable pedagogical value for the attendees.  Fourteen US graduate students and over fifty faculty and other US researchers attended the meeting to present their work, discuss scientific and technology interests and priorities, and explore collaboration opportunities.  Total meeting attendence was approx. 300.  The meeting served as an important opportunity for scientific, engineering and policy dialogue. There was extensive continental (African) and intercontinental networking and exchange of ideas in materials.  In the two days prior the conference, we held 9 training sessions I the following areas:  Crystallography Electrospinning Live Cycle Assessment Impact of Materials on Society I &amp; II Electrochemical Energy Technologies I &amp; II Computational Biology and Physics Nanoscale Biosensors Building Materials at the Human Scale Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy        Last Modified: 04/01/2021       Submitted by: Eric L Garfunkel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
