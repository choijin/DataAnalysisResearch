<AbstractNarration>This Noyce Track 4 Research project is a collaborative endeavor to examine teacher induction as an aspect of teacher preparation that affects the way teachers become embedded within their professional community.  It will look at how being a member of a specific Community of Practice (CoP) influences teacher identity, belief in their personal teaching abilities, and desire to remain in the profession related to teacher retention. The institutions (SUNY at Stony Brook University, University of Kentucky, Kennesaw State University, University of Minnesota, University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, and the University of Missouri-St. Louis) in this study span the U.S. and represent successful Noyce teacher preparation programs with a variety of recruitment strategies (e.g., career changers), induction support structures (e.g., online), and teacher placements (e.g., rural vs. urban). These six sites will also allow for a comparison of Noyce and non-Noyce teachers emerging from the different teacher preparation programs.  The goal is to determine whether a core set of program features contributes to the success of each induction program, or if distinct program features are useful for unique populations (e.g., periodic face-to-face meetings for career changers, or online support for urban teachers). The project also seeks to determine which program features lead to different community structures (e.g., collaborating mainly with teachers inside or outside the school), and how that community affects a teacher's perception of the profession (e.g., teacher is connected to professionals across the state and wants to remain in the profession as a career). The primary research methodology used in this research study is Social Network Analysis, which will be used to determine with whom teachers exchange information related to their teaching. The study will benefit the field by highlighting induction strategies appropriate and effective for diverse teacher groups, and lead to a desire for increased retention in the workforce. The study will inform workforce issues in the organizational sciences, in which limited work has explicitly adopted a social network approach to explain human resource outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory being examined in this project is the extent to which teacher identify formation linked to persistence in the profession can be detected in participants' social networks and correlated to Noyce preparation and induction features.  The three-stage research design will include documenting the antecedents of network formation, teacher networks, and the outcomes of networks. In Stage I, information will be collected about the support structures present at each site, and which activities and demographics represent the participants' experiences during induction. Coherence between the planned focus of each program, and the experiences of the participants, will be examined. In Stage II, social network information will be collected from participants using an ego-centric network survey (with data focused on a given teacher's local community of ties, e.g. the CoP) of who each teacher exchanges information with related to teaching content and pedagogy, how frequently the interactions occur, and whether the contacts occur in the local school or across regional, state, or national levels. Survey data will be transformed into matrices needed to generate STEM teacher networks, and examined for size, density, strength of ties, and geographic proximity to the teacher, utilizing the latest social network analysis software packages. Network properties from Stage II will be modeled using Stage I data to determine which activities and support structures contribute to different structural CoPs. In Stage III, teacher perceptions of their teaching self-efficacy, identity within the profession, and outlook on remaining in the profession will be collected. Stage III data will be modeled using Stage II network data to determine which CoPs influence desirable teacher outcomes. In order to strengthen claims of causality from the quantitative analyses, teachers will be asked which activities influence their CoP network, and which portions of the network effect their outcomes. Stage I and III instruments will be aligned to NSF Annual Participant Surveys, and Department of Education Teacher Follow-up Surveys, respectively, so results from this study may be generalized to national data in future studies.</AbstractNarration>

The project hypothesized that teachers? decisions to remain in the profession are influenced by the structure and resource capacities of the CoP in which they are embedded. CoP was specifically examined using network theory and social network analysis. To that end, network surveys and interview protocols were developed and implemented to examine correlations between (1) community activities, (2) professional networks, and (3) teacher outcomes [i.e., self-efficacy, identity, and disposition toward remaining in the profession]. Research efforts sought to establish which teacher activities promote professional networks that support strong teacher self-efficacy beliefs, strong identity as a professional STEM teacher, and a desire to remain in the teaching profession as a career path.

The project was advised by a board of five experts spanning an equally distributed cross section of US geographies and perspectives.

First, teachers can describe and discuss their network of contacts related to teaching content and/or pedagogy. These networks are approximately 10 contacts in size for science teachers, but smaller for mathematics teachers; they are localized to teachers? schools, but encompass state and national contacts; are positive and energizing in nature, but include some de-energizing and non-role model teachers; and maintained through weekly to monthly interactions, although regional contacts may be accessed annually. Second, these practice-focused networks are correlated with teacher self-efficacy beliefs and discipline-based teacher identity, just as CoP are related to self-efficacy and identity in the literature. This suggests they can be treated as CoP networks. Third, the influence of CoP networks on teacher self-efficacy varies by gender. Female teachers derive more self-efficacy gains than males for each additional contact who is a role model, energizing in nature, or in frequent contact. Only males reporting high perceived network density, or cohesion among their CoP, were able to overcome this effect and display comparable levels of teacher self-efficacy. Fourth, teacher job satisfaction is positively and significantly improved by the presence of teacher role models in school level networks that are perceived to be more dense or cohesive. Fifth, teacher commitment to remain in the profession is influenced by broader, less dense CoP networks. Teachers who perceived being in more bridging positions in their overall network, thereby connecting CoP members who would not otherwise be connected, also reported the desire to remain in the profession for a greater number of years. This effect was mediated by teacher identity, to the extent that perceiving more bridging positions positively influenced teacher identity, which ultimately drove the commitment to remaining in teaching.</p> <p>Taken together, the findings provide a model for how CoP networks influence positive teacher outcomes that can be further investigated and replicated. Activities that promote interactions with local teacher role models and dense school networks can impact local job satisfaction with positions, peer groups, and schools. Dense networks can also improve teacher self-efficacy. At the same time, CoP networks ranging beyond the school walls serve a different purpose. Opportunities to bridge CoP contacts across school, district, state, and national arenas can improve discipline-based teacher identity. As a consequence, teachers can identify more strongly as an individual teacher and as a member of the teaching community, leading to a stronger desire to remain in the profession, despite local constraints that might vary by administration or school.</p> <p>Project outcomes include the dissemination of findings in four scholarly journals spanning education research and business management sectors.

Presentations at diverse venues have advanced conversations between educators, education researchers, human resource, and business management stakeholders. Social Network Analysis surveys and other instruments have also been shared through online supplementary materials on journal websites, and directly with multiple interested parties, leading to additional collaborations and grant funded investigations.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/01/2021<br>      Modified by: Gregory&nbsp;T&nbsp;Rushton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1917181/1917181_10482272_1621383428209_SummaryModel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1917181/1917181_10482272_1621383428209_SummaryModel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Summary Model"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1917181/1917181_10482272_1621383428209_SummaryModel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Summary Model"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Conceptual model for the role of teacher community of practice (CoP) networks in teacher retention.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Justin Polizzi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gregory&nbsp;T&nbsp;Rushton</div> <div class="imageTitle">Summary Model</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
