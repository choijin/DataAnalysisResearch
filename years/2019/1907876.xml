<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a new computational framework for modeling astrophysical sources of high energy particles. In space, the vast majority of visible matter consists of hot charged gas, called plasma.  Astrophysical flows of plasma can move very fast, become turbulent, and generate shock waves.   This kind of plasma turbulence is key to a broad range of space and astrophysical problems, including black-hole accretion disks, supernova explosions, star formation, and even space weather.  Some of the particles in a turbulent plasma gain enormous amounts of energy by interacting with the turbulent motions, and with shock waves. In different settings, these particles may be called cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, or pick-up ions.  While these particles gain energy, they also change the structure of the shock waves, and the fundamental characteristics of the turbulence.  In this project a new theoretical model for this interaction will be developed by extending a theoretical framework that has been successfully used to model particle interactions for turbulent combustion in car engines.  State-of-the-art simulations will be produced to examine how energetic particles can modify plasma turbulence and shocks.  These simulations will provide detailed understanding of how energetic particles move through an astrophysical plasma, and may have a practical impact on improving space weather prediction to help minimize satellite radiation damage.  This project will also support efforts to increase diversity among students and professionals in high performance computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plasma turbulence and instabilities play a fundamental role in accelerating particles to high energies. As particles gain energy, they interact with the plasma surrounding them, resonating with certain types of plasma waves to stabilize them while destabilizing others, and changing the character of the background turbulence in ways that have not been fully quantified or understood.   This interaction with the turbulent background plasma is key to the acceleration of many types of energetic particles including high-energy cosmic rays,  solar energetic particles, and pick-up ions.  In this project, a new computational model and tool for simulating multi-species compressible plasma turbulence will be produced by expanding on a state-of-the-art model for multi-component turbulent engineering flows and combustion.  This model will self-consistently include the energetic particle feedback on the plasma.  The main focus of this project is to produce high-quality simulations of the shock structure and surrounding turbulence as they are modified by energetic particles.  This will address several open questions: (1) How do energetic particles alter turbulence around a shock?  (2) How do energetic particles alter the magnetic field and magnetic instabilities around a shock?  (3) How do modifications to shocks, turbulence, and magnetic instabilities contribute to particle acceleration?  The simulations targeted in this project will also allow particle movement to be traced to produce a physically-clear understanding of how modification of the shock affects the particle acceleration process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
