<AbstractNarration>Despite well-funded efforts to diversify engineering in the United States, Americans who identify as Black, Latinx, and Indigenous (Native American, Alaskan, or Hawaiian) remain underrepresented and marginalized throughout engineering academic training and employment. Previous research has identified that underrepresented PhD-degreed engineers of color are less likely to be employed in engineering jobs compared to their overrepresented counterparts. However, there is much less certainty on the reasons behind this disparity. Moreover, the employment paths of White women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) employment have been extensively explored along with the career trajectories of graduate students of color in STEM, but there has been very little attention to engineers of color with PhDs post-graduation. The focus of this research is to understand the employment paths for two populations: underrepresented engineers of color who have successfully navigated the challenges of obtaining an engineering PhD, along with Asian engineering PhD holders who are well-represented in the field. This research will investigate two critical factors that can help explain disparities for underrepresented engineers of color: (1) their experiences of racialization, and (2) their interest in using engineering as a mechanism to decrease social inequities. This research will address the gap in understanding the factors that drive these disparities in engineering employment outcomes across racial groups and how to decrease them, thereby aiding engineering education and industry communities in becoming and remaining more diverse, innovative, and affirming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will answer these questions through a mixed-methods design, including a longitudinal survey component and qualitative in-depth interviews. Survey respondents will be engineers of color who are working in industry and the academic workforce within a decade of graduating with their PhD. Participants will be recruited through the professional networking site LinkedIn as well as professional organizations for engineers of color. In the first phase, survey data and analysis, using structural equation modeling, will determine how respondents' experiences of racial inequity and bias at work and their motivations and efforts to address social inequities through engineering vis-a-vis their employers, predict their employment outcomes (e.g., commitment, intentions to quit) by increasing their "job embeddedness." The analyses will test this model across different race groups. Collecting follow-up employment data one year later will provide a measure of actual persistence. Survey findings will inform the content of the qualitative interview protocol. Interview participants will be people of color with an engineering PhD who are not directly using their engineering skillset because they either switched from an engineering job into a non-engineering job or transitioned into a leadership or administrative position. These findings will help to identify why engineers of color with advanced doctoral training are either: (a) dissatisfied and pushed away from this workforce or (b) persist in their work to transition into different roles that allow them to diversify the field. Insights from this research will inform workplace training webinars promoting diversity and inclusion in engineering workplaces in both industry and academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
