<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to investigate how engineering students decide to participate or not participate in co-curricular activities and how these students perceive the impact of various types of co-curricular activities on their persistence, learning and entry into the workforce (or career) and what interventions encourage co-curricular involvement.  This project is aligned with two of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) strategic performance goals: prepare and engage a diverse STEM workforce motivated to participate at the frontiers (T-2) and build the capacity of the nation's citizenry for addressing societal challenges through science and engineering (I-2).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project uses existing NSF-funded instruments to develop, test and distribute a new survey instrument; collect and analyze quantitative and qualitative data on co-curricular involvement, persistence and learning outcomes that can be leveraged to guide institutional policies and programs and to design effective innovations to retain diverse students in engineering that progress to the workforce; apply research findings to design, pilot test and evaluate an innovative, evidence-based intervention constructed to enhance student persistence and learning and to inform institutional policies and practices on retention; and collaborate with institutional programs and national professional organizations to expand and scale up the intervention and disseminate results of the project.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project advances the understanding of engineering students' pathways to include those traditionally underrepresented in engineering; methodologically contributes to informal learning of engineering students; shapes future research and development related to these populations; and informs research communities, policymakers, and institution leaders. Research on the student experience is essential to transforming engineering education, which will result in broader participation of underrepresented groups in engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Background Recent research indicates that participation in out-of-class activities (OOCAs) can contribute to increased students? engagement and retention. Unfortunately, little is known about the reasons and outcomes that are associated with students' OOCAs engagement and demographic characteristics related to the type of OOCAs students participate in. Purpose The purpose of this project was to develop a nuanced understanding of students? engagement in OOCAs, especially for underrepresented groups in engineering fields. OOCAs were referred to any student activity that occurs during waking hours outside of formal instruction in a classroom. These typically involve one of three types: curricular-related, co-curricular, or extracurricular activities. Approach We developed the psychometrically sound instrument called Postsecondary Student Engagement Survey (PosSES) based on 2,032 responses from 28 institutions in the US. Empirical results include findings for persistence, engagement, and learning outcomes of OOCAs and integrated findings across the three categories. Results Engineering education is the principal discipline in this project where results were found in the following areas: Instrument Development The PosSE survey collected demographic data including gender, race/ethnicity, age, self-reported household income, citizenship status, veteran status, disability, first-generation and continuing-generation college, LGBTQ+. Profile of students? participation was measured by 19 types of OOCAs across 4 levels of participation. The survey examined the 30 types of learning outcomes (i.e., 14 positive and 16 negative reasons) that related to each OOCA. Persistence The study found gender and peer interaction as impactful factors for students who switch their majors to engineering programs and suggested strategies for growing the presence of women in engineering. The study explored the structural barriers - specifically racism and sexism experienced by underrepresented students in engineering education and called for mitigating these barriers through research and instruction changing the culture and the role of allies. Engagement Engagement was measured according to the influence of peers and faculty, motivation, satisfaction, and belonging in a learning setting. A six factor model including Major Satisfaction, Academic Discipline Belonging, Major Valuing, Achievement Striving, Peer Interaction, and Positive Faculty Relationship were constructed and validated to measure the affective engagement of engineering students.

On the other hand, men tend to report job and sports as their top activities. Learning Outcomes Implications were suggested to improve OOCA participation as a path to developing T-competencies demanded by the workforce. For example, the study found that engineering undergraduates perceived ethical standards as an outcome from OOCAs, especially in pre-professional activities, coeducational sorority or fraternity, military, and job. Another study confirmed civil engineering undergraduates accrued engineer of 2020 attributes (i.e. suggested by the National Academy of Engineering) from OOCAs. Missed opportunities of OOCAs were discovered and should be reconsidered. For example, social fraternities and sororities were linked to providing student opportunities for professional development.  Underrepresented groups were found to accrue more engineering 2020 attributes than overrepresented groups. While overrepresented students accrued most outcomes from jobs and sports, underrepresented undergraduates accrued engineering 2020 attributes from various types of activities. Integrated Findings The study found the participants? perceived benefits of participating in OOCAs as they pertain to fun which is a missed opportunity to retain underrepresented groups in engineering.

Intellectual Merit This project advances the understanding of engineering students' learning pathways to include those traditionally underrepresented in engineering; methodologically contributes to measuring informal learning of engineering students; shapes future research and development related to various student populations; and informs research communities, policymakers, and institution leaders. Broader Impact Research on the student experience is essential to transforming engineering education and civil engineering, which will result in broader engagement of underrepresented groups in engineering and the workforce. Conclusion The project underscores the need for continued work related to out-of-class activities to include identifying the different ways in which a group of people experience, interpret, understand, perceive or conceptualize out-of-class activities.
