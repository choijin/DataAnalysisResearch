<AbstractNarration>The Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) Symposia, organized by the National Academy of Engineering, provide emerging engineering leaders from academia, industry, and government laboratories the opportunity to share research insights to facilitate an interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge and research methodologies. The nature of emerging technologies and how they fit together to create products and processes that drive economic growth in an increasingly competitive environment makes it essential that engineers understand each other's disciplines. The symposia serve as a catalyst to spur engineering innovation and foster collaborative networks of researchers within the United States and between engineers from the United States and partnering countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support for four Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) symposia, to be held in 2019. These symposia, organized by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in concert with international partner organizations, are for early career researchers. The meetings to be held in 2019 are: German-American FOE (March, 2019; Hamburg, Germany); China-America FOE (June, 2019; San Diego, California); US FOE (September, 2019; North Charleston, South Carolina); and EU-US FOE (November, 2019; Stockholm, Sweden). The 2019 US FOE symposium will focus on Autonomous Driving: Technology and Ethics, Engineering the Genome, Blockchain Technology, and Advanced Manufacturing in the Age of Digital Transformation. The 2019 GAFOE will focus on Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, Biomedical Optics, Electro-Mobility and Its Impact, and Technologies for Space Exploration. Topics for the 2019 CAFOE are Smart Cities, New Materials, Neuroengineering, and 5G Wireless Communication Technology. The 2019 EU-USFOE symposium will focus on Internet of Things and 5G, Materials Engineering Enabled by Advances in Imaging, Smart Manufacturing, and Systems Approach to a Clean Environment. Approximately 100 outstanding young engineers for the U.S. symposium and 30 from each country for the bilateral symposia will participate. Each two and a half day symposium will include plenary sessions, tours, break-out and poster sessions, and opportunities for developing collaborative research partnerships. Sessions will consist of presentations on cutting-edge research, innovations, and emerging research opportunities in engineering fields relevant to the symposium. FOE symposium papers, abstracts, presentation videos, and slides will be made available on the FOE website (www.naefrontiers.org).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
