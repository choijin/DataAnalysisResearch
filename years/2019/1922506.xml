<AbstractNarration>The  Workshop on Quantitative Representation of Microstructures and Materials for Extreme Environments will be held May 20-24, 2019 in Alexandria, Virginia. This workshop brings together leading experts in quantitative representation of microstructures and Materials for Extreme Environments. The workshop aims to develop tools and strategies to expand the field of materials modeling and data science, and expand their application to extreme environment conditions with integration of non-equilibrium physics. This award provides support for the meeting logistics. The expected outcome of the workshop is an accelerated roadmap to develop and manufacture materials to operate at non-equilibrium conditions. When applied at this scale, transformative research that relates processing to microstructure to properties quantitatively will lead to disruptive technological developments. The collaborative and open approach developed will provide a competitive advantage to the United States, in particular in aerospace and defense applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers that (i) develop mathematical tools, (ii) expand existing models to more realistic conditions, and (iii) verify the outcome of the models and define the realistic environment of applications. Prospective attendees represent a diverse group of researchers with a variety of expertise and perspectives. Participation in this workshop is co-sponsored by this award and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) program on Materials in Extreme Environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
