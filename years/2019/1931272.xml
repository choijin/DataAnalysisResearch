<AbstractNarration>Trusted hardware is the foundation of cybersecurity.  The International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) is a leading forum for hardware security researchers. This travel grant enables student researchers to attend the symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposed activity includes professional development for undergraduate and graduate students as well as continued growth of the symposium. Preparation has begun for HOST 2019 to be held in the Washington, DC Metro Area. This project provides opportunities for 50 students to receive travel support to attend HOST 2019. Their attendance enables them to learn about the latest tools, design methods, architectures, circuits, and novel applications of secure hardware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical contributions from previous symposia have covered topics such as: (1) counterfeit detection and avoidance, (2) side channel analysis and fault analysis, (3) hardware architectures for cryptography, and (4) physically unclonable functions (PUFs). The travel grants would encourage more students to consider a technical submission, participation in hardware demonstration to a large diverse audience, or even to attend as a means to prepare for a technical submission in future years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) is an annual symposium focused on hardware security research and development. It is a week-long event with a three day technical program, tutorials, and associated workshops. The 2019 edition of HOST was held from May 6 to 10&nbsp;in the Great Washington DC area. It has attracted a record-breaking 367 registered attendees, including 120 students.&nbsp;</p> <p>HOST is also known as a student-friendly conference, where we provide students the opportunity to get feedback on their work, talk with senior researchers from government, industry, and academia, and be exposed to the latest research in hardware security. We have organized&nbsp;events targeted specifically towards student researchers including the student hardware demo competition. The NSF student travel grant has been the major financial resource to allow us provide students free or discounted registration for HOST technical talks, free access to the tutorials, and free or discounted hotel accommodation.</p> <p>This year, HOST has awarded 53 students in the forms of free registration, free access to the tutorials, and 1-4 nights of free hotel rooms. A total of 69 room-nights were completed paid by HOST to accommodate 39 students (most rooms were shared by two students). In addition, 16 room-nights were partially covered by HOST.&nbsp;The entire amount of this NSF student travel grant was used to pay the hotel rooms. HOST covers a small portion of the hotel rooms and the rest of the benefits to the students travel grant awardees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>All the student awardees are full-time students from U.S. universities. Most of them came to HOST to present their hardware demo and attend the technical presentations and tutorials. To encourage more students to attend HOST, we did not grant the NSF awards to any of the students who came to HOST to present their papers. We have been very successful in attracting minority and underrepresent students to apply and granting them the NSF student travel grant.</p> <p>Among the 120 students who attended&nbsp; HOST and its accociated tutorials and workshops, more than a dozen are from HBCU school. Slightly less than half of them are female thanks in part to the workshop for women in hardware and system security (WISE).&nbsp;</p> <p>HOST 2019 has selected 25 research papers for presentation, 8 tutorials on the topics of property driven hardware security, side channel attacks and countermeasures, energy efficient hardware security, SoC platform security, secure processor architectures, and so on. There 31 student demos.
