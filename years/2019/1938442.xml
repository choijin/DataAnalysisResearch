<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the opportunity to reduce current energy consumption in existing displays (e.g. TVs, outdoor signage, mobile phones, wearables, AR/VR) in the United States by 70% while simultaneously improving color experience by 50%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the engineering parameters and the reliability of the core technology for commercialization. The core technology is a suite of ligand chemistries that enable virtually any functional nanoparticles to be turned into an ink for patterning of next generation electronics such as displays. Unlike any other technology, the final film, can pattern extremely dense films with over 90% loading of nanoparticles. When the technology is applied to quantum dots and displays, the resulting device is 70% more energy-efficient while simultaneously 50% better in color experience. The Phase I project research objective is to identify the ink formulation comprising of our technology that is compatible with at-scale manufacturing equipment. Variables such as viscosity, solvent composition, and shelf life will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
