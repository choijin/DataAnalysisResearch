<AbstractNarration>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adolescence is often viewed in a negative light in American society. Both American youth and adults view teens as more rebellious and irresponsible than younger children. Accumulating evidence underscores that negative stereotypes that youth hold about teens, which appear to be culturally shaped, undermine their behavioral adjustment and neural development. Despite the detrimental impact of negative stereotypes about teens, little is known about how youth’s stereotypes of teens change over adolescence, how such changes impact long-term academic, social, and neural development, and how social context plays a role in transmitting stereotypes of teens. The overarching goal of this study is to examine the developmental trajectories of adolescent stereotypes of teens, as well as the antecedents and consequences of such trajectories. This study will highlight the importance of changing negative stereotypes about adolescence at the policy and societal level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will employ a longitudinal design that combines survey and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Youth and parents will complete a survey, including assessments of their stereotypes of teens, annually over 4 years. Longitudinal neuroimaging data will be collected to assess participants’ neurodevelopment of cognitive control and affective systems. This work exemplifies a multi-method, multi-dimensional approach by integrating adolescent development across belief, behavioral, and brain levels in theoretically novel and important ways, with attention to the role of social context (e.g., parents). Although no prior research has examined the developmental trajectories of adolescents’ stereotypes of teens, this study will systematically investigate this issue. The longitudinal design will not only provide insights into the reciprocal and dynamic pathways between stereotypes and adjustment over time, but also elucidate the neuro-behavior transactions initiated by stereotypes of teens. Highlighting the role of parents in transmitting cultural views of teens, this work also stands to inform theoretical models regarding parental socialization of adolescent development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
