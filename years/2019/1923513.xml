<AbstractNarration>All species exist in a variety of environments. How a species adapts across those environments determines its survival in a particular location. This also determines the species range over time. The type of reproduction shown by an organism can have profound consequences for that adaptation across a varied landscape. One key reproductive mode, partial clonality, which includes both asexual reproduction, and sexual reproduction, is found in many organisms. These include species that influence many important ecosystems functions. Partial clonality is also found in many pathogens, pests, and invasive species. This research will develop mathematical models that explore how partial clonality and local environmental variation interact to shape the evolution of such species. The results of this research will help identify key aspects of populations that make them especially vulnerable to changing environmental conditions, leading to population decline and even extinction. Conversely, factors that allow populations to more easily adapt to new environments will also be determined. An important impact of this work is its applicability to our understanding of invasive species and emerging infectious diseases. Broader impacts also include increased mathematical literacy and a better understanding of the linkages between the biological sciences, mathematics, and statistics for both graduate and undergraduate students trained under this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will explore the differences in the average selective regime experienced by clonal verses sexual offspring and how that may influence realized patterns of adaptation across a variable landscape. Of particular interest is the influence on genomic diversity, and a population's ability to persist under environmental change. Two complementary approaches will be utilized to address these complexities: (1) analytical models combining stage-structured life histories and phenotypic evolution and (2) individual-based forward-time simulation models allowing for consideration of important aspects of stochasticity in both evolution and demography will be applied. Together these two modeling methods will clarify the integrated effect of reproductive mode and variable selective environment in shaping the dynamics of species&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
