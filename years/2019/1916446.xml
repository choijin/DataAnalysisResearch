<AbstractNarration>The extraction of information from data is of fundamental importance. Central to this problem is defining "information", determining what in the data is most relevant and deciding which algorithms/procedures should be used.  Technological advances in data acquisition and storage have led to an over  abundance of data, which has only exacerbated the problem. The field of statistics has addressed these issues since its inception; the traditional point of view relies on stringent assumptions about the data and probabilistic models, but has ignored computational aspects. This project will develop a new theory and algorithms based on a concept called computational sufficiency. Rather than making stringent assumptions about the data and models, this concept assumes that many different and complementary procedures might be applied to the data. Then we consider the relevant information in the data to be that which is sufficient for obtaining the results of all the  procedures under consideration. In this way, the theory can (i) reveal hidden commonalities between procedures, (ii) identify meaningful reductions of the data, (iii) provide results that are robust to modeling assumptions, and (iv) allow us to exploit the reductions for efficient computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistical sufficiency has been a foundational concept of mathematical statistics since the early 20th century. Implicit in its definition is the specification of a statistical model. However, actual data analysis does not always begin with the specification of a model, and it may not even make explicit use of a statistical model. The abundance of data and advances in computing have made it easier for the data analyst to abandon a single statistical model and instead consider multiple algorithmic models. Computational sufficiency defines information in the context of a collection of procedures that share a common input domain. The basic idea is very simple: we wish to find functions of the data that contain sufficient information for computing every procedure in the collection. In other words, what are the reduced summaries of the data that are sufficient to produce the same answers as would be obtained by applying the procedures to the whole data. This project will broaden the applicability of this theory and its depth. The results will lead to both theoretical insights and practical  computational advances in data analysis. In some cases, the theory will be  able to provide a conceptual link between seemingly unrelated methods and it will also provide a basis for inferences that are less dependent on  assumptions. The computational advances provided by this research can lead to  reduction of computational costs in applying multiple, advanced procedures by an order of magnitude, thus facilitating responsive and multifaceted analysis of large-scale data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
