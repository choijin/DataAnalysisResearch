<AbstractNarration>The annual IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE) addresses research issues in designing, building, managing, and evaluating advanced data-intensive systems and applications. It is a leading forum for researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The 35th ICDE is held at Macau, China April 8 - 12, 2019. This award enables diverse US students to participate in ICDE-2019, provides opportunities to the students to interact with other attendees and attend the educational events being offered.  The students' participation in ICDE-2019 is important to the students research training and will develop the future generation of leaders and workforce in the increasingly critical data management field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supported students will have opportunities to showcase their research results, learn about the cutting edge research conducted by others, and interact with experts at a premier data engineering conference. ICDE-2019 includes a comprehensive program including research papers presentations, tutorials, panels, industrial papers, and technical demonstrations that provide a platform for exchange of research results and ideas, interaction and education. The program also includes workshops that demand dedicated coverage due to their relevance to the current data management research and development, industrial exhibits, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. The  students will also have an opportunity to participate in a PhD Symposium, which  provides a forum for PhD students to present their research ideas, and interact with and receive feedback from senior members of the research community in academia and industry. The focus of the PhD Symposium is on mentorship and providing constructive feedback to the students. The Symposium fosters a collaborative environment, encouraging constructive discussions and sharing of ideas. These opportunities will have a long lasting impact on the future career of the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

It is a leading forum for researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences.  As one of the most prestigious conference in data management research, ICDE has contributed significantly on the advance of all aspects of data management technologies and applications since 1984.   The 35th ICDE (ICDE'19) took place at Macau, China. Its dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction, included research papers,workshops, tutorials, panels, industrial papers, technical demonstrations, industrial exhibits, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry.   All these activities provided a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research works with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry.

All applicants to the student travel award were full-time students (undergraduate or graduate) currently matriculated in US institutions.
