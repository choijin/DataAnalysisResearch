<AbstractNarration>Overweight and obesity (OO) are a huge public health concern in many countries. Globally, the prevalence of obesity has nearly doubled since 1980. One population at increased risk for OO is immigrants. However, we still have a limited understanding of how exposures to stressors over the migration process interact with the life course to impact risk for OO. OO increases risks for chronic diseases and the economic cost of obesity-related illnesses is estimated at $190.2 billion annually in the U. S.  Immigrants are increasingly at risk for OO, and an estimated 18% of the US population will be immigrants within 50 years. Africans are now the fastest growing immigrant group, roughly doubling in number every decade. Despite their growing numbers, less is known about the factors that increase risk for OO among African immigrants. Africans are more likely than immigrants from most other regions to come to the United States as refugees or to seek asylum, and also have a higher prevalence of pre-migration traumatic events. This is significant because studies have shown trauma exposure and psychological distress increase the risk for OO. This training from the Cultural Anthropology Scholars Award will allow Dr. Covington-Ward to explore these questions and develop the methodological skills necessary to publish several articles based on secondary analysis of datasets, eventually conduct a larger, multi-sited project (post funded training) combining quantitative and qualitative data analysis, contribute to the pedagogical and research programs of several departments at her university, and share her research with local communities and scholarly audiences. This project also has broader implications for improved health policy, as the results will identify risk factors for obesity for African immigrants and suggest strategies for supporting these and other immigrant populations towards better health and well-being. The project will also contribute to science in regards to examining how exposure to trauma and stress increases obesity risk overall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Covington-Ward of the University of Pittsburgh will investigate the following research questions: How do stressful and traumatic events before your move, during your move, and after your move impact obesity? And how does the age at which you have these experiences affect your obesity risk?  The proposed research and training from the Cultural Anthropology Scholars Award will address this gap by examining the relationship between traumatic life events and stressors, migration processes, and OO among African immigrants. The award will allow Dr. Yolanda Covington-Ward to obtain training in demography and statistical analysis in order to study how stress and migration are related to obesity risk for African immigrants at a larger population level. The award will enable her to be an external affiliate with the Population Research Institute at Penn State University, to take graduate-level classes in demography at Penn State and statistics classes at the University of Pittsburgh, to take summer survey research courses at the University of Michigan, and to receive one-on-one guidance and mentoring in demography and analysis of several large datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
