<AbstractNarration>This award supports a one-day workshop convening an interdisciplinary group of experts conducting research on the relationship between workers, emerging technologies, and the social and economic landscape of jobs and work. Participants will report on the first year of their NSF-supported projects, as well as participate in structured and unstructured activities, including oral presentations, poster sessions, and panel discussions, to facilitate the exchange of ideas and experiences. The applications areas that will be covered by the workshop participants range from power grid resiliency to medical decision making to classroom education to factory work to firefighting. These projects go beyond the introduction of new technology into the workplace, and explicitly address the social and economic consequences of innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All twelve projects supported under the FY2018 solicitation NSF 18-548, "Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier: Advancing Cognitive and Physical Capabilities (FW-HTF)," will be represented at the workshop. Other participants will include representatives of previous NSF-supported projects and researchers from academia, government, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
