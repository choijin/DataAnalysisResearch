<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be replacement of toxic, lead-based radiation shielding materials with non-toxic bismuth composites that are lighter weight and have equivalent or better radiation shielding protection. These bismuth composites can be flexibly fashioned into a variety of shapes, including aprons, gloves, hats and drapes, to provide custom protection for medical and other radiation-exposed workers.  Because of the reduced weight burden and increased flexibility of the bismuth composites relative to lead, we expect that our product will significantly reduce physical strain on personnel who wear these garments, while also being biologically and environmentally safer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will evaluate the commercial potential of radiation shielding bismuth composite materials, which are produced using our patented technology, in several different market spaces, including medical, dental, veterinary, electronics, and military sectors.  Based on initial prototypes and measurements of X-ray attenuation, we calculate that we will be able to produce a flexible radiation protective barrier that is 50% lighter than traditional lead-based barriers, with the same or better shielding protection.  The patented method to produce the X-ray opaque material is highly scalable, and the proposed work will determine effective commercialization strategies for this technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
