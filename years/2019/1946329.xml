<AbstractNarration>This workshop will be organized in Fall 2019 and will bring together key stakeholders from academia and industry. The participants will discuss current challenges in Quantum Computing, opportunities to overcome those challenges, and will map out a path forward to enable near-term progress. The specific aim of the workshop is to identify realistic deliverables in the area of Quantum Computing, including: i) Prototypes that could be developed in the next 2-5 years, and ii) Testbeds needed to evaluate them in the following 5 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With quantum information science now pervading all corners of academic and government science and engineering programs, there is great interest in pursuing the scientific limits of quantum computer capabilities. The control and use of ever larger entangled superpositions in quantum computers may even confront the fundamental conundrum of quantum mechanics: how to reconcile quantum and classical worlds?  Apart from such intellectual directions, the continual use and building of generations of quantum computer devices is expected to impact a new discipline that will help change the culture of our scientists and engineers to embrace the laws of quantum physics and create new scientific and technological capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the workshop, the aim is to gather input from the broad community in quantum information science and quantum computing, with representatives from physics (atomic/molecular/optical and condensed matter), chemistry, mathematics, information theory, computer science, and engineering disciplines. We expect attendees from academia, government laboratories and industry in order to determine needs that are specific to the science goals of quantum computing. The resulting white paper produced by the workshop will help motivate the allocation of resources to these areas and will have a positive impact on the entire quantum information science community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded the hosting of a workshop in the area of quantum computing, with an aim to advance the objectives of two of 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments: "Quantum Leap" and "Growing Convergent Research".  The workshop brought together the community in quantum computing and quantum information science (QIS), to consider the needs for capable quantum hardware that allows some degree of abstraction of the device itself.  This will allow a broad range of scientists and engineers to use and improve quantum computers and inform an evolution of quantum computer systems into the future.  The workshop described the challenges facing the quantum computing community, opportunities to address those challenges, and will map out a path forward for near-term progress. The workshop will identify realistic deliverables: a) Quantum computer system prototypes in the next 2-5 years; b) Testbeds for the following 5 years; c) Broad areas of use cases for the systems.  Attendeed of the workshop included researchers from several scientific disciplines related to QIS:  Martin Savage (U Washington) &ndash; Nuclear Physics: lattice gauge theory and QCD David Huse (Princeton) &ndash; CM Physics Norman Yao (UCB) &ndash; CM physics and QI theory Brian DeMarco (UIUC) &ndash; AMO David Wineland (UO) &ndash; AMO Eddie Farhi (MIT/Google) &ndash; Algorithms Alain Aspuru-Guzik (Toronto) &ndash; VQE Umesh Vazirani (UCB) &ndash; QCS algorithms Aram Harrow (MIT) &ndash; Physics and CS, algorithms Ken Brown (Duke) &ndash; CS: QC architectures and compilers Margaret Martonosi (Princeton) &ndash; CS: QC architectures and compilers Dmitri Maslov (IBM) &ndash; CS: QC architectures and compilers Fred Chong (U. Chicago) &ndash; CS: QC architectures and compilers Scott Aaronson (U. Texas) &ndash; QCS algorithms David Bacon (Google) &ndash; Algorithms Jungsang Kim (Duke) &ndash; Quantum Systems Christopher Monroe (UMaryland) -- Atomic Physics  A product of the workshop was a manuscript, entitled "Quantum Computing Systems for Scientific Discovery," that will soon appear as a publication in Physical Review X: Quantum, and can be found on the arXiv here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07577          Last Modified: 02/02/2021       Submitted by: Christopher R Monroe]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
