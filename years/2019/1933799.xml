<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project couples the benefits of a traditional ICE-mechanical or an electro-mechanical drivetrain with a hydrostatic drivetrain for increased energy efficiency, improved performance and extended driving range. This concept is fundamentally different from the existing approaches, since it is based on the design of a compact kit to hybridize an existing drivetrain for a large transportation vehicle used in cities. The project will focus on exploring potential customers who own, operate and maintain fleet vehicles larger than 5 tons. These types of vehicles are especially suited for the adoption of the proposed kit due to the room in the engine compartment facilitating ease of installation in a short time. Examples of potential customers include passenger bus fleets in urban areas, refuse vehicles, parcel distribution vehicles, material handling vehicles and in general vehicles with frequent stop and go drive cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is a radical improvement to a vehicle drivetrain system because it effectively captures larger amounts of kinetic energy from a moving vehicle compared to existing and other proposed methods, such as electric batteries, flywheels, or supercapacitors. A hydraulic accumulator will be compactly coupled to a hydraulic pump/motor to conform a regenerative hydrostatic transmission mounted to the front axle of the vehicle. The proposed technology will lead to the improvement of energy efficiency in vehicles with high start and stop duty cycles. The proposed hydraulic add-on kit serves as an auxiliary powertrain to extend the driving range of the vehicle, reducing the stress of the battery discharge or reducing engine use during the vehicle accelerations, and provide extra capability for propulsion and braking. The advantage of using the hydraulic accumulator is its power density, which will lead to an ideal solution for energy management and performance of the system. A hydraulic accumulator will be compactly coupled to a hydraulic pump and hydraulic motor to conform a regenerative hydrostatic transmission mounted to the front axle the vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to validate through customer surveys and customer interactions the feasibility of a startup business centered around the concept of hydraulic energy regeneration. During the process of interviewing these companies the constant message we heard from fleet managers and engineers was that, they need a solution to reduce maintenance costs and increase their vehicle productivity. Many of them are interested in projecting a green image to their customers but this is a secondary gain for them. After analyzing the advantages of hydraulic accumulators and understanding the reality of the current market, we realized that on-road applications using hydraulics will greatly benefit if a compact and distributed energy regenerative option was available for heavy duty utility vehicle operations, the boom truck industry is $1.5M in the U.S. alone.  This team found that utility vehicles using the proposed distributed hydraulic energy storage system could reduce operating costs by ~25% from fuel savings and reduce 30% CO2 emissions and at the same time increase the life expectancy of engine parts, this by supplementing the energy provided by the combustion engine or electric battery pack.   Following these interactions with industry it is clear that a large barrier to the implementation of energy regeneration in those hydraulic applications is the accumulator size and its limited energy capacity.
