<AbstractNarration>This award supports student participation in the 2019 Fourth North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management in Toronto, Canada. It is organized by the Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IE0M) Society International. The conference provides a forum for academia, researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and recent developments in the fields of industrial fourth revolution / cyber physical systems, also referred to as Industry 4.0. Smart technologies are shaping our industries and societies. US industries are competing in the global footprint to lead in smart intelligent technologies along the entire supply chain. The new workforce is expected to have new job types that currently do not exist. Student participants will have opportunities to learn from industry practitioners and academia from conference technical and keynote sessions related on Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), big data, iCloud, cybersecurity and related fields. Most important to student participants is the opportunity to gain a world-wide perspective from representatives from over 50 countries about research, development, design and manufacturing of global supply chain networks, vertical integration, and the use of cyber-human systems comprising sensors, IoT, and understood through advanced analytics and computational modeling. The investigators will enable students to improve their knowledge of disruptive technologies of Industry 4.0 and contribute to the competitiveness of the 21st Century U.S. workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports conference registration, lodging and a portion of the travel expenses of approximately 51 graduate and undergraduate students who should be enrolled full-time at a United States colleges or universities. Students at colleges and universities will be made aware of the opportunity through a posting on the conference website, the conference committee network, and from students who participate in various competitions, posters and technical papers. Students will be selected for the award by the conference committee. The criteria for granting a student award includes the following: enrolled in a U.S. college or university as a full-time student, desire to present a paper or poster, and willingness to attend the Industry 4.0 related sessions. Preference will be given to students from historically underrepresented communities including African Americans, Native Americans and Hispanics. After the conference, the list of student awardees will be announced on the main conference website, in the IEOM post-conference report, and in the IEOM Society Awards website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
