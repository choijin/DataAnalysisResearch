<AbstractNarration>This conference grant will support professional development at Jackson WILD. Jackson WILD (formerly the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival) is the premier industry conference for science and natural history documentary filmmakers and distributors, bringing the world's top factual storytellers together with inspiring STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) professionals at a biennial industry conference and juried film festival. This project supports a robust thematic strand of professional development within the conference focused on strategies for making the science of science communication more accessible to an industry that has significant influence over the accuracy, quality and quantity of STEM stories reaching mainstream audiences through popular media. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference grant strategies are scaffolded upon the results of Jackson WILD's previous two conference awards which have employed multiple interventions aimed at 1) understanding how science communication expertise is perceived and gained by media content creators, 2) identifying the demographics and professional development needs of both emerging and seasoned STEM storytellers, and 3) finding pathways to enhance science communication expertise for STEM professionals seeing to increase their reach to public audiences.  The current conference grant will build upon lessons learned and offer thematic professional development programming advancing science communication literacy and best practices among media professionals and STEM communicators.  The 2019 Jackson WILD industry conference will also further expand the cross-industry STEM media fellows program, which offers professional development and cohort-building opportunities to emerging professionals in both STEM and media fields. The driving theory of change is that access to research-informed professional development and increased science communication fluency among content creators and STEM communicators results in products (i.e. documentary programs, podcasts, social media content, etc.) that are in better alignment with evidence-based best practices for communicating STEM topics to lay audiences. Therefore, the resulting media products will be more effective in engaging and educating those audiences, resulting in increased STEM literacy and informal STEM learning. To extend the reach and impact of the conference, the program content will be available on line via streaming videos and podcasts on various channels. Investing in professional development for science media professionals will strength the ecosystem of quality STEM media and help support public engagement in STEM more broadly.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understanding of deeper learning by participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
