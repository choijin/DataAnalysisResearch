<AbstractNarration>This NSF award will provide partial funding for the conference: "Analytic and Combinatorial Number Theory: the legacy of Ramanujan."&lt;br/&gt;This is an international conference to be held at the University of Illinois from June 6-9, 2019.  The conference is expected to attract around 120 participants. The conference proceedings will be published in a special issue of the International Journal of Number Theory.&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together prominent national and international figures to discuss current research trends and recent advances in combinatorial and analytic number theory, and for collaborative research discussions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The invited speakers represent a broad range of topics including algebraic combinatorics, representation theory, special functions,modular  and other automorphic forms, partition theory, symbolic computation, L-functions and many others. In addition we will have many contributed talks on diverse areas of number theory. More details are available at the conference website: https://math.illinois.edu/nt2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
