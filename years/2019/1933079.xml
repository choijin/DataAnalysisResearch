<AbstractNarration>The IEEE/ACM 2019 International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) is a leading conference where results of Software Engineering research are reported and discussed among academic and industrial communities.  The conference takes in San Diego, California in November 11 through 15, 2019. This proposal requests funds to support student travel and expenses to attend the conference and events such as the Doctoral Consortium and mentoring events.  The grant will enable the technical exchange of information and research conversations/collaborations made possible by the conference, as well as advances in the field made possible by these interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference provides education, training and mentoring received by the participants. The international nature of this conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce of research and educators within the US and helps build the community of researchers in the field of Software Engineering. The Doctoral Symposium is for graduate students at all stages of their degree completion. The goal is for students to exchange ideas, receive constructive feedback from experts in a supportive environment, learn how to perform quality research on automated software engineering, and to meet other students and researchers in their research fields. This grant will be used to support student travel from US institutions to attend both the Doctoral Symposium and the main ASE conference.  Awardees will be prioritized based on acceptance into the Doctoral Symposium, with preference given to students in underrepresented groups and US citizens. A portion of the funds will be used to recruit undergraduate students from schools near the&lt;br/&gt;conference venue that have a large population of students from diverse and underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
