<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate the integration of novel two-dimensional materials in silicon-based, planar photonic circuits to achieve broadband optoelectronic devices operating in the near- to mid-infrared spectral range. The two-dimensional materials to be studied include graphene and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides of various types. The approach is to develop fabrication processes and conduct characterization and measurement of two-dimensional materials integrated optoelectronic devices. The specific research goals include development of broadband and highly efficient photodetectors and modulators for the near- and mid-infrared, investigation and utilization of nonlinear optical phenomena in two-dimensional materials, and demonstration of waveguide integrated and coupled two-dimensional light emitters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The optoelectronic properties of two-dimensional materials have not been widely utilized for integrated optoelectronic devices. The proposed research will demonstrate practical optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional materials with unprecedented performances. The integrated approach will also provide effective near-field means to investigate the optoelectronic properties of the two-dimensional materials. The research results will be the first steps to incorporating two-dimensional materials in large scale integrated, silicon-based photonic circuits and systems for optical communication and computation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will impact the industry and the scientific community by providing new materials for optoelectronic devices. The education and outreach activities will encourage high-schools students to pursue a career in science and engineering, disseminate the knowledge learned in the project through undergraduate participation in research and curriculum development, and recruit minority students to participate in research.</AbstractNarration>

The 2D materials that has been studied include graphene, black phosphorus (BP), and topological insulator bismuth selenide. These materials have many remarkable optoelectronic properties that can be optimally utilized in integrated photonic platforms. The research approach is to develop fabrication processes and conduct characterization and measurement of 2D materials integrated optoelectronic devices. The specific research goals include development of broadband and highly efficient photodetectors and modulators for the near- and mid-infrared, investigation and utilization of nonlinear optical phenomena in 2D materials, and demonstration of waveguide integrated and coupled 2D light emitters.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:&nbsp; </strong>Previously, the<strong> </strong>optoelectronic properties of 2D materials have been investigated with various free-space optical characterization techniques but not yet been widely utilized for integrated optoelectronic devices. The proposed research will achieve integration of 2D materials in planar photonic circuits in order to demonstrate practical optoelectronic devices with unprecedented performances and to better exploit their novel optical properties. The integrated approach will also provide effective near-field means to investigate the optoelectronic properties of the 2D materials. The project developed the first waveguide integrated black phosphorus photodetector with a high responsivity and low dark current for near-infrared light. The research also investigated the fundamental carrier dynamics and third-order optical nonlinearity in black phosphorous. The project further demonstrated mid-infrared electro-absorptive modulation using the quantun-confined Franz-Keldysh effect in BP. The research furtuer integrate BP with mid-infrared silicon and plasmonic waveguides to improve modulation efficiency on an integrated photonic platform. The research also demonstrated spin-momentum locked interaction between the surface state of topological insulator bismuth selenide and the transverse spin angular momentum of the evanescent field of a waveguide mode.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impact:</strong> The project was highly interdisciplinary and fostered collaboration in areas of photonics, material science, and condensed matter physics. The project made an impact on the photonics industry by providing a new class of optoelectronic materials and devices that can be integrated with current integrated photonic systems. The education and outreach activities of the project encouraged high-schools students to pursue a career in science and engineering and disseminate the research through undergraduate participation in research and curriculum development.
