<AbstractNarration>This project will partially support participation of the diverse group of early career mathematicians in the  two-day Conference entitled, "The KUMUNU-ISU Conference in PDE, Dynamical Systems and Applications", to be held April 25-26, 2020, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). (The Conference website is https://www.math.unl.edu/kumunu-2020.) This Meeting will be the sixth in a series of Meetings put together by the KUMUNU-ISU contingent; i.e., mathematics faculty from the Universities of Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Iowa State University. The KUMUNU-ISU 2020 will feature world-acclaimed researchers in Partial Differential Equations (PDE's) and Applied Mathematics, as well as those who are in the relatively early stages of their career, and/or are representatives of groups that have historically not had great representation in Applied Mathematics.  The organizers will put an effort to recruit participants from institutions where opportunities to attend large Research Conferences might be limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will include world-class experts who work on the Navier-Stokes Equations and other modelling PDE of fluid and fluid-structure dynamics. Within the framework of KUMUNU 2020, the research interests of such nonlinear fluid PDE researchers will be juxtaposed with those of mathematicians who are interested in the asymptotic behavior of solutions to general nonlinear evolution equations. The conference will also feature speakers and participants with interests in scientific computation and PDE Control Theory; these will include researchers who have documented interest in applying their results and methodologies to problems which involve the Navier-Stokes and other fluid and fluid-structure PDE's. Subsequently, there are expected collaborative efforts among these KUMUNU 2020 participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
