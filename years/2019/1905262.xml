<AbstractNarration>Chemists routinely transform molecules using chemical reactions to make and break chemical bonds, rearranging the atoms in controlled and deliberate ways to make new and valuable molecules. The synthesis and transformation of molecular nanoparticles (10-100 times the size of most small molecules) lack that level of control and sophistication.  Professor Terry Bigioni and his research group at the University of Toledo are changing this limitation by systematically studying different types of nanoparticle reactions to learn the details of nanoparticle synthesis and transformation. By shedding light on how nanoparticles react, chemists may be able to make better nanomaterials and enable new technologies that drive the economy and help society. The fundamental nature of this work means that it can impact a broad range of fields, such as better catalysts that clean the air and conserve energy, new classes of anti-cancer and anti-viral drugs, light-emitting beacons for biomedical imaging, or energy absorbers for harvesting energy directly from the sun. Students involved in this research gain valuable skills and interdisciplinary training that is vital to strengthening our nation's economy, technical leadership, and workforce. This project includes extensive outreach activities, including the popular "Saturday Morning Science" public lecture series at the University of Toledo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monolayer-protected clusters (MPCs) are a class of nanoparticles that are small enough to have discrete molecular structures. Despite being a molecular species, it is still not yet possible to predict the outcome of MPC reactions. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Professor Terry Bigioni and his research group are studying the fundamental chemical principles of noble metal MPCs (primarily gold, silver, and their alloys), to better understand reactions involving this new class of compounds. The research focuses on learning the synthetic principles of nanoparticle formation as well as the underlying concepts of nanoparticle modification and transformation using a subset of MPCs with known structures. To accomplish this, the team is developing methods to study equilibrium distributions and reaction kinetics in order to gain a more detailed picture of metal nanoparticle thermodynamics and reaction pathways. These are important steps toward establishing a predictive theory of noble metal nanoparticle reactivity and improving our ability to rationally control their structures and properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
