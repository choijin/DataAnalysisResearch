<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national need for experienced and aspiring STEM teachers who are prepared to integrate English as a second language (ESL) instructional practices into their teaching. High-quality STEM courses are rarely available to ESL students, in part because STEM educators are unlikely to be endorsed and prepared to integrate ESL practices in their STEM courses. Mentors First partnerships intend to build capacity to address language barriers in STEM courses in four ways: 1) monthly partnership development meetings that include building community, sharing data, planning course sequences and grants; 2) developing 9th grade through college dual language (English/Spanish) STEM courses; 3) disseminating and using project findings to identify, examine, and eliminate barriers to STEM course success for limited English proficient students; and 4) designing STEM+ESL mentor teacher training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Capacity Building project at The Evergreen State College includes partnerships with STEM and ESL faculty at South Puget Sound Community College and the 44 high-need school districts in the Educational Service District 113 region surrounding the partner colleges. The Mentors First partnershipâ€™s goals are to collect, analyze, and use data to identify, understand, and remove barriers to STEM course trajectories for bilingual students attending high-need schools in the region. The project also aims to identify high-quality STEM mentor teachers to participate in the STEM+ESL Mentors First Fellows program. The Mentors First project and evaluation aims to advance knowledge of the institutional barriers for ESL students succeeding in STEM courses using Hierarchical Linear Modeling to examine the nested effects of ESL students in classrooms and schools with/out ESL endorsed teachers. The long-range goals include development of a STEM+ESL Mentors First program enhanced by an aspiring STEM+ESL teacher program. If ESL students have high-quality STEM teachers with language strategies that welcome and support them, it may be possible for them to imagine a STEM career for themselves. As a result, this project has the potential to broaden participation in STEM fields. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The outcomes are Noyce Track I, and III grant ready to submit in August.   Listed below are highlights from our work on each grant over the year. a)     Developed a cross campus STEM faculty advisory board to analyze student course taking data at Evergreen and SPSCC. b)    Analyzed STEM course sequences between SPSCC and Evergreen  to ensure alignment and easy transfer between the two colleges. c)     Reported and discussed STEM course taking data from both colleges during faculty advisory board meetings. d)    Developed activities (i.e., transfer day, regular advisory meetings, cross campus faculty presentations) to increase student transfer between SPSCC and Evergreen. e)     Established a partnership between the SPSCC STEM leadership, Evergreen STEM faculty and teacher education leadership.  f)     Increased understanding of the qualities of the STEM programs at both colleges. g)    Established an excellent leadership team of outstanding STEM and ELL teacher education faculty and science and math education researchers to design and facilitate (when funded) the STEMtoTEACH and STEM+ELL MentorsFirst! program. h)    Established a partnership with North Thurston School District STEM and ELL leaders and teachers for STEMtoTEACH and STEM+ELL MentorsFirst! i)      Established a partnership with the Centro Integra Educativo Latino de Olympia, to participate in  STEMtoTEACH and STEM+ELL MentorsFirst! projects to increase the number of STEM+ELL teachers and ensure increased connection between mentors and the broader LatinX community. j)      Designed and conducted a reginal STEM and ELL teacher survey to gauge current teacher resources, and capacity to include emergent bilingual students in STEM courses, and STEM teacher interest in learning more about ELL strategies for STEM.   With funding, in five years, we hope to double the number of STEM+ELL mentors and exponentially increase the number of STEM+ELL teachers in high needs schools in Washington.
