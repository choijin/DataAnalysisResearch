<AbstractNarration>Introducing students to computational thinking is critical for workforce development. Because the elementary grades are a crucial time for developing students' dispositions toward STEM, integrating computational thinking into elementary students' science coursework is of paramount importance. The project centers on the design, development, and investigation of InfuseCS, an interactive learning environment for computational thinking that features maker-based digital storytelling and problem-based learning. Students will be introduced to computational thinking by working together in small groups to conduct computational model-based scientific investigations and creating narrative programs that generate interactive science narratives. The project will advance understanding of how to help upper elementary students learn about computational thinking in the context of science by conducting studies of students using the InfuseCS interactive learning environment in public elementary schools in California and North Carolina. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate how problem-based learning and computational thinking can be integrated with maker-based digital storytelling to create effective and engaging learning experiences in physical science. In conjunction with this investigation, the project will also explore how to best support teachers implementing narrative-centered maker activities that are deeply infused with problem-based learning. The project will have three thrusts. First, it will see the design and iterative refinement of the InfuseCS narrative-centered maker environment, which will be implemented at partner elementary schools in California and North Carolina. Second, it will develop, implement, and refine professional development materials for upper elementary school teachers. The professional development will include both face-to-face and online activities with the goal of preparing teachers to use the narrative-centered maker environment effectively and with fidelity in their classrooms. Third, the project will conduct focus groups, semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, and classroom implementation studies in the co-design of the narrative-centered maker environment. The project will investigate how the narrative-centered maker environment supports students in developing improved computational thinking competencies, improved understanding of disciplinary core ideas in physical science, and improved attitudes toward computational thinking and science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is funded by the STEM + Computing Program, which seeks to study the applied integration of computational thinking and computing within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (PreK-12).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
