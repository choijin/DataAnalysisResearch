<AbstractNarration>The renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU )Site for Nanotechnology in Health, Energy and the Environment at Stony Brook University in New York responds to the need to provide experiential learning opportunities for undergraduates in the interdisciplinary field of nanotechnology. The project stemmed from the need to implement an effective model for research-oriented undergraduate education which meets the needs of both students (from different academic majors, types of institutions - including community colleges, and who have completed from one to three years of undergraduate education) and their eventual employers (or graduate programs) in the emerging and changing nanotechnology sector. It responds to the need to recruit students from diverse populations, including under-represented groups, for enhancing diversity in STEM fields, and the need to enhance engineering education with a focus on emerging technology systems in the context of applications and societal impact.  This is accomplished through an approach which supports self-efficacy, multidisciplinary team-building, understanding broader impacts of technology, and building the skills necessary for research and life-long learning  through a program of faculty-mentored multidisciplinary research, professional development, and exposure to real-world issues which reflect the impact of nanotechnology on society, the business community, human health and the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a three year period Stony Brook University will host a ten week, eight intern multidisciplinary nanotechnology REU Site focused on Nanotechnology in Health, Energy and the Environment, involving multiple engineering departments and administered by the University’s Center for Inclusive Education (CIE).  Providing real research experiences for undergraduates is a critical need for the successful education of the next generation of engineers and scientists.  The laboratories involved will provide research experiences for REU interns in all aspects of nanotechnology and nanomaterials development, including polymeric nanostructures for medical applications, batteries, catalytic surfaces for energy and environmental remediation, nanoscale surface engineering to enhance recycling and “green” manufacturing, and development of nanosensors. This approach integrates a comprehensive graduate education preparation model that has proven to be effective in successful transition of undergraduate students into competitive graduate programs.  This REU site has supported 72 students directly over nine years, augmented by 16 additional students through supplemental support.  More than half the REU interns were female and more than one third were members of underrepresented minority populations. This support will enable the continued targeted inclusion of underrepresented groups in nanotechnology research and graduate education opportunities and leverages the resources of multiple departments effectively. The project will also include a RET experience for a STEM high school teacher. Results of this program will be widely disseminated to the campus and local community, and to other scientists and engineers in the U.S. and worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
