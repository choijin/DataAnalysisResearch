<AbstractNarration>The practice of synthesis in ecology and environmental science is now routinely used to address many of the most pressing scientific and societal environmental research questions. The rapid growth in big data is accelerating advances in synthesis, creating new opportunities for novel research questions, disciplines, perspectives, and data techniques to address a variety of ecological and environmental challenges. This award will support a workshop aimed at reflecting on the current status of synthesis science and exploring emerging needs, opportunities and frontiers in ecological synthesis by facilitating expansive and convergent discourse. A diverse community of scientists will collectively identify priority research directions and develop a research agenda for the next decade that incorporates bold new thinking and strategic prioritization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this synthesis workshop, a multidisciplinary, diverse group of nearly 100 experts will convene in Santa Barbara, CA to brainstorm opportunities and needs and produce a forward-looking agenda for synthesis in ecology and environmental science. Participants will engage in charrette-style breakout sessions of structured idea sharing that focus on expansive thinking with an outcome objective. Plenary discussions will be interspersed, and the selection of keynote speakers will prioritize diversity across a number of measures, particularly gender equity and career stage representation. The workshop will address a range of topics that are relevant to the future of synthesis in environmental science including ecological forecasting, cyberinfrastructure for synthesis, data-driven conservation decision making, the role and future of artificial intelligence (AI) in ecology, coproduction of synthesis science with stakeholders, and the role of synthesis in social-ecological systems research and promoting diversity and inclusion. At the conclusion of the workshop, ideas will be synthesized into a peer-reviewed publication on the frontiers of ecological and environmental synthesis science to communicate important insights to a broader audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
