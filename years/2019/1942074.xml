<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to the Midwest Programming Languages Summit, to be held at Purdue University in September 2019. This research workshop will serve as a valuable forum for researchers and students to share in-progress research ideas and receive timely feedback to influence subsequent work. This will be particularly valuable because of the high concentration of programming languages researchers in the Midwest, and because it will provide graduate student researchers opportunities to network and further develop their research and presentation skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds from this award will help support U.S. based students, focusing on graduate students at an advanced stage in their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend this workshop. The impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area. Higher priority will be assigned to students giving presentations and a strong emphasis will be put on supporting students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
