<AbstractNarration>This is funding to provide full or partial financial support for up to 15 graduate students from U.S. universities along with faculty mentors to attend the 2019 ACM International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2019), to be held March 16-20 in Los Angeles, CA and to participate in a full-day Student Consortium that will be held on March 20 in parallel with the other workshops.  The annual IUI conferences represent the growing interest in next-generation intelligent interactive user interfaces.  Attracting 200-300 attendees, they are the premier forum where researchers from academia and industry worldwide who work at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) come together to exchange insights and to present outstanding research and applications whose goal is to make the computerized world a more amenable place.  Unlike traditional AI the focus is not so much on making the computer smart all by itself, but rather on making the interaction between computers and people smarter; and unlike traditional HCI, there is a focus on solutions that involve large amounts of knowledge and emerging technologies such as natural language understanding, brain-computer interfaces, and gesture recognition.  To this end, IUI encourages contributions not only from computer science but also from related fields such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, etc.  This funding will enable attendance at the IUI conference by students who might otherwise be unable to do so for financial reasons.  It will enhance the educational experience of funded participants, by bringing them into contact with leading researchers in the field and by exposing them to the lively discussion during the course of the conference that often leads to opportunities for professional development.  The quality of the conference itself will be enhanced as well, thanks to a broadening of the base of institutions represented and increased diversity of participants.  The rich exchange of ideas at IUI has previously proven to be a valuable source of ideas for future research, as well as leading to collaborative efforts; this funding will extend the opportunities for collaboration and provide intellectual stimulus to programs that have previously sent few or no representatives to this conference.  The organizing committee has undertaken to proactively recruit student participants from schools that have not traditionally been well represented in the IUI community.  Women and students who are members of underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged to participate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IUI 2019 Student Consortium will build on the success of previous such events.  The heart of the Consortium will be a full-day workshop on March 20.  Student trainees will be afforded exposure to their new research community by giving a 20-30 presentation on their work and receiving feedback from peers and a panel of senior researchers.  The event will include opportunities for students to engage in discussion with peers and mentors, which will enhance community building. The students' work will also be featured during the main conference in a poster session, where they will gain additional experience explaining their work to others in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The conference is the premier international forum for reporting outstanding research and development on intelligent user interfaces. ACM IUI is where the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community meets the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. The conference brought together promising doctoral students and distinguished researchers from all over the world in IUI topic areas from both academia and industry. The NSF award supported 18 students, 7 of them are female, 14 are first authors of papers/posters, 2 attended the doctoral consortium, 1 presented a TIIS journal paper and 1 co-chaired a workshop at the conference.  The students presented their research at the conference. Not only did they receive valuable feedback that helps them to move forward with their research and career, but they also got a chance to disseminate their research results to the research community.   In addition to presenting research papers, many students also participated in various tutorials, workshops, doctoral consortium, keynote speeches and multiple discussion panels during the conference.
