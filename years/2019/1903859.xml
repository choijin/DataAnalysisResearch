<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to increase student and eventually, employee engagement, by better aligning skills and innate interests with degree programs, particularly novel STEM programs. In response to increasing demand for new types of jobs, degree programs such as Computational Genomics and Music Technology have combined fields that have historically been distinct.  This project enables students to discover both traditional and emerging majors relevant to them. By providing actionable insights and better alignment of interests early on, this decreases the friction of changing majors (~80% currently) during college and begins to mitigate widespread lack of engagement (~70%) in the workplace.  Compared with traditional methods that match GPAs, test scores, unstructured essays, and resumes, with schools, majors, and job openings, this project could revolutionize the way students identify, train and prepare for their future careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on a novel patent-pending technology of a unified multi-dimensional data representation method called Skills Genome. Skills Genome can be exploited by several machine learning models, allowing for capturing and modeling complex student data inputs such as critical thinking, communication, interests, leadership, etc. with temporal graphs.  By making the structure of the graph accessible to several machine learning models, the method improves accuracy, relevance and facilitates scale.  Specifically, this tracks the student?s development timeline, so they can best determine the timing and sequencing of skills needed for their chosen careers.  Further, by matching profiles at scale, new insights into potential careers can be surfaced, along with the next steps needed to achieve them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our I-Corps team was comprised of Anita Balaraman (EL), Berna Geylani (co-EL), SurakshaVidyarthi (TL), and Grace Wong (IM). We began the I-Corp program with a broad definition of a product-market fit for a technology platform for the education space, based on a novel patent-pending tunified multi-dimensional data representation method called Skills Genome.Over the course of 7 weeks, the team traveled across the country and interviewed over 120 individual stakeholders and partners from the ecosystem. The interviews included users, payers, partners, and influencers. Over the 7 weeks, we received critical mentoring and feedback from the weekly I-Corp team to help us hone in on the product-market fit. We continued our customer discovery (over 70 additional customer interviews) and refined our hypothesis and further iterated our hypothesis testing beyond the 7 weeks, which has been monumental in defining the business model, the value proposition, and clarity on our personas of the payers and users. As we approach the end of the I-Corp program, we have been encouraged to apply for the NSF PFI grant to build out the prototype in addition to applying for the NSF SBIR.The overall positive experience of the National NSF I-Corp program has set the team to be competitive in being accepted into UC Berkeley&rsquo;s technology start-up incubator, and applying for dilutive and non-dilutive funding sources. Epixego&rsquo;s team is clearer about the pain points, the clarity of customer segments, the value proposition for users and payers, and influencers and partners in this ecosystem. These learnings would not have been possible without the support ofNSF I-Corp program and the change in structured thinking that this program enabled beyond theduration of the program. The program has also been a strong validation of the break-throguh technology that the team is working on and the potential commercial benefit. Ms. Grace Wong continues to be our informal mentor and supporter of the company and team. The insights and connections and insights she brings to enable our customer discovery interviews has been invaluable. The team&rsquo;s vision has brought one more technology team member (part-time) who have been working with our TLm S.
