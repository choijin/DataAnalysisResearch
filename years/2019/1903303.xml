<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;Solar cells convert light directly into electricity via the photovoltaic effect. Their ability to efficiently and economically harness solar energy makes them a promising source of power. Silicon has proved to be the best material for making solar cells. A new class of materials, hybrid perovskites made from organic and inorganic components, have been used as the light-harvesting active layer in solar cells. Perovskite solar cells have attracted great attention as their performance approaches that of silicon and they are compatible with low-cost processing and flexible electronics. So far, the most efficient state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells were observed from the lead-based hybrid perovskites. Tuning the optical and electronic properties of hybrid perovskites by replacing lead or tin with other metal ions is relatively unexplored. Studies have also shown that unbalanced charge carrier diffusion within perovskite thin films limits the performance of perovskite solar cells. This project will address above issues by developing perovskite solar cells with a bulk heterojunction (mixed) device structure made from novel hybrid perovskites. The success of this project is expected to significantly advance the field of perovskite solar cells. The project will also provide cutting edge research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop efficient perovskite solar cells with a bulk heterojunction device structure by novel hybrid perovskite materials. The first objective is to develop novel hybrid perovskite materials, where lead (or tin) is substituted by different metal cations. The second objective is to investigate molecular and crystal structures, film morphologies, optoelectronic properties, and photovoltaic properties of these novel hybrid perovskite materials. The third objective is to investigate perovskite solar cells with a bulk heterojunction device structure by novel hybrid perovskite materials. The fourth objective is to correlate the device performance of bulk heterojunction perovskite solar cells with molecular and crystal structures, film morphologies and optoelectronic properties of bulk heterojunction composite photoactive layers. This project will advance the fundamental understanding about the interplay of molecular and crystal structures, the optoelectronic properties of novel hybrid perovskite materials, device physics and engineering, and the enhancement of device performance of perovskite solar cells. Insights gained from this work will elucidate materials design and device physics rules through comparison of device performance with materials properties. The participation of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines will be increased by engaging high school and undergraduate students using inquiry-based methods and hands-on learning activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
