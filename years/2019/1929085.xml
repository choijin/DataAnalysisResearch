<AbstractNarration>Vassar College is conducting a 2.5-day conference, as well as pre- and post-conference activities, that convenes a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional (USA and international) team to conceptualize and plan various research, education and outreach activities in informal  learning, focusing on the seminal concept of tensegrity and its applications in many fields of science and mathematics. Tensegrity is the characteristic property of a stable three-dimensional structure consisting of members under tension that are contiguous and members under compression that are not. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together researchers and practitioners in informal learning and researchers in the various disciplines that embrace tensegrity (mathematics, engineering, biology, architecture, and art) to explore the potential that tensegrity has to engage the public in informal settings, especially through direct engagement in creating such structures. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date there have been no sustained informal educational projects and research around the topic of tensegrity. However, there is considerable related work on learning through "making and tinkering" upon which the participants will adapt and expand.  The intended conference outcomes are to produce prototypes of activities, a research agenda, and lines of development with the potential to engage the wider public. A key priority of the gathering is the development of new partnerships between researchers and creators of tensegrity systems and the informal learning professionals. The long-term project hypothesis is that children and adults can engage with tensegrity through tinkering with materials and becoming familiar with a growing set of basic structures and their applications. The activities will include evaluation of the conference and a social network analysis of the collaborations that result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Tensegrity structures also pose mathematical, physical, and engineering questions---how can one model such objects in order to study their properties? The conference ``Exploring Tensegrity'' took place August 5-7, 2019 at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, NY, where researchers in mathematics education, mathematics, engineering, architecture, and dance, together with museum professionals came together to explore the notion of tensegrity for its potential to embody mathematical ideas such as symmetry and balance, and make these ideas accessible through hands-on experiences. At the conference we learned some of the mathematical and engineering ideas behind tensegrities from Bob Connelly and John Rieffel, and our work together was framed by Ricardo Nemirovsky as a "conversation with the materials." There were four workshops on building simple tensegrity models, exploring design with tensegrity, and using dance to explore bodily tensegrity. Perhaps the most successful of the workshops was the dance workshop---a novel offering from the participants based at Vanderbilt University. After warming up the participants with elementary movements, the leaders guided us in exploring physical notions of tension through leaning poses and mirror exercises. Many of the participants agreed that these exercises made tangible the issues of tensional balance as well as some of the implications of forces in an ensemble. The workshop went on to include materials--rope, pvc piping, mylar sheets---and groups of participants sought to construct tensegrity structures that included humans plus materials.  The "conversations," between participants and with the materials were the most valuable outcome of the conference. The participants identified issues of access and community in mathematics education in the large, and, in the small, such as engagement in the kinds of frustrations posed by the study of mathematics, complete with the beauty of the constructed object after a successful collaborative effort. Together with the embodied experience afforded by the dance workshops, the role of engaging tensegrity as a model for exploration and learning of abstract mathematical and physical ideas excited many of the participants.
