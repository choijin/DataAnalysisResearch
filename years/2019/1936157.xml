<AbstractNarration>This grant supports travel costs for key speakers, moderators and scientific committee members to participate in the Stanford Symposium to Accelerate Progress in AI in Healthcare, taking place September 18-19, 2019.  These participants are research leaders on applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, who will provide fresh thinking across a range of topic areas addressing AI in healthcare from leaders in science and industry. Each presentation will be followed by a facilitated panel discussion among researchers from diverse research environments and disciplines.  Compared to AI research in industries such as transportation, retail and defense, AI research targeting gains in healthcare quality and efficiency is currently underdeveloped. The symposium's goal is to accelerate near term scientific progress in forms of AI that improve clinical diagnosis, treatment selection and treatment activity in order to improve the performance of US healthcare. This activity is expected to facilitate progress toward a computer-assisted, rapid learning healthcare system that can potentially eliminate the gap between current and optimal efficiency and quality of care. In addition, the symposium will catalyze new collaborations between researchers, industry leaders and influencers and thereby accelerate real world testing and scaling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The FAC Symposium was held on the Stanford campus on September 18-19, 2020. The content of the event spanned six topics relating to the use of AI to improve healthcare:  1.     AI to improve accuracy of diagnosis and health risk assessment.  2.     AI to improve selection of treatment options.  3.     AI to improve step-by-step clinical pathways used to apply treatments.  4.     AI to detect and correct failures in clinician, patient and lay care-giver treatment actions inside and outside of healthcare facilities.  5.     Innovation in AI methods that increase AI’s capacity to improve healthcare.  6.     AI to improve patients’ ability to self-assess symptoms, select and implement self-care options to avoid use of or more successfully partner with health care professionals.  The symposium had 256 persons registered to attend with 113 academics, 83 students, and 60 industry professionals registered. We invited 26 distinguished researchers and industry personnel to speak during the two-day event including 12 presenters, eight discussants and six moderators. Additionally, we had 47 researchers present their work during two different poster sessions. Impressively, we had three high school students selected to present their work based on merit alone. Two presented during the poster presentation and one, Sidra Xu, was part of the Topic 3 moderated discussion.  Following the conclusion of the event, our team developed a press release and event summary for lay audience and prepared a draft journal manuscript to be submitted to Nature on research likely to generate near-term improvement in healthcare value.  We catalyzed diverse examples of potential research collaborations targeting opportunities to improve healthcare value that developed during the FAC Symposium. Examples include:  A.   Lingfend Yang and Bora Uyumazturk, students at Stanford University with expertise in medicine and computer science, respectively, presented separate posters on liver pathology. These two connected during the poster session and begun forming a collaboration that integrates clinical and technical expertise.  B.    Christine Meinders, Founder of Feminist.AI and a presenter in Topic 6, communicated that the opportunity for her group to present their research at FAC lended the group "legitimacy to open the door to further research in this space." She also connected with James Gillespie, who organizes national conferences for biomedical technology leaders. James is planning to introduce Christine to biotech researchers with overlapping interests.  C.    Shiven Mian, a graduate student at University of California, Davis, and Dr. Rajan Puri, a clinical assistant professor at Stanford, are planning a research partnership.  D.   Andrea Jonas, a postdoctoral fellow in the Pulmonary and Critical Care Department at Stanford, is planning joint research with Roger Bohn, a UCSD professor specializing in the evolution of industries from craft-based to science-based.
