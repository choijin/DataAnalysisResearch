<AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;Xavier University of Louisiana (XULA) in partnership with Louisiana University Marine Consortium (LUMCON) will use several of the geoscience-related grand challenges identified by an Integrate Project, including but not limited to, eutrophication, erosion, environmental stability, environmental change, water and food production, the life cycle of water-borne pathogens and carbon cycling to introduce students to the Geosciences.  The project between XULA and LUMCON will develop students' ability to address transdisciplinary problems (sustainable agriculture, conservation, resource management, energy, carbon) by using data visualization and analysis skills applied to authentic data. Faculty from across the College of Arts and Science (including Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Public Health and Business) will work on this project.  Faculty will use the Integrate model to develop a field course at the LUMCON research station.  Students will work with a XULA faculty mentor, who will partner with LUMCOM faculty experts on topics in geology, chemistry, atmospheric science, sustainability, GIS and water monitoring. Environmental Geosciences, including Geo-risk Analysis, which has a strong emphasis on real practical applications and uses state-of-the-art methodology, which are of interest to governments, corporations and NGO sectors worldwide will also be included. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;As an established best practice this project aims to reshape the image of what it means to be a Geoscientist.  In addition to the field and course work, students will have opportunities to network with geoscience professionals from academia, federal agencies, and non-profit organizations with the objective of helping them to identify key geoscience career skills, as well as helping them to identify with the profession.  The specific objectives of this project will be 1) to utilize the ERA-E model as a strategy to prepare students for the workforce with hands-on experiences that utilize field studies, 2) to create an Integrative Geo-Risk Analysis and Water Management Certificate, and 3) to provide mentoring, coaching and networking for both the student and faculty participants in this program using existing platforms.  Findings will be shared with both the academic and professional communities via a dedicated website on the University's website.  The PI team plans to host workshops (specifically targeted at other minority-servicing institutions) and organizational meetings around topics of Environment Geoscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
