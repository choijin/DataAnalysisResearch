<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the significant advancement of U.S. wireless technology and infrastructure. The proposed research applies an innovative high-frequency radio-frequency design process to address emerging market needs that current products and design processes are unable to meet. The key feature of the design process proposed is its basis on technically rigorous transistor-centric measurement and model-based design processes and capabilities. This will serve present and next generation applications in legacy 3G/4G, emerging 5G, Public Safety and Wireless Charging markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project uses an innovative high-efficiency design technique for solid state power amplifier (SSPA) integrated circuit (IC) products operating in the Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), S and C bands. These new IC's will utilize GaN-on-Si, which is far more cost-viable with high volume wafer sizes up to eight-inches in diameter as compared to the conventional GaN-on-SiC substrate material.  Use of GaN-on-Si semiconductors, combined with our new design technique, will achieve efficiencies far beyond incumbent products through waveform engineering and time-domain load-pull methods. Anticipated technical results include GaN SSPA pallet amplifier products realized on the UHF, S and C bands by the end of Phase I, corresponding to the markets of wireless charging/RF-energy, public safety wireless networks and 5G communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project successfully designed, fabricated, and tested Gallium Nitride (GaN) RFIC and reference design power-amplifiers with state-of-the art power added efficiencies (PAE) of over 88% at 5 Watts output power, at S and C-Bands.   Critical to this achievement was the advancement of next generation time-domain harmonic load-pull modeling and design methods based on waveform engineering - this project significantly advanced these techniques to consistently enable beyond present day state-of-art efficiencies up to Ka-Band and beyond.   Phase-1's results have resulted in positive feedback, partnerships, and support from Tier-1 commercial partners.   This project's results can have a very high impact on minimizing the U.S.'s and world's electric power consumption from its wireless infrastructure; thereby contributing to significantly minimizing the negative impact on the environment due to finite fuel and energy sources.   There exists high commercial market and societal needs for power-efficient RF transmitters in next-generation 5G/6G wireless back-haul infrastructures. The physical base stations and small-cells supporting these networks will be numerically dense and transmit at higher powers and frequencies, thus placing enormous strain on the U.S.'s electric grid, due to energy consumption at unprecedentedly high power levels. 5G and 6G base stations will be required at least at three times the number of base stations required for 4G; the component counts will also be exasperated by the need for massive multi-element antenna arrays, thus the demand for energy efficient GaN power-amplifiers will be greater than ever. This NSF funded project markedly contributes to the much needed advancement in minimizing the U.S.'s and world's ever increasing power draw from its emerging wireless infrastructures.
