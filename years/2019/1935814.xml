<AbstractNarration>Investigating the flow of blood and blood-driven transport of cells and particles in microchannels of different shapes and degrees of roughness is critical for fabricating and characterizing a host of medical devices meant for separating blood components. The objective of this proposal is to employ a combined computational-experimental framework for studying the fluid dynamics of blood and blood flow driven transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additive manufacturing techniques will be employed to fabricate straight and spiral microchannels with varying degree of roughness. The microchannel cross-section and surface roughness will be quantified using microCT imaging. A computational geometry representing the rough straight and spiral microchannels will be constructed by importing the microCT imaging data. In this simulation geometry a two-phase fluid flow model (plasma representing one phase and red blood cells another) will be employed to quantify the blood transport as a function of hematocrit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project outcome report has the same key elements as the final report, since the project was for 1 year.     Firstly, in terms of the significant results, three separate tasks were performed, and we highlight the main results of these three tasks.    Task 1: Testing the quality of print of 3D printers compared to manufacturer claims and identifying the design parameters that affect the quality.  Popular 3D printers fail to print circular and square channels with dimensions &lt; 0.5 ?m. The resolution of the channel dimensions get poorer with (a) increasing channel length, (b) in closed channels compared to open channels, and (c) with increasing tortuosity of the closed channels For successful 3D prints, typically several hundred micrometers in diameter, the surface roughness of channels are &lt; 10 ?m, Therefore, the surface roughness in 3D printed parts are not likely to influence the flow.    Task 2: Development of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for probing the transport of blood (described as a two-phase non-Newtonian system consisting of a dispersed phase and a particulate phase) in a straight microchannel of square cross section.    Identification that even surface roughness feature of average height of 30 microns in a channel of height 250 microns might not have a noticeable effect on the dynamics of blood flow (modeled as a two-phase non-Newtonian system consisting of a dispersed phase and a particulate phase) in a straight microchannel of square cross section on account of significantly small (&lt;100) Reynolds number typically experiences in channels of such dimensions.      Task 3: Development of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for probing the transport of a two-phase Newtonian flow (consisting of a dispersed phase and a particulate phase) in spiral microchannel of square cross section.    For a single-phase flow, the curvature of the spiral microchannel induces a centrifugal force enforcing the liquid mass to move towards the outer wall, shifting the location of the maximum velocity towards the outer wall, and creating two symmetric counterrotating vortices. This centrifugal force increases with an increase in the Dean number (which is proportional to Reynolds number) enforcing a more prominent shift of the location of the maximum velocity towards the outer wall as well as the generation of secondary vortices necessitated in order to balance the larger induced pressure differences. The presence of a finite volume fraction of the dispersed phase severely affects the liquid flow inside the spiral microchannel of square cross section. The interaction forces experienced by the liquid phase opposes the centrifugal force and as a result the liquid mass moves back towards the channel center, the location of the maximum velocity shifts towards the channel center, and the secondary vortices within the two symmetric counterrotating vortices disappear. The increase in the interaction forces, ensured by increasing the diameter of the particles constituting the dispersed phase, leads to a further opposing of the effect of the centrifugal forces. Therefore, with an increase in the particle diameter, one witnesses the fluid mass moving towards the inner wall ensuring that the location of the maximum velocity shifts towards the inner wall.        Secondly, in terms of the key outcomes, the project made the following contributions:   Outcomes that may aid regulatory review  Created a standardized geometry that can be used as a tool for quality control test of 3D printers by medical device manufacturers Developed considerations when deploying commercial CFD software specifically intended for microfluidics applications for multiphase blood flow applications    Also, the research led to the following key outcomes with regards to the numerical modeling of two-phase flow in microchannels  Identified relatively insignificant impact of the roughness in blood flow in straight microchannels owing to the relatively small Reynolds number associated with such microchannel flows. Identified that the presence of a particulate phase (representing the particles being transported in a background flow) significantly alters the fluid flow in spiral microchannels by enforcing the liquid mass to move away from the outer wall (for a single-phase flow without particles, the centrifugal force triggered by the channel curvature causes the liquid mass to move towards the outer wall). This occurrence is attributed to the interaction force (opposing the centrifugal force on the continuous phase) experienced by the continuum phase from the particulate phase. Such a tendency of directing the fluid mass away from the outer wall becomes more prominent for large particulate volume fraction and for larger interaction forces between the particulate/dispersed phase and the continuum phase.
