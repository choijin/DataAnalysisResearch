<AbstractNarration>2020 Vision for Dynamics will be held in the Mathematical Research and Conference Center Bedlewo of the Institute of Mathematics at the Academy of Sciences of Poland from August 11 to 16, 2019. The conference will focus on topics related to elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic dynamical systems and smooth ergodic theory that have seen much progress, but where significant problems vital to the field remain open. Based on forward-looking presentations of recent developments, the conference will set a broad and concrete agenda for further research on several fronts and bring together senior, mid-career and young practitioners for discussions of open problems in these research areas.  More information can be found at: https://www.impan.pl/en/activities/banach-center/conferences/19-vision2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

It was held at the Mathematical Research and Conference Center of the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in B&#281;dlewo, which provided not only lecture and seminar rooms but also meals and accommodation, thus enabling the participants to be together 24 hours on each conference day. Thee participants were diverse in many ways (career stage, expertise, gender, ethnicity, nationality), and this helped not only present a broad range of mathematics through lectures, poster sessions and informal interactions, but to catalyze research. Numerous projects were started, completed, accelerated or inspired by this meeting, and problem sessions developed specific research agendas of particular interest. Via a special book volume the impact of this meeting on shaping mathematics research will far transcend the group of participants and their immediate collaborators. In particular, a diverse group of junior mathematicians were integrated into large and active research communities. A senior participant has completed a research project that resulted from the meeting; "I learned from the talk of Alena Erchenko about the flexibility problems. The result is here: https://arXiv.org/abs/2004.01813". The same worked for junior participants: "What I am currently working on is a result of this meeting."
