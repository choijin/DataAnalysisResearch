<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will address key hurdles for commercialization of an injectable breast tissue replacement for use immediately following breast conserving surgery, otherwise known as lumpectomy. Surgeons using this procedure today have limited options for predictably restoring normal breast size, shape, and consistency following tumor removal. Because of this, many women are left with breast deformities or must undergo multiple surgical procedures. These issues compromise their psychological well-being and quality of life and increase healthcare costs. With these challenges in mind, this project will evaluate the ability of a patented, liquid, fibril-forming collagen to serve as an injectable, breast tissue replacement. Upon injection, this liquid biopolymer self-assembles into a physically stable and persistent natural fibrillar scaffold, meaning it can be used to fill patient-specific tissue voids. Project results will provide early-stage preclinical evidence of this biopolymer's effectiveness for filling and regenerating breast tissue in a large animal lumpectomy model. If successfully translated to the clinic, this therapy would provide breast cancer surgeons with a much-needed regenerative breast tissue solution. This in turn, would boost surgeons' confidence when working to achieve complete tumor removal, improve quality of life for breast cancer survivors, and decrease overall costs of care. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The liquid collagen polymers evaluated in this proposal preserve several natural features of the collagen protein as it exists in the body, thus giving rise to three key advantages. First, this biomaterial has the ability to rapidly transition from liquid to solid, forming natural collagen-fibril scaffolds just like those in the body's tissues. Second, it is amenable to customization and advanced biofabrication with tailorable geometries, fibril architectures, and mechanical properties. And finally, these scaffolds stably integrate and persist in vivo, inducing site-appropriate tissue generation without evoking immune or inflammatory response. This project seeks to overcome technical hurdles associated with identifying compatible and scalable sterilization and manufacturing processes for this unique, liquid biomaterial. Additionally, project activities will seek to specify biopolymer formulations that support surgeon ease-of-use, provide efficacy for breast tissue replacement, and do not interfere with standard clinical practices (e.g. radiation and re-excision procedures). The outcomes of this proposal will provide valuable proof-of-concept for a viable medical-grade manufacturing process and early preclinical validation that these collagen polymers can address breast cancer patient-specific needs. Finally, this project will lay the foundation for this natural collagen polymer to serve as an enabling tool for next generation personalized regenerative medicine therapies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
