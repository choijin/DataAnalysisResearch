<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways.  Many animals must cope with seasonal changes in their environment. Most snowshoe hares, for example, molt from brown to white to maintain camouflage against snowy backgrounds in winter. As with many seasonal traits, the timing of these molts is critical. Hares that change color too early or too late are mis-matched to their environment and easily seen by predators. As climate change leads to warmer winters and shorter periods of snow cover, snowshoe hares must adapt their molt timing. Otherwise, populations will decline due to increased predation. To better understand seasonal adaptation, this project will use DNA sequencing of extensive archived tissue samples of snowshoe hares to determine which parts of the genome are associated with adaptation to the environment and affect molt timing. This research addresses fundamental questions in evolutionary biology while also assisting conservation efforts: knowing which genes are important for adaptation will be helpful in identifying which populations of snowshoe hares can adapt to shorter winters and which populations are at risk of disappearing. Outreach events will highlight the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The archived tissue samples are sourced from a broad network of museum specimens, scientists, trappers, and other stakeholders. These georeferenced samples come from populations of hares from across North America which experience a wide range of environmental conditions and vary in their molt timing. The fellow will combine two approaches to investigate the genetics of adaptation in hares. Landscape genomics will be used to relate DNA sequence data (from exome sequencing) to climactic and environmental variables. Then, divergence mapping will be used on two populations with significant population- and individual-level variation in molt timing to zero in on the regions of the genome that affect seasonal changes in color. Based on this research, the fellow will develop outreach events which will advance the public understanding of science and demonstrate the relevance of evolutionary biology to wildlife and conservation. First, the fellow will create a mobile museum exhibit on snowshoe hares geared to schoolchildren. This exhibit will include video lessons recorded by the fellow such that it can be shared with schools in remote communities.  Second, the fellow will connect the general public with scientists through a series of informal public presentations and discussions at local microbreweries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
