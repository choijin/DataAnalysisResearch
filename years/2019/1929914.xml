<AbstractNarration>This award supports a collaborative workshop for researchers, students, non-governmental organizations, federal agencies, and industry experts to explore sustainable urban systems connections between urban and rural places. In addition to Central Michigan University (CMU) and the University of Arizona, steering committee member organizations include Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the U.S. Department for Housing and Urban Development. The workshop will be held July 29-30, 2019, at the CMU campus near Detroit, Michigan. Specifically, the workshop focuses on how food, community, and related innovation reveal and create opportunities to better understand the links between urban and rural communities. The workshop will feature small and large group discussions, student and expert presentations, and dialogue between researchers, students, and practitioners in both formal and informal settings. The primary output of the conference will be a set of researchable questions that reflect the needs of industry and build upon previously-funded research efforts supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Partnership for Sustainable Communities. These researchable questions will serve as the foundation for new collaborative research and practice partnerships composed of industry, government, and/or academic institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prosperity and sustainability of cities are inextricably linked to rural regions. This workshop will use food and community to develop new basic and applied science methods, questions, and projects to improve understanding and efficiency of rural-urban connections that enhance the social, economic, and ecological sustainability of urban systems. Professionally facilitated discussions will help drive science-practice dialogue, across industry, government, and academic participants that will shape a set of use-inspired research questions. These are questions to which industry and government need answers to drive more efficient policy, investment, and sustainability outcomes. The use-inspired questions emerging from the trans-disciplinary facilitated discussions will serve as the basis for an array of new collaborative research efforts to be undertaken by combinations of academic, industry, and policy teams. The insights generated will form the foundation for the proposal of a new sustainability research network addressing enhanced sustainable urban systems through urban-rural linkages. Additionally, the workshop will support and mentor students in an array of disciplines; facilitate opportunities to develop related interdisciplinary research projects; create space to discuss new theory and methods of analysis; and develop new understanding of urban-rural linkages and their role in the sustainability of urban systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary  From July 29-30, 44 industry, academic, and government experts collaborated at the Dearborn Inn and Dearborn campus of Central Michigan University.  This group generated a series of use-inspired questions examining sustainable urban systems; specifically, about urban-rural linkages and their manifestations in food and community systems.   The seven use-inspired questions emerged from two days of individual reflection, and both small and large group facilitated discussions.  These conversations embarked from the hypothesis that the prosperity, potential, and sustainability of cities are inextricably linked to rural regions.  In this, the questions sought to build upon previously funded Sustainable Research Networks (SRN), Coupled Human and Natural Systems projects, and other federally funded initiatives focused on sustainable urban systems to articulate a new and accretive research agenda.  Looking forward, the seven use-inspired questions will offer a starting point for groups of conference participants (and other interested parties) as they being to address emerging sustainable urban systems funding opportunities.  Primary Conference Outcome:  Use-Inspired Questions  How do transportation facilities shape the spatial      patterns of urban and rural resident migration flows, visitor flows, and      commute flows in different types of rural economies and to what extent do      their transportation systems support community resilience during economic      transitions? What is the value proposition of rural areas in      attracting high productivity citizenry?  Further, why do people want to move      "home?" How do private and public partnerships, ecological sustainability      and economic diversity across the rural urban gradient affect these      migration patterns? The physical form, patterns and structures of future      communities across urban hierarchies resilient to climate change and that      foster local/regional economic growth? What technological forms that      facilitate that? What are the policies and tools for affordable housing      in rural places? What policies support equitable renting, purchasing, and      leasing practices as well as site selection and zoning. What policies      support land use policy for neighborhood amenities and access to      opportunity? What are direct benefits to employers of nearby housing and      to what extent should employers be involved relative to public sector in      subsidizing housing? With respect to food systems, to what extent are urban      regions more resilient when they have diverse connections to rural (and      vice versa)? What is the diversity portfolio for regional resiliency?  What are the primary and secondary      effects of imminent disruptions to urban-rural food system supply chains?  To what extent is urban farming competitive      with other urban land uses?  At what      prices will urban farming be competitive with rural production? What      products are most amenable?   What are the units      of exchange along the urban-rural continuum and how are these measured,      valued, conveyed to stakeholders?     Secondary Conference Outcome: Network Building, Mentoring, &amp; Training  In addition to generating use-inspired questions, the conference created opportunities for attendees to expand their professional networks across discipline and domain boundaries.  It also provided mentoring to graduate students, post-docs, and early career researchers through interactions with senior colleagues.
