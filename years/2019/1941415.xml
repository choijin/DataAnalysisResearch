<AbstractNarration>Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Research, proposes to continue its participation in the CyberCorps® Scholarship for Service (SFS) program to educate security professionals to support the federal government workforce. At WPI, cybersecurity is recognized as one of five priority research areas across the university, due to its critical importance to society. WPI’s SFS program provides students with a project-based learning experience that includes a hands-on experiential learning environment and formal undergraduate and graduate degree designations in cybersecurity. The SFS program also provides a cohort experience to students enabling them to explore opportunities together, gain peer mentorship, and identify enriching professional development opportunities. This project will strengthen the security of federal cyber operations by increasing the number of highly qualified cybersecurity professionals hired at federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To bolster the federal cybersecurity workforce, WPI’s SFS program has the following specific goals: 1) recruit highly-qualified students who show a genuine commitment to serving the national need; 2) prepare students for the needs of the federal workforce through a high-quality education; 3) support students who otherwise might not be able to afford their studies; and 4) broaden participation in cybersecurity among women and underrepresented minorities. The WPI SFS program incorporates service learning, in which SFS scholars engage in outreach that benefits others while reinforcing their own learning. The SFS program helps its students engage in outreach through opportunities like on-campus Capture the Flag competitions, mentorship of high school CyberPatriot teams, and events to help the Worcester-area community learn how to keep their computers safe. Students earn formal degree designations in cybersecurity through an undergraduate concentration and a graduate specialization. WPI’s project-based curriculum provides a hands-on learning environment where students explore topics in-depth, engage in research, and publish in peer-reviewed venues. WPI partners with eligible federal and state government agencies, and with federally funded research and development centers, to help students pursue post-graduation employment at SFS-eligible government agencies. To support this hiring process, WPI hosts speakers to describe the research and employment benefits at a variety of agencies. WPI builds relationships with potential employers and maintains strong ties with alumni at these organizations who can help mentor and recruit future students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the CyberCorps® Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
