<AbstractNarration>This award provides participant support to a conference titled "Equidistribution, Invariant Measures and Applications", to be held on May 19 - May 24, 2019 at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The theory of actions of groups generated by unipotent elements also known as Ratner theory is a cornerstone of modern ergodic theory. The goal of the conference is to review the recent developments in the field and to set up new directions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main topics of the conference will be unipotent flows and their applications to counting and equidistribution; diagonal flows on homogenous spaces, and their applications in arithmetic and beyond; measure and orbit classification results for dynamics on moduli spaces of abelian and quadratic differentials; stationary measures and associated random walks in the homogeneous and non-homogeneous spaces. The conference structure will include mini-courses, lectures, and times for discussion and collaboration. More details about the conference could be found at http://ias.huji.ac.il/22midrashamathematicae .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
