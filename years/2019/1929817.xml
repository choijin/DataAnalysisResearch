<AbstractNarration>The 2019 Spring MRS Symposium on Emerging Thermal Materials - From Nanoscale to Multiscale Thermal Management will be held April 22-26, 2019, in Phoenix, AZ. The aim of this symposium is to cover recent advances in the development of thermal transport processes and to stimulate innovative research ideas among scientists and researchers from different disciplines in the overarching area of thermal materials. In particular, three emerging research areas will be highlighted, namely: new thermal phenomena and functionalities, novel theories and characterization techniques, and emerging applications and devices. Understanding and discovery of new thermal transport phenomena, energy carriers interactions, and how they affect the existence, behavior and dynamics of components and systems, are central to thermal science and engineering and are closely related to the scientific interests in the Thermal Transport Processes (TTP). The Symposium also aims at providing the means for participants to exchange technical knowledge, become aware of advances in the state-of-the-art from international experts, and learn of future directions in solving thermal transport problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will cover advanced topics, such as: emerging thermal interface transport and thermal boundary resistance, thermal insulation and multifunctional behaviors (mesosporous materials, ambient gels, aerogels), phononic, thermal-mechanical, and -acoustic meta-structures, thermal management of electronics, photonics, thermal management of batteries, super capacitors, and electrochemical systems, thermal transport in 2D, 1D and 0D materials, non-equilibrium and femto- to pico-second thermal transient behaviors, nanoscale heat conduction in materials, devices, and integrated systems, and new metrologies. This workshop will enable state-of-the-art knowledge and training to be made available to the attendees to help advance their efforts in developing and utilizing novel techniques. The technical exchanges and information shared among the attendees will lead to future collaborations and new projects, including working with world-renowned researchers. In addition, the workshop will provide useful information and procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
