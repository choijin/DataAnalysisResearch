<AbstractNarration>This award is for support of the participation of US mathematicians, mainly early career researchers, at the Jean-Morlet Chair Conference on Thermodynamic Formalism: Dynamical Systems, Statistical Properties and their Applications at Centre International de Recontres Mathematiques (CIRM) in Luminy from December 9 until December 13, 2019. This conference will bring together many internationally leading researchers in ergodic theory and dynamical systems and will have a special focus on recent developments in the application of thermodynamic formalism to dynamics. Up to 20 US mathematicians will be supported by this grant and will learn of recent progress and novel techniques in modern dynamical systems theory. In addition to the formal lectures there will be plenty of time for discussions to foster new collaborations and maximize interactions between participants.   The interactions with international colleagues will lead to collaborations and new research directions which will benefit US researchers, their PhD students and their home institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideas from statistical mechanics in the guise of thermodynamic formalism were introduced into the study of dynamical systems by Sinai and Ruelle in the late 1960s. The notions of pressure, equilibrium states and entropy among others were successfully applied to classify and study the statistical and geometric properties of hyperbolic dynamical systems. This conference will continue this theme and focus on several topics that are very active and fruitful, including: studying statistical properties using transfer operators and anisotropic Banach spaces; the structure and properties of Gibbs measures; moduli spaces, flows and applications to number theory; fractal geometry and dimension theory. The conference website is at https://www.chairejeanmorlet.com/2019-2-pollicott-vaienti.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award fostered research collaborations and research programs by allowing the participation of ten US mathematicians, eight of whom were early career researchers, at a weeklong  international  conference on Dynamical Systems held at the Center for International Meetings (CIRM) in Luminy, France in December 2019. The field of dynamical systems is concerned with the study of systems which evolve over time, for example climate systems, animal populations and other complex physical systems. At the conference were many leading world experts in the particular area of thermodynamic formalism  whose ideas (arising from statistical mechanics)  are used in the study of chaotic dynamical systems, those systems whose future behavior is difficult to predict due to their extreme sensitivity to change of parameters or  initial conditions. The conference was  of great benefit to the US participants, especially those participants at an early stage of their career, by providing a unique opportunity to learn of recent progress, especially research directions that are not available in textbook or monograph form,  in  crucial research areas.  The award also increased  both international and US research collaborations and fostered US research competitiveness.   There have been significant recent  advances in the applications of ideas from statistical mechanics to dynamical systems theory. In fact in  the past few years the area has undergone something of a renaissance with applications to many different areas (including Riemannian geometry,  number theory ,climate modeling among others).  These developments have opened  the possibility of further applications to adjacent fields. This award promises to contribute to future insights by allowing US researchers to learn cutting edge techniques and form new mathematical collaborations.   Direct contact and cooperation with groups at the  frontier of research is of fundamental importance for the development of mathematics in the US.  The proposal  allowed  ten US based mathematicians to participate in a conference in which many of the  world experts in the fields of thermodynamic formalism and dynamical systems were present. The field of dynamical systems has an impact on many areas of science, including physics, biology, economics and chemistry. It is a field that has seen much growth during the past 30 to 40 years.  The award  will expand and improve the research programs of several early career US mathematicians and the field of dynamical systems in the US.
