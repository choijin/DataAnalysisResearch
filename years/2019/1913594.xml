<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the advancement of a Rechargeable Hybrid Aqueous Battery (ReHAB) containing a novel freeze tape cast zinc electrode that will contribute to meeting global battery demands.  The two chemistries dominating the majority of electrification markets are lithium-ion and lead-acid.  However, both of these chemistries have drawbacks, which include the low cycle life and energy associated with lead-acid batteries, and the high price and safety risks associated with lithium-ion batteries.  These drawbacks open the door for the ReHAB battery chemistry to become a drop-in replacement to the lead-acid and lithium-ion markets such as stationary, heavy trucking, data center backup, and industrial motive. The primary goal of the ReHAB battery will be to step into these established markets as a lower cost and safer replacement to current technologies. These target markets total more than $50 billion in annual sales and continue to grow.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the ReHAB battery by utilizing freeze tape cast (FTC) zinc electrodes. The ReHAB is an emerging, high efficiency rechargeable battery technology that utilizes the high specific energy density of lithium intercalation electrodes with affordable, nontoxic zinc electrodes.  The electrolyte is water-based and is more conductive than non-aqueous electrolytes, which makes ReHAB cells a safe, alternative battery for high rate applications.  Despite the enormous potential of the ReHAB technology, poor performance of commercially available zinc foil electrodes and difficulties with fabricating zinc plated electrodes have prevented practical implementation of the ReHAB battery.  The Phase 1 project will be comprised of three major tasks to advance the emerging technology and establish the novel FTC anode, including initial characterization of the FTC zinc electrode, fabrication of ReHAB pouch cells with the FTC electrode, and the initial performance of the chemistry under varying operating conditions. The FTC novel electrode is anticipated to provide directionally aligned active metallic struts that will allow for ordered zinc plating, help control shape change, and dramatically reduce dendrite formation due to a more homogeneously distributed current, which will provide much longer cycle life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
