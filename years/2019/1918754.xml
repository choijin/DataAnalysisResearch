<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project is to introduce ways to prepare printed electronics. The global market for printed electronics is growing exponentially with new applications identified daily in the automotive and biomedical fields. The majority of existing applications undergo long preparation process, known as curing, in external ovens at high temperatures. This results in significant time and energy costs, while the high temperature requirement limits the range of materials that can be used without undergoing melting, warping, or other damage during the heating process. A fast curing technology that focuses heat can reduce costs, enabling the manufacturing of electronics on flexible, colder surfaces.  The ultimate goal is to launch a start-up company offering fast curing solutions to meet market needs in a variety of industries, ranging from automotive to wearables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will accelerate the design, development and commercialization of a fast, in-line curing system to address functionalization of printed electronics on low-temperature surfaces. To realize this technology advancement, the intellectual merit of the proposed work focuses on (1) determining performance and testing requirements for a class of identified printed electrical devices and material combinations (ink/substrate), (2) deriving new knowledge of in-line curing methods and system design in the context of key success metrics, (3) determining the correlation between material properties, device requirements, and curing process parameters, and (4) developing a prototype in-line curing system that meets critical design and process specifications. To mitigate the risks associated with the proposed project, the team aims to provide early proof-of-concept and characterization tests to demonstrate feasibility, incorporate design redundancy through the investigation of two curing methods, develop strategic partnerships with industry experts to discuss technical hurdles and innovative solutions, and conduct experimental testing to enable statistical analysis of process throughput, yield, and robustness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
