<AbstractNarration>This travel grant provides support for 18 US-based students to attend the Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium (PETS) to be held in Stockholm, Sweden from July 16-20, 2019. PETS brings together privacy and anonymity experts from around the world to discuss recent advances and new perspectives. PETS addresses the design and realization of privacy services for the Internet and other data systems and communication networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences like PETS is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer science researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class researchers in privacy, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers. This award aims to increase the participation of students from underrepresented groups and those from smaller institutions of education, to provide them with equal opportunities, rather than leave them behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
