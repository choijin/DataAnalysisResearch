<AbstractNarration>This is a grant for student (undergrad, grad) and postdoc support for travel and attendance at the Sackler Colloquium May 2-3 2019 at the Beckman Center in Irvine CA. The title is: "The Brain Produces Mind by Modeling". Speakers include a large variety of world leaders in computational and behavioral modeling of the brain-mind connection. The colloquium will bring together various threads and approaches in neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychological science by focusing on computational modeling that attempts to bridge the gaps between these fields. It aims to present a coherent view of the brain as a model builder, using the model to maximize survival and utility in a complex world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding supported attendance and participation by students (undergrad and graduate), and a few postdoctoral researchers, at the colloquium titled "The Brain Produces Mind by Modeling" sponsored by the National Aacdemy of Sciences Beckman Center in Irvine, CA. 40 students were given partial or full travel awards. 18 gave posters, most preceded by short talks to the entire audience.       All students interacted with the 18 colloquium speakers at meals. Each speaker sat with two, and in a few cases three, students, and the matching of speakers to students rotated. The discussions were about research and about future prospects for participation in these fields.  The student outcomes resided in the interactions they had with the speakers at the colloquium, and the learning that resulted from the presentations and the questions and answers following the presentations.   The colloquium outcomes included online dissemination of the talks, most of which are now publically available on the website for the National Academy of Sciences, and in the special issue of the Proceedings of the National SAcademy of Sciences that will appear in the fall of 2020 highlighting articles inspired by the colloquiium and submitted to PNAS for review and publication.  The student awardees were quite diverse, as shown in the following listing:  Geographic Distribution of the 40 awardees:   Amherst MA  Irvine CA  Pittsburgh PA  Baton Rouge LA  Los Angeles CA  Austin TX  Rensellaer NY  Berkeley CA  Paris France  Irvine CA  Berkeley CA  Nijmegen Netherlands  Riverside CA  Boston MA  Boston MA  Baton Rouge, LA  Montreal Canada  New Haven CT  Philadelphia PA  Ithaca, NY  Houston TX  Pittsburgh PA  Pittsburgh PA  Newark Delaware  Irvine CA  Hempstead NY  Boston NY  La Jolla CA  Phoenix AZ  Bern Germany  Dublin Ireland  Beijing China  Irvine CA  Waco TX  Washington DC  Phoenix AZ  Dublin Ireland  Bloomington IN  Philadelphia PA  Atlanta Georgia     Types of institutions   1 NIH, 2 institutes, 3 medical schools, 34 universities     Diversity:   25 of 40 awardees were women  16 of 40 awardees were from under-represented populations     ,            Last Modified: 08/31/2020       Submitted by: Richard M Shiffrin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
