<AbstractNarration>Engineering a secure IT system, in addition to technical skills, requires a particular mindset focused on using cybersecurity solutions effectively against sophisticated and stealthy cyber attacks. The traditional lecture-centric style of teaching has failed to deliver that mindset, which is the direct result of an over-emphasis on specific technical skills (with limited lifespan and insufficient technical depth), abstract rather than deeply technical examination of fundamental concepts, and an impatience in developing broader analytical skills. The vast majority of cybersecurity failures are the result of poor understanding of the security landscape and an inability to adapt to new threats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peer instruction may be a solution to this challenge. This project evaluates the effectiveness of peer instruction methodology for cybersecurity education, and develops the peer instruction material for three cybersecurity courses offering an introduction to security concepts, a defensive view of cybersecurity, and an offensive view of cybersecurity. The two primary mechanisms are used for measuring impact of peer instruction, which are pre- and post-testing, and isomorphic questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Peer instruction pedagogy is a student-centric approach designed to provoke deep conceptual thinking in students. It engages them in meaningful group discussion via pre-planned conceptual questions. Peer instruction has shown promising results in core computer science courses such as theory of Computation and Computer Architecture by reducing failure rates and improving student retention. This project has developed and evaluated the effectiveness of peer instruction methodology for cybersecurity education. In particular, it has developed 280 peer instruction questions, 108 questions for digital forensics, 93 questions for the introduction to computer security, and 79 questions for network penetration testing. These courses offer an introduction to security concepts, a defensive view of cybersecurity, and an offensive view of cybersecurity, respectively.  The project has utilized an action research methodology to implement and evaluate peer instruction in a semester-long cyber-security course i.e., introduction to computer security at the University of New Orleans. The evaluation results has showed an evidence of learning gains during group discussion and improvements in dropout and failure rates compared to traditional lecture classes. The attitudinal survey concluded that most students would recommend other instructors to use peer instruction.   The project has published five peer-reviewed papers including USENIX Advances in Security Education Workshop, 50th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE), and IEEE Security &amp; Privacy. The peer instruction material is publicly available at https://www.peerinstruction4cs.org/category/courses/       Last Modified: 09/03/2019       Submitted by: Irfan Ahmed]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
