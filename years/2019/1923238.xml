<AbstractNarration>The Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (GRWC) 2019, to be held June 17-28 and hosted by the University of Kansas, is the sixth edition of an annual two-week collaborative research workshop for advanced graduate students and postdocs from all areas of combinatorics.  Participants work in small collaborative groups with faculty and postdocs on research problems from across the discipline.  The workshops also host a variety of professional development activities to prepare students and postdocs for industrial and academic careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems participants will work on cover a wide range of subfields of combinatorics, including (hyper)graph theory, combinatorial representation theory, Ramsey theory, and symmetric function theory. Details of the workshop can be found on the website: https://sites.google.com/view/grwc/workshops/2019-lawrence-ks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (GRWC) is a 2-week summer workshop for graduate students and postdocs in combinatorics, a branch of discrete mathematics.  The GRWC has been in existence from 2014 and this award provided funding for the 2019 GRWC, held at the University of Kansas in June 2019.  The goal of the workshop is to support early-career mathematicians through individual and group mentoring, exposure to important research problems and cutting edge methods, and the development of a durable professional network of their peers.       At each GRWC, teams of students, postdocs and faculty mentors collaborate on open research problems from across the discipline.  Students and postdocs also take part in professional development seminars on topics including careers in industry, government and academia, the grant writing process, equity in the mathematical sciences and more.  This award supported 16 graduate students and postdocs and partially supported 6 faculty from U.S. institutions.  With additional support from other funders, the 2019 workshop supported the training and mentoring of 46 early-career mathematicians from 27 institutions.  Thus far, two papers have been submitted from the workshop, and many more are in progress, contributing to the over 50 research papers generated by the GRWC program from 2014 to 2019.
