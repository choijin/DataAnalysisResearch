<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  This study examines how the diet of an animal can help it survive attacks from other animals.  The Fellow studies the fall webworm, a caterpillar that eats the leaves of different trees.  Fall webworms are attacked by parasitic insects that lay their eggs inside the caterpillar and use it as a host.  The caterpillar's immune system can help defend against these parasitic insects, but the strength of the immune system can be affected by the caterpillar's diet.  The Fellow uses experiments and field surveys in Colorado to understand whether different trees increase the immunity of the fall webworm against wasp attacks.  The survival of insects, like many animals, is dependent on the plants in their habitat.  As changes in climate transform many plant communities, insects are likely to be affected too. This study will increase understanding of how plant-insect interactions might change if major climatic events drastically modify plant communities.  In addition, the Fellow works closely with youth from underrepresented minority students from urban areas in Denver.  Students will participate in wildlife surveys, which increase awareness of wildlife. The fellow will also promote opportunities for mentorship and guidance by creating an online network of biologists from minority backgrounds who will advise high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For widely distributed animals, the relative importance of diet and natural enemies can vary depending on location and composition of ecological communities.  The Fellow will use genomics to identify and quantify the diversity of parasitic insects attacking fall webworm across its range in Colorado. Next, the Fellow will use lab experiments to measure the relationship between diet and the nutrient quality of fall webworms.  Finally, the Fellow will manipulate the caterpillar's diet to examine how different tree species impact the caterpillar's ability to launch immune defenses against parasitic insects.  This research includes two approaches to increase interactions with nature among underrepresented minority students in urban public schools. First, the Fellow will use an experiential learning model to create interactive out-of-school learning opportunities for middle school students. Second, the Fellow will build an online network of professional biologists who agree to be mentors for high school students with interests in biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
