<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis (CAT) program in the Division of Chemistry supports work on homogeneous catalysis in the laboratory of Professor Wesley Bernskoetter of the University of Missouri.  The project examines new uses for carbon dioxide, which is an abundant and renewable resource. Currently, most consumer goods are produced from petrochemical. This project envisions that chemicals can be produced by combining petrochemicals and carbon dioxide. The project aims to discover catalysts that combine carbon dioxide with petrochemicals, a process called carboxylation. Many technologies could be enabled if carboxylations could be more efficient, the goal of this research.  This project also aims to spread awareness of chemistry?s role in society. Hands-on training is provided to the next generation of scientists including underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) program in the Division of Chemistry, the laboratory of Professor Wesley Bernskoetter of the University of Missouri is developing new catalysts to utilize carbon dioxide as a renewable, alternative carbon source for commercial chemicals.  The research targets reactions that form carbon-carbon bonds between carbon dioxide and other reactive small molecules, such as ethylene or acetylene.  These processes reduce carbon dioxide while also creating valuable carboxylated products including acrylates, oxalates, and acetylene carboxylates in nearly thermoneutral reactions.  Through mechanistic studies of the elementary reaction steps and structure-reactivity relationships, the project identifies the pathways for these rare transformations of the stable carbon dioxide molecule.  These findings build a foundation for further design of catalysts and processes enabling efficient, scalable conversion of carbon dioxide into a wide array of more complex, higher value molecules.  The Bernskoetter laboratory uses this research trains future leaders in the science and to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in chemistry as a partner of the University of Missouri McNair Scholars program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
