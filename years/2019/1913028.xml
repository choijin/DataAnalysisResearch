<AbstractNarration>The nucleus is billions of times smaller than is visible with the human eye and so we cannot merely take a photograph to understand its properties and structure.  At UKAL, we employ a particle accelerator to produce nuclear reactions that create gamma rays which are characteristic of the nucleus we wish to study.  From these gamma rays, we can develop an image of the nucleus of an atom and gain an understanding of how the neutrons and protons interact within it.  In addition, students at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels gain a world-class education while participating in these studies.  Graduates of our program receive hands-on experience and emerge as well-trained nuclear scientists who are capable of important contributions to our national energy, medical, and security needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary aim of the research program at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory (UKAL) is to address open questions in nuclear structure and outstanding problems in related areas of nuclear science to which we can uniquely contribute.  This broad-based research program includes selected studies in several forefront areas: nuclear structure relevant to neutrinoless double-beta decay; nuclei undergoing shape transitions; deformed structures and shape coexistence; nuclear structure contributions in support of studies of fundamental symmetries.  The most unique capability of the laboratory is the availability of a mono energetic beam of fast neutrons to do inelastic scattering experimenst to investigate low-energy collective modes in nuclei.  With the inelastic scattering of neutrons, we are able to obtain information which is not accessible at other facilities.  Experimental innovations in our laboratory include the development of capabilities for measuring lifetimes in heavy nuclei with the Doppler-shift attenuation method following the inelastic scattering of the fast neutrons.  These advances, coupled with the unique capabilities of our laboratory for the production of high-quality, time-bunched monoenergetic neutrons, have permitted us to address important questions and make meaningful contributions in nuclear structure physics and fundamental symmetries. We have also opened other areas of study and engaged in complementary experiments with collaborators at other nuclear accelerator laboratories.  Education at all levels continues to be an emphasis in our laboratory activities and research at a small accelerator laboratory permits the mentoring of young scientists on a daily basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
