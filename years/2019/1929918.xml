<AbstractNarration>This award supports the 13th Graduate Climate Conference (GCC), held 7-10 November 2019 at the Marine Biological Laboratory of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.  The conference has been held annually and alternates between Woods Hole and the Pack Forest Center of the University of Washington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GCC is an interdisciplinary climate conference organized by and for graduate students. It provides a discussion forum for students conducting research on climate in a variety of disciplines including atmospheric dynamics, ocean dynamics, ocean biology and chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, climate dynamics, paleoclimate, and human dimensions of climate variability and change. The meeting is intended to help students familiarize themselves with the breadth of climate science, gain exposure to the enormous range of tools available to address climate-related questions, and understand how their research fits into the broader landscape of current climate science. The conference seeks to better prepare graduate students for scientific inquiry in a field that increasingly demands interdisciplinary approaches. Funds provided here support travel and subsistence for 80 students chosen through a competitive process which places emphasis on selecting a cross-section of applicants that reflects the diversity of the next generation of scientists&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

By providing hands-on training in science communication, the GCC helped students learn how to apply their research beyond academics and communicate their science effectively to diverse audiences.
