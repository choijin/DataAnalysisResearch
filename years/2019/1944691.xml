<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will bridge the gap between design and engineering by developing a robust computational framework for the use, development, and integration of geometry-based structural design methods in three dimensions. These methods, known as 2-D graphic statics (GS), are powerful geometric techniques that have been used to find efficient structural forms of many iconic bridges and long-span structures over the past 150 years. This program will establish the mathematical foundations of 3-D graphic statics, which has been very recently developed for finding architectural forms for high-performance structures. This research will devise computational tools to effectively build, control, and optimize structural forms in three dimensions. An open-source software, an interactive educational platform together with outreach activities will extend the accessibility and use of 3-D graphic statics by students, designers, and practitioners to learn, share, explore, and design innovative, high-performance, lightweight spatial structural solutions. The result of this project will open a new horizon for an unexplored realm of efficient spatial structural designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this CAREER project is to develop mathematical methods and computational algorithms that (1) effectively construct convex and non-convex (self-intersecting) reciprocal polyhedral diagrams with certain user-input geometric constraints; (2) optimize the magnitude of external loads and the internal forces geometrically; (3) manipulate reciprocal polyhedral diagrams without breaking the topological and geometric dependencies of these diagrams; (4) allow for instant topological editing of both structural form and its force distribution; and (5) enhance the visualization of the reciprocal diagrams to increase design efficiency. This program will also provide a robust software platform and its related application programming interface for design, control and optimization of structures using 3D graphic statics. The software platform will be used in the education of a wide range of students, researchers, and practitioners and broaden the use of 3-d graphic statics in the design and fabrication of highly efficient, innovative, high-performance structural systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
