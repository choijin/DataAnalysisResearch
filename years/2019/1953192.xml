<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract: A Scientific Symposium entitled Convergence Research at High Magnetic Fields will be organized by the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL). A number of scientists, including at least one Nobel Laureate, will present high-level, technical science talks in the areas relevant to the mission of NHMFL. The meeting will expose students to high level research and will encourage participants to discuss the convergence of multiple disciplines and areas of research enabled by NHMFL. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: Modern research in quantum materials, including materials growth, novel measurements, and theory, depends on availability of high magnetic fields provided by NHMFL. A collection of high level speakers creates an excellent opportunity to summarize the research done at NHMFL and expose students to current topics in research. Students will benefit from participating in the lectures and discussions of unsolved problems, and access to speakers and other participants will enable networking. &lt;br/&gt;Throughout the meeting participants will be encouraged to consider new questions that can be addressed across the many areas presented, by identifying convergent research directions. A summary of the conference will be prepared, focusing on areas where collaborations and convergence research seeds have been planted. Timing of the conference is aligned with the MagLab Theory Winter School on Quantum Matter, which will enable broad student participation in the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At this workshop, thirteen world-renown prominent scientists, including one Nobel Laureate, presented high-level technical scientific talks on quantum materials that included novel superconductors, topological materials, and quantum information science.  The invited speakers and 119 attendees covered a wide swath of disciplines in quantum materials which included growth of novel quantum materials, innovative measurement techniques, and pioneering theoretical techniques.  A century ago, the "First Quantum Revolution" focused on the understanding and control of the quantum, which has become the economic basis of our modern society.  Quanta, such a electrons and photons, can be described both as particles and waves, and as waves, the phase, or where the peak and valley of the wave occurs, is an important concept.  The "Second Quantum Revolution" focuses on the understanding and control of the phase of the quantum, which will lead to high-coherence qubits, that may someday lead to quantum sensing, artificial intelligence, and even quantum computing.   This conference bridged the quantum revolutions, with topics that included strongly correlated electron materials, a variety of topological materials, and discussions of coherence, Majorana fermions, and what materials might lead to strongly coherent qubits.  Among the attendees were many students, post-docs, and early career scientists allowing our young people to see many of the long-standing, and new, questions on the fundamental nature of these quantum materials, and some of their existing and promising future applications.  The conference was also diverse in countries of origin, gender, underrepresented minorities, and areas of expertise in quantum materials, which will help to understand and broaden our understanding of these complex and economically promising materials.
