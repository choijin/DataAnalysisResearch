<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will benefit a broad range of medical device users, ranging from hearing aids to deep brain stimulators. The proposed innovation will enable efficient, self-directed tuning of medical devices using patient preference to find the settings that work best for each individual patient. The proposed innovation will improve patient outcomes and satisfaction, and thereby improve efficacy. Additionally, the innovation will reduce the need for patients to travel to expert clinicians, thereby improving access and reducing cost. This I-Corps project will first focus on exploring the application of this technology for creating a self-fitting hearing aid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores the market need for this self-directed tuning algorithm in medical devices. The core technology of the proposed innovation is an AI-guided self-fitting algorithm differentiates itself by efficiently tuning parameterized medical devices based upon user preference. By asking the patient to compare two settings, the innovation efficiently learns the patient's underlying preference, and finds their preferred setting in a small number of comparisons. The technology is currently being used in two pilot studies, where it is learning stimulation parameters for spinal cord stimulation and parkinson's disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This I-Corps project built on the ELâ€™s patent-pending machine learning algorithms for acoustically fitting hearing devices. The main goal of this project was to conduct customer discovery in order to develop our value proposition and customer segments, as well as design our business model canvas.     With the support of the NSF I-Corp program, we carried out extensive customer discovery. During the seven-week program in the spring of 2019, we conducted a total of 111 interviews, almost all of which were in person. Additionally, we participated in weekly webinars and video lessons to learn the foundations of lean startup.     Much was learned about the hearing aid landscape and the role of artificial intelligence in hearing aid settings.  There appears to be great potential for the application of AI to hearing aid self-fittings.  This could be pursued in a future NSF hearing aid project.     The insights learned from the I-Corps process enabled us to narrow our value proposition and identify key customers and stakeholders. Through the process, we concluded that our project was a "no go": while we felt as though we had a strong value proposition, we still had many open questions to answer before we were ready for either decision.
