<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical abstract: Quantum technologies are viewed by many as the next great technological revolution, which will deeply impact future economic growth and national security. The research aims to solve some of the most fundamental and critical problems confronting future quantum technologies by identifying novel materials that host on-demand quantum particles and phases. To achieve this goal, quantum properties of such new materials need to be protected from environmental noise. In two-dimensional crystals quantum electronic properties can be remarkably engineered, offering ability to protect phases from noise. Various interesting quantum states are explored here, focusing on the electronic states organized and protected by correlations and topology. The results will help push forward the frontier of fundamental quantum science, and enable new technical routes toward future quantum technologies. The project trains next generation of quantum scientists and engineers, as the experiments incorporate comprehensive and high-quality educational components for both graduate and undergraduate students. Various educational and outreach activities will be developed for encouraging and training students from underrepresented groups, and educating K-12 students and the public on quantum materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract: Topological quantum matter offers tremendous opportunities for discovering fundamentally new phenomena and applications in electronic systems. For instance, the search for a class of correlated topological quantum matter that hosts non-Abelian anyons is the first step towards developing topological quantum computation. The key to realizing the potential relies on the development of new quantum materials. A rich, largely unexplored material class for topological quantum matter is the family of two-dimensional (2D) crystals. In this project, the principle investigator aims to search for a variety of new, highly tunable topological and correlated quantum states of matter based on novel 2D crystals and their associated structures. Several candidate systems, including devices made from atomically thin WTe2, GdTe3 and their twisted bilayers, are explored. The investigator utilizes and innovates a set of nanofabrication and quantum transport measurement tools for investigating the novel quantum electronic phenomena in these systems, focusing on superconducting, magnetic, and/or topological phases, including the non-Abelian quantum states. The outcomes are expected to generate impact on several sub-fields, including 2D materials, topological matter, non-Abelian physics and quantum information devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
