<AbstractNarration>Anatoly Kolomeisky of William Marsh University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to theoretically investigate the role of various chemical and biological processes. It is known that chemical reactions are random or stochastic processes, i.e., the times before the products appear are varied and broadly distributed. All living systems rely on a large number chemical reactions to support and maintain their activities.  The high efficiency of biological systems, however, raises a question of how random chemical reactions can lead to very precisely controlled biological processes. Professor Kolomeisky proposes that biological systems are able to properly tune the random chemical processes by utilizing several different mechanisms. By combining theoretical modeling, advanced computer simulations and extensive bioinformatics analysis, his research group investigates the mechanisms of various complex chemical and biological systems in order to clarify the role of randomness at the molecular level. Specific projects include: determination of the molecular origin of cell-size control in bacteria; understanding the mechanisms of transcription bursting; uncovering the role of motion in cancer initiation; and investigating the dynamics of heterogeneous catalytic chemical reactions. Close collaborations with experimental and theoretical groups enable testing of the new ideas on the role of randomness, and it promotes a deeper understanding of these complex natural processes.  Professor Kolomeisky is providing opportunities for high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to participate in this research and gain valuable training and experience for their future careers. A special summer research program for visiting female and minority undergraduate students is established. Outreach activities also include the presentation of chemical shows in local schools, co-organization of an undergraduate chemistry research symposium, public lectures delivered at local cafes, and continued collaboration with science writers in order to disseminate the this knowledge to a general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Kolomeisky focuses on developing a comprehensive theoretical description of stochastic effects in living cells by generating quantitative models for several specific biological and chemical phenomena. Theoretical analysis in his group is driven by a central hypothesis that cells are capable of tuning the randomness of biochemical reactions by using two main strategies, which involve a collective effect when many different stochastic processes are coupled together to cancel out the unfavorable random factors.  They also observe a coupling of stochastic processes with external fields (mechanical, electrical, etc.) to control the random features. Professor Kolomeisky will specifically investigate several biological and chemical processes in order to quantify the effect of stochasticity in each of them. These processes are analyzed using a variety of theoretical tools including discrete-state stochastic models, first-passage analysis, bioinformatics methods, and extensive Monte Carlo computer simulations. An outreach program developed by Professor Kolomeisky provides the opportunity for local high-school students and undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups to participate in scientific research in an academic setting via special summer research programs. Professor Kolomeisky organizes a team of chemistry graduate students to give chemical experiments shows in local schools, which are supplemented by popular lectures in order increase the interests in STEM topics. The project also highlights the benefits of science for society by directly presenting scientific findings to the local community in an informal setting of caf√© discussions, as well as communicating with science writers in local newspapers and participating in scientific internet blog discussions. The broader impacts of this project include a multidisciplinary training program for young researchers of different levels that will prepare them better for future technological and industrial challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
