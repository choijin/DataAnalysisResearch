<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the combat effectiveness and safety of warfighters and law enforcement officers by making their gunsights significantly more rugged and reliable than current state of practice.  The research and development conducted under this project will enhance scientific and technological understanding of optical beam steering and optical guidance techniques applicable to broad fields of science and engineering, such as astronomy, missile tracking, remote sensing and self-driving cars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to develop an extremely rugged telescopic sight. Once a telescopic sight is mounted on a rifle, it is necessary to adjust its “point of aim” so that it corresponds to the “point of impact” where the bullet actually hits the target.  Most telescopic sights available today shift the position of the crosshairs inside the sight to adjust the point of aim.  Military and hunting applications require adjustment precision of ½ of a minute of arc or better. Because the turrets and the springs holding the crosshairs in conventional gun sights are delicate mechanical pieces, conventional telescopic sights lose their precision over time due to the rifle’s recoil and other vibrations encountered during field use.  This project will advance a completely new design in which the crosshairs remain fixed while the image of the target formed on the crosshairs is shifted optically. We will study the potential for optical aberrations and mitigation techniques, then optimize the design for both image quality and cost of manufacture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  "Only accurate rifles are interesting".  This is perhaps the most famous quote attributed to Colonel Townsend Whelen, a prolific writer on guns and hunting and the former head of United States Frankford Arsenal. A high-quality riflescope enables accurate aiming at extended ranges (Fig. 01). In this project, we focused on developing a riflescope that not only possessed intrinsic aiming accuracy but also guaranteed that its accuracy is maintained under adverse field conditions over many years of service.  Nearly all riflescopes used today by soldiers, hunters and law-enforcement officers have a spinning turret mechanism (Fig. 02). This mechanism allows the shooter to adjust the internal cross hairs vertically and/or horizontally so that the rifle's point of impact is aligned with the sight's point of aim. This mechanism, while 'basically' functional, has a fundamental design flaw: An error of just a few thousandth of an inch in positioning of the cross hairs will produce a noticeable shift in the sight's point of aim.   To create a more robust riflescope, the PI has invented an "optical solution": Thin wedge prisms are added to the optical path of the rifle scope to induce small deviations in the apparent location of the cross hairs on target image.  In this invention, the cross hairs remain fixed and a lateral or longitudinal shift in prisms' position is inconsequential. Five embodiments (variants) of this invention have been developed and patented by the PI as of 2021. These variants are shown schematically in Fig. 3.  Key Technical Outcomes  A key objective of this project's R&amp;D was to determine which embodiment of this invention (from among 5 patented embodiments shown in Fig. 3) is most suitable for making a commercial telescopic sight. We proved using both mathematical analysis and actual field tests that a rifle scope adjustment system according to this invention can be made such that it achieves +/- 100 cm adjustment at a distance of 100m with angular accuracy of 0.1 milliradians (positioning error less than 1cm on a 100m target). It was further demonstrated that standard BK7 optical glass is sufficient for constructing the wedge prisms used in the system (i.e. more expensive achromatic prisms which were suggested in patent applications are not needed).   Two scientific papers based on the project's results were submitted to the International Optical Design Conference (IODC). Both papers were accepted for oral presentation and were presented by the PI on June 30, 2021. The PI is further writing a comprehensive journal paper titled "Visual Ergonomics of Telescopic Gun Sights" for submission to a prominent peer-reviewed journal such as "Applied Optics" or "Journal of Optical Society of America".  An Unexpected Discovery  An unexpected result of the PI's research was the realization that physiological changes in human vision under dangerous or stressful situations have not been considered in the design of current riflescopes.  Current riflescopes force the shooter's eye to adapt for "near focus" in order to see the target, the foreground and the background simultaneously. This is fine when the shooter is calm and relaxed but under conditions of fear and stress - which is the predominant condition in the battlefield and during the peak of a hunt- the human eye can not achieve near focus: In response to acute stress, the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system sends a flash flood of hormones to increase the body's alertness and heart rate. These hormones also quicken breathing, dilate the eye pupil and push the focus state of the eye towards seeing far.  Researchers have shown that sympathetic innervation acts with a time course of 10 to 40 seconds to produce hyperopia (eye focusing for far) of at most 1.5 diopters. As a result of the conflict between the near focus required by the riflescope and the involuntary far focus induced by the sympathetic activation, a stressed soldier or hunter will not see his target clearly when looking through his riflescope. The PI hopes to find an opportunity to investigate this topic more fully during Phase II of the project.   Opportunities for Training and Professional Development  This award allowed the PI to license a professional optical design software (CODE-V) and learn how to use it. In also gave the PI an opportunity to read a vast body of scientific literature on visual perception and eye physiology including the works by prominent American psychologist James J. Gibson and Nobel-prize winning physiologists David H. Hubel and Thorsten N. Wiesel.     Last but not least, this SBIR grant helped the PI learn how to set up a proper company, hire an accounting firm, establish a formal office, set up payroll, etc.   I wish to close by expressing my profound gratitude to the NSF not only for funding this project but also for the important contribution the Foundation makes to the country.
