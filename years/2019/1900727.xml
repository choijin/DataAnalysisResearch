<AbstractNarration>The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) will host the 53rd Annual Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference (STDC), March 14-16, 2019 in Birmingham, Alabama. The STDC is one of the longest standing regular conferences in general topology, having started in 1967 and continuing as an annual conference.  It attracts participants nationally and internationally.  The STDC regularly attracts over 150 participants, and often over 200.  There are 7 plenary talks and 12 semi-plenary talks in most areas of topology and its applications by established researchers.  Talks bridging two or more research areas are encouraged.  In a highly technological society like the USA, a high level science research, and in particular mathematics research, is crucial for further progress. Conferences are an essential part for developing successful and competitive research programs in mathematics and for the education of young researchers. The STDC has played an essential part in the success and education of many of its participants. The conference will include contributed talks by PhD students, post-doctoral students, as well as junior mathematicians, and will encourage diversity among speakers.  There are six special sessions in subareas of topology including a new session in Topology and Graph Theory. More information and an invitation to participate may be found at the conference website:  http://www.uab.edu/cas/mathematics/mathnews/stdc&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The 53rd Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will run six special sessions: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Topology, Geometric Group Theory, Set&lt;br/&gt;Theoretic Topology, and Topology and Graph Theory that will include most topics of contemporary research in topology as well as highlighting connections between topology and other mathematical subjects. The session on Topology and Graph Theory is being included for the first time this year.  The winner of the Mary Ellen Rudin Award for a beginning mathematician will be announced at this meeting, and will be invited to give a plenary address.  The conference has succeeded in strengthening major connections between areas which normally do not interact. Particularly effective have been interactions between dynamical systems and continuum theory, between geometric topology and continuum theory, between geometric topology and geometric group theory, and between set theoretic topology and continuum theory. The interaction between these areas and graph theory is being encouraged by particularly inviting speakers who can bridge between the former areas and graph theory. The STDC encourages these interactions by providing travel support to students, post-docs, and junior mathematicians, by encouraging the special session organizers to seek diversity in those they invite to speak in a special session, and by welcoming unsolicited submissions for speaking in a special session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
