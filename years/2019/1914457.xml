<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is primarily a solution to recent concerns of the effects of nanoparticles on overall health. Based on scientific claims that nanoparticles are detrimental to an individuals health, regulatory agencies, companies, and the general public have become more vigilant in finding non-nano alternatives to materials and products that they have been using. In addition to providing a non-nano alternative to existing metal oxides used in many personal care products, this project also allows for more environmentally friendly manufacturing processes and end products. Cost-effective synthetic methods will allow for these alternatives to be feasible replacements to formulators, toxicologists, and other people involved in the manufacturing decision-making process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to focus on finding the best product market fit for the novel synthetic methodology of Zinc Oxide. This synthesis relies on milder temperatures with only water-based precursors that are utilized to yield surfactant-free, morphologically identical, and non-nano zinc oxide particles. The same methodology can be use to yield metal-doped zinc oxide constructs with enhanced properties depending on the metal used. The eclectic nature and environmentally friendly qualities of the reactants make this one-pot synthesis a perfect candidate for an ecologically conscious alternative to the state-of-the-art zinc oxide synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The features of Zinco Verde chemical synthesis include (i) water-based, (ii) scalable, (iii) highly reproducible, and (iv) versatile. This process yields robust ultra pure, non-nano particles that do not need surfactants and have intrinsic antibacterial properties, and can be doped with any metal. The eco-friendly synthesis takes place at low temperature and pressure ( oC, 1 atm). Our product is eco-friendly and will reduce the environmental impact on aquatic life caused by chemical based sunscreen products and products containing nanoparticles of mineral sunscreens. One of the largest pain points described by formulators, was a difficulty in having a high SPF product that will blend into the skin quickly. This is due to the white color of ZnO. Zinco Verde's synthetic methodology allows for tinting of the mineral SPF active ingredient itself so more skin tones can be addressed with a mineral sunscreen. Several formulators we spoke to actually expressed that they would be willing to pay more for intrinsically colored SPF active materials. Within the cosmetic formulations industry, we would initially act as a zinc oxide supplier to smaller companies who work with clients in the green beauty industry. Aside from the cosmetic and personal care industry, there are a number of other industries we could impact, including rubber, ceramics, and paint. The importance of finding alternative greener solutions needs to be addressed in every aspect of our society. Zinco Verde represents an innovative effort to find an alternative path to commodity product development.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/21/2020<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;Blaho</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
