<AbstractNarration>Vector and tensor fields provide a powerful language to describe physical phenomena in many scientific applications. In atmospheric sciences, vectors are used to represent air movements with speed and directions and to capture typical and atypical atmospheric conditions. In materials science, stress and strain tensors are used to specify the behaviors of material bodies experiencing deformations and to facilitate the study of material strength. The main objective of this project is to define and quantify robust features in vector and tensor fields and to derive scientifically meaningful visualization for knowledge discovery. Robust features are objects, structures, or regions of interest that are stable under small perturbations of the data that arise from measurement noise, numerical instability or simulation uncertainty. Robust features are defined and evaluated via close collaborations with domain scientists to help them discriminate spurious from essential structures in the data. In materials science, the extraction of robust features in stress tensor fields will help the materials scientists better characterize and predict 3D cracking for manufacturing stronger materials. In neuroscience, quantifying the robustness of degenerate elements in brain imaging will offer new metrics and visualization in characterizing tissue microstructure for disease diagnostics. In bioengineering, robust vortex extraction and tracking of 3D conduction velocity fields in the heart will help bioengineers develop new metrics that detect and characterize ischemic stress associated with a heart attack. In atmospheric sciences, extracting and visualizing robust features in wind data will help the atmospheric scientists establish situation awareness of hazardous weather conditions such as wildfires and to provide wildfire weather forecasting and resource planning for firefighting personnel. This project will also provide a unique environment for multidisciplinary activities and training opportunities for students in integrating visualization with scientific applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish a new approach to feature-based visualization with three interconnected aims. First, it will derive novel mathematical formulations of robust features for vector and tensor fields and their ensembles. Second, it will develop new robustness-driven algorithms in feature extraction, tracking, simplification, visual representation, and uncertainty visualization. Third, it will apply and evaluate the proposed framework via close collaborations with scientists in four high-impact application areas: materials science, neuroscience, bioengineering, and atmospheric sciences. Using simulated micro-mechanical fields in an uncracked polycrystal, the project will integrate robust features with visualization to improve the interpretability of micro-mechanical fields and the prediction of fatigue-failure surfaces. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) from the Human Connectome Project, the project will investigate quantifiable characteristics of crossing fibers as part of a long-term goal for deep brain stimulator placement. Using 3D conduction velocity generated in volumes of swine and canine tissues, the project will generate feature-based signatures from vortex stability and evolution and use them, in the long term, for disease diagnostics and medical intervention. Using ensemble datasets generated from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh Model (HRRR), the project will use robust features in the visualization and statistical analysis of atmospheric models to identify atypical atmospheric conditions for wildfire weather assessment. The research results will be instantiated by a collection of research papers and open-source software tools targeting the communities of collaborating scientists and the large research community. These software tools will be made available via GitHub under MIT or BSD licenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
