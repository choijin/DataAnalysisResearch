<AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks funding to support graduate and postdoctoral student participation in the 26th meeting of the North American Catalysis Society (NACS) to be held in Chicago, Illinois June 16-20, 2019. The funds will provide registration fees and accommodation assistance to 38 students from U.S. universities as administered through the merit-based Kokes Travel Award program sponsored by the NACS. The students will present their research at the conference, attend lectures by leaders in the field of catalysis, and provide assistance to the organizers in running the meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biennial NACS meetings are the largest North American meetings dedicated to catalysis. Student participation helps train young researchers in this vital aspect of science and enginering that supports advances in environmental pollution control, energy utilization, sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction, and competitiveness of the U.S. chemical and petroleum industries. The Kokes Award selection committee will ensure appropriate representation of women and underrepresented groups in making their awards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
