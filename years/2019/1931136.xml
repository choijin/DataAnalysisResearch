<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for undergraduate student participation in the Symposium on Undergraduate Research. This Symposium will be held at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Laser Science (DLS), in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Optical Society of America. The conference program includes many of the research topics central to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in laser science acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is scheduled to be held Washington DC on September 16, 2019. It offers an opportunity for undergraduate students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The nineteenth annual DLS Symposium on Undergraduate Research at LS-XXXV was held in Washington, DC on Monday, 16 September, 2019.   Monday morning was unscheduled and the students used the time to mount their posters and become further acquainted with one another.  Our Symposium events began at noon with the luncheon in the Hoover Room on a balcony overlooking the lobby of the Marriott Wardman hotel.  We had a sandwich lunch for our participants and several guests, who spoke extemporaneously to the assembled group on a variety of topics initiated by student questions.  The guests were primarily mentors, and the exchanges were lively and stimulating.  The guests included Nobel Laureate Donna Strickland, Steve Cundiff (Schawlow Prize), Anne Kelley (DLS chair), Randy Bartels (DLS chair elect), Brad Conrad (SPS director), Joe Eberly (past OSA president), and mentors Kristan Corwin (recent past DLS chair), Jenny Magnes, Mike Raymer, Catherine Herne, Klaus Bartschat, Nathan Lundquist, Samir Bali, Hong Lin, and others. The students were especially fortunate this year to have so many highly visible optical scientists meet and talk with them during the lunch. We heard inspiring remarks and lively discussion from several of these distinguished guests about career paths, the Nobel ceremony, grad schools, advances in the optical sciences, etc.   The exchanges were lively and stimulating, and the 1:00 PM ending came all too soon.  The scientific events began with the poster session on the circular balcony outside the Hoover room overlooking the hotel lobby.  It was a highly visible place and many conference attendees come upstairs to meet the students and talk with them about their work.  The session included 52 papers whose abstracts were published in an eight-page program (copy attached) and ran from 1:00 to 4:00. It was presided by Prof. Catherine Herne from SUNY New Paltz. The entire area was abuzz with conversation and discussion as the delighted presenters talked about their work to interested scientists and fellow students.  The poster session was followed by a brief break for a group photo (see below) that was taken nearby.   The oral presentation session began at 4:45 and lasted until 6:00.

Besides students and mentors, there were quite a few regular conference attendees present over the course of the afternoon who may have learned about the session from the programs included in their registration packages or from the posted signs.  The quality of the talks was uniformly very high, and the oral session was an unqualified success.  Students enjoyed snacks during the session, courtesy of our corporate sponsor, Thorlabs.  Sign boards with logos of all the corporate sponsors were prominently displayed at all Symposium meals and sessions.  It was gratifying that these very young scientists could give their first presentations at a professional meeting, and it was clearly a memorable event for them.
