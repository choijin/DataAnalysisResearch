<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to support the attendance of Ph.D. students at the 2018 Ph.D. Colloquium and Winter Simulation Conference. The Winter Simulation Conference is a leading international conference in the field of simulation and is widely attended by researchers from all over the world. This award will support the participation of graduate students who will become the next generation of leaders in the simulation community.  Participation in international scientific discussion forums is an important mechanism in building a mature workforce in scientific research, and this award will enable interaction of emerging U.S. scholars with their counterparts and senior researchers from Europe and elsewhere.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colloquium and Conference will be held at the Swedish Exhibition and Congress Center in Gothenburg, Sweden, from December 9-12, 2018. The Colloquium is organized by four leading simulation researchers and provides attendees the opportunity to present their research and to interact with senior researchers from both academia and industry.  Workshop organizers will include the broadest possible group of highly qualified Ph.D. students for support and will particularly identify candidates from underrepresented STEM groups and from non-Research 1 institutions.  The workshop will be broadly promoted through major professional societies and list serves, such as the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS), the IEFac.list, the Simulation Society Discussion Board, and the Winter Simulation Conference mailing list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
