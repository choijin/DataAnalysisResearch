<AbstractNarration>The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) is joining as a new site (CICI-UTA) to the existing ?Center for Integration of Composites into Infrastructure (CICI)?, a NSF Industry - University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) based in West Virginia University. The mission of CICI is to accelerate the adoption of composites into infrastructure applications with a particular focus on structural applications. CICI-UTA research team participation will enhance the integration of composite material utilization in various geo infrastructures areas including deep foundations (fender piles), mechanically stabilized earth walls (retaining walls), sheet piles, and others in both natural and extreme soil environments.  CICI-UTA will also work with all center sites in studying and implementing composites underground under harsh environment; harvesting composite samples for fundamental durability studies; and studying fibre-reinforced polymer composites as reinforcements in expansive soils to mitigate heaving failures. CICI-UTA will have strong educational and graduate training programs, and will train skilled and high caliber doctoral and masters students in civil engineering with special emphasis on composites. As a part of new Hispanic Serving Institute (HSI), UTA team members will be able to recruit Hispanic and other minority undergraduate and graduate students to involve and train them in the proposed research works. Research team will work with CICI sites to disseminate research results through conference presentations, publications in technical journals, short-courses and other means. Also, research results will be further integrated into the design, codes of practice, and academic curricula as desired by the industry/end-users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CICI-UTA will complement CICI?s research efforts by focusing and studying on different types of polymeric based geosynthetics and geocomposites, biopolymers and geopolymers and their applications in civil and military infrastructure in geotechnical, soil-structure and superstructure related areas. CICI-UTA team will also focus on bringing out sustainability aspects of using polymeric and other composites by addressing life cycle cost benefits. Research topics will be formulated, screened and selected by the Industrial Advisory Board members.</AbstractNarration>
