<AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;This project creates a partnership between the New York City College of Technology (City Tech), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Rutgers University that provides an opportunity for geoscience experts to come away from their busy routine activities (most of which do not allow the time and the setting for thoughtful reflection and engagement about the geosciences in general and about their own geoscience programs and innovations, in particular) and to huddle together for three days in a bid to create a geoscience support group, to exchange ideas about geoscience programs for URMs and marginalized groups, to document their tested strategies and best practices, and to forward-think about the shaping and the reshaping of a geoscience landscape that implements strategies and methodologies that encourages, embraces, and integrates diversity and inclusion. &lt;br/&gt;The deliverables from this project will have transformative and sustainable effects on the geosciences. Not only will the project attract, add, and encourage a new cadre of geoscience experts to the geoscience writing and publication community, but it will also increase and proliferate best practices for engaging URMs and other marginalized groups in the geosciences and thereby potentially increase the successful participation of these neglected groups in the geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;This workshop seeks to take advantage of extant expertise in the atmospheric sciences to bolster the efforts related to workforce development and inclusive educational practices. Specifically, the project will: a) collect and compile geoscience research studies that will potentially advance knowledge about how best to engage URMs and other marginalized groups in the geosciences; b) provide hand-held guidance on how to prepare and submit a geoscience educational article that focuses on diversity and inclusion, and c) train and engage City Tech undergraduates in geoscience educational research. By providing expert guidance in writing and submitting geoscience educational research papers to peer-reviewed journals, articles developed at the workshop will be widely disseminated. Moreover, by posting the articles on City Tech's OpenLab site, they will be easily accessible to not only the geoscience community, but also to any group, institution, or person across the globe who has interest in cultivating diversity in the geosciences or in any other discipline. One of the highlights of this project is that it is replicable, adaptable, and adoptable. It may be scaled to involve more partners, more participants, and ultimately to produce more geoscience educational research articles that will help to inform how best to expand the geoscience tent as far as diversity and inclusion are concerned. Through this proposed project, geoscience practitioners who perhaps never would have documented their work, now have an opportunity to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
