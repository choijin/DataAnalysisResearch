<AbstractNarration>Ice sheets are tightly connected to the underlying earth upon which they rest. Where liquid water resides at the bottom of an ice sheet, it can exchange with the groundwater system. Whether the bottom of an ice sheet is frozen or melted is therefore an important control on the connection between ice and groundwater but depends on the complex ways in which water and heat pass between ice and earth systems. In this project the PI, with expertise in glacier science, will work closely with groundwater experts at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, sharing discipline-specific knowledge to overcome challenges to understanding connections between ice sheets and groundwater systems. The PI will carry out computer modeling that connects both ice sheet and groundwater systems to determine how groundwater flow influences where the bottom of the ice sheet is frozen or melted. Where a glacier or ice sheet is frozen or melted at its base controls where it can slide, and also determines where water can recharge the groundwater system. Outcomes from the project are therefore relevant to both ice sheet dynamics and groundwater flow in cold regions. The project will increase research capacity and student opportunities at University of Montana, and guest lectures to Montana high schools will benefit the local jurisdiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water cycling in the Arctic is distinctly unique from the global hydrologic cycle due to the presence of large ice masses that source and generally drive groundwater to adjacent terrestrial and ocean systems. Linking coupling processes between ice sheet and groundwater systems, however, requires merging the knowledgebase and skillsets of a spectrum of scientific sub-disciplines. The objective of this project is to overcome discipline-specific barriers by enabling close collaboration, sharing of expertise, and educational exchange between experts in ice sheet processes and groundwater systems. Project research is focused on mass and energy feedbacks on the inland extent of melted conditions at the bottom of an ice sheet: a key problem that is highly relevant to both glaciology and hydrogeology disciplines. The problem will be addressed through novel modeling of coupled ice sheet and groundwater systems: the PI will be an early adopter of modeling packages developed by host collaborators, and generate new thermal coupling between systems. Outcomes of the project will advance understanding of heat and water fluxes across ice sheet and groundwater systems: two critical components of the Arctic that impact sea level rise, groundwater resources at the global scale, and submarine fluxes of fresh groundwater. Activities will generate new learning opportunities for students at the University of Montana, increase the institutionâ€™s research capacity, and yield jurisdictional benefits through outreach lectures to Montana high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
