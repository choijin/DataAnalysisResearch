<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation on the R/V Atlantic Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel owned and operated by Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the United States Academic Research Fleet (ARF).  BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for-profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the Island of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research throughout the Central Atlantic but specifically work in support of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series (BATS) program. RV Atlantic Explorer had 188 days funded in 2018, all but 9 of which were for NSF. In 2019, the vessel is scheduled to sail 1943 days with 1818 (94%) of them funded by NSF. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Seawater System Major Upgrade $62,392 &lt;br/&gt;Serial Data System Upgrades $16,978 &lt;br/&gt;Campbell DataLogger Install  $11,442 &lt;br/&gt;DataLogging Computers w/ DC Power $16,616 &lt;br/&gt;Wire Health/Event Logger Software  $25,838 &lt;br/&gt;Profiling WetLabs Fluorometers $14,455 &lt;br/&gt;Teledyne ADCP Deckbox $23,412 &lt;br/&gt;Knudsen Chirp 3260 Deckbox $36,441 &lt;br/&gt;   $207,574 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award, in the amount of $107,428 &shy;&shy;&shy;was used to purchase oceanographic instrumentation and equipment for required for upgrading the scientific capabilities of the R/V ATLANTIC EXPLORER. Purchase and installation of proposed and funded instrumentation and equipment included the following.  1) Scientific Seawater System Major Upgrade: $62,392  In 2019, the OTS department at BIOS installed a completely new Underway Seawater Sampling System.  This new system improved on all known deficiencies that its predecessor had including adding duplicates of all the flow-through sensors and making the plumbing easier to operate, troubleshoot and clean. Thanks to this grant, the ship now has the ability to run with duplicate Fluorometers, Thermosalinographs and Transmissometers year-round.  This focus on making maintenance easier has greatly improved the accuracy and dependability of this underway system.  Better accuracy is also achieved by having duplicate sensors that are able to help scientists and technicians identify faulty data much quicker.  This new system was designed to last the rest of the life of the ship.  2)  Serial Data System Upgrade: $16,978 Two Actisense NBF-3 NMEA 0183 Buffers, one Pro-Buf-1, and three 8-port DB9 patch panels were purchased from NavStore. 1000ft of outdoor shielded serial data cable was also purchased from Amazon. These were purchased in order to expand the serial data access for scientists in the labs on the R/V Atlantic Explorer.   Scientists now have direct access to data from the GPS units, GPS-Compasses, Gyro, ADU800, and even weather data. This new network of permanent NMEA feeds to all the labs has helped meet the majority of scientists’ needs without having to take time to program a custom moxa connection. It also allows for scientists to plug these feeds directly into any of their instrument’s deck boxes.   3) Campbell DataLogger Install: $11,442  BIOS completed its implementation of the switchover from SCS as its primary datalogger for all underway sensors to the Campbell Scientific infrastructure.  Two CR1000x Dataloggers, four 24VDC Power Regulators, two Serial Data Modules and several other smaller Campbell Scientific accessories were purchased from Campbell Scientific.   4)  Datalogging Computers with DC Power: $16,616  Two Cincoze Rugged Intel Skylake fanless DS-1100-S computers were purchased from Logic Supply. These computers were used to replace older rack-mounted computers that were nearing the end of their life.          Last Modified: 10/05/2020       Submitted by: Nicholas R Bates]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
