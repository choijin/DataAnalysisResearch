<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project results from the ability to design a reusable nanofiltration membrane platform for wastewater treatment. Energy-efficient and effective wastewater treatment for water purification and reuse remains a tremendous challenge because safe and reliable approaches are often capital and energy intensive. The production of clean water from wastewater for municipal or industrial reuse requires the removal of a wide range of organic and inorganic contaminants, including many hazardous and toxic substances (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, etc.). Energy costs are driven even higher by the high fouling propensity of polymeric membranes with the wide array of water contaminants.  Preventing fouling and enabling high contaminant rejection with low energy requirements remain the two core challenges of membrane filtration for wastewater treatment. The proposed technology will address the two core challenges through the use of an anti-fouling surface chemistry. The low energy requirements, contaminant rejection, and anti-fouling properties of the proposed membrane make it a disruptive innovation that can easily penetrate the market, providing a cost-effective solution that is lacking in current membrane purification systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a nanofiltration technology utilizing surface chemistry modification for the creation of an anti-fouling membrane for the rejection of pesticides.  The United States spends nearly $9 billion a year on pesticides, which account for 16% of the world pesticide market. Out of the 25 most common active ingredients in pesticides, 76% are water soluble, which leads to contaminated soil, groundwater, and nearby bodies of water. The objectives of this project are to remove common commercial pesticides from water while investigating the advantageous effects of an anti-fouling membrane surface. Performance of the membrane will be investigated through cross flow filtration experiments to identify rejection, stability, and anti-fouling properties. The vision is to create a nanofiltration membrane  with a broad contaminant rejection while decreasing energy requirements and fouling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>CatalyzeH2O had identified an urgency for a technology in the wastewater treatment field to address bacterial fouling for membrane systems. Through interviews with 100 professionals in wastewater treatment facilities, consulting firms, membrane manufacturers, and industrial manufacturing processes, CatalyzeH2O has found that current nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes are prone to irreversible biofilm/fouled layers after minimal use in water treatment procedures. CatalyzeH2O directed research toward applying a material coating to membranes and other surfaces to reduce fouling to provide the wastewater treatment industry a solution in this Phase I project. Through customer discovery interviews, CatalyzeH2O realizes that public municipalities and water treatment project contractors require field-proven components before integrating a new technology making them unlikely early adopters of the technology. During the interviews, CatalyzeH2O found that water treatment processes are often updated due to compliance issues not to just increase efficiency. This was important because the proposed technology we are working on does not address a compliance issue but increases operational efficiency. We were prepared to continue to market knowing we would have to beat competitors by showing that our product makes over a 50% cost savings of a difference. Due to COVID, CatalyzeH2O will no longer be exploring this technology to market. COVID has caused this conservative industry to become even more conservative. The key learnings from our customer discovery interviews coupled with the technology hurdles has made exploring this technology further no longer feasible in this economic climate.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/19/2021<br>      Modified by: Shelby&nbsp;L&nbsp;Foster</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
