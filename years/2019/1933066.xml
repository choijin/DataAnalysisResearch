<AbstractNarration>The United States has historically been the global leader in the field of artificial intelligence in education (AIED), or ways to use artificial intelligence technology to enhance teaching and learning in contexts ranging from children learning math in K12 setting, to soldiers learning highly technical jobs in the US military. The preeminent conference in this field is the International AIED conference; at this conference the latest research is presented and practitioners learn the state of the art techniques that allow creation of these important educational technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal would provide partial travel support for 18 Ph.D. students, selected through a competitive process, to attend the AIED conference, present their work, and receive additional mentoring outside of their dissertation committees as part of a doctoral consortium. The intellectual merit of the work rests on the studies the graduate students submit to be considered for participation in the early career track of the conference; this work is then enhanced by guidance from world-class mentors who meet with the students in a structured format to improve their research. The broader impact includes the career impact on the twenty selected students, especially since promising graduate students whose advisors may not have funding to send them to the conference can still be included, and their work can be showcased and improved. Possible long-term broader impacts include building the field of artificial intelligence in education and data analytics researchers and thus eventually, improving the quality of education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Members of the International AI in education (IAIED) society do research at the intersection of computer science, educational psychology, cognitive psychology, and education. The society's annual conference is a top-tier research conference in the area of educational technology.  The 20th edition of the conference (AIED 2019) was held in Chicago, Illinois, from June 25-29, 2019 and was co-located with another key educational technology confererence, Learning@Scale 2019. These conferences, and others like them, help to advance the vision of the Cyberlearning program by examining and discussing how people learn in technology-enhanced environments. These conferences also focus on how learning environments can be designed to best support instruction. AIED in particular focuses on building new learning technologies using Artificial Intelligence and leveraging those technologies to test theories of learning sciences.   This NSF-supported project provided 21    PhD students with travel funds to participate in AIED 2019. All students who received funds applied beforehand, presented their research at the conference, received feedback on their work, connected with other researchers, and wrote a short report afterwards on their experiences. Some of the recipient students were participants in the conference's doctoral consortium (9) and some were first authors of papers that were accepted at the conference (12).   PhD students are the lifeblood of any research society and IAIED is no exception.  Without the keen minds and enthusiasm of young scholars, there would be no future to this (or any) research.  Yet, attending conferences for PhD students is expensive. Many of the students' advisors do not have sufficient resources to pay for their students to attend.
