<AbstractNarration>This CAREER project is motivated by the need for developing environmentally-friendly synthesis methods for next-generation multifunctional 'green' coatings. This proposed research will integrate waterborne non-isocyanate polyurethanes (WNIPUs) technology with functional inorganic pigments to achieve a waterborne non-isocyanate thermal insulating uralkyd coating.  Structure-property-processing relationships will be investigated to understand the non-isocyanate approach, coloration mechanism, and waterborne coating formation and pigmentation. The research will be integrated with educational activities supporting the Corrosion Engineering program at The University of Akron and outreach activities aimed at attracting female students into STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research project will be focused on understanding the structure-property-processing relationships of a WNPU thermal insulating coating. A waterborne non-isocyanate uralkyd with tunable properties will be synthesized by using vegetable oils as the feedstock. The objective of the study will be to gain new insights into the polymerization reaction kinetics and structure-property relationships. To develop coatings that can reflect near-infrared radiation (NIR) and exhibit a variety of colors, three new types of NIR-reflective inorganic pigments that are thermally- and UV-stable will be obtained by doping/co-doping traditional inorganic pigments with metal ions. The structure-property relationships of the doping elements and the pigment properties will be studied to understand pigment coloration mechanisms. The property-processing relationships will be established by studying the processes of pigment dispersion and film formation to achieve desirable coating properties. An application of the produced waterborne non-isocyanate thermal insulating uralkyd coating will be evaluated through an undergraduate senior design project that integrates research and education. The scientific understanding of the polymerization process will lead to a framework for designing waterborne coatings through a non-isocyanate approach that will facilitate the replacement of isocyanate-based coatings. The results of this study can be potentially transferred to other waterborne coating systems that use inorganic pigments. A new course on sustainable coatings will be developed to enrich the curriculum of the Corrosion Engineering program at The University of Akron, the first undergraduate program of its kind in the US. Proposed educational and outreach activities include a 'Green Coatings 101' workshop, women-in-engineering summer camps, and summer research opportunities for high school students aimed at attracting female students into STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
