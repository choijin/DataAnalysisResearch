<AbstractNarration>The funds will support student attendance of the two-day single-track MRS 2019 conference and associated mentoring activities. The conference will be held in New Brunswick, NJ, USA, between August 22nd and August 23rd in 2019. The conference will be hosted on the campus of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. The proposal requests funding support to help approximately 15 U.S. students to attend the MRS 2019 conference.  Participation in the conference will provide motivation and excitement for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students to continue their research journey in multi-robot and multi-agent systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this Student Travel Grant Proposal is to make it possible for U.S. students to attend the conference, present their work, and forge connections with colleagues from around the world. In addition to paper presentations, MRS 2019 will feature 4?6 keynote presentations by internationally renowned roboticists. These presentations will provide succinct, first-hand information on historical perspectives, current state-of-the-art, and future trends of multi- robot and multi-agent systems, which are hard to come by otherwise.  The overall goal of the multi-robot meeting closely matches  the core Robust Intelligence program and cross cutting programs like the National Robotics Initiative (NRI 2.0). In particular, the main theme of MRS, which focuses on multi-robot and multi-agent systems, coincides with the collaborative robotics theme of NRI 2.0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
