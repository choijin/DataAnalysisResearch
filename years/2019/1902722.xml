<AbstractNarration>This award will support students at U.S. institutions to attend the Twentieth ACM Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile 2019). HotMobile, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Insterest Group on Mobile Systems (ACM SIGMOBILE), will be held in Santa Cruz, California, February 27-28, 2019. HotMobile 2019 is the premier workshop targeting mobile computing and system integration fields. Attending this event will benefit the scientific progress of the student's research. The exposure to the technical content of HotMobile 2019 will inspire students to address the tough problems in their respective fields, with a long-term benefit of scientific advances in mobile computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Priority will be given to students who will benefit from attending this workshop but are unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel funding. In addition, applications from female and underrepresented groups in mobile computing research will be strongly encouraged. Up to 25 students will receive travel grants from this award to attend HotMobile 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
