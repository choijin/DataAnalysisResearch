<AbstractNarration>With more than one half of the world's population now living in urban areas, urbanization is a global phenomenon that has been changing the world's physical environment and social fabric. However, urbanization is experienced differently across regions. The varying roles played by the government, local communities, and ordinary citizens are at the root of the diverse urbanization processes across the world. While the government can directly shape the outcome of urbanization through its laws, policies, and regulations, the roles played by local communities and ordinary citizens may be less visible and therefore overlooked. Nevertheless, the various types of grassroots activities can fundamentally affect the outcomes of urbanization (such as the spatial distribution of social resources, the redefinition of urban citizenship, and the reconstruction of property rights). Understanding how local communities and ordinary citizens experience and respond to the urbanization process in different social and cultural contexts can facilitate the development of programs and policies that are appropriate to specific communities or social groups. Such knowledge is especially important to developing countries where urbanization often resulted in uneven distribution of resources and unequal opportunities among social groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Yi Wu of Clemson University will examine the social, political, and technological challenges associated with creating an equal and inclusive society in the midst of a rapid urbanization process. Because of it is urbanizing faster than most other regions, China is an appropriate context for exploring these questions. For example, 13% of China's population lived in cities in the 1950s, while the number reached 53.7% in 2013. Moreover, such rapid urbanization was accompanied by significant political changes, diverse social conflicts, and popular resistance. Conducted by Dr. Yi Wu (Clemson University), this research studies rural communities on China's urban fringes. Specifically, it examines whether and how village communities and rural individuals have defended and redefined their land rights within the context of rapid urbanization in the new-millennium China.  Empirical data will be collected from three villages in China that have been experiencing urbanization at different rates and in different environments. Through participant observation, interviewing, and documentary research, Dr. Yi Wu collect data on (1) land loss caused by urban expansion in these communities, (2) each village's land development plans and strategies, and (3) the rights-asserting activities of rural individuals. Data from these villages will allow a comparison of land use patterns associated with different stages of urbanization, as well as a comparison of the varied perceptions of rural populations on issues of rights, equality, and social justice. Furthermore, data on how rural communities and individuals engage in land bargains may help social scientists and policy makers assess whether and how hybrid and contested property regimes can be conducive to economic development. In short, the questions addressed by this research concern not just China, but other parts of the world, especially developing countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
