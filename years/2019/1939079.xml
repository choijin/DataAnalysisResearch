<AbstractNarration>The Center for Hierarchical Emergent Materials (CHEM) will couple academic researchers with expertise in chemical synthesis, rheology, morphology, simulation, and modeling; with industrial manufactures of paints, pigments, printed electronics, biomedical devices, consumer products, tires and elastomers to develop a new approach to the design, simulation, and modeling of emergent multi-hierarchical structures that impact engineered properties. Academic researchers have been adept at the construction of molecular to nanoscale architectures for targeted self-assembly. Industrial researchers, on the other hand, have been equally adept at the manipulation of manufacturing and application/use conditions to control emergent structures that govern features like gloss, haze, biocompatibility, electrical and ionic conductivity, and toughness in engineered materials like paint, reinforced elastomers, inks, healthcare products and plastics. An example might be phenomena that occur when paint is processed, stored, applied, and dried. During this process pigment nano-aggregates and agglomerates may breakup, reform, and finally produce an emergent network structure that spans atomic to macroscopic scales in a complex multi-structural hierarchy. Often the multi-hierarchies have time dependence to their structural maturation and performance, i.e. "4D materials". This is the case as an ink dries on paper developing a multi-hierarchical structure that interacts with light. Similar structural hierarchies are produced in tire manufacturing and lead to a dynamic hierarchy, coupled to the structural hierarchy, important to road performance. Such complex emergent systems can only be studied by a team of academic researchers in close interaction with their industrial partners who can take advantage of the technology which is developed. Finding parallel approaches in divergent fields, the center will leverage existing synthetic, processing and simulation approaches in application to new fields, for instance, taking advantage of knowledge or emergence of structure in reinforced elastomers to produce new nanocomposite solid electrolytes for lithium batteries. An undergraduate research program (REU) focusing on minorities, the handicapped, and women will be associated with the Center, with students integrated across the three campuses and industrial partners for research projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Hierarchical Emergent Materials (CHEM) assembles a team of twelve world leaders in research from three universities, the University of Michigan, the University of Cincinnati and the University of Delaware. The center will be organized in three thrusts: I. Disordered Structural Hierarchies including reinforced elastomers, synthetic skin, and pigments; II. Ordered Structural Hierarchies including semi-crystalline materials and synthetic approaches to self-assembly; and III. Surfactants and Coacervates including worm-like micelles, coacervates, and biometric assembly. The goal of the Center for Hierarchical Materials (CHEM) is to address chemical and biological products and processes where chemical and nanoscale manipulation and processing lead to the emergence of complex hierarchical structures with direct impact on performance. These products are extremely common across a range of industries, yet have not been studied in a coherent, interdisciplinary manner, making full use of technical and scientific expertise and advances. The impact of the center will be in new predictive simulations and models, new approaches garnered partly by borrowing concepts across the different disciplines of application, new products and processes that take advantage of scientific understanding of these dynamic emergent materials. The University of Delaware has several unique analysis capabilities that will facilitate the research of faculty, students, and industrial partners who participate in CHEM. These the Center for Advanced Microscopy (CAMM) and Microanalysis and the Advanced Materials Characterization Laboratory (AMCL) in the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Laboratory (ISE-Lab). UD is also home to the Center for Neutron Science (CNS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is a planning grant for an Industry/University Collaborative Research Center called the Center for Heirarchical Materials (CHEM).  The goal of the project is to develop a full proposal for the center.  Three universities are involved: The University of Delaware, the University of Michigan, and the University of Cincinnati.  The PIs for the project participated in training sessions with NSF and its representatives, and a virtual planning meeting with industrial participants was held in August 2020.   Web pages for the center and planning meeting were created.  30 extermal participants were engaged with the planning meeting in August from 19 different institutions.           Center for Hierarchical Emergent Materials (CHEM)   http://www.eng.uc.edu/~beaucag/CHEM/CHEM.html   Webpage for the center     http://www.eng.uc.edu/~beaucag/CHEM/CenterPlanningMeetingAgenda.html   Web page for the virtual planning meeting.       Individuals who participated from UD include PI David C. Martin, and Co-PIs Darrin Pochan, Arthi Jayaraman, and Norman Wagner.  Also participating in the planning meeting from UD were COE Director of Entrepreneurship Dr. Julius Korley and from the Office of Economic Innovation and Partnership Michael Blaustein.        The Center for Hierarchical Emergent Materials (CHEM) draws from multiple industrial sectors and seeks to find technical symbiosis between parallel fields guided by a basic scientific understanding of control over structural emergence from nano- scale additives. The emergence of multi-hierarchical structures is common to paints, stains, inks, reinforced elastomers, polymer additives. These are used in a wide range of commodity and specialized fields from coatings to solid electrolytes and shampoos and conditioners. Traditional understanding in materials science and chemical engineering involves consideration of one structural level at one size scale. The multi-hierarchical approach considers how modifications of chemistry, size, processing on the nano-scale can lead to emergence of colloidal, micron and macroscopic structure, and properties that can be beneficial to targeted markets.           CHEM is intended to impact multiple disciplines with a central theme of understanding the scientific basis for structural emergence from nanoscale materials.  The CHEM planning process during the summer, including the virtual planning meeting itself, opened up new avenues of communication between different industrial sectors from the elastomer industry, paints, pigments, biomedical, pulp and paper industries.  We currently anticipate submitting the full proposal in June 2021.              Last Modified: 01/11/2021       Submitted by: David C Martin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
