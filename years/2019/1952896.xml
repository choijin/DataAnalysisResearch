<AbstractNarration>With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program, this Track 1 project aims to use technology and cybersecurity as catalysts to increase the STEM graduation rate, particularly of Hispanic and other underrepresented student groups. The project seeks to develop a seamless pathway from high school to two-year institutions, and then to a four-year institution.  This pathway includes alignment of STEM curricula to enhance the transition from an associate degree to bachelor's degrees in STEM, with a focus on cybersecurity. The project aims to increase student enrollment and engagement in STEM coursework at two-year institutions, improve the transition from lower- to upper-division coursework, and develop culturally based educational and support practices that contribute to student success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By developing a transition pathway in technology and cybersecurity, the project seeks to increase the enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of STEM students, particularly of Hispanic students and students from other groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields. To enhance their engagement in STEM, students will participate in the National Cyber League boot camp training and cybersecurity competitions. The project will facilitate professional development in cultural responsibility and sensitivity for teachers, advisors, coaches, and administrators at participating high schools, community colleges, and universities. The project will use quantitative and qualitative metrics to investigate how the project activities impact student enrollment and graduation rates in STEM, with emphasis on technology and cybersecurity programs. Data from this research project will be analyzed using structured equation modeling methodology to reveal significant path coefficients and goodness-of-fit model indices for both the community college and university research models. The project aims to develop a model that may be implemented at other institutions seeking to develop associate-to-bachelor degree pathways. Results and findings will be shared via conference presentations and academic journal publications. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
