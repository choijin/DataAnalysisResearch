<AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;At its 2020 annual meeting, the GLOBE national and global education community will share current practices, research, and strategies for bringing Earth system education to more schools and citizen scientists around the world. This includes both data collection with popular GLOBE science protocols and protocols of interest to the community and best practices for integrating GLOBE into classrooms, informal education programs, with undergraduate students, with interested citizens and with the research community more broadly. Additionally, through a retrospective look at GLOBE over the 25 years of the program, participants will have the opportunity to learn about long-term involvement with GLOBE and how GLOBE has changed over the years. Through the work with the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force and its recommendations, participants will have the potential to reach even more people in their own communities. Additionally, students attending the meeting will obtain experience discussing their research with peers and scientists from around the world as well as tools on how to discuss Earth system science with their families and communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;At the Annual Meeting, the theme of Reflecting on the Past, Looking to the Future will be explored further in multiple strands. These strands are: 1) A Welcoming GLOBE; 2) Collaborations Around the World; 3) 25 Years of GLOBE; and 4) The Next 25 Years. Additionally, trainers and mentor trainers will train participants in the top five GLOBE protocols and the top five requested protocols at the meeting. The GLOBE participants will learn about the GLOBE Diversity and Inclusion Task Force recommendations for making more GLOBE more welcoming and inclusive. GLOBE students will learn about science storytelling and how to share their knowledge with their schools, communities, and families. GLOBE teachers from non-traditional schools (e.g., schools focused on learners with disabilities, talented and gifted, etc.) will be invited to participate and share at the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
