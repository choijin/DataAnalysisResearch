<AbstractNarration>The building blocks of matter, protons and neutrons, are made up of smaller constituents, which are called quarks and gluons.  In collisions of heavy nuclei accelerated to nearly the speed of light, a new state of matter is formed, called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).  In this matter, the protons and neutrons seem to "melt", allowing the quarks and gluons to form a soup-like phase with a viscosity that is nearly as low as possible, earning it the title of a perfect liquid.  This project will answer fundamental questions about the QGP, such as how normal matter came into being and how it evolved from the primordial soup of matter which existed just after the Big Bang.  The goal of the project is to probe the inner workings of the QGP and determine its properties at much shorter length scales by using high momentum collisions of quarks from within the heavy nuclei collisions. This research will be performed with the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), which is located at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  This award will also support the PI's mentoring of graduate students and undergraduate students as well as broadening the participation of people from underrepresented groups in STEM through outreach activities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particle jets are formed in the very initial stages of the heavy nuclei collision, when two quarks or gluons have a high momentum collision.  In this collision they are kicked in opposite directions from one another, roughly perpendicular to the beam of heavy ion particles. The quarks and gluons from such an interaction will travel through the QGP, interacting with and losing energy to it. They then fragment and hadronize into a spray of particles which can be measured by the detectors at STAR.  The energy scale of the particle jet is inversely proportional to the length scale that it can probe.   This effort will focus on observables related to prompt photon-jet correlations at the top collision energies at RHIC.   Observables in this category have the advantage that the transverse momentum of jets produced these collisions is explicitly known, due to both conservation of momentum, and the non-interaction of the photon with the QGP. These measurements will be necessary to understand the temperature and energy dependence of key features of theoretical models of the quark-gluon interactions, and thus understand how the strong nuclear force operates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this grant is to study the strong nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, otherwise known as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), at extreme temperatures and densities.  This is done by accelerating heavy nuclei such as gold to nearly the speed of light, and colliding them, which produces a droplet of matter that is so hot that the protons and neutrons within these nuclei melt and free their constituent quarks and gluons (otherwise known as partons).  This droplet of matter, the quark gluon plasma (QGP), rapidly expands and cools after its creation, until the quarks and gluons recombine into normal particles known as hadrons. The very small size and lifetime of the QGP droplet means that it is impossible to use an external probe to examine its properties.  We proposed using particle jets, which are formed in a small fraction of these ?heavy-ion collisions? when a parton is struck so that it travels with a high rate of speed, and fragments into a spray of particles which can be measured using detectors.  When this happens in the presence of the QGP, the parton will lose energy as it travels through the medium due to its QCD interactions in a process called jet quenching.  This can be quantified because the final state jet particles measured by the detectors will be modified compared to collisions where no QGP is produced (such as in proton-proton collisions).  By studying the modification with respect to the elements related to the geometry of the collision, we can perform tomography of the QGP and thus better understand how QCD operates.  We studied these heavy-ion collisions with the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), located at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  We examined extremely rare events where a quark and photon were produced with high energy, instead of a pair of partons.  Photons only interact via the electromagnetic force, so they don?t interact strongly with the QGP.  This means that measuring the photon?s momentum allows a better determination of the momentum and energy its partner quark, which will fragment into a jet. Due to the non-interaction of the photon, this is an unbiased measurement with respect to the geometry of the QGP droplet.  We found that in collisions which were head-on collisions (labeled central collisions) the jets lost more energy to the medium compared to peripheral collisions.  Under this grant, we maintained the STAR Event Plane Detector (EPD), which is a key component of the STAR research plan.  This includes installing and removing it before and after the run, as well as calibrating the detector over the course of the entire run and ensuring that it is configured so that it can efficiently select collisions that occur at the center of the STAR detector.  One of the purposes of this detector is to allow a determination of the collisions geometry by measuring the pattern of the charged particles from the collision.  This determination is more complicated for the lower energy collisions that are being measured at STAR during the next few years.  We determined a linear weighting methodology that allowed a determination of the collision geometry with high resolution using simulated collisions.  In addition to the scientific progress, this grant allowed the graduate students and undergraduate students to receive training in problem solving, developing practical STEM skills such as programming, using CAD programs for detector design, learning the basics of electronics.  In particular, since this research requires large-scale computing as we need to acquire and analyze data on the petabyte scale, which allows the students within the project to gain experience in big data analytics.  Student supported by this grant had a chance to report their research at either the APS or DNP conferences, which developed their science communications skills.
