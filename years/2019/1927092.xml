<AbstractNarration>The National Academy of Sciences will support 10 U.S. Early Career Scientists' travel to the 2019 International Quaternary Association (INQUA) Congress through this Travel Fellowship Program. The quadrennial INQUA International Congress represents the foremost opportunity for Quaternary (last 2.6 million years of Earth's history) scientists from around the world to present their research and discuss the latest developments in their disciplines. Without this assistance these scientists could not normally participate. This Congress, which has a special programming thread for early career scientists, will give U.S. participants the unique opportunity to discuss their original research among their cohort of awardees and with U.S. and international scientists at all career stages.  These interactions will likely result in improvements of the analysis of existing data, and the generation of ideas for the gathering of additional data and the construction of new hypotheses through disciplinary and interdisciplinary work. The broader impact of this fellowship program is in the exposure of the awardees to excellent international research and in giving them the opportunity to show their research at the international level. Such participation will likely foster international collaboration, keep them engaged, give them the opportunity to interact with preeminent scientists across the many Quaternary science subdisciplines, and foster interdisciplinary collaborations. These awardees can establish long-lasting scientific relationships as has happened in previous editions of the program. A mentoring component is also planned in which senior U.S. scientists help the awardees navigate the Congress and network effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board on International Scientific Organizations, part of the International Networks and Cooperation theme within the NAS Policy and Global Affairs Division, is home to the U.S. National Committee for the International Union for Quaternary Research (USNC/INQUA). The project will provide small travel fellowships to support U.S. graduate student and early career scientist participation in the 20th INQUA Congress to be held in Dublin, Ireland, July 25-31, 2019. USNC/INQUA will competitively award at least 10 travel fellowships at up to $2,000 each for U.S. citizens or permanent resident graduate students and early career scientists working on Quaternary research at U.S. institutions who are presenting papers as first authors at the 20th INQUA Congress and organize mentoring activities for the cohort. The process of selecting the travel award recipients will aim at increasing the active participation of those who have been traditionally underserved and underrepresented in the Earth sciences. This strategy is consistent with the goal of NSF's INCLUDES program. This program exposes awardees to the union and affords them the possibility of getting involved in the scientific and, eventually, governance activities representing the U.S. in INQUA. All of these fruitful interactions will advance U.S. Quaternary science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The U.S. National Committee for the International Union for Quaternary Research of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's Board on International Scientific Organizations offered travel fellowships to U.S. students and early career scientists to present their research at the 20th INQUA International Congress in Dublin, Ireland, in July 2019.  Most of the funding for the USNC/INQUA Travel Fellowship Program was provided by the National Science Foundation (award #1927092), with additional support from the American Quaternary Association.  The U.S. National Committee for the International Union for Quaternary Research competitively awarded travel fellowships to 26 U.S. graduate students and early career scientists. Awardees used these funds to defray part of the costs of attending the Congress. This program, which included a mentoring activity, gave them opportunities to present their research and develop their U.S. and international scientific networks.  The mentoring activity, integral to the program, provided awardees the opportunity to interact with both experienced scientists and other cohort members. For almost all awardees this was the first time they had attended an INQUA International Congress.  Intellectual merit:  All fellowship recipients presented their original research on a wide variety of Quaternary science disciplines, especially on humans and biosphere. When queried during a post-Congress survey, awardees highlighted the quality and innovativeness of the science presented and the relevance of this International Congress as compared to other conferences they had attended. Awardees received high quality feedback from senior scientists and from their peers, and as a result some are refining their projects, considering new questions to guide further research, establishing new collaborations within or outside their fields, or improving their scientific communication skills.  Awardees interacted assiduously with each other: 77% reported establishing relationships with other members of the cohort. Over three-quarters of the awardees connected with current collaborators and 73% met with new or potential collaborators. One awardee specifically praised the very highly rated Travel Award mentoring activity, ?(It) was definitely one of the major highlights of INQUA. I really enjoyed meeting this year?s cohort and discussing potential collaboration opportunities.?  Broader impact:  Fellowship recipients underscored the many benefits of participating in the 20th INQUA International Congress: presenting their original research internationally, gathering important feedback and discussing ideas with both their peers and senior scientists, building their scientific reputations, receiving mentorship guidance, improving their science communication skills, establishing and cultivating their scientific networks, and placing their work in a global scientific context. As a result, they will be able to contribute even more strongly and creatively to Quaternary science research in the U.S.  The awardees were grateful to the National Science Foundation and the American Quaternary Association for funding this program, which was organized by the U.S. National Committee for the International Union for Quaternary Research.
