<AbstractNarration>This conference grant will support the travel of participants to attend the workshop on "Emergent Trends in Complex Function Theory" that will take place at the Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM) in Barcelona, Spain, from October 28 to October 31, 2019. The scientific program is aimed at the interplay between two vast areas of complex analysis: the theory of approximation of functions by solutions of elliptic equations, rational approximation, singular integrals and capacities on the one hand and the theory of spaces of analytic functions and their operators on the other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main goals of the program is to strengthen contacts between researchers working in these two areas of analysis. The interplay between these fields has already led to interesting and important results. For instance, results about harmonic approximation in the plane and spectral synthesis in Hardy-Sobolev spaces (J. Mateu, J. Orobitg, J. Verdera), and the recently discovered intersections of polyanalytic polynomial approximations with the theory of model spaces (A. Baranov, J. Carmona, K. Fedorovskiy, M. Mazalov, P. Paramonov). A significant amount of the funding will be used to support graduate students, early-career researchers, and researchers from underrepresented groups, giving them the opportunity to learn from and discuss these topics with renowned specialists. More information is available at http://www.crm.cat/en/Activities/Curs_2019-2020/Pages/IRP_SAFAIS_WK_ETCFT.aspx.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
