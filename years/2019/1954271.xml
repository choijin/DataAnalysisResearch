<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Establishment Statistics-VI (ICES-VI) will take place  June 15-18, 2020 in New Orleans, Louisiana. A nation's official statistics is directly affected by the quality of the data derived from its business, economic and agricultural surveys. Unlike the situation for social and demographic surveys, there are too few commonly accepted and practiced methodologies for these surveys. The most important reasons for this situation are that establishment surveys face much more difficult design and execution problems and that far less is published on strategies to solve these problems. ICES was created to address this situation by providing a venue for researchers to share their expertise in new areas of establishment statistics and to reflect on state-of-the-art methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Conference on Establishment Surveys (ICES) provides a forum to present current methods being used for surveys of businesses, farms, and institutions; to offer new or improved technologies for solving the unique problems associated with such establishment surveys; and to promote international interchange of ideas by providing an opportunity for researchers around the world to discuss their work and to exchange ideas for interdisciplinary and cross-country research. The survey world has continued to change in the four years since the last conference. There are increased possibilities for electronic communication, reductions in response rates, and greater opportunities to harmonize international data. During this conference leading experts and emerging researchers will have an opportunity to discuss these timely and important topics. The conference website is: https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/ices/2020/index.cfm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
