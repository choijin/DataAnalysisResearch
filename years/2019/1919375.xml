<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of promising United States graduate students and distinguished research faculty in a Graduate Student Consortium.  The full-day event will take place on Sunday, March 17, immediately preceding and in conjunction with the 13th Association of Computing Machinery International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI), to be held in Tempe, Arizona.  Launched in 2007, the annual TEI conference is about creating compelling experiences that bridge bits and atoms through research in human-computer interaction, design, interactive arts, tools and technologies. TEI brings together researchers, designers, engineers, and artists who provide an innovative and cross-disciplinary perspective on physical/digital interaction design and technological innovation. The intimate size of this single-track conference (about 250 participants in recent years) provides a unique forum for exchanging ideas through talks, interactive exhibits, demos, posters, art installations and performances. The theme of this year's conference is Hybrid Materials in light of the fact that over the past few years TEI research has increasingly embraced hybridity, whether through material explorations of composites such as bioelectronic, on-body, or active materials, or theoretical inquiries into socio-technical systems as hybrid assemblies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2019 TEI  Graduate Student Consortium will immediately precede the conference, with follow-up activities during the conference's main technical program. Students will present their early stage research to their peers and the faculty mentors, who will constructively critique the students' work from diverse viewpoints. The students will also get to show their work in posters at the conference, and their short papers will be included in the conference proceedings. The day will end with general discussion, reflection, and career advice. The organizing committee has made a special effort to recruit a diverse set of student participants, particularly seeking persons with disabilities and members of underrepresented groups, or at institutions not historically represented at the TEI conferences.  The GSC will sharpen the research skills of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and designers who will shape human-centered computing as it takes place in physical things and places. Already we are observing the impact of this field in our daily lives, as computing becomes embedded in our phones, our bus stops, and soon even our clothing. Now is a critical moment in the field, as a wave of early exploratory prototypes gives way to disciplined investigations, the development of toolkits, and more rigorous evaluation methods. Mentoring the next generation of TEI researchers is crucial if the field is to retain its vigor and openness in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Held every other year in an international location, TEI conference brings together researchers, designers, engineers, and artists who provide an innovative and cross-disciplinary perspective on physical/digital interaction design and technological innovation. As a core part of the conference, TEI hosts a Graduate Student Consortium (GSC). The GSC is a one-day event held before the main conference, in which promising scholars are selected to participate in a day- long critical discussion and review of their work with senior mentors. This Workshop project received funding for the edition of the GSC held in Tempe, Arizona on March 17-20, 2019.</p> <p>The GSC was consisted of 12 student participants and six research mentors, for a total of 18 participants. The research mentors were asked to review the student papers prior to the start of the consortium meeting. In addition, the student participants were asked to review each other?s papers and presentations prior to the consortium well as taking collaborative notes during each presentation. Each presentation was 15 minutes, followed by a 20 minutes feedback and discussion.</p> <p>During the morning of the GSC meeting, each student briefly presented his or her work in a short formal talk. Mentors lead a brief discussion of the work, including the research question, method of addressing the question, possible results and findings, significance of the work, and pointers to related work and research areas. The mentors also offered critiques of each student's written and oral presentation. These discussions continued through a working lunch.</p> <p>In the afternoon, following the individual presentations and discussions, the mentors lead a broad discussion that relates the presentations to one another and to the other work in the field. The mentors highlighted common themes that emerged across the individual student works, and noted differences and similarities in research methods both across individual research projects as well as across diverse intellectual threads within the tangible interaction field as a whole. In the late afternoon session, the mentors lead a discussion on pursuing a career in this interdisciplinary field and what the opportunities are from different disciplinary perspectives (e.g. arts and design vs. technology, academia vs. industry, etc.).</p> <p>The Graduate Student Consortium concluded with a working dinner for all participants to discuss reflections on the event during the day and provide feedback for future consortiums. Students, mentors and organizers all offered their reflections. There also were discussion and advice for students on how to gain maximum benefit from attending the conference that followed the GSC. Mentors shared their experience of research practice, networking, job interviews, hiring and evaluations.</p> <p>Student papers (4 pages in ACM SIGCHI Papers and Notes format) appeared in the TEI Proceedings and they are indexed in the ACM Digital Library.</p> <p>Students were also invited to present their work at the main conference during the Poster Session, giving their work wider visibility in the TEI community. This also afforded the opportunity for students to talk one-on-one with peers and other more senior researchers, in addition to the focused mentoring of the Graduate Student Consortium itself.</p> <p>Intellectual Merit:</p> <p>Students in GSC gained experience and skills in communicating their own work and critiquing the work of peers. Through this process, along with the feedback provided by senior mentors, graduate students were empowered with new research insights and possible future directions, knowledge of prior work and the field in general, as well as gaining awareness of potentially useful methods that draw from different disciplines. GSC thus has lasting impacts for the graduate student attendees. Attending GSC also gave graduate students the opportunity to build professional and social connections that transcend the conference event and gain awareness of potential career paths in both academia and industry.</p> <p>Broader Impacts:</p> <p>GSC contributed to the professional development of a more knowledgeable, capable, and productive workforce in the U.S. It guided early stage research and creative explorations to maximize the research potential for advancing knowledge and practice in the field of tangible, embedded and embodied interaction. GSC actively recruited participation from graduate students from under-represented groups and at institutions not historically represented at the conference. Student submissions appear in the ACM TEI 19 Proceedings and are indexed in the ACM Digital Library. Students were also invited to present their work at the main conference during the Poster Session, giving their work wider visibility in the community. The event afforded the opportunity for students to talk one-on-one with peers and other senior researchers, in addition to the focused mentoring of the GSC itself. Additionally, GSC helped to build an informal social network among the next generation of researchers in this field.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/26/2020<br>      Modified by:
