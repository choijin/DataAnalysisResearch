<AbstractNarration>Autonomous systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles, medical devices and self-driving cars are challenging to design because of the inherent software complexity, as well as uncertainty in their operating environment.  Unfortunately, many of these autonomous systems are also safety-critical; there are real tragic implications on human life and property when these systems malfunction.  Monitoring the safety of such autonomous cyber-physical system while they are operating has long been viewed as scalable solution to ensure safety of these systems. Such safety properties can often be written using logical formalisms such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL).  The project develops a modular framework called Premonition for monitoring temporal-logic properties of autonomous cyber-physical systems.  The following abilities of Premonition framework highlight its novelty: (1) Predictive monitoring to forecast the failure of a safety property before a violation actually occurs; (2) Resource-awareness for monitoring that is performed with low memory and sensing overhead; and finally, 3) Probabilistic guarantees for providing quantifiable bounds on the accuracy of the predictions made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Premonition framework is highly interdisciplinary: it combines statistical methods for predicting future values of time-series data with techniques from formal methods.  The key site for innovation is in new techniques for obtaining probabilistic guarantees on whether a safety property will be violated by the system in the future. Such guarantees are obtained for different kinds of system models.  For data-driven system models, Premonition weaves prior work on forecasting for stochastic processes with monitoring algorithms for STL. For dynamical system models, the framework introduces new algorithms to monitor STL properties on over-approximations of future reachable states of the system.  For system models with explicit uncertainty models, the framework focuses on resource-aware predictive monitoring. For systems with unobservable states, it provides new algorithms for latent- xstate predictive monitoring, i.e. algorithms that give probabilistic guarantees on whether the hidden system states violate a given property in the future, by monitoring the observable states of the system.  Probabilistic guarantees are useful for designing enforcement and warning mechanisms to provide safety assurance for systems. This project's impacts are in making dynamic safety-assurance cases for autonomous systems such as automated insulin-delivery systems, unmanned aerial vehicles and self-driving cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
