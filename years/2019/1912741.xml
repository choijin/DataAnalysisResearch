<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to introduce a novel and renewably resource-derived polymer, Polyacrylated Glycerol (PAG), to the asphalt road maintenance industry.  The project will demonstrate the performance and efficiency of PAG to improve the performance and life expectancy of common asphalt maintenance applications.  If successful, this project will create a pathway to new demand for glycerol, a significant byproduct of the bio-diesel industry.  Furthermore, it will create the potential to replace up to 50,000 tons per year of petroleum-derived polymers with a green product having significant renewable content. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will explore the potential for PAG elastomers to perform as adhesion promoters, sealants, primers, and asphalt additives in asphalt roadway maintenance applications.  A series of laboratory produced PAG polymers with variations in molecular weight, average acrylic functionality, and residual acrylic acid comonomer content will be explored using  a series of laboratory-based tests designed to characterize performance of asphalt primers, seal coats, tack coats, micro surfacing, and chip seals modified with the PAG polymers.  In addition, this Phase 1 project will explore the potential to scale-up the manufacturing of the PAG polymer from a laboratory scale to pilot scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Objective:  The objective is an evaluation of novel bio-polymers as additives in asphalt maintenance applications to improve performance.  Most asphalt maintenance products involve asphalt emulsions--solutions formed from the stabilization of asphalt droplets using a surfactant in water.  We hypothesized that properly designed polymers can improve adhesion of asphalt to aggregate surfaces, thereby increasing performance and reducing life cycle costs associated with asphalt maintenance products, including seal coats, tack coats, micro surfacing, and chip seals.  Background Statement:  After receiving notice of its phase 1 award, Adventus Material Strategies lost access to the licensed technology for the Polyacrylated Glycerol (PAG) polymer system.  This polymer was synthesized using a proprietary Radical Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer (RAFT) polymerization process patented by Iowa State University Research Foundation (ISURF).1  In consultation with the program director and ISURF, the objective was shifted to evaluate a series of novel bio-polymers based on polyacrylated, epoxidized, high oleic soybean oil (PAEHOSO).2  PAEHOSO technology was not encumbered with pre-existing license agreements, enabling Adventus to secure a license.  Phase 1:  Polymer Synthesis:  This phase involved synthesis of PAEHOSO bio-polymers by the team at Iowa State University, led by Professor Cochran.  The work was accomplished under a sub-award agreement and involved copolymerizing water-insoluble PAEHOSO with comonomers to render the polymer water dispersible.  Similar to the PAG polymer, acrylic acid (AA) was used to drive water dispersibility.  The polymers comprised various levels of AA , ranging from 30% to 70% AA, by mass, with the balance PAEHOSO.  Table 1 summarizes the polymer variants provided for evaluation. Subsequently, a second comonomer was used in an attempt to improve water dispersibility while raising the renewable component (PAEHOSO) in the polymer.  For this effort, a macromonomer based on polyethylene glycol monoacrylate (PEGMA) was used.  All bio-polymers evaluated were elastomers, with glass transition temperatures ranging from -41.85C for the 70/30 AA/PAEHOSO copolymer to -48.71C for the 50/50 PEGMA/PAEHOSO variant, measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry.  For initial evaluations, 1 Liter samples of polymer dispersions were evaluated.  We determined the 30/70 and 50/50 PAA/PAEHOSO polymers were unstable dispersions in water,  readily agglomerating into solid elastomeric masses.  We attempted to redisperse these polymers using high shear milling, in the absence and presence of surfactants, and following adjustment of the pH to 10.0-12.0 to fully deprotonate the acrylic acid comonomer.  None of these efforts resulted in a stably dispersed polymer amenable to further evaluation.  The 70/30 PAA/PAEHOSO polymer became the focus for the next phase.
