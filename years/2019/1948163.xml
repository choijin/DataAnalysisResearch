<AbstractNarration>Communication amongst plants and animals often occurs through molecules that readily evaporate at normal temperatures, called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Some VOCs that are produced in the ocean and then enter the atmosphere as gases have been seen to play an important role in climate. Since marine microbes both produce and consume these compounds they affect the concentration of VOCs in the surface ocean. The investigators found that as much as 20% of the carbon resulting from photosynthesis leaked out of microscopic plants in the form of VOCs. These molecules were then used by bacteria as a source of carbon and energy. This suggests that VOCs may play a more important role in the flow of carbon in the marine environment than previously thought. This project examines how microscopic plants and bacteria produce and consume different VOCs.  It supports professional development training workshops for Oregon high school teachers from rural areas in OSU’s Science &amp; Math Investigative Learning Experiences (SMILE) program. SMILE’s mission is to close the achievement gap for underserved students by increasing their STEM-content knowledge, preparing them to succeed in higher education, and inspiring them to pursue STEM careers. This project also contributes to three workshops per year, training teachers and engaging students with hands-on learning activities on the topic of Carbon Cycling by Marine Microorganisms such as “Clouds in a Bottle”. One graduate student, one post-doctoral scholar, and at least six undergraduate researchers are being trained by participating in research activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field observations suggest that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by phytoplankton are either rapidly consumed by bacterioplankton in the surface ocean or emitted into the atmosphere. VOCs are an understudied path for carbon transfer in microbial food webs throughout sunlit marine ecosystems because these compounds require specialized detection methods. Using a new system to study VOCs in suspensions of live plankton cells, 20% of photosynthetic carbon fixation was seen to be transferred as VOCs from a diatom to SAR11 bacterioplankton in co-cultures. Many of these transferred VOC compounds were not known to be growth substrates for bacterioplankton. Both the magnitude and complexity of the observed VOC transfer were surprising. This project extends these observations to a larger set of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton through controlled studies of cultures, co-cultures, and mesocosms. VOC are detected via proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry and isotopic labeling is used to measure the impact of VOC exchange on rates of photosynthesis and bacterial production. VOC production by phytoplankton is measured in response to nutrient-driven variation in growth rates, and over day-night cycles to discern the relationship of VOC production to photosynthetic metabolism and other cellular processes. These experiments enable  a better understanding of field observations, in which bacterial consumption of VOCs can appear to significantly outpace production, while temporal variability in VOC production across daily to seasonal scales can cause VOCs to accumulate transiently to pM-nM concentrations in the surface ocean. This project contributes to close the significant gap in knowledge about the range and quantity of VOCs produced by phytoplankton, and about the roles played by these compounds in phytoplankton metabolism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
