<AbstractNarration>Science provides an extraordinarily powerful tool for investigating nature, and nature supplies an&lt;br/&gt;endless abundance of research topics that are ripe for scientists to investigate. Faced with such&lt;br/&gt;abundance, scientists must regularly choose where to place their efforts: which questions to pursue and&lt;br/&gt;which to leave for another day, which results to prepare for publication and which to set aside, and so&lt;br/&gt;on. When making these decisions, researchers face incentives that scientific funders and scientific&lt;br/&gt;journals create through the peer‐review processes that funders and journals use to ensure quality and&lt;br/&gt;rigor in the science they support and publish. Yet we understand very little about how the incentives&lt;br/&gt;created by peer‐review in scientific funding and publication shape the scientific activity of individual&lt;br/&gt;investigators, and how those decisions scale up to impact the aggregate knowledge that science creates.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we will develop new mathematical theory to understand how incentives created by&lt;br/&gt;scientific funders and journals affect individual scientific activity and the subsequent production of&lt;br/&gt;scientific knowledge. This theory will provide a foundation for evaluating proposed refinements of&lt;br/&gt;funding or publication practices, and for understanding whether these changes will nudge the scientific&lt;br/&gt;enterprise towards a more reliable and expansive understanding of the natural world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will focus on two questions. First, how do journals' publication decisions shape the ability of their&lt;br/&gt;readership to learn from the scientific literature? Second, how do the incentives created by funding and&lt;br/&gt;publication structures motivate scientists to work on certain projects and shy away from others? For&lt;br/&gt;each question, we will ask how peer‐review filters function differently for basic versus applied research.&lt;br/&gt;We will investigate these questions by building and analyzing mathematical models that incorporate&lt;br/&gt;elements of information theory, economics, forecasting assessment, and statistics. In the long run, this&lt;br/&gt;work will deepen our understanding of science as a social process by revealing how scientific institutions&lt;br/&gt;generate incentives that shape the direction of scientific inquiry. More immediately, it will provide a&lt;br/&gt;theoretical framework to explore how possible changes to the peer‐review process such as registered&lt;br/&gt;reports or pre‐print servers may change scientists' collective process of learning and discovery. Finally,&lt;br/&gt;we will develop an online module to help readers become savvier consumers of the scientific literature,&lt;br/&gt;and we will share our findings with the editorial board of a leading biological journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
