<AbstractNarration>Out-of-school time (OST) programs today are grounded in the positive youth development framework. According to the National Research Council, high-quality OST programs apply the youth development framework to STEM by providing young people with rich, engaging learning experiences that couple STEM concepts with hands-on activities. These experiences apply STEM to real-world social contexts, foster youth voice and choice, build relationships with adults and peers, and support learning, thinking, interest, and identity development. Presently, there is emphasis for OST programs to focus on the development of social and emotional skills that impact all learning and performance. Social emotional skills, like perseverance, relationship building, problem-solving, and self-awareness, are also referred to as 21st-century skills, workforce skills, life skills, essential skills, or soft skills. For this conference, the term social-emotional development (SED), incorporating the above terms and social-emotional learning, will be used. There is a potentially deep and effective connection between SED and STEM, prioritizing skills that are mutually important to both fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this virtual conference, The PEAR Institute will convene practitioners and researchers who can imagine the power of an integrated vision of STEM and SED. An important aim of this conference is to catalyze OST programs toward the intentional and explicit integration of STEM and SED in a high-quality manner. Activities by which this will happen include: (1) mapping the practice landscape of STEM-SED integration in OST to understand the interest in, capacity of, and demand for such programming; (2) documenting exemplars that illustrate explicit and intentional program integration; (3) exploring existing and potential researcher-practitioner partnerships to understand methods, data, and data systems used to capture efficacy and effectiveness of integrated STEM-SED programming; and, (4) drafting a research agenda that focuses on the quality of implementation and impact of integrated STEM-SED programming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target audience for this conference consists of professionals. Participants will represent the diversity of STEM and SED communities, including representatives of national youth-serving organizations (e.g., executives, research directors, practitioners), State Afterschool Networks (e.g., network leads, summer and afterschool practitioners, contributors to educational policy), and STEM learning ecosystems (e.g., community leads, OST practitioners, business leaders, college and university researchers). The conference format includes one short introductory session to set the stage and two longer working sessions. With input from the panelists and working group leaders, the team will produce a narrated slideshow focused on the mapping of the connections between STEM and SED to innovate assessment and data systems for research and practice. In addition to the narrated slideshow, the project team will produce two conference briefs for the field (i.e., one to two-page descriptions of findings), and an informal webinar regarding the conference outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This three-session conference, hosted in spring 2020, was designed to: clarify the meaning of integrated STEM+SED in OST; increase collaboration of leaders, practitioners, and researchers to make STEM+SED a strong focus of OST research and practice; search for observable best practices for STEM+SED to highlight for the field; explore measures of STEM+SED quality and outcomes; and initiate discussions on how to create an impactful research agenda for STEM+SED. Rather than seeking consensus, this conference sought to unearth questions and generate new ideas to lay a foundation for future research and practice; a way to inform the field about high-quality research and practice to promote collaboration in STEM and SED. Although the team had planned a virtual conference before before COVID-19, the convening took place during the height of the pandemic and protests, which increased the intensity of discussions around social, emotional, and academic development. The discussion themes were: connections between the fields of STEM and SED, how the turbulent national context has elevated the urgency of STEM+SED in all educational settings, and how STEM+SED can support social justice and equity, among other emerging themes. One clear result is that foundational research is needed to create a common framework with clearly defined terminology to build coherence, capacity, and collaboration to support meaningful integration of STEM+SED.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">The project outcomes are:</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span></p> <ol> <li> <div style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Integrated vision of STEM and SED in OST research/practice</span>: We received input from 49 participants (researchers and practitioners from the fields of STEM and SED).

The project outcomes are:      Integrated vision of STEM and SED in OST research/practice: We received input from 49 participants (researchers and practitioners from the fields of STEM and SED). The results, including the need for a common framework and language, formed the basis of a recent proposal to the NSF entitled "A Systematic Review of STEM Learning and Social-Emotional Development (SED) in Out of School Time."   Collaborations to make STEM+SED a strong focus of OST research/practice: During the conference, we designed breakout groups to include a mix of researchers and practitioners to encourage conversations, new ideas and partnerships.

Explore tools to measure STEM+SED and undersand quality and outcomes in OST: We designed a survey that obtained a list of assessments currently in use to assess STEM, SED, or STEM+SED in OST programs.    Discuss an impactful research agenda for STEM+SED: To generate ideas for future research in service to practice, we engaged participants in discussions about research to launch a new field of STEM+SED. Participants brainstormed in small groups  and reported back to the group. The conference, in reaction to the social and public health conditions, included more discussion than expected on the relationships between STEM and SED in the context of trauma and social injustices. These conversations informed the conceptualization of a new field of inquiry&mdash;one that centers diversity, equity, and inclusion in the STEM+SED equation.    We aggregated data obtained from conference sessions, two participant questionnaires, and one conference evaluation survey, from which we made the following discoveries:  The relationships between STEM+SED were primarily viewed as reciprocal and mutually enhancing, meaning SED supports productive STEM learning and, conversely, productive STEM learning supports SED.  The national context&mdash;inclusive of a global pandemic and protests&mdash;increased the intensity and urgency around efforts to integrate social, emotional, and academic development, especially to support social justice and equity work.  A common framework, especially one that is evidence-based and centers diversity, equity, and inclusion, is needed to support meaningful integration of STEM+SED in OST.  A common understanding of STEM+SED will build field coherence, increase measurement precision, support educator capacity, and clarify within-/cross-sector communications. High-quality, scalable, and sustainable implementation of STEM+SED will require interdisciplinary teams at both the individual and system levels.
