<AbstractNarration>Innovative research on the complex interaction of socio-economic and global environmental trends on biodiversity and ecosystem services is needed to help develop more informative scenarios for addressing environmental and human development challenges. To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research project, which is an international coalition between US scientists and five European nations, seeks to quantify the magnitude, spatial extent and timing of aerial migrations (birds and insects), and their functional relations to environmental and socio-economic variables. Migratory bird and insect populations involve thousands of tons of animal biomass that move through the air within and across continents at various times of the year. Migratory flying animals play significant roles in shaping ecosystems through a variety of transport and trophic effects that also represent services and disservices to human infrastructure, agriculture, and welfare. This project reveals the role these organisms have in shaping the diversity of ecological communities, as well as providing information to allow the better utilization of their related ecosystems services and reducing their negative impacts. This requires the tracking and quantification of these species and their movements across continents, i.e. over large spatial and temporal scales. This study investigates past changes in important drivers of change such as climate; the expansion of urban areas; deployment of energy infrastructure, like wind farms; and changes in land use/agriculture. Data and results will be modeled to develop projections for future changes under environmental and human-induces scenarios. Current and archived radar data of biomasses of aerial migrants will be used. Drivers resulting in changes in patterns of migrations and local ecosystem function will be used to develop behavior-based models for generating predictions under future changes. The broader impacts of this work include international collaboration with scientists from five other countries (UK, Belgium, The Netherlands, Finland, and Switzerland), the generation of data to improve policy and resource management decisions, and information to help reduce airplane damage from bird strikes. Other impacts include training a postdoctoral scholar in interdisciplinary, international, team-oriented, collaborative research and the creation of new software that allows others to process data on aerial migrations in terms of variables such as weather, climate, land use, wind, and light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on "Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, this major international effort between the US and five European countries will addresses challenging and pressing biodiversity issues related to aerial migratory species (birds and insects) across scales from local to continental. For the project, each country will fund its own scientists and their part of the overall project. The interdisciplinary team consists of ecologists, meteorologists, and computer scientists who will use the existing infrastructure of continental weather (and other) radars to generate a standardized large-scale, long-term monitoring of migratory aerial biomass flows, as well as develop sustainable data and analytical infrastructure and workflows that that can be used by other present and future stakeholders. Motivation for this study comes from the fact that aerial migratory animals are an integral component of biodiversity and have been declining at an alarming rate. Identifying their response to climatic and land-use changes, light pollution and wind energy development is fundamental for efficient conservation and mitigation of human-wildlife conflicts. Thus, this research links various stakeholders from scientists to meteorologists to conservation practitioners and policy makers and to the wind energy sector and aviation safety. Goas are to develop (a) standard long-term and large-scale monitoring of aerial migrations; (b) information to feed policies associated with the proliferation of artificial light; (c) establish aerial migratory species death-mitigation procedures for wind energy installations and aircraft; and (d) policies for conservation of crucial (aerial) habitat, migratory locations, and major migration time-periods that are essential for sustaining migratory populations. Research will entail quantifying the magnitude, spatial extent, and timing of aerial migrations; understanding their (functional) relations with environmental and socio-economic variables; and projecting the consequences of future changes in these variables on migratory populations. This will be achieved by retrieving biological information from weather radar networks using methods that rely on machine learning and statistical analyses to quantify biomass flows of aerial migrants in Europe and North America. It will also estimate the role of migrants in ecosystem functioning and how aerial migratory biomass flows is impacted by external human induced variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
