<AbstractNarration>The 49th John H. Barrett Memorial Lectures will be held on May 28-30, 2019 at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  The year's Lectures are entitled "Recent Advancements in Number Theory" and will feature a number of hour long plenary talks by high profile mathematicians, as well as shorter talks given by mostly early career researchers.  These talks will cover a range of topics in number theory and arithmetic geometry.  For more information, please visit the conference website at: http://www.math.utk.edu/barrett/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Barrett Lectures began in 1970 as a tribute to Dr. John H. Barrett, a distinguished mathematician and influential Mathematics Department Head at the University of Tennessee.  Over the years, the Lectures have covered a large number of mathematical topics (which this year topics coming from number theory and arithmetic geometry), and have developed a rich history of excellence.  The Lectures are aimed to bring together researchers from various career stages in order to stimulate academic discussions and collaborations as well as to disseminate new topics and ideas among the community.  Attendees, especially graduate students and other early career researchers, will be exposed to the research of high profile mathematicians, that can inspire, motivate, and give new directions to their own research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The lectures welcomed 62 registered participants, including 31 graduate students, 1 undergraduate student and 6 post-docs/lecturers.   There were 18 lectures: 8 one hour long plenary lectures given by prominent and more senior researchers, as well as 10 half an hour lectures given by younger but promising speakers.   The lectures covered a broad range of topics in number theory, including algebraic K-theory, rational points on algebraic varieties, Iwasawa theory, and cryptography among others, mostly in arithmetic geometry.   The lectures hosted coffee breaks, all lunches, and a banquet, where participants had the opportunity to discuss the talks and their own work.   The lectures were attended by a diverse group of participants, half of which were students, while around 75% were researchers in the early stages of their careers (student, post-doc or equivalent, and assistant professors).  Half of the plenary speakers were women, as were four out of the other ten invited speakers. Among all fifty six participants  who provided their gender, ethnicity and citizenship status during registration, twenty identified themselves as women, six as hispanic/latino, and nineteen as not US citizens nor permanent residents.
