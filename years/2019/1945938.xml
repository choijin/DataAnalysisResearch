<AbstractNarration>The open science movement is gaining momentum across the academic landscape. Since the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) published the Open Science by Design: Realizing a Vision for 21st Century Research report in 2018, many institutions, organizations, and faculty have begun assessing their current practices and infrastructure to support a more open research ecosystem. To fully realize the vision for open science and scholarship, stakeholders need to adopt key infrastructure, standards, and practices necessary to facilitate responsible data practices. Drawing inspiration from sources such as the May 2019 NSF Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) the organizers propose an expert convening to discuss persistent identifiers (PIDs) for datasets and creating machine readable data management plans (DMPs).  The conference is organized by California Digital Library (CDL) and Association of Research Libraries (ARL), in partnership with the Association of American Universities (AAU) and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will engage approximately 40 experts in a multi-day workshop in Washington DC winter of 2019 with the goal to identify and determine:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What barriers remain to implementing the widely recognized good practices in the NSF DCL&lt;br/&gt;2. What kinds of model workflows might address those barriers, while minimizing faculty burden&lt;br/&gt;3. What implementation of the NSF DCL means for institutional data governance (e.g. sharing DMPs across campus units, between institutions, and publicly)&lt;br/&gt;4. Findings to bring back to policymakers, funding agencies, and other similar institutions&lt;br/&gt;5. Recommendations of effective practices for grants offices, including guidance to their researchers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In December 2019, the library community, represented by the Association of Research Libraries and the California Digital Library, in partnership with the Association of American Universities and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities convened a small conference to discuss the current state of Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) for data sets, and machine-readable Data Management Plans (DMPs).  The goal of the Implementing Effective Data Practices conference was to frame the suggested best practices in NSFâ€™s May 2019 Dear Colleague Letter within the larger stated commitment by AAU and APLU institutions to expand public access to research data and to advance open science and scholarship within the framework of the NASEM Open Science by Design report. Furthermore, the goal was to draft, with multi-stakeholder input, guidelines for research institutions to implement PIDs and machine-readable DMPs. Approximately 40 experts came together with the aim to identify and determine:    What barriers remain to implement the widely recognized good practices in the NSF DCL?   What kinds of model workflows might address those barriers, while minimizing faculty burden?   What does the implementation of the NSF DCL mean for institutional data governance (e.g., sharing DMPs across campus units, between institutions, and publicly)?   Which findings should be brought back to policymakers (specifically NSF), funding agencies, and institutions so they can engage in a discussion about the next steps?   What are the recommendations for effective practices for grants offices, including guidance to their researchers?           The reulting recommendations and considerations were compiled into a report and circulated widely on social media for community review. The project team also held six consultative virtual focus groups with key stakeholders who were either invited to or participated in the conference.
