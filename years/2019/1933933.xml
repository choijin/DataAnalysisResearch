<AbstractNarration>As computing has become integral to the practice of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), the STEM+Computing program seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12). One significant challenge is designing professional learning experiences around CS/CT integration that fit within the landscape of teacher credentialing and that can be accessed and recognized at scale within and across schools and districts. This project develops a scalable model for supporting teachers' capacity to design, implement, and iterate integrated computational thinking lessons while simultaneously providing mechanisms that support teachers' access to an integrated CT professional learning experience. The proposed professional learning experiences will involve a blended learning model of (1) online platforms to build foundational CT knowledge, (2) face-to-face engagement in curricular co-design, (3) expert supports for integrated CT lesson development, and (4) evidence-based micro-credentials on integrating various specific CT practices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project supports teachers' capacity to integrate CT into the disciplines of Social Studies, English Language Arts, and Art. The project's focus on CT integration into these subject areas fits well with the STEM+C program's aims given that computational thinking skills are required for many subject areas and CT applications cross many traditional disciplinary boundaries.  The research focuses on two key areas: questions of teacher learning within the micro-credential program; and issues of systems implementation of the micro-credential program. Its two related research questions are, (1) What professional development mechanisms support teachers to engage in productive sense-making and conceptual understanding around computational thinking in ways the result in successful CT integration within Social Studies, English Language Arts, and Art Education disciplines? and (2) How can alternative teacher certifications in the form of micro-credentials support access to professional learning experiences focused on CT integration into existing disciplines, and, once received, support recognition of teacher expertise around CT within their schools and districts? Data sources include video of curricular design activities, vignettes, interviews and artifacts including integrated CT lessons and pedagogical reflections. Drawing on design-based research methods, the project aims to contribute to the literature around teacher professional learning and how teacher learning opportunities are situated within broader school-level and classroom-level systems that influence their implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
