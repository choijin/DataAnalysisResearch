<AbstractNarration>This conference award provides partial support for US-based participants to the Fifth Conference on Computational and Mathematical Population Dynamics, to be held in Ft. Lauderdale, FL during May 19 - May 24, 2019. Mathematical population dynamics was historically the first subfield of Mathematical Biology to be developed. It continues to grow and expand its influence of understanding nature on multiple scales, from molecules to ecosystems. Mathematical population dynamics is a driving force of innovation with applications in many disciplines: immunology, epidemiology, ecology, and a number of medical sciences (e.g. cancer, microbiology, and others). This international conference will bring together senior, mid-career, and junior researchers for a week of intense exchange of ideas and networking. The conference will contribute to the training of young researchers in presentation and communication skills, as well as to initiate new collaborations and state-of-the art new research directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fifth Conference on Computational and Mathematical Population Dynamics (CMPD5) is the fifth joint meeting of the Conference on Mathematical Population Dynamics and the Conference on Deterministic and Stochastic Models for Biological Interactions, with a history of more than 30 years worth of international meetings. The goal of this international conference is to bring together leading researchers to communicate about their current work on computational and mathematical population dynamics. As the first conference of this sequence to be organized in the United States, the conference will provide a unique opportunity for U.S.- based graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty to interact with leading researchers in the area of mathematical and computational population dynamics. The funding provided by NSF will be used to support US-based participants, including minorities and women, and will provide young scientists and under-represented groups exposure to current research topics and techniques in the interdisciplinary area of computational and mathematical population dynamics. The work at the conference will focus in two main directions: developing the mathematical techniques, including some novel techniques of machine learning, capable of tackling big data problems, and developing the applications of the new and existing techniques to address pressing societal issues, such as health problems, pollution, invasion of species and control, emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases, and surging of existing diseases. More information about this conference can be found at http://www.math.fau.edu/cmpd5/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
