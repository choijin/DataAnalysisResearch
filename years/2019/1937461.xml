<AbstractNarration>This project funds U.S. student participation at the 12th annual IEEE North American School for Information Theory (NASIT). Information Theory studies the transmission, processing, and use of information in many contexts; it draws from and contributes to a large number of disciplines in the engineering, computer, and mathematical sciences. The types of research topics presented by students at this summer school and the tutorial areas discussed by lecturers, will span foundational theory, algorithmic design, and implementation in practice. This travel award can help the participating students get a fuller understanding of the various facets of information theory, helping build out their professional networks and enrich their research experience overall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NASIT is an annual educational event initiated in 2008 by the IEEE Information Theory Society, and regularly involves between 60 to 100 graduate student participants from across North America. The format consists of several half-day tutorials delivered by high-profile researchers from within and adjacent to the information theory community. Students are also given an opportunity to present posters of their ongoing research and receive feedback from each other as well as tutorial speakers and faculty organizers. Approximately 60 students will receive partial travel support to cover their costs of attending this event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
