<AbstractNarration>Type-safe programming languages report errors when a program applies operations to data of the wrong type---e.g., a list-length operation expects a list, not a number---and they come in two flavors: dynamically typed (or untyped) languages, which catch such type errors at run time, and statically typed languages, which catch type errors at compile time before the program is ever run.  Dynamically typed languages are well suited for rapid prototyping of software, while static typing becomes important as software systems grow since it offers improved maintainability, code documentation, early error detection, and support for compilation to faster code.  Gradually typed languages bring together these benefits, allowing dynamically typed and statically typed code---and more generally, less precisely and more precisely typed code---to coexist and interoperate, thus allowing programmers to slowly evolve parts of their code base from less precisely typed to more precisely typed.  To ensure safe interoperability, gradual languages insert runtime checks when data with a less precise type is cast to a more precise type. Gradual typing has seen high adoption in industry, in languages like TypeScript, Hack, Flow, and C#.  Unfortunately, current gradually typed languages fall short in three ways. First, while normal static typing provides reasoning principles that enable safe program transformations and optimizations, naive gradual systems often do not. Second, gradual languages rarely guarantee graduality, a reasoning principle helpful to programmers, which says that making types more precise in a program merely adds in checks and the program otherwise behaves as before. Third, time and space efficiency of the runtime casts inserted by gradual languages remains a concern.  This project addresses all three of these issues.  The project's novelties include: (1) a new approach to the design of gradual languages by first codifying the desired reasoning principles for the language using a program logic called Gradual Type Theory (GTT), and from that deriving the behavior of runtime casts; (2) compiling to a non-gradual compiler intermediate representation (IR) in a way that preserves these principles; and (3) the ability to use GTT to reason about the correctness of optimizations and efficient implementation of casts. The project has the potential for significant impact on industrial software development since gradually typed languages provide a migration path from existing dynamically typed codebases to more maintainable statically typed code, and from traditional static types to more precise types, providing a mechanism for increased adoption of advanced type features.  The project will also have impact by providing infrastructure for future language designs and investigations into improving the performance of gradual typing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team will apply the GTT approach to investigate gradual typing for polymorphism with data abstraction (parametricity), algebraic effects and handlers, and refinement/dependent types.  For each, the team will develop cast calculi and program logics expressing better equational reasoning principles than previous proposals, with certified elaboration to a compiler intermediate language based on Call-By-Push-Value (CBPV) while preserving these properties, and design convenient surface languages that elaborate into them.  The GTT program logics will be used for program verification, proving the correctness of program optimizations and refactorings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
