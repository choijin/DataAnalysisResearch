<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is improving corrosion monitoring through development of a microbial corrosion monitor.  There are over 2.6 million miles of pipeline in the United States and microbial corrosion leads to substantial costs for the pipeline operators.  Currently, operators are alerted to a breakdown of product and begin corrosion testing using a combination of microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) kits, corrosion coupons, and laboratory testing. Results from corrosion testing can take weeks, during which time the microbial community can change and the corrosion mitigation strategy will be unsuccessful.  Development of a probe capable of immediately determining when microbial growth will cause corrosion could have a significant impact on corrosion management.  Such a probe could be of interest for consumers in oil and gas, water treatment, food production, and environmental monitoring.  There is already great demand in the corrosion monitoring industry for probes and monitors to access abiotic corrosion damage.  The next generation of corrosion monitors could very well be defined by the ability to incorporate real-time monitoring for microbial growth and its impact on corrosion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on an innovative probe that is able to predict when microbial growth will lead to microbially influenced corrosion (MIC), before the onset of corrosion.  The MIC instrument developed here is comprised of a probe that can monitor type and severity of corrosion caused solely by microbial growth.  This is unique to our probe, as all other available probes cannot distinguish between abiotic and biotic corrosion.  The probe uses a combination of split-chamber/zero-resistance ammetry (ZRA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The data obtained by the probe is analyzed with a new algorithm that gives real-time corrosion rate data for biotic corrosion, determines the type of corrosion, and rates the biotic corrosion from low to severe.  The instrument can be used to quickly screen for the corrosion-causing ability of different organisms that are isolated from a sample.  This will allow operators to quickly determine which types of organisms are causing corrosion and allow them to deploy the proper biocide.  Immediate detection of MIC will allow for safer pipeline operation, decrease downtime, and decrease the overall cost of pipeline operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The initial target audience will be corrosion consultants as they are continuously looking for new corrosion detection technology that can help them better manage the assets and they would be early adopters as well as influencers of new technology  Through the NSF I-Corps program, the MIC Monitor team conducted 205 interviews with asset integrity managers and corrosion engineers from companies in all areas of the oil and gas industry (BP, Marathon, Dominion, TransCanada, Kinder Morgan and Shell, etc.); corrosion specialists from corrosion monitoring manufacturing companies (3M, BTI, Sani Labs, Sentry, Honeywell, Metal samples, etc.); scientists from third-party laboratory testing companies; and third-party corrosion consultants (DNV-GL, Mears, Aegion, etc.). Our interviews revealed that 98% of customers are currently using multiple test kits (e.g. coupon tests, bug bottle tests) to make an educated guess about the potential risk associated with microbial contamination. 184 of our interviewees have expressed interest in new technology that can tell them when microbial growth is causing corrosion in order to develop effective mitigation strategies.  Our client interviews validated the key assumptions that underlie our proposed business model. Clients confirmed that the current monitoring methods do not tell the user whether the presence of microbes is causing corrosion. Our interviews also revealed that compliance with the regulatory bodies is essential.   The initial target market for commercialization is corrosion engineers and asset integrity managers for upstream and midstream oil and gas pipelines and third-party companies, such as specialty chemical, corrosion monitoring, and engineering services firms that work with the petroleum industry companies who are interested in determining the type of corrosion occurring in their assets to help them develop a more timely and accurate mitigation strategy. MIC Monitor will sell these corrosion engineers and asset integrity managers test kits that can differentiate when microbial growth is leading to corrosion and help them avoid leaks and spills, leading to fines and stricter regulations.    Worldwide, annual corrosion monitoring and mitigation costs in the oil and gas industry are estimated to be $1.37B, which is our total available market. In the U.S., our served available market, there are 9,000 oil and gas companies that spend a total of $819M on their corrosion monitoring/mitigation programs each year. Our target market is the 1,944 upstream/midstream oil and gas companies, where MIC is predominantly seen. At upstream/midstream companies, there are around 1,700 Asset Integrity Managers who spend $320M on their corrosion monitoring/mitigation programs annually. More than 80% of the asset integrity managers we interviewed at companies in our target market said a technology that differentiates between MIC and abiotic corrosion was a ?must have.?
