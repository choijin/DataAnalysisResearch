<AbstractNarration>This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU). NEIU is a Hispanic Serving Institution with 42% of the undergraduate population identifying as Hispanics.  Over the six-year duration of this project, 45 community college transfer students, who are pursuing bachelor’s degrees in CS, will receive scholarships. The project personnel will recruit transfer students from Wilbur Wright, Harry Truman and Oakton Community Colleges.  These students will receive two-year scholarships.  The project personnel will enhance the CS curriculum by adding the use of industry standard tools and methodologies into the teaching of entry level courses.  Of significance is the introduction of mentors from faculty, alumni, and industry partners that will support the scholars as they advance in their degree and prepare them during their transition into the workforce, or a graduate program, upon completion.  Due to the high representation of minority students among CS majors at NEIU, this project has the potential to broaden participation in CS careers and to learn how a curriculum aligned with industry practices and mentoring activities support retention and graduation of these students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need.  Student attrition at the low-level introductory CS courses is historically high among low-income students.  This project will investigate the effects of incorporating industry standard tools and methodologies into curricular and non-curricular activities, while actively mentoring students.  Researchers will also advance the understanding of which type of curricular improvements and active interventions have a positive impact in student success.  Expected outcomes include increasing the scholar’s commitment to CS careers and increasing satisfaction with the program in general.  This will translate to an increase of student retention, graduation, and career placement rates overall.  This evaluation of this project will include analyzing surveys and conducting interviews with scholars and faculty involved.  Course data, retention, graduation, and career placement information will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the changes and strategies implemented.  Results of this project will be disseminated in relevant conferences (ACM Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education, Great Minds in STEM), journals (Journal of Educational Computing Research, Journal for STEM Education Research), and in meetings of the Computing Alliance of Hispanic Serving Institutions (CAHSI).  This project is funded by NSF’s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income, academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.  It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
