<AbstractNarration>This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. CUNY City College (CCNY) is upgrading a console for solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectrometer that is equipped with an advanced control system for solid-state NMR experiments and a pulsed field high-gradient (PFG) NMR broadband diffusion probe. The instrument supports the research of Professor Ruth Stark, Robert Messinger and other colleagues. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of chemically and biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution as well as collaborators from neighboring colleges. This advanced solid-state NMR instrumentation at CCNY facilitates new collaborations among molecular biophysicists and chemical engineers who target both natural and designed materials, laying the groundwork for activities that share technical expertise, seed partnerships and disseminate scientific advances. This instrument is also employed in educational activities such as half-day workshops among CCNY ssNMR users that share technical expertise, illustrate research applications and foster student communication skills. An annual NMR poster session brings together ssNMR practitioners from the NYC region and a hands-on outreach workshop using ssNMR projects to spark the interest of undergraduate students in STEM, especially those from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts investigations on pigments and polyesters that protect cells and studies of molecular environments and structures of inorganic battery materials. The instrumentation is also used to enable the study of lipids and membrane proteins in complex biomembranes and the study of tension-dependent dynamics in designed and natural elastin fibers which are an essential component of extracellular matrices. In addition, it the instrument allows investigations of ion storage in molecular organic electrode materials for use in batteries, and allows studies of protein-mediated signaling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
