<AbstractNarration>The Division of Materials Research provides funds to support a virtual workshop  organized by the Materials Research Society. The workshop will be a venue for scientific exchange among North American scientists to become exposed to the diverse muon spectroscopy techniques and the science enabled by future muon facility. The workshop will showcase recent results and provide a forum for scientific discussion of muon-enabled research in fields as diverse as hard and soft condensed matter, biology, magnetism, engineering materials, and instrument development. This will be achieved through a combination of invited oral presentations, and break-out sessions. Ample opportunities for spontaneous discussions and collaboration are built into the program to facilitate the free exchange of new scientific ideas and to explore the potential use of powerful muon scattering methods. The workshop will bring together university faculty, students, post-docs, and national laboratory scientists to communicate and discuss the latest developments in all areas of Muon science and to draft a roadmap for the future of muon spectroscopy facility. The workshop is scheduled for February 1-2, 2021 and will be a virtual meeting. A report will be generated at the end of the workshop, outlining the milestones and a timeline that will be used to guide a future Muon project for the US. NSF funds are used to maximizing the participation of graduate students and post-docs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muon spin spectroscopic is an experimental technique using beams of spin-polarized muons to perform scientific experiments in condensed matter physics, engineering, energy materials, chemistry and biology.  The technique has a long, well-established history of high-profile scientific productivity, but there is currently no facility in the US capable of performing these experiments.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop title "US Muon Workshop 2021: A road map for a future Muon Facility" was held virtually on February 1-2, 2021.  The workshop aimed to bring together world experts in muon spectroscopy (&micro;SR) and other techniques along with interested stakeholders to evaluate the scientific need to construct a new &micro;SR facility in the United States (US).  The more than 200 participants highlighted several key scientific areas for &micro;SR research, including quantum materials, hydrogen chemistry, and battery materials, and how each area could benefit from a new, high flux pulsed muon source.  Experts also discussed aspects of the &micro;SR technique, such as low-energy &micro;SR, novel software developments, alongside beam and detector technologies, that could enable revolutionary advances in &micro;SR at a next-generation facility.  The workshop concluded with discussion of a concept being developed for a new &micro;SR facility at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  That novel design concept was first envisioned by many of the same &micro;SR experts at a workshop held previously at ORNL in 2016.  The participants expressed that the current design had the potential to be a world-leading &micro;SR facility, and strongly encouraged the principal investigators to continue their work in order to refine the concept and determine instrument parameters that would enable new scientific opportunities.  Muon Spin Rotation/Relaxation/Resonance (&micro;SR) is a technique that involves the use of spin-polarized muons that are implanted in a material to provide extremely sensitive measurements of the local magnetic field distribution within the sample.  The &micro;SR technique has led to important results in condensed matter physics, chemistry and semiconductor physics, among other fields. This technique is highly complementary to neutron scattering and since the two techniques share a common user base, 3 of the 4 existing &micro;SR facilities in the world are co-located with neutron sources. The exception is in North America, where the sole muon source is located at a meson accelerator laboratory in Vancouver, Canada, while the United States has not had a &micro;SR facility since the closure of LAMPF at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  There have been several efforts in recent years to address this shortcoming, most recently at ORNL beginning in 2016, and culminating with this workshop.  Several recurring themes were identified during the workshop: the advantage of higher muon fluxes to enable new science, increasing demand for low-energy muon beams, the need for more software tools for muon site determination and analysis, and the role of multi-probe studies combining &micro;SR with neutrons and other spectroscopic techniques.  The primary method for enabling new science with &micro;SR is higher flux muon beams.  It is important for the detection of weak magnetic field phenomena, it has a greater sensitivity to molecular levels, and even to broader applications, such as using muon beams for fundamental physics experiments.  But by far the largest benefit of a high muon flux would be the expansion of low-energy &micro;SR capabilities. Low-energy &micro;SR beams enable more depth-resolved experiments, creating opportunities for measuring topological materials, novel states in interfaces, layered heterostructures and other new types of experiments.  In particular, there is an opportunity to focus the low-energy muons into a sub-millimeter beam to create a muon microscope for adding spatial resolution.  The consensus was that any opportunity to expand the capabilities of low-energy &micro;SR would be hugely beneficial to the scientific community.  The workshop often noted the complementary nature of &micro;SR to other techniques, especially neutron scattering.  Researchers always benefit from having access to other types of measurements of the materials.  The co-location of &micro;SR and neutron scattering facilities has proven this fact, and a next-generation muon source in the US would miss scientific opportunities by not being closely associated with neutron scattering, computing, advanced materials characterization and other spectroscopic techniques. Co-locating these facilities and fostering collaborations would be a great benefit to scientific discovery. Of course, muons are not only used to measure properties of materials &ndash; they can also be used to study the most fundamental problems in particle physics. One of these is the "flavor problem" which looks at the patterns of masses of particles. The flavor problem also deals with unexplained oscillations of particles between different flavors (muonium-antimuoniom conversion). This directly feeds into the bigger question of whether there is physics beyond the Standard Model.  These would be key features of a US-based &micro;SR facility at ORNL.  This concept has the opportunity to gain orders of magnitude more flux, and it was felt that this would be an excellent opportunity to develop low-energy &micro;SR beams that can expand the current capabilities. The &micro;SR community expressed strong interest in being further engaged in realizing a new, US-based muon source.       Last Modified: 09/07/2021       Submitted by: J.
