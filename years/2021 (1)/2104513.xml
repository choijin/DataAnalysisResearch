<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the need for a flexible wireless gas sensing device at high temperature for wide variety of applications including the use by first responders. Monitoring environmental conditions surrounding a first responder and relaying the information to the on-scene commander and incident command quickly is essential to assess true situational awareness of the health and performance of the first responder. Specifically, during forest fires and terrorist attacks, the environmental monitoring system is typically expected to provide real-time data on gas phase exposure endured by the first responders to the incident managers enabling them to make the best decisions possible in situations where time is critical. The availability of a flexible ceramic based on Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia that can withstand high temperature have opened up possibilities to realize new devices. In partnership with the local industry, the investigators are pursuing electrical characterization of the flexible substrate to implement functional devices such as high temperature gas sensor and antenna. By leveraging the integrated device, firefighters will be better-equipped to face some of the worldâ€™s deadliest situations, helping preserve life and property for civilians and the firefighters themselves. The research results will directly impact first responders operating under extreme environments and circumstances such as forest fires, terrorist attack, earthquake, etc. The project is offering extensive research experience for undergraduate engineering students in order to prepare them for future workforce tackling complex challenges. The project is intending to address one of the biggest educational challenges in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics community: keeping students engaged in science and engineering. The industry and academic investigators involved in this project are designing creative and interactive lab modules on wireless systems to engage under-represented high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The university-industry project is exploring the feasibility of a compact and integrated high temperature wireless sensor system on a new and ultrathin flexible substrate with a dual intent of providing comprehensive undergraduate research experience and training. The investigators are pursuing fundamental electrical investigations to characterize the flexible substrate for high temperature gas sensing and communication applications. The suitability of the substrate as an integrated device platform is being assessed by implementing a high temperature antenna. Subsequently, the antenna integration with a high temperature gas sensor and a high temperature voltage-controlled oscillator is being implemented.  Antenna performance evaluation is being assessed by performing high-temperature tests, thermal shock tests, bending routines, and microstructural examinations. Field readiness of the device is being evaluated by testing return loss, radiation pattern, gain, and efficiency in anechoic chamber at various temperatures in an industry setting. High temperature gas sensor to monitor toxic gases that might arise from forest fires is being implemented on a flexible platform. Long-term testing and independent validation of the antenna and gas sensor performance are being carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
