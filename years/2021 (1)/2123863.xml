<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Description &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to address the rising energy consumption of computing that is posing an existential crisis with super exponential growth of data, computing and communications.  The genesis of the current digital revolution started with silicon-based digital technology and has ushered in unprecedented progress over the past five decades.  However, as information systems transform to a data-centric paradigm, it motivates a comprehensive rethinking of the fundamental nature of computing platforms- from materials-to-systems. For instance, unlike traditional computers that separate memory storage and computing processes, realizing new computing platforms such as cognitive systems, explainable artificial intelligence, communication systems, etc., would benefit from converging them together, resulting in orders-of-magnitude improvement in energy efficiency and performance. The recent progress in developing highly scalable, and process technology compatible ferroelectric materials provides a promising pathway to developing this infrastructure for the next generation of information processing platforms. The objective of this planning grant is to consolidate this vision to enable setting up an Engineering Research Center that can facilitate across-the-stack innovations to facilitate such systems. Researchers from the Rochester Institute of Technology, the State University of New York, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Virginia, with complementary expertise- ranging from devices to systems and computing algorithms, will integrate these strengths to lay the foundation for a center to realize the next generation of computing hardware infrastructure. The center also aims to create mid-scale research infrastructure for training the future generation of scientists &amp; engineers to expand the semiconductor workforce for imminent societal needs in energy efficient computing, security and healthcare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unified logic and memory technology platform provides a promising pathway to overcome the challenges of conventional computing platforms arising from the Mooreâ€™s law scaling slowing down, and the memory bottleneck of the von Neumann architecture. The ultra-low energy, non-volatile polarization switching in new highly scaled ferroelectrics is a promising route the realize the power, performance, area, and cost benefits of such a unified technology platform. We propose to conceptualize a Center for Micro Ferroelectronic Devices and Systems (microFeDS) that will create the infrastructure dedicated to performing a comprehensive research effort that will span from designing, growth and integration of ferroelectric materials, fabrication of ferroelectronic devices, circuits and systems. Besides application of such platforms in computing, we will also explore the synergies of various aspects of this technology in other areas such as microwaves, ferro photonics, microfluidics, sensors, and energy harvesting. Planning activities will entail cultivating collaborations with government, academics, national labs, industry technologists, international institutes, and educators to enable the integration of ferroelectronic devices with new functionalities on to the existing electronic platform.  The major grant activities include: 1) establish mission and grand vision of the Center; 2) identify external partners and invite them to collaborate in the planning of the Center; 3) define goals, objectives and metrics for the Center; 4) conduct joint meeting to unveil the mission, where involved parties will present their technical work in the context of technological contributions and broader impacts; 5) writing a compelling proposal; and 6) proposal review and submission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
