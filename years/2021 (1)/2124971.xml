<AbstractNarration>This project examines and documents the impacts of engaging with Indigenous Research Methods and Pedagogy in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields. The Native Environmental Science Program (NES) at Northwest Indian College (NWIC), situated within Lummi Nation's traditional territory with six extended campuses throughout the Pacific Northwest, is in a unique position to give voice to ethical research in STEM. While there is some documentation about the impacts of engaging in Indigenous Research Methodology in the social sciences, less is known about the impacts of engaging with Indigenous Research Methods in STEM. NWIC’s NES Program is well positioned to influence the culture of STEM education, more broadly, because of its commitment to engaging in methodologies and topics that align with community values and are identified as community priorities. The diversity of students, themselves, with more than 130 different Indigenous nations represented at NWIC, provides a unique (and under-reported) lens to view science education and the growth of the STEM field. This project addresses the need to develop culturally responsive and ethical research methodologies and practices for conducting relevant and transformational research in Indigenous communities. This project documents the impacts of investing in tribal college science programs and developing culturally responsive and ethical research methodologies. Specifically, this project investigates the question, “How does engaging with Indigenous Research Methodology and Pedagogy impact the educational pathways of Indigenous students in the STEM field?”.  Answering this question will help contribute to a greater understanding of ethical research practices in the STEM field, highlight best practices to support Indigenous scientists, and lead to greater diversity and representation in the STEM field. This investment in tribal college science programming is an investment in increasing the diversity in the STEM fields, in general, while shaping innovative approaches to solving complex problems. Engaging in Ethics Research involving Indigenous Science will provide a significant opportunity to grow and strengthen Indigenous Scientists while informing both minority-serving and predominately white academic institutions and STEM practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a longitudinal study of Indigenous students engaging in STEM education over twelve years and an institutional autoethnography documenting program development. The project will also conduct focus group conversations with science faculty and advisors for high schools connected to Northwest Indian College and other tribal college science programs. The project addresses the need to develop culturally responsive and ethical research methodologies and practices for conducting relevant and transformational research in Indigenous communities, and the research will be the first to comprehensively analyze the impacts of investing in tribal college science programs. This project will help answer the question, “How does engaging with Indigenous Research Methodology and Pedagogy impact the educational pathways of Indigenous students in the STEM field?”  with two goals: 1) contribute to a greater understanding of ethical research practices in the STEM field through engagement with Indigenous Research Methods and Pedagogy and Highlight Best Practices to Support Indigenous Scientists and 2) greater diversity and representation in the STEM field. Analyzing the transformations of Native Environmental Science research and practice in a tribal college setting will yield much-needed insights into how other research programs may adjust their research practices to promote inclusivity in research methods and design. Following Indigenous Research Methodologies prioritize community-identified research projects, reciprocity to and consistent engagement with community, and inclusivity of multiple ways of knowing. In addition, this process values Indigenous Knowledge Holders as experts in the field and meaningful contributors to research and pedagogy. Through this process, we will contribute to a wider understanding of the applications of Indigenous Research Methodologies in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
