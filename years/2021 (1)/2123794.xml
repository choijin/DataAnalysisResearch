<AbstractNarration>The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program. Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that the ocean economy can add up to $1.5 trillion of value to the global economy by 2030, doubling their 2010 levels. The data sets that our envisioned ERC can produce can help policy and decision-making through a more thorough assessment of the impact of human activity and economic development on the coastal environment. The technology that can be developed can enable faster, safer, and more effective emergency response, and search-and-rescue operations. Specifically for the activities of this planning grant, we believe that they can contribute uniquely to workforce development, by offering a unique opportunity to participating students across institutions for inspiring, hands-on applied field work, as well as for networking and mentoring with academic, industry, and community leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coastal communities are heavily dependent and reliant on the nearby complex and dynamic marine geo-eco systems, whose extent, structure, interactions, and function are not fully understood. What is more, estuarine and coastal regions in the US currently face multiple additional marine spatial planning issues and challenges, including the effects of episodic storms, climate change, and other stressors. Obtaining scientific insights on the morphology and evolution of these natural multi-scale dynamical systems, and how they are influenced by human activity, will help assess the impact of long-term coastal and offshore development projects. It will also enable us to facilitate a more timely, coordinated, and effective response to natural and man-made emergencies and disasters. The envisioned RECON ERC is intended to help create the science to understand the underlying processes; develop the technology to efficiently and accurately observe, measure and record the associated phenomena; engage with industry to transition the technology to the field and innovate with new products and services; partner with local government to help them effectively leverage the technology and serve their communities; reach out to the communities to understand better their perspective and problems, and give them a more complete picture of how automation technology and engineering can contribute to their solution; and finally, educate the new generation of leaders and practitioners who will field, maintain, and grow this new technology-driven industry segment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) Division and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
