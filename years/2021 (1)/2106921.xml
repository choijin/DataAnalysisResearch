<AbstractNarration>Animal  agriculture  has  intensified  over  the  past  several  decades,  and  animals  are  managed increasingly as large groups. As animals are often located remotely on large expanses of pasture, continuous monitoring of animal health and well-being is labor-intensive and challenging. This project  aims  to  develop  a  solar  sensor-based  smart  farm  Internet-of-Things  network,  which  is versatile, reliable, and robust to cyberattacks for smart animal monitoring and to demonstrate its operation and practicality on real farms. The solar sensor network will leverage low-power, wide- area  networking  to  enable  animal  care  personnel  to  monitor  the  behavior  and  health  of  cattle remotely  through  the  Internet.  The  proposed  research  will  provide  fundamental  advances  to building  an  energy-efficient,  scalable,  communication-efficient  animal  farm  system,  while ensuring high monitoring quality under uncertain, dynamic, and hostile smart farm environments. The success of this project will contribute to a farm management system by accurately observing, measuring and responding to variabilities in animal agriculture systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will design an energy-centric solution that actively schedules communication and computation to minimize energy waste in energy harvesting contexts. The proposed sensor node will monitor biometrics, acceleration, and location of animals and is powered by solar energy. The proposal further builds a physical and medium-access communication layer that is actively aware of the energy-mismatch between the low-energy sensors and the more capable LoRa (Long Range) gateways. The adoption of wireless technologies introduces cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and hence, cybersecurity is another major design objective of the proposed system by leveraging belief models and deep learning techniques while maintaining high quality monitoring services. The proposed sensor network will be tested at Virginia  Techâ€™s farm testbeds, which have been designed to test and showcase such technologies for pastured livestock. The research will also be beneficial  to  the  fields  of semiconductor devices,  embedded systems, Internet-of-Things  (IoT) devices,  wireless  communications  including  5G  and  beyond,  robust  machine/deep  learning, cybersecurity, statistical signal detection, and agricultural production.  The project will pioneer transformative research to increase productivity of animal agriculture and allow  for  real-world testing of advancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
