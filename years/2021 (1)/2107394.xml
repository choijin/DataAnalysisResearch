<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), through Targeted Infusion Projects, supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Accordingly, Tennessee State University will establish its “Increasing Mathematics Achievement Gains by Engaging Students (IMAGES)” Project that will support the enhancement of introductory mathematics courses to the benefit of undergraduate students who will pursue degrees in science, engineering, technology, and mathematics (STEM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IMAGES Project is designed to provide a pathway for on-time graduation, to increase student learning and engagement, and to promote academic and professional development for STEM students.  This project will target first year students who are majoring in mathematical sciences, architectural engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, or mechanical engineering and who do not meet the ACT requirement for enrolling in Calculus I during their first semester at Tennessee State University.  The project comprises of three major components: the redesign of a one-semester Pre-calculus course, the implementation of adaptive and active learning strategies, and the provision of student support services.  The first-year mathematics experience will include Pre-calculus I with adaptive learning strategies during the fall semester, Calculus I with active learning strategies during the spring semester, and Calculus II during the summer term with active learning strategies in an online format.  The student support services will include peer tutoring, peer mentoring, a STEM student seminar series, and opportunities for experiential learning.  The IMAGES Project will enhance the academic infrastructure of existing STEM disciplines at Tennessee State University and contribute to strengthening diversity in STEM career fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
