<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by developing coursework and teaching strategies that will increase the number of STEM professionals who are well-prepared to utilize biostatistics skills in the workforce.   Specifically, this project will increase undergraduate STEM students’ biostatistics skills at two Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs), Fisk University and Tennessee State University. Skills in biostatistics are essential for students in STEM fields to analyze, interpret, and predict outcomes across a broad collection of disciplines.  This project is intended to increase students’ interests in pursuing STEM research, deepen students’ learning through applied course work, and improve students’ matriculation by providing support in an often difficult course, biostatistics. This project will design and study a biostatistics course with four prominent elements. First is the use of flipped classrooms that emphasize short on-demand lectures with follow-up quizzes and real-time technical demonstrations. Second is hands-on practice using real data sets. Third is engaging students in small group discussions for supportive group learning. Fourth is the use of comprehensive data-based projects that provide opportunities to interpret biostatistics in plain language. By the completion of this project, participating students will have an increased capacity to use biostatistics effectively for assisting with analyses in research labs and pursuing their own research interests. Project research will compare the newly developed course to a traditional biostatistics course, in particular exploring ways to meet students' needs and identify potential growth of critical biostatistics skills. Furthermore, HBCUs have a prominent role in supporting African-American students’ journeys to the STEM workforce and the project's research and dissemination activities will generate new knowledge on effective approaches in biostatistics education at minority-serving institutions and other schools serving diverse student populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to foster engagement and improve student learning of biostatistics, which will specifically contribute increased opportunities for students at HBCUs. To achieve this goal, there are three objectives: (1) implement a biostatistics course with integrated research-focused classroom and computer lab assignments; (2) develop a replicable flipped classroom approach to teaching biostatistics; and (3) assess the value of the strategies used to improve outcomes for future biostatistics HBCU students. Objective 1 will be met through the development and iterative improvement of course projects with authentic data, small peer-to-peer discussion groups, and participation in ongoing research projects. Objective 2 will be met by tailoring the flipped classroom approach to students at two HBCUs and creating materials and toolkits that will be publicly available to other institutions nationwide. Objective 3 will be met by conducting a mixed-methods research study to compare growth of biostatistics content mastery and interests in STEM careers by comparing students enrolled in the project biostatistics course and a matched control group taking traditional biostatistics courses.  Major data sources include content assessments, interviews, validated survey instruments and student academic outcome data.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
