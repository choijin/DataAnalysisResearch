<AbstractNarration>Event-based programming is used to construct software systems with&lt;br/&gt;billions of users, including mobile apps, Web clients and servers, and&lt;br/&gt;Internet-of-Things devices. Despite their popularity, event-based&lt;br/&gt;systems are poorly understood and prone to errors because the&lt;br/&gt;underlying platform, not the program, generates and invokes&lt;br/&gt;events. These difficulties have wide-ranging consequences such as&lt;br/&gt;losing users' work in mobile apps, silent errors or downtime in Web&lt;br/&gt;services, and unexpected Internet-of-Things device behavior. This&lt;br/&gt;project is (1) making event-based systems easier to analyze, (2)&lt;br/&gt;constructing an approach for extracting order between certain key events&lt;br/&gt;before the program runs, to prevent ordering errors, and (3) allowing&lt;br/&gt;rigorous reasoning about event-induced volatility, to prevent errors&lt;br/&gt;such as state loss and state inconsistency.  The project is&lt;br/&gt;introducing students to new approaches to event-based system&lt;br/&gt;reliability, as well as providing researchers and software developers&lt;br/&gt;with models and infrastructure for analyzing such systems. End-users&lt;br/&gt;are expected to benefit from more reliable event-based systems, whether mobile,&lt;br/&gt;browser/server, or Internet-of-Things.  The project is increasing the&lt;br/&gt;participation of underrepresented groups in computing via outreach,&lt;br/&gt;mentoring, and research involvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Event-based systems continue to surge in popularity.  The relative&lt;br/&gt;novelty of this paradigm, coupled with essential programming&lt;br/&gt;difficulties (such as non-deterministic event processing, asynchronous&lt;br/&gt;state manipulation, and state destruction) complicate the construction&lt;br/&gt;of robust, reliable applications.  Furthermore, there is a shortage of&lt;br/&gt;program-analysis approaches and tools for this space. To address these&lt;br/&gt;issues, this project is introducing program-analysis foundations and&lt;br/&gt;practical tools such as event sensitivity, making event&lt;br/&gt;creation/initiation a first-class object of program analysis, and&lt;br/&gt;allowing precise analysis via path-based event ordering. The project&lt;br/&gt;is intended to result in: static analyses that incorporate the aforementioned&lt;br/&gt;advances, enabling analysis of event-based applications; as well as&lt;br/&gt;automatically-constructed platform models (which address&lt;br/&gt;deficiencies in current, manual/ad-hoc platform models, and are intended to be&lt;br/&gt;usable in other contexts, e.g., to facilitate program&lt;br/&gt;understanding). The project is targeting the Android mobile platform,&lt;br/&gt;JavaScript client and server programs, as well as Internet-of-Things&lt;br/&gt;applications. Using these tools, developers and researchers are&lt;br/&gt;able to gain effective insights into event-based applications&lt;br/&gt;facilitating the construction of reliable applications as well as&lt;br/&gt;exposing incorrect behavior in existing programs; this, in turn is&lt;br/&gt;benefiting event-based ecosystems' users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
