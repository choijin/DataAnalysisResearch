<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Lifespan is one of the most diverse traits across the tree of life. Work in model organisms demonstrates a strong role of genetics in determining an organism’s maximum lifespan. However, the full extent to which genes, environment, and life histories interact to influence the lifespan of particularly long-lived animals is still uncertain. Bats provide the perfect system to study the genetics of lifespan and the evolution of exceptional longevity. This project will establish a comprehensive system for studying the evolution and genetics of lifespan in bats at multiple levels of biology. Moreover, the methodology and resources will benefit all bat biologists by allowing researchers to comprehensively study other traits, such as the evolution of disease tolerance, and the genetic adaptations to their environments. This research also adds to the long list of reasons why bats are vital to the environment and provides a novel angle for people to become interested in both evolution and ecology as tools to address both new and old questions. This project will also broaden participation in biology by bringing in students from underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as by providing a wealth of educational experiences for the public via a new and exciting view into how evolution be used as a tool to understand the modern world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on 9 species of bats (genus Myotis) in the western United States and involves generating primary cell lines from wing-punch biopsies of multiple individuals in order to create three new resources: 1) a chromosome-level reference genome per species; 2) phased population genetic data for each species; and 3) cell line biobanks for in vitro functional experiments. By analyzing the high-quality genomes for each species alongside the population genetic data, the fellow will determine which genetic changes – both ancient and recent – are associated with the evolution of longevity in bats which are either longer- or short-lived than their ancestors. These hypotheses will then be validated using the primary cell lines from each species, enabling a comprehensive study into the evolution of longevity and longevity-associated traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
