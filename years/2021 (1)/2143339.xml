<AbstractNarration>This award is funded in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seasonal changes of the colors on butterfly wings are perhaps the most exquisite illustration of how the environment can influence an organism’s development. Understanding how a change in the seasons triggers a cascade of complex changes inside a caterpillar that weeks or months later results in drastic changes in the butterfly’s wing color has boggled people’s minds for centuries. The research of this project aims to fill this gap in our understanding using an integrative approach to track the changes in wing development and, importantly, test how such changes impact the butterfly’s future mating success. The results will offer a detailed picture of the fundamental processes involved when an environmental trigger causes changes in organismal development. The educational plan of this project leverages the charismatic nature of butterflies and tractability of seasonal plasticity to establish an outreach program that aims to increase interest and participation in the sciences of rural middle school teachers and students. Through a series of organized events, middle school students will develop their own research projects that they will complete throughout the year. The experiences aim to positively alter the science education environment for all involved, which could have life-long impacts on their appreciation of science, much like the life-long impacts developmental environments can have on an organism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to study the genomic changes involved in seasonal plasticity and genetic assimilation of a sexually dimorphic trait: butterfly wing color patterns. The project further aims to test how plasticity and assimilation of secondary sexual traits that influence adaptation and speciation, such as butterfly wing patterns, impact organismal mating success. Counterman will combine genome sequencing, genetic mapping, gene expression, DNA accessibility, and CRISPR-based gene editing approaches to characterize the genetic changes involved in plasticity and assimilation. These experiments will be complemented with mate preference trials to assay how the plastic wing patterns impact mating success and may be a target of sexual selection. Equally important, the project aims to establish an education and outreach program that trains and empowers middle school teachers and students to develop hypothesis-driven research projects they can pursue inside and outside of the classroom. Collectively, this project reflects a major effort to (i) fill important gaps in our understanding of the genetic mechanisms involved in plasticity and assimilation, (ii) provide an example of a genotype-to-phenotype connection that extends from DNA to whole organism, and (iii) train teachers and students in conducting biological research that has long-lasting impacts on views and interests in STEM for future generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
