<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by developing and testing a curriculum that integrates ideological awareness modules into existing science content â€“ with an initial focus on introductory biology. Ideological awareness is an understanding of biases, stereotypes, and assumptions that shape contemporary and historical science. Science is often presented as a purely objective discipline, far removed from societal issues. However, by contextualizing societal and ethical considerations into biology curricula, we highlight critical unquestioned assumptions of individual scientists and ideologies that can bias research. The absence of discussions on these topics communicates a vision of biology as objective and enlightened; however, the discipline is subject to the same human biases as any other entity. Teaching ideological awareness enables students to challenge prevailing worldviews and the status quo. This research will evaluate how the inclusion of ideological awareness in instructional materials affects student learning and experiences in science, as well as how to use science. Teaching materials developed and tested in this project will be freely available to the STEM education community for use in biology classrooms that highlight ideological awareness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This discipline-based education research study will evaluate the impact of introducing content modules with an explicit focus on ideological awareness to undergraduate students across multiple institutions. Project personnel will design new teaching materials that address unethical experimentation and its relation to human rights evolution; how biological science shapes societal views on identities; and persisting societal biases shaped by historical beliefs in biology. The study will address three research aims. First is to research a national sample of biology instructors to explore perceived barriers to ideological awareness instruction in class and pedagogical approaches to teaching ideological awareness. Second is to conduct pre/post-course semi-structured interviews with instructors to address their perceptions of barriers, comfort, and pedagogical approaches to understand how modules impact how instructors discuss ideological awareness in their classroom. Third is to assess how incorporating modules focused on ideological awareness into biology courses affects student experiences in science (i.e., cognitive, emotional, and social engagement); learning in science (i.e., indicators of retention in STEM careers); and learning to use science (i.e., emotional competency). The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
