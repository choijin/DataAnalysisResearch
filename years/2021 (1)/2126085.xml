<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a simulation-based decision-support platform to assist regenerative medicine manufacturers, including cell, gene, and tissue-engineered products.  The proposed technology aims to address the challenges facing the manufacturing and distribution in regenerative medicine products.  The goal is to assist manufacturers in the identification of problems early on and throughout the overall manufacturing process. The proposed platform may lead to improved access, improved quality of the product, and reduced costs, which may benefit the millions of people suffering from terminal diseases as well as those in need of tissue and organ transplants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a simulation platform to provide decision support for regenerative medicine manufacturers. The simulation platform is designed to create digital twins of a single manufacturing facility or a manufacturing network throughout a large region. The platform incorporates two types of manufacturing modes: a patient-specific, personalized manufacturing process for autologous products and a batch manufacturing process for allogeneic products. The platform enables manufacturers to devise system-level decisions to improve facility design and predicts “what if” scenarios to plan for unexpected disruptions. The proposed technology may enhance knowledge in regenerative medicine manufacturing, supply chain, regulatory, and decision science realms by addressing a wide range of challenges.  The proposed technology may help to ensure accuracy, reliability, and timeliness in the manufacturing and distribution processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Thus, the serviceable available market in the US canbe as high as $450 Million. We also segmented our potential client within our target market todetermine which companies we should prioritize in getting their business. The first group ofclients we will target are the growing cell therapy developers. They have sufficient capital andare eager to improve capacity planning but have no bandwidth and expertise to manageproperly. Next, large cell therapy manufacturers are the ones we will target after we gain afoothold in the business since they already have dedicated experts working on solving the&nbsp;problems and would thus require convincing case studies to get their business.

Thus we believe we have found aproduct/market fit for our technology that focused on serving the need for cell therapymanufacturers to improve capacity planning by offering them customized consulting solutions.Our next step is to secure a client, develop and implement our solutions, and build customersuccess stories.
