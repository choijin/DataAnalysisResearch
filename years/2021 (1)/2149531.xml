<AbstractNarration>This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site award to Michigan State University, located in East Lansing, MI, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. Plants are fundamental to human civilization, providing food, fiber, fuel, and medicine. Research in plant genomics and the training of the next generation of plant scientists is of critical importance as the global population increases and climate change places strain on natural resources, the environment, and agricultural production. The next generation of plant scientists must develop a foundational understanding of plant biology but simultaneously gain skills in computational biology and data science. This integrated approach to training is vital to develop scientists who can work across disciplinary boundaries and utilize big data to address fundamental questions in plant biology and develop improved crops. Students will learn how research is conducted through the integration of training in plant sciences and computational biology and will have opportunities to present their research at on campus research forums and national scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be conducted through the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will join the laboratory of an MSU faculty member and will undertake a mentored research project focused on plant genomics. Simultaneously, they will receive training in computational biology through mastering the Plants&amp;Python curriculum. Students will receive training essential for success in STEM, including critical thinking, communication, responsible conduct of research, and ethics. Seminars and workshops will provide exposure to diverse research topics, advice on graduate school, and career opportunities within and outside of academia. The goal of the program is to help participants realize their full potential in science and train the next generation of scientists to solve global challenges. More information about the program is available by visiting https://plantgenomics.natsci.msu.edu/ , or by contacting the PI (Dr. Cornelius Barry at barrycs@msu.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Dan Chitwood at chitwoo9@msu.edu).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
