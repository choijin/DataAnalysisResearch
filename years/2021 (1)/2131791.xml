<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a metal-based nanoparticle coating solution for durable antimicrobial and self-cleaning surfaces.  Disinfected and cleaned surfaces are critical to fight against microbes and to prevent infection. However, the most commonly used methods including sprays and wipes involve repeated applications of disinfectants, some containing volatile chemicals that are potentially harmful. The goal of the proposed technology is to create a durable coating on surfaces that are susceptible to microbes and contaminants. Compared with existing methods, the proposed technology improves the convenience and potency and is expected to find use in a number of applications including surface disinfection, antimicrobial and self-cleaning coatings, and wastewater treatment systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a metal nanoparticle coating solution to enable antimicrobial and self-cleaning surfaces.  Metal nanoparticles are broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that can suppress growth and eliminate microbes via multiple mechanisms. Tailoring the size, shape, and surface properties of the metal nanoparticles may improve their antimicrobial potency significantly. In addition, surface modification may enable antimicrobial and self-cleaning functions in one formulation. Compared to the existing disinfection and self-cleaning methods, the proposed metal nanoparticle-integrated solution has other possible advantages including the flexibility to be a stand-alone product or to be incorporated into existing products.  The metal microparticles can also be combined with a built-in indicator for a visual readout of effectiveness or with an added external portable scanner for accurate readout and recording of effectiveness that may be linked to a smart-phone app to log the result. The proposed technology may create a durable, self-cleaning surface that protects against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and chemical contaminants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
