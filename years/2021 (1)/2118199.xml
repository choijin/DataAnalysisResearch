<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the theoretical underpinnings of Bayesian computational methods that are key in studying heavy-tailed distributions. These distributions are known to model the impact of highly consequential events that may be difficult to hedge against, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics, wildfires, economic shocks, among many others.  In turn, Bayesian methods encompass the body of statistical theory that explains how to combine observed evidence with subjective beliefs. Despite the importance of the applications mentioned earlier, most of the computational methods for Bayesian inference are typically designed to efficiently study light-tailed distributions, which model events that are in some sense easier to hedge against. The project's goal is to study questions that lie at the heart of the convergence speed of computational methods for Bayesian inference with heavy-tailed target distributions. The methods studied in this project will provide the tools to design faster and more efficient algorithms to accurately predict high impact events such as those described above. Successfully enabling efficient and systematic Bayesian inference for heavy-tailed targets requires a breadth of expertise and research experience which would be very difficult to assemble within a single project without the DMS-EPSRC Lead Agency agreement. The results obtained in this proposal will be introduced in courses that will enhance broadening participation. The PI will attempt to recruit personnel from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the project is the study of the convergence analysis to equilibrium of Markov chains which exhibit heavy-tailed features. While this goal is theoretical in nature, its motivation comes from applications: the existing theory does not apply to randomized Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms with heavy-tailed targets, which nevertheless arise frequently in practice. Despite the fundamental importance of convergence to equilibrium analysis, there are important questions that have not been well studied in the literature. For instance, the presence of a spectral gap is known to be equivalent to the geometric convergence of a Markov chain. However, even under geometric convergence, ergodic estimators may still exhibit large deviation behavior of the heavy-tailed type for standard empirical means. Contributions in this direction will significantly extend the Donsker-Varadhan theory of large deviations (which is fundamental in probability). Conversely, Markov chains with heavy-tailed stationary measures typically do not have a spectral gap but might nevertheless exhibit good convergence properties. Designing quickly convergence Markov chains requires dynamics that are completely different from the standard Langevin diffusion typically used in MCMC. The PI will investigate and build a systematic theoretical treatment of the convergence to equilibrium of Markov chains with heavy-tailed stationary measures arising in randomized algorithms of computational statistics and machine learning (ML).  This project will involve students and a postdoctoral associates who will visit the research teams both in the US in the UK. This will further enhance the human resource development of these participants since they will be exposed to a broad network of collaborators and ideas. The scientific output will have a substantial impact beyond applied probability in a number of sub-areas of computational statistics and ML where such targets arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
