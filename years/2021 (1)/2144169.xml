<AbstractNarration>Water-related economic risks and unsustainable water uses will accelerate under the combined pressures of climate change, antiquated infrastructure, and competition for scarce water. In an increasingly interconnected economy, water-related risks can spread through linked river, trade, and electricity networks to other areas. Yet, traditional approaches to U.S. water management and science do not consider multi-scale interdependencies within the hydrologic and economic systems. Efforts to ameliorate water risks and use water more sustainably within the economy will require an understanding of (i) the drivers of water use within different industries, (ii) the source and location of water uses, and (iii) the infrastructure that enables water use and creates dependencies within supply chain networks. This project will address fundamental questions regarding how water can be used more sustainably within interconnected hydrologic, economic, and infrastructure networks. More specifically, this research will (i) determine the economic, environmental, technological, and regulatory determinants of industrial water uses; (ii) conceptually and analytically connect aquifers, rivers, and supporting infrastructure to the irrigated croplands that underpin the nation’s food supply; and (iii) reveal local and nonlocal vulnerabilities and opportunities for improved sustainability within the interconnected hydrologic, infrastructure, and supply chain networks. The scientific advances and student training stemming from work will support a pressing national need for more resilient supply chains and infrastructure to support a more sustainable economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching scientific question of this research is: How do infrastructure, hydrologic, and economic systems converge to shape water use and risks within the U.S. economy? This work will harness large- scale data with machine learning, multilayer network analysis, and geospatial tools to uncover the drivers of industrial water use, water infrastructure dependencies within the economy, and the water scarcity risks and opportunities embedded within the hydro-economic system. Building on recent research and through unique data access, this project aims to produce infrastructure-level insights regarding where, for what purpose, and from what source water is used within the U.S. economy. Research advances will be integrated within an education plan that will generate new knowledge regarding the efficacy of different sustainability and systems science instructional methods within undergraduate and K- 12 settings. Undergraduate students, scientists, and middle school science teachers will utilize research findings to co-develop interactive webtools, in-person demonstrations, kid-reviewed scientific publications, and lesson plans for K-12 students. Using these educational tools, the PI and undergraduate students will engage with local and regional elementary and middle school students. The U.S. Geological Survey’s Water Science School (7.5M+ unique annual visitors) will make educational tools available for use in traditional and virtual classrooms worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
