<AbstractNarration>This grant will support a virtual convergence workshop hosted from Hawaiʻi that brings together Indigenous and traditional communities, scientists from diverse fields, nonprofits, businesses, government, and more to develop project ideas and define priorities for use-inspired research and application coming out of ongoing collaborative efforts at rebuilding human relationships with coastal ecosystems based on the land and resource management practices of Indigenous peoples and traditional communities. The workshop contains four subtopics: resilience to flooding, tech-enabled coastal and waterway observation and data management, sustainable economic development, and higher education for Indigenous peoples in STEM and resource management. The project ideas developed in the workshop will have the potential to benefit coastal communities’ disaster preparedness, economies, and success in STEM education for rural and Indigenous peoples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the workshop will be facilitated through a series of meetings to ideate and describe possible deliverables growing out of ongoing coastal biocultural restoration efforts. Ideas should be backed by research, cutting edge/emerging/innovative by nature, fill gaps in existing coastal biocultural restoration activities or amplify/scale/leverage the results of coastal biocultural restoration for greater social or environmental impact, and may come from applications in different industries/disciplines and/or require collaboration across sectors. Indigenous cultures are biocultural, meaning they developed historically as part of social-ecological systems and have developed generational, observation-based knowledge of how to manage local and regional resources sustainably. Applying, amplifying, and scaling Indigenous ecological knowledge can help address the compounding environmental crises we face in the 21st century. Furthermore, Indigenous and traditional communities around the world have maintained sustainable management of or are working to restore traditional territories, creating biocultural restoration zones that offer opportunities to unlock innovations in natural resource management, resilience design, computational and network systems for data-driven decision-making, regenerative economic development, and inclusive and equitable higher education or workforce training for Indigenous peoples. In particular, coastal biocultural restoration is impactful because coasts and waterways form boundary zones of ecological and economic importance, and work in these zones can inform emerging coastal and fisheries management technologies, scientific progress in the geosciences, and sea level rise mitigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Coastal Biocultural Restoration as a Nexus for Innovation Workshop was held virtually on Zoom over the course of four days in May 2021, engaging 314 participants from 6 countries and 10 U.S. states. Participants were diverse and represented different sectors of society including Indigenous Peoples / Native Hawaiians, scientists, businesses/corporations, government officials, tribal leaders, university leaders, cultural practitioners, and community-based nonprofit leaders.  This workshop was grounded in the key idea that Indigenous cultures are "biocultural," meaning they developed historically as part of a resilient and life-supporting social-ecological system. In addition to the lived and experienced histories of Indigenous and local community members, there is a growing body of scientific and academic literature establishing how Indigenous Peoples maintain distinct worldviews and ways of life, often in resistance to a dominant or colonial culture that seeks to disappear them. Indigenous cultures and languages hold immense ecological knowledge developed through long-standing observation of places. This knowledge is often considered sacred within Indigenous worldviews and is passed down intergenerationally, in some instances over tens of thousands of years. Indigenous ecological knowledge ensured the survival of Indigenous Peoples over time, and it is increasingly relevant today to questions of how to manage regional resources sustainably.  Biocultural restoration is the restoration of these social ecological systems that seek to positively impact the environment, as well as the Indigenous peoples of a particular place. Indeed, biocultural restoration has been defined as, "the mutually reinforcing restoration of land and culture such that repair of ecoystem services contributes to cultural revitalization, and renewal of culture promotes restoration of ecologic integrity." For this workshop we narrowed the scope to "coastal" biocultural restoration, and we defined the term "coastal" as including coasts and waterways of all kinds. Coasts are boundary zones of immense ecological and economic importance.  The workshop was hosted by Purple Mai&#699;a Foundation in collaboration with the Office of Indigenous Innovation, University of Hawai&#699;i, Dr. Brian Glazer, University of Hawai&#699;i at M&#257;noa, Kua&#699;&#257;ina Ulu &#699;Auamo (KUA), and the Hawai&#699;i Alliance for Community-Based Economic Development (HACBED).  We sought to hold space for K&#257;naka Maoli (Native Hawaiians), Indigenous Peoples and local community members from Turtle Island and around the world to convene together with individuals and organizations that work with and for these groups, in meaningful discussions on the future of coastal biocultural restoration. Efforts at coastal biocultural restoration have developed, against the odds, within frameworks of conservation, nonprofit/philanthropy, and education. We were driven to organize the workshop by the belief that in many instances, coastal biocultural restoration projects are now poised to become regenerative and sustainable paths to abundance as well as scalable models that generate positive social-environmental impact.  At the workshop, participants were asked to ideate and describe potential projects and project deliverables that:  1) Have been vetted within their own knowledge systems. Examples include, but are not limited to, peer-reviewed ecological research and publications, and place-based practices that have been implemented, adapted, and refined over generations.  2) Are cutting edge/emerging/innovative by nature.  3) Fill gaps in existing coastal biocultural restoration activities or amplify/scale/leverage the results of coastal biocultural restoration for greater social or environmental impact.  4) May come from applications in different industries/disciplines and/or require collaboration across sectors.  Participants developed a range of potential projects within the limited timeframe of the workshop. Based on the ideas and information shared by participants, we produced a report for the NSF Convergence Accelerator that highlighted specific topical areas that are most well-align and, if picked as a Convergence Accelerator track, would be poised to enable research leading to innovative solutions on 1-3 year time scales.  Briefly, those suggested tracks were:  Track A: Integrating Indigenous Ecological Knowledge and/or Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) into Data-Driven Decision Making Sub-tracks: TEK Data Collection; TEK Decision Support Tools; TEK Data Sovereignty Usage Guidelines and Standards  Track B: Indigenous Empowerment through Community Engagement &amp; Education Pathways Sub-tracks: Centering Indigenous Communities; Educational Pathways for Indigenous students  Track C: Localized Sustainable Infrastructure  Besides the report and recommendtions, another outcome was the creation of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) Guidelines for the workshop. These guidelines are a model of how conference organizers and institutions can set ground rules and establish practices to ensure free, prior, and informed consent in conference settings where Indigenous knowledge may be shared by Indigenous peoples and local communities.
