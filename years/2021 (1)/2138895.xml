<AbstractNarration>The semiconductor industry has played a prominent role in the US and global economy for more than 50 years and has impacted human experience in an irreplaceable manner. While the most common practice is to just think about computers when the term "semiconductor industry" is mentioned, its societal impact is broader than that. Indeed transportation, healthcare, internet, energy, defense, AI, sustainable environment etc. are all fueled by the engine that is called the semiconductor industry. As cloud and 5G/6G are poised to impart huge impact at the global scale, the importance of the semiconductor industry is only growing to grow in the coming years. However, the US leadership in manufacturing chips has consistently eroded and is now facing steep competition from around the world. The proposed workshop involving leading researchers in the field is meant to provide recommendations to NSF for new research directions, both in terms of facilities and future programs in the domain. In addition to the providing new research directions, the results of the workshop are to include new ideas to train students and researchers and thus help develop workforce for US industry of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To revitalize the US semiconductor industry it is imperative to develop infrastructure where new ideas for future computing hardware can be explored, fabricated and tested in a relevant scale. These facilities will need to be able to fabricate both advanced CMOS and new technologies (sometimes referred as the 'CMOS+X') and integrate them in a seamless manner. Indeed, similar facilities are being developed in other countries. This workshop will develop an outline for a network of US facilities by listening to domain experts. The workshop report will aim to provide recommendations to NSF for both facilities and programs that can make such an effort successful and thus serve a very critical national need in the most efficient manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Presentations and discussions in the three panels indicate that functional augmentation of CMOS with emerging technologies (X), or the CMOS+X platform, is poised to become the building block of computing hardware in the future. Two decades ago NSF helped set up the NNIN centers across the nation. These centers have played a very important role in providing critical infrastructure for nanoscience research.

There was almost a unanimous consensus among the panelists that NSF should play a major role in the development and continued operation of such infrastructure. NSF has prior experience in establishing similar infrastructure in other fields, including the NNIN centers.      While establishing such infrastructure: It is important to remember that platforms are needed that can enable frontier research in both CMOS and X. This is critical as co-optimization of both is necessary to unleash the full potential of CMOS+X platform. Cost effectiveness is an important consideration. Running in a 300 mm pilot line could be prohibitive due to the cost involved. In fact, at the initial stage, every technology does not need such a pilot line. Considering cost effectiveness and also the need to establish scalability, 200 mm facilities present a decent tradeoff. Hierarchical facilities in Germany have shown good effectiveness. Establishment of research infrastructure, e.g. in universities, in appropriate locations with proximity to industries such as in Dresden has proved to be a very effective model.        One of the major challenges is also that research funding is targeted almost completely towards new projects. However, enablement of research in semiconductor technology involves maintenance and operation of complex infrastructure that involve paying for engineers and often for technicians. In addition, maintaining tool chains for chip design is another such activity which is essential but almost impossible to fund. NSF should address this challenge, perhaps by creating programs around infrastructure (point 1) that can fund maintenance of such infrastructure in addition to funding research projects.      The complexity of the technologies, need for compatibility with 100’s of processes, and the diversity of the modern computing workloads indicate that center level effort will be needed for success. Recommendations include: Centers should be formed around technology and not materials. Material, synthesis, processing research should be done in relevance to the technology. Centers should involve researchers from device and materials technology all the way to the circuits and systems, but they should be rooted around one specific technology. It is important to bet on a few ideas and build separate, large efforts around each one of them. It is important to find models to involve industrial presence in such centers. This is specially important so that the research is guided by appropriate awareness of the ecosystem that will be needed to make that research successful.       Being able to attract the smartest students is imperative for continued success of semiconductor technology in the future.
