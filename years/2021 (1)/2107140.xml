<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. This project at Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical University (PVA&amp;M) intends to address curriculum deficiencies by addressing the industrial trend of Industry 4.0.  It is proposed that modern product development and manufacturing concepts be infused into an existing design and manufacturing laboratory. Participating students will work in a collaborative environment which will assist PVA&amp;M in attaining its goal of increasing STEM graduation rates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to enhance the learning experience and research capabilities at Prairie View A&amp;M University in engineering design and manufacturing by infusing Industry 4.0 concepts.  This project has five main objectives: (1) To equip students with engineering design skills that incorporate manufacturability. (2) To expose students to the computer-connected design and manufacturing framework of Industry 4.0. (3) To Improve students’ hands-on experience and grant unlimited access using Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies. (4) To provide an online communication platform for effective peer-to-peer and peer-to-instructor idea-sharing. (5) To improve students’ learning outcomes for engineering design and manufacturing courses, and their communication, lifelong learning, and teamwork skills. To this end, the project intends to create a set of learning and training modules on Design for Manufacturing (DFM) and various manufacturing equipment. These proposed modules will be based on evidence-based learning strategies and integrated into the PVA&amp;M VR Advanced Design and Manufacturing (VR-ADAM) system. A learning management system-based – PVA&amp;M Design and Manufacturing forum will be developed to promote a collaborative and mutual learning experience. This student-centered and -driven cyberlearning environment is scalable and can be adopted by other disciplines. Thus, an annual summer VR-ADAM workshop will be organized within the HBCU community to encourage broader adoption of VR-based teaching and learning. Furthermore, the research results, modules, and relevant teaching materials will enrich the NSF learning material repository and benefit the research and educational community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
