<AbstractNarration>HBCUs have limited capacity nationally to produce geoscientists. Of 103 HBCUs nationally, there are 23 that offer degree programs relevant to Earth and Geosciences and consequently, of interest to the National Association of Black Geoscientists (NABG). Most of these (20) are environmental science programs at BS, MS, or PHD level, but they also include geology BS (1), geosciences MS (1), and atmospheric sciences (BS, MS, PHD). Faculty in these HBCU programs, in particular, are underrepresented at STEM and Geosciences-oriented national conferences. A primary aim of this conference is to engage faculty in these programs to enhance their awareness of NABG and aid their participation in the organization as it strives to create a more inclusive 21st Century geosciences workforce. The project will provide support for key faculty in these programs to attend the conference, develop a network of professional NABG members with whom they may interact going forward, and become active members in a vibrant minority-serving STEM organization. The objective of the workshop is to determine how NABG might better serve HBCU faculty and the many students-of-color they serve nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks financial support from NSF for approximately 200 student participants and up to 30 faculty from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to attend the 40th Annual Technical Conference of NABG, 9-10 September 2021 on a virtual platform. For this year, the PI is actively recruiting faculty participants from the geoscience oriented degree programs (e.g. environmental and atmospheric sciences) at HBCUs. Faculty in these institutions and programs are historically under-represented at the NABG annual conference. The objective is to expand the disciplinary representation of NABG to include more people of color interested in environmental issues through engaging faculty at HBCUs. Expanding NABG membership with faculty in environmental sciences and atmospheric sciences at HBCUs will also significantly enhance visibility of NABG within the national cohort of 1890 Land Grant Institutions, and thus, enhance the stability and long-term viability of the organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
