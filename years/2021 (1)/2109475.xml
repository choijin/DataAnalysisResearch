<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The project will address the need to understand how organisms respond to rising temperatures by measuring the organism’s behavior and physiology in response to temperature in two closely related songbirds. These songbirds vary in their ability to tolerate hot temperatures, which will allow the fellow to directly test this question. This research will advance scientific knowledge by providing insight into how and why different populations of birds vary in their response to heat in a changing climate. The project benefits society by taking a 4-tiered approach to address the need to develop a sense of community to support the recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups at the postdoctoral level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many species are shifting their range in response to changes in climatic conditions that are altering selective pressures. Behavior can buffer these effects and facilitate survival. Cognitive traits, such as learning, can be particularly vital to survival when facing new challenges and could mean the difference between a species persisting and going extinct in an area. However, not much is known about how variation in thermal tolerance affects behavioral performance, particularly of cognitive traits. The project includes a set of integrative, experimental studies to fill this gap in knowledge by experimentally manipulating air temperature to quantify effects of learning on a spatial foraging task. Critically, the approach uses individuals from multiple populations across a latitudinal gradient spanning the shifting range limit of two species of songbird who vary in thermal tolerance, to ask how variation in thermal tolerance affects variation in cognitive performance under thermal stress. Overall, the research aims to use thermal stress as a biologically relevant tool to understand connections between behavioral responses to an organisms' environment and underlying physiological mechanisms over different scales from neurons to individuals to populations and species. The project will expand the evolutionary framework of the fellow’s research program and her training in designing and analyzing behavioral assays. Broadening participation activities focus on building community for postdocs from under-represented groups by organizing career development workshops, a lightning talk series, formalization of postdoctoral committees, and a postdoc run outreach event to provide an opportunity for the younger generation to see diversity in scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
