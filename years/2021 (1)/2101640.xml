<AbstractNarration>Algebraic geometry is concerned with the study of algebraic varieties, that is geometric objects defined by polynomial equations. Such objects are ubiquitous in mathematics, and are relevant to a variety of real world applications ranging from cryptography, to computational biology, to models of the universe in physics. Indeed, the Calabi-Yau threefolds, a special class of algebraic varieties, are abstract representations of the shape of the universe in string theory. A very consequential, wide-open question regarding the Calabi-Yau threefolds is the existence of finitely many types of such objects. This proposal is concerned with the study of Calabi-Yau threefolds and of a related, wider class of algebraic varieties, the so-called K-trivial varieties. A number of questions ranging from the above-mentioned finiteness question to more tangible questions will be investigated. This study will involve a number of the PIâ€™s graduate students and postdocs. Some additional research and outreach activities related to the subject are also planned. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of K-trivial varieties, that is algebraic varieties with trivial canonical class, is a central subject in algebraic geometry. The proposed projects will focus on two main classes of K-trivial varieties:  hyper-Kaehler manifolds and  Calabi-Yau threefolds. The motivational goals driving this study are the finiteness of deformation types for such objects, and the complementary question of constructing new deformation classes (especially in the hyper-Kaehler case).  Intermediate steps towards these challenging objectives include questions regarding the automorphism groups, that is the symmetries of such objects; the deformations and degenerations, that is breaking up the K-trivial varieties into simpler, more manageable pieces; and the fibrations of K-trivial varieties (especially Lagrangian fibrations for hyper-Kaehler manifolds), that is constructing such varieties from lower dimensional objects.  A main tool in this investigation is Hodge theory, and the associated period maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
