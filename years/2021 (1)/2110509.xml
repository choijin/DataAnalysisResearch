<AbstractNarration>This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea. The last several years were very exciting in gravitational wave astronomy, with the first detection of gravitational waves in 2015 from a collision of black holes 1.3 billion years ago, and with more than 50 detections published in 2021; the LSU group has been a critical contributor to these discoveries. The group's activities in the next years will focus on aspects of improvement of the Advanced LIGO detectors and the characterization of data from the Advanced LIGO interferometer. These efforts are fully integrated with those of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and are closely related with the activities of the LIGO Livingston Observatory, since that Observatory is located only 30 miles from the LSU campus. In doing its research, the group will train students and a postdoc who will add to the quality and diversity of the STEM workforce, as well as share the research with the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LSU group will pursue research activities in two main topics, all coordinated with the LSC and key to the improvement of detection rates of gravitational waves with the Advanced LIGO detectors. The first topic is about characterizing the Advanced LIGO detector and applications to future designs; the group will help diagnosing and improving the detector's noise in the frequency domain due to the sensing and control of the alignment degrees of freedom, and the feedback control of the suspended masses. The group will model the performance of the system, compare models with actual performance, and then apply the models and the experience to the conceptual development of such systems for upgraded detectors. The second topic is analyzing data from Advanced LIGO detector; the group will identify instrumental artifacts, in particular those related to the group's expertise on scattering sources. The group will eliminate the cause of the transients when possible, and find out the artifacts that most affect the low latency searches for astrophysical signals in LIGO data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
