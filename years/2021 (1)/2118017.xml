<AbstractNarration>The climate across the United States is increasingly unpredictable, with rising temperatures and longer stretches of extreme changes in water availability such as drought and flooding. These events change arable land availability and reduce crop yield. Cells in the plant root are responsible for transporting water and mineral nutrients to the rest of the plant and their cells are the first responders to changes in water availability. One of these cell types is the exodermis, which is known to produce a barrier in its cell wall that is proposed to aid plants in becoming drought tolerant. However, little is known regarding the genes that control its development or response to the environment.  In this project, classical developmental biology approaches coupled with single cell genomics and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing will be used to map the pathways that produce the root exodermis and its barrier, and to determine how this barrier helps tomato plants tolerate drought. The results of this research can be directly used to generate plants better able to respond to changes in water availability and facilitate more sustainable agriculture. The research will be fully integrated into education efforts for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of California, Davis and will provide them with cutting-edge training and expertise. These students will further establish a compendium of root cell barriers that plants produce to counter a harsh environment. These will enable scientists to harness natural solutions for future plant breeding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Botanical studies report that up to 93% of plant species have an exodermis cell type that underlies the root epidermis and which produces a barrier. In tomato, the exodermis first forms a polarized lignin cap that restricts passive diffusion between cells. The genes that regulate formation of the exodermis lignin barrier are distinct from those that regulate endodermis development and production of the Casparian Strip barrier. The goals of this project are to map the genetic pathway that produces the exodermis and its barrier, to show how the barrier regulates the transport of specific mineral ions and to determine how the barrier functions to help a plant tolerate drought stress. Existing exodermis differentiation genes will be ordered in a genetic pathway using developmental genetics. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing will be used in a targeted approach to generate pair-wise mutations of exodermis-enriched transcription factors and signaling genes to determine which of these promote formation of the lignin barrier. This approach will be directly integrated as a Course-Based Undergraduate Research opportunity at UC Davis and will form the basis of long-term undergraduate research projects. Single cell transcriptome sequencing will be used to identify genes that control exodermis specification via asymmetric cell divisions of its stem cell precursors. Finally, the exodermis and endodermis lignin barriers will be genetically uncoupled in order to determine how each of these directly contribute to plant drought responses and mineral ion transport using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
