<AbstractNarration>Diverse experts from five universities in, or with a presence in, the Chicago area are collaborating as the Metropolitan Chicago Data-science Corps to 1) help local non-profit organizations take advantage of increasing data volume and data complexity, 2) train data science students in how to effectively apply their academic knowledge to real data challenges in the non-profit sector, 3) exchange data science curriculum and expertise among these universities and with local community colleges. An organization can submit a Request for Data Services (RDS) and receive help to develop it. MCDC particularly welcomes RDS in areas related to environment, health, and our social well-being. Each RDS is assigned to a team of students. Teams of students with a foundation in data science are formed within a practicum course or as part of a summer internship. MCDC will develop the practicum course, where each team has one or more expert mentors and forms a partnership with the requesting organization. At the end of the term, each team will deliver a solution to each of the requesting organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MCDC is an interdisciplinary partnership between universities, myriad community organizations, and two expansion colleges and aims to strengthen the national data science workforce by integrating community needs with academic learning. By supporting infrastructure to unite diverse students and faculty across institutions and disciplines, by prioritizing the engagement of community, and embedding real-world team-based data science projects into the curriculum, the MCDC will be a uniquely powerful educational experience which will support societal progress. To realize this goal, existing curricula are grouped into multiple pathways to prepare a diverse range of students for participation in MCDC. MCDC students acquire both data acumen and societal knowledge that is intended to lead to a well-prepared and engaged workforce. The MCDC project directors combine extensive, proven, funded, and diverse expertise in curriculum development, inclusive learning practices, integrating real-world data into courses, learning systems, data science, as well as in health, social, and environmental sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
