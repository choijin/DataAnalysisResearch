<AbstractNarration>This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, located in Lincoln, NE, supports the training of 10 students over 10 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024, offering undergraduate participants the opportunity to carry out original research projects in the areas of biochemistry, chemistry, chemical biology, chemical education research, and chemical engineering. To create a welcoming and inclusive environment, each participant is assigned a graduate student mentor who works with them on an almost daily basis to learn about the methods and literature. Participants learn about science communication, careers in the chemical industry, the graduate school application process, and how to disseminate research results through publications and presentations to a variety of audiences. For instance, participants will spend time describing their research to participants in the Upward Bound Math Science (UBMS) program for economically disadvantaged high school students, helping to inspire high school students to pursue science related degrees, propagating the impact of this REU site. In a commitment to broadening participation in STEM, this program supports women and students from underrepresented groups. By the completion of this program, students develop complex analytical and communication skills and have a deeper knowledge of science and engineering careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site offers a range of research projects in chemical assembly, including neuropeptide-receptor interactions, catalyzed hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, RNA folding and ligand binding, laser spectroscopy of halide perovskite semiconductors, rapid analysis of drug-protein interactions, electrochemical sensors using biomolecules, chemical education research into the student use of evidence to support chemical arguments, adaptive surfaces, metabolomics, organic radicals for MRI contrast agents, and the synthesis of 2D materials such as graphene. Students develop communication skills by presenting written, oral, and graphic interpretations of their work to an array of audiences including the UBMS high school students, REU students from other programs, graduate student mentors, faculty members, and on social media to reach the public. Participants take three field trips to explore industrial careers, learn about careers in academia, and are trained in the responsible conduct of research, including workshops on safety and authorship ethics. Best practices gleaned from this site are shared with the wider REU community through presentations at national meetings to disseminate evidence-based, effective methodology more widely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
