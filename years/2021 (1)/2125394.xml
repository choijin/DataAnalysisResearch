<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a software suite of modular web applications to guide medical rehabilitation from neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases and stroke lead to medical complications that require months of diligent rehabilitation to improve the quality of life for patients.  The goal of the proposed technology is to provide a product that improves the lives of people in the rehabilitation process. In addition, the platform may be used to help people (especially children) with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The technology uses gamification, incentivization, and machine learning, integrated with mobile games and virtual reality, to support patients in the taxing and lengthy process of routine medical rehabilitation. The proposed technology provides a platform that allows patients and doctors to cooperate remotely in establishing habitual routines and good habits that aid in improving patient quality of life. Medical practitioners may use the platform to develop a structured, remote learning curriculum that encourages patients to maintain the required level of limb activity, engage in memory exercises, and complete the set of health maintenance tasks that are critical to improving their quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a progressive web application that assists in the rehabilitation from stroke or neurodegenerative disorders. The proposed technology serves to unite multiple data sources and provide a backend for elements like data visualization, project management, and task completion. The system employs continuous feedback, incentives, rewards, and points to give structured feedback to both the end user and mentor while also providing metrics that may be scrutinized for those looking to refine such habitual or incremental processes.  Gamification elements are handled through the selective use of certain proprietary algorithms. These algorithms may be used to make decisions regarding sending user notifications and alerts to incentivize and motivate performance. The proposed technology has great potential to be integrated with the growing trend of mobile and virtual reality “serious games” used extensively in the medical field. In addition to helping with stroke rehabilitation, neurodegenerative disease, or medical applications, the platform may help parents build healthy daily routines for their children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
