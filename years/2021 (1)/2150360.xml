<AbstractNarration>This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently the value of an undergraduate degree has been challenged as demands for greater accountability in higher education have been driven by economic climate and employment considerations. The demand for professionals with science and engineering knowledge and the ability to handle data is increasing across all disciplines. This trend is especially applicable to materials science and engineering, where professionals with both domain and data science knowledge are in very short supply. Thus, it is vitally important to train our future scientists and engineers to be able to gather, handle and interpret complex data. The most efficient way to bridge the gap is to implement student training in data science using hands-on approach, by combining learning modules and research experience. In this REU Site at North Carolina State University, ten students from various academic backgrounds in STEM will be recruited to spend ten weeks of mentor-guided research experiences. Projects will integrate machine learning, informatics, statistical and mathematical methods, and other data science tools in experimental and computational-based materials discovery. A diverse cohort of participants will be recruited each year, leveraging established relationships with minority-serving institutions, and targeting institutions with limited research opportunities. Exposing the students to data science through this REU program is aimed at encouraging them to pursue careers in STEM-related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will strive to provide young materials engineers with training and hands-on experience in data science through their involvement in cutting-edge materials engineering projects within NC State community. Projects will integrate machine learning, materials informatics (MI), statistical and mathematical methods, and other data-science tools in experimental and computational-based materials discovery. This REU site is focused on improvements of student knowledge and experience in cutting-edge experimental and computational characterization techniques and application of MI tools that can be used to guide the discovery of novel materials. Through the collection of data and application of MI techniques and principles to their research projects, the students will elucidate new perspectives of engineered materials systems and will be able to directly apply this knowledge to the improvement of system designs and/or the investigation of novel materials applications. The REU site activities are designed to connect students to the data science and materials informatics methods and approaches of their research and to help prepare them for an excellent career in STEM. Focused recruiting efforts will aim to increase participation by underrepresented groups. In addition, the program will enhance graduate students' education by providing mentorship training and experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
