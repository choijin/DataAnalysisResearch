<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to partially support 18 undergraduate students, graduate students, post-docs, and under-represented, female, junior and retired faculty to attend and present at the symposium on Quantum and Nanomaterials at the Spring Materials Research Society (MRS) national meeting in Seattle, Washington, April 18-23, 2021. The main focus of this symposium is to discuss the advanced state-of-the-art experimental tools and theoretical calculations used to manipulate and detect the physical properties (magnetic, superconducting, structural, opto-electronics, etc.) of quantum materials, heterostructures and devices, particularly, on the atomically thin crystals, whose response is exceedingly difficult to detect by employing conventional bulk techniques. This meeting is the world's foremost international scientific gathering for materials research, the MRS meeting showcases leading interdisciplinary research in both fundamental and applied areas, coordinated by scientists from both academia and industry in many countries around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ MRS 2021 Spring Meeting  Symposium NM06, Manipulation and Detection of Physical Properties of Two-Dimensional Quantum Materials    The scope of this symposium was to present and discuss the recent developments in the rapidly progressing field of (quasi)two-dimensional layered quantum materials which are interesting for both fundamental science as well as for potential next generation optical and spintronics applications. Research on these materials is rapidly evolving due to the world-wide excitement on their intriguing magnetic, electronic, superconducting and optical properties and potential applications.

The central goal of this symposium was to bring together both experimentalists and theoreticians investigating the physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering aspects of quantum materials. With a mix of young scientists and established leaders in the field as invited and joint keynote speakers, the symposium captured the new and most exciting developments in the field, and simultaneously enable researchers to receive a deeper perception of this emerging field and its grand challenges and opportunities.   The symposium had received more than 67 abstracts.
