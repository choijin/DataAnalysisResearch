<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) on R/V Atlantis, a 274’ general purpose research vessel, and R/V Armstrong, a 238’ multidisciplinary vessel. Both are operated by WHOI as part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF) which is scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). Both are owned by the U.S. Navy, have state-of-the-art instrumentation and support all disciplines of oceanographic research.  The vessels work in all the world’s oceans supporting science funded primarily by U.S government agencies. R/V Atlantis is specifically outfitted for launching and servicing Alvin, the human occupied submersible as well as other vehicles of the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2020, R/V Atlantis completed 74 days at sea in a season shortened dramatically by the COVID pandemic. NSF funded projects accounted for 95% of the total sailing schedule (70 days). In 2021, Atlantis is scheduled for 146 days with NSF accounting for 100 of those or 68%.  R/V Armstrong sailed 178 total days in 2020 and 66 of these, 37%, were for NSF. Additionally, 61 days (34%) were for NSF-OOI. The vessel is scheduled for 217 days in 2021, 9% of which (19 days) are for NSF and 37% (81 days) are for NSF OOI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this proposal, WHOI provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following SSSE:&lt;br/&gt;1) Laboratory Infrastructure (Benches, Seating, Cabinets, etc.) $149,261&lt;br/&gt;2) ALVIN LARS Gimbal Frame $88,874&lt;br/&gt;3) KVM System $54,908&lt;br/&gt;4) IP Video Matrix System $110,430&lt;br/&gt;5) (2) -20ºC Cospolich Laboratory Refrigerator-Freezers $13,609&lt;br/&gt;6) (3) General Use Laboratory Computers $16,194&lt;br/&gt;7) Graco Husky Pump for Underway Seawater System $11,992&lt;br/&gt;8) (2) Lithium Battery Containment Units $8,792&lt;br/&gt;       $454,060&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
