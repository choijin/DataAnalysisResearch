<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an adhesive-free bandage to wear on the skin for wound healing and other applications. Current bandage technology relies on rigid, adhesive materials that do not provide comfortable, long-term adhesion for the user.  The proposed technology is an elastomeric mesh that is a highly deformable and an elastic membrane with similar mechanics to skin that provides a conformable surface to the microgrooves of the skin for long-term wound or scar coverage. The technology has application in wound care, scar management, and skin-patch type treatments (e.g., nicotine, wrinkle, acne, etc.). The goal of the proposed technology is to provide a self-adhesive bandage that may be laminated on the skin for a long period of time, circumventing the need for frequent removal or replacement, and reducing the risk of potential infection. This adhesive-free bandage may be suitable for patients with sensitive skin and/or allergies, such as premature babies and elderly patients. Additionally, this technology may be developed for on-skin, self-adhesive, wearable electronics and translated into markets that have yet to be fully established such as the development of stretchable electronics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a microstructure that mimics the skin naturalâ€™s extracellular matrix by providing an adhesive-free, comfortable substrate for long-term lamination in wound care. Currently, used bandages require "tacky" adhesives that can aggravate allergies and exacerbate inflammation. The proposed technology is a self-adhesive, nanofibrous, silicone elastomer that may replace adhesive bandages. Preliminary testing demonstrates its biocompatibility, increased cellular proliferation, and viability compared to silicone sheets, which are among the most widely used bandage materials. Further, it may increase the rate of cell proliferation and cell turnover in vivo to diminish wound healing time and improve the appearance of scars.  In addition, it has been demonstrated that the proposed technology adheres to the skin during exercise conditions that result in vigorous sweating, acting as a fully permeable self-adhesive. The bandages provide a unique opportunity to evaluate an unmet need in the wound care industry for soft, ultra-thin, stretchable, and permeable bandages, yielding a highly conformal, adhesive-free, and sweat diffusive protective membrane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
