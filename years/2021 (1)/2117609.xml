<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical description:&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of a next-generation dual-beam nanofabrication platform for rapid prototyping of materials and devices that enable quantum computing, next-generation electronics, and the study of novel soft/hard matter systems. This instrument enhances intellectual output by empowering researchers to make new nanoscale devices and to modify materials, with greatly improved fidelity and reproducibility, which are needed to bridge the gap between fundamental science and engineering. The tool enables research through its novel ability to fabricate structures with various liquid metals and is paired with scanning electron microscopy for dynamic inspection of the fabrication process. Furthermore, the integration of an ultra-precise stage will provide wafer scale stitching-error-free continuous writing of large-device structures that was previously not possible. Also, the equipped nanomanipulator can be used to test circuits immediately after fabrication and adjust the patterning process accordingly. The instrument will be included in several ongoing activities, where K-12 students can experience scientific instrumentation first-hand. For example, because traditional approaches to bring new students into science have only been partially successful, the centerpiece of the educational outreach program targets young students and the public by stimulating interest in science through the visual arts using nanofabrication inspired by morpho butterflies. With the broad spectrum of materials and systems that can be studied with the instrument, the acquisition will impact research across departments at MIT and the New England region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;Direct nanoscale fabrication methods have led to dramatic advancements in the development of new devices, modification of surfaces, and the integration of novel or dissimilar materials. Advances in focused ion beams (FIBs) formed from liquid metal alloy ion sources (LMAIS), in particular, have great expanded direct-write capacities, and can now be exploited for the nanofabrication of nanoplasmonics, fiber-tip optics, quantum devices, electron/x-ray optics. In contrast with Ga-only FIB instruments, the LMAIS provides Si, Ge, or Au beams, which can be used for milling of material with the smallest possible linewidth as well as implanting qubits at targeted locations without the need for masks or pre-processing. This patterning precision is enhanced by simultaneous field emission scanning electron microscopy imaging for in situ fabrication inspection, the inclusion of gas injection sources (Pt, C) for patterning and sample protection, a laser interferometer stage for ultra-precise positioning, wafer scale stitching-error-free continuous writing, a nanomanipulator, and electron beam lithography capabilities. This instrument will thus accelerate intellectual output by empowering researchers to make new, nanoscale devices and modify materials, with greatly improved fidelity and reproducibility, which are needed to bridge the gap between fundamental science and engineering. In terms of research accessibility, the microscopy will be managed by Characterization.nano, a shared experimental facility, which is part of the newly built MIT.nano center.  This centrally located facility functions as a cross pollination hub and brings together expertise in nanofabrication, electron microscopy, teaching,â€¨and maintenance. This open access center serves local internal and external users, providing training and hands-on usage of the instruments, and is open to researchers across the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
