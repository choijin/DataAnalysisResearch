<AbstractNarration>This award establishes a new REU site in the Department of Physics at the University of California – Merced, where each summer ten undergraduate students will participate in physics research across a range of subfields ranging from biophysics, condensed matter, atomic, molecular and optical physics, soft condensed matter, and astrophysics. UC Merced Physics has a dedicated faculty and active, cutting-edge research programs with which to engage students. The Department leverages its strong history of supporting undergraduate research as well as institutional partners, including the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center, to provide a comprehensive program of targeted research opportunities, comprehensive professional development plans, community building activities, and dedicated mentoring. Knowledge generated through the conducted research projects will impact a variety of scientific disciplines. Student presentation and publication of data will be encouraged to actively participate with the relevant research communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will engage a diverse and talented cohort of undergraduate students who will benefit greatly from engaging in physics and material research research at a formative stage in their trajectories to graduate school or the scientific work force. The University of California – Merced, as a Hispanic-Serving Institution with a large percentage of first-generation students, situated in the San Joaquin Valley in central California, has both the institutional resources and campus culture to support a diverse and talented cohort of students traditionally underrepresented in physics and science. Participants will gain research skills in physics, as well as scientific self-efficacy through program activities. Collaborators on campus, including the faculty, graduate student and postdoctoral scholars, will benefit from the impacts of contributing to the mentoring and collaboration with the REU participants. Participant support to attend conferences to present research outcomes will extend the reach to impact a variety of physics subfields and serve as a capstone experience for participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
