<AbstractNarration>PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop sustainable materials for their ion transport properties in solutions, which is important for membrane applications for water treatment, as well as electrolytes for energy applications.  The PI aims to investigate the nanoscale dynamics, transport, and structural behavior in ionic media of nanoparticles with attached polyelectrolyte and poly(ionic liquid) molecules. The concept of polarization of the ionic liquids and electrolyte molecular chains will be investigated; it can find transformative uses for magnetic polyelectrolyte hybrids. The molecular conformational behavior of polyelectrolytes as well as ionic transport in poly(ionic liquid)-based copolymer-grafted nanoparticles and their morphologies will determine the transport efficiency of the membranes. The PI plans to use the project deliverables in undergraduate level chemical engineering courses and will also work with high school science teachers to help course development on nanotechnology. Multifaceted educational approaches will include virtual nanoscience educator workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyelectrolytes and poly(ionic liquids), possessing strong ion binding and ion transport properties, can exhibit switchable responses which make them ideal candidates for sustainable membranes with easy regeneration; similarly, polyelectrolytes with enhanced durability and ion transport. This project aims to investigate the role of hydrogen-bonding and polarization of molecules on the conformations and orientations of electrolytes, either as solvent medium or as polymer chains. Network formation in polyelectrolyte-grafted particles under fields will be examined using rheology and small-angle neutron scattering experiments. Interactions between the polyelectrolytes and the solvent media will determine the solvation state, ion transport, conductivity, viscoelastic properties and the polarization of chains. In addition, hydrogen interactions between non-conductive polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate), and imidazolium-based ionic liquid will be verified by Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques, and the polarization of ionic liquids with the polymer-grafted particles will be studied through in-situ TEM experiments. Imidazolium based poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)-grafted particles will be synthesized and their interactions with the ionic liquid medium will be explored to understand ionic conductivity. Two copolymer-grafted nanoparticles with different PIL blocks will be prepared and the ion conduction mechanism in ionic liquid will be investigated. Ultimately, the morphological study will be correlated to the conductivity. The overall aim of the proposed research is to explore the hydrogen interaction-induced and polarized structures of nanoparticle-based polyelectrolytes in solutions. The research plan will underpin the fundamental mechanism of orientations both for the polymer and for the ionic liquid media and will help us understand competing factors and how they influence the ion transport properties through nanoscale interactions.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
