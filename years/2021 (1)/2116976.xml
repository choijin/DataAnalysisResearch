<AbstractNarration>This award to Appalachian State University is to purchase a flow cytometer to support the expansion of research, training and educational activities across campus. In addition to facilitating research activities by various PIs, the flow cytometer will be used to train undergraduate and Master's level graduate students in completing their independent research and thesis projects. The instrument will also be used to teach immunology labs and may be incorporated in existing and new undergraduate and graduate courses serving traditional and underrepresented students from multiple disciplines, such as cell biology and biochemistry. In addition to serving as a multi-user equipment for all departments at Appalachian State University, the instrument will be utilized for outreach purposes for surrounding Appalachian communities, including training high school students in established summer programs such as Summer Ventures and Future Scientists and Doctors. The projects completed using the flow cytometer are critical to the broader efforts of the College of Arts and Sciences and the university to improve research capabilities and scientific literacy by providing a well-equipped, integrated research and educational environment to our students. Research supported by this award will also advance the Universityâ€™s commitment to sustainability by developing strategies to stabilize antibodies at room temperature, reducing the environmental impact of refrigeration typically required for storage and transportation. Furthermore, the projects proposed as part of this award have the potential to offer broader insights into reducing malnutrition and health disparities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support multiple faculty members across campus in projects relating to immunology, biochemistry, bioenergetics, endocrinology, and genetics. Specifically, we will first look at how deficiency in zinc and iron influence the way cells grow and divide when exposed to various parasites and viruses. We will also investigate how natural plant products can compensate for nutrient deficiency and promote cell growth. The second project will investigate how vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) interacts with host immune cells which has relevance for understanding how to design more effective, and targeted, anti-viral therapeutics. The third project involves screening conditions required for a protein from tardigrades to stabilize other proteins so that they can be transported without refrigeration. Other projects will investigate inflammation, cell cycle and development, and plant population genetics. All these projects will enhance collaborations in research among faculty at Appalachian State University and offer opportunities for expansion of integrative and interdisciplinary research relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
