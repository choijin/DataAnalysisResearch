<AbstractNarration>This U.S.-Polish International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project creates a unique three-year opportunity for U.S. students to acquire early career research experience abroad in the fields of materials science, nanotechnology and solar energy conversion working side by side with renowned European scientists. Through this collaborative project between Adelphi University and Warsaw University, IRES students will participate in research focused on development and characterization of novel composite materials for alternative energy sources and environmental remediation applications. The photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties of the new materials will be thoroughly characterized using state-of-the-art instrumentation to correlate the structure and properties of individual components with properties enhancement of the nanohybrid composites. The US-Polish team expects go gain a better understanding of the basic working principles of these semiconducting nano-architectured composite materials in order to increase their effectiveness in photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices for solar fuel production and hazardous waste degradation. This project will also provide research experience for teachers by exposing them to innovative hands-on approach to student teaching and teaching them how to create a student-centered active learning environment in the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IRES project supports the participation of 6 U.S. students annually, 18 total for the 3 year duration. PI will recruit qualified IRES students from diverse and underprivileged backgrounds. U.S. student participants spend 8 weeks at the Faculty of Chemistry and Centre for New Technologies (CeNT), Warsaw University (UW) in Poland working together with their U.S. and Polish mentors and Polish students on thematically-linked research projects focused on photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Pre-trip training includes both technical and cultural preparation. As a pre-requisite to the summer program in Poland students take an independent study with the PI to learn about experimental methods and theoretical aspects relevant to the proposed studies. Post-travel follow-up by the PI continues with scientific mentoring and career advice. The broader impact is multi-faceted. A cost-effective method for manufacturing highly efficient photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices will greatly facilitate the application of those devices in economically and environmentally important fields such as hazardous waste treatment and alternative solar energy production. Moreover, these studies will help to correlate the electronic properties of the hybrid with the structural parameters of the semiconducting components. Furthermore, the students involved in this study will start building up an international professional network and will learn to work in an interdisciplinary, multi-cultural environment. The involvement in this project of Teachers and Students Future-Teachers will give them novel opportunity for the hands-on research experience and better prepare them for their work in the K-12 education system. The results of this collaboration will be disseminated by presentations at conferences, publication of journal papers, as well as outreach to high school students and teachers. Overall, the cooperative activities of this IRES project are expected to enhance STEM education at both institutions, strengthen international partnering, and facilitate the development of research collaboration in this critical area of national and international need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
