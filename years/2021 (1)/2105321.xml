<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding biomaterials to replace the wires in heart pacemakers remains a challenge for society. Many biomaterial approaches have been developed for pacing heart tissue without leads; the wires that connect to the tissue. Existing alternative strategies have not been successful in clinical settings. In this collaborative project between NSF and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF), Drs. Tian and Dvir propose to develop a new class of silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (SiC)-based nanostructured membranes for optically controlled stimulation of cardiac tissues. The semiconductor-based membranes are flexible and biocompatible, and are capable of bypassing many of the current limitations faced by traditional cardiac pacing tools. The team will use the pulsed light illumination of the Si and SiC membranes to trigger the excitation of heart cells under physiological conditions. This research will provide new data that are critical for understanding and developing biomaterials-based tools to meet the needs of future cardiac therapy. The educational goals include providing learning opportunities for students in a highly interdisciplinary area. Dr. Tian will build on existing model programs at the University of Chicago to increase diversity in science and engineering by offering summer research opportunities to high-school and undergraduate students. Other educational activities include an international student exchange program to provide US students with unforgettable awareness and lifelong appreciation of the science and engineering research in Israel. The research and education results will be disseminated broadly through peer-reviewed publications, seminars, conference presentations, and websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many biomaterial approaches for leadless cardiac pacing capabilities, including those based on infrared photothermal effect, electromagnetic induction, and ultrasound-mediated energy transfer, have failed to translate clinically. Therefore, new biomaterial tools and biointerfaces are still highly desired for understanding the treatment of arrhythmias and conduction disorders. Drs. Tian and Dvir propose to develop a new class of silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (SiC)-based nanostructured membranes for optically controlled, non-genetic modulation of cardiac tissues. The semiconductor-based membranes are flexible and biocompatible, and are capable of bypassing many of the current limitations faced by traditional modulatory devices. When activated by pulsed light illumination, the Si and SiC nanostructures can trigger membrane depolarization of cardiomyocytes under physiological conditions, causing the interfaced cardiomyocytes to fire action potentials. This research will provide new data that are critical for the fundamental understanding and development of biomaterials-based tools to enable future leadless cardiac resynchronization therapy. The research activities will provide learning opportunities for students in a highly interdisciplinary area. The proposed study will also provide a unique knowledge and skill set that can open new endeavors in the semiconductor or detector industry. Dr. Tian will build on existing model programs at the University of Chicago to increase diversity in science and engineering by offering summer research opportunities to high-school and undergraduate students. Through an international summer exchange program, the team will provide the US students the experience to establish unforgettable awareness and lifelong appreciation of the science and engineering research in Israel. The research and education results will be disseminated broadly through peer-reviewed publications, seminars, conference presentations, and websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
