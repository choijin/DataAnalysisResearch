<AbstractNarration>This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical abstract &lt;br/&gt;When light is absorbed by a solid, it can create a transient excitation quasiparticle, the so-called exciton, which carries information from both the light and the matter. Understanding excitonic interactions are crucial for the future design of quantum devices with contact-free, all-optical control and sensing. This project investigates the quantum correlations between excitons in an atomically-thin two-dimensional crystal with exceptionally strong light-matter interactions. The unique optical and electronic properties of the two-dimensional crystal promise the realization of quantum correlation well above the liquid helium temperature. The research results will establish new platform systems to achieve on-chip operation and control of coherence for future quantum technology developments. Integrated with the research, the project aims to promote the participation of women in STEM and train the next-generation STEM workforce through interdisciplinary research projects and tasks. A series of career support seminars for women in STEM will be organized at the University of Florida. In addition, optics science demonstration stations will be developed for display in a local museum to increase STEM awareness in a younger generation.&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) and the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) programs of the Division of Materials Research (DMR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract &lt;br/&gt;An exciton is a bound electron-hole pair that can be considered as a Boson, often created through optical excitations in semiconductors. Beyond the dilute exciton gas limit, exciton-exciton correlation forms, and the possibility of achieving quantum degeneracy of exciton liquid and condensate phases have attracted great attention for decades. The recent advent of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors of transition metal dichalcogenides provides a completely new paradigm for exciton physics, where excitons have anomalously strong binding energy and enable all-optical control of the spin and valley degrees of freedom. This project aims to investigate the nonlinear exciton interactions and seek experimental signatures of exciton complex correlations in tungsten-based monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. In particular, this research will focus on spin-polarized excitonic states, which have long lifetimes and support a high exciton density. Both the classical regime and the possible quantum degeneracy of 2D excitons will be investigated through a combination of ultrafast optical spectroscopies and optoelectronic probes. The outcome will inform our understanding of excitonic many-body interactions in 2D and lay the foundation for realizing macroscopic coherence in compact 2D devices. Investigation of these spin-polarized excitons will also elucidate how the spin polarization of bosons affects the formation of correlation and further macroscopic coherence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
