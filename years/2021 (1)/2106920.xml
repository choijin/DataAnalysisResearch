<AbstractNarration>Nearly all aspects of society are affected by data being produced at a faster rate in recent years. The data from experiments, observations, and simulations are not only in more classical science and engineering domains but also in numerous other areas such as businesses tracking more and more facets of consumer behavior, and social networking capturing vast amounts of information on the relationships between people and their actions and interactions. There is a strong need to distill a set of data into a smaller representation that separates useful information from noise and captures the most important trends, patterns, and underlying relationships.  Such a representation can be used for direct interpretation of hidden patterns or as a means of simplifying other data analytic tasks.  This project addresses these challenges by studying a concept from linear algebra called low rank approximation.  The project develops techniques that faithfully distill the meaningful information within a data set.  The algorithms are also designed to exploit high-performance computers so that analysts can get results more quickly and tackle larger problems.  The overall effort in the project is expected to close the gap between algorithms that can effectively handle very large-scale problems and the data analyst’s ability to convert raw input into meaningful representations and actionable insight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The matrix and tensor low rank approximations being studied in this project serve as foundational tools in numerous science and engineering applications. Imposing constraints on the low rank approximations enables the modeling of many key problems, and designing scalable algorithms enables new applications that reach far beyond classical science and engineering disciplines. In particular, mathematical models with nonnegative data values abound, and imposing nonnegative constraints allows for more accurate and interpretable models. Variants of these constraints can be designed to reflect additional characteristics of real-life data analytics problems. The primary goals of this project are (1) to develop robust techniques for evaluating computed low rank approximations for rank and model determination, (2) to develop scalable parallel algorithms for large and robust low rank approximations on today’s extreme-scale machines, and (3) to provide end users the practical tools required to compute and analyze solutions at scale. Typical data and application scientists use Python or Matlab to iteratively compute, visualize, and evaluate solutions, and they are limited to small data sets with feasible memory and computational requirements. While high-performance algorithms and implementations exist, end users would not leverage these tools if they cannot rely on the robustness and generalizability of the results. This project aims to close this gap, developing an end-to-end system with scalable solutions for all steps of the data analytics workflow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
