<AbstractNarration>The elemental ratios of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (C:N:P) have been considered fixed proportions in marine environments but recent work has demonstrated changes across  latitudes. Such variation can have large implications for marine biogeochemistry and atmospheric CO_2 levels. As such, future variations in ocean community C:N:P could be a key feedback to global change. The elemental composition of particulate organic matter (POM) represents the aggregate value of diverse microorganisms as well as non-living particles. However, we currently do not understand how individual cells and particles contribute to observed variation in the C:N:P of POM. This project is determining the biomass C:N:P of individual microbial cells grown under a range of conditions and sampled from diverse ocean biomes. Because different individuals are likely to have different fates (e.g., loss to sinking, lysis, predation), understanding how the trait distribution of microbial biomass C:N:P relates to cell size and trophic mode and how environmental conditions affect each trait’s distribution offers new perspectives and insight into marine C, N, and P cycles.  This project supports two PhD students and multiple undergraduate students.  The PhD students are integrated into existing networks on microbiome science at each institution with opportunities to collaborate across diverse disciplines. Undergraduate students at both institutions are being recruited through existing training programs that target underrepresented groups. In addition, PI Hall is part of a collaborative of Ecologists and Poets at CSU, that look at ways to translate ecological relationships to non-traditional media to make it more accessible and impactful to the general public. This group is exploring the nature of individuality within the marine microbiome by creating trait distributions of written text and removing different modes of individuals (e.g., words) to better understand and communicate how individuals from the smallest organisms on the planet (marine microorganisms) can have large effects on the surrounding ecosystem (i.e., the planet). Results from this project are being incorporated into future projects of the working group at Colorado State University including public presentations, art installations, and published materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to quantify the relationship between environmental conditions and marine microbial C:N:P by assessing the individuality in microbial elemental stoichiometry. To achieve this the project uses energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to assess the stoichiometric trait distribution of populations and communities under different resource and temperature treatments and oceanographic field work across a broad latitudinal gradient. The researchers hypothesize that the relationship between the stoichiometry of particulate organic matter (POM) and environmental conditions are masked by distinct responses of individual constituents of the marine microbiome. They hypothesize that these distinct responses result in a multi-modal distribution of particulate carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) of the marine microbiome. The investigators are characterizing the distribution of three stoichiometric traits (biomass C:N, C:P, and N:P) for 50 marine isolates (both autotrophs and heterotrophs) under different resource and temperature environments. They are characterizing the same trait distribution for marine communities sampled from different regions of the ocean for the same resource and temperature environments as the population experiments. They are participating on an ocean going cruise to characterize stoichiometric trait distribution of the marine microbiome across natural gradients of resources and temperature. Understanding how constituent members of microbial communities alter their biomass in response to environmental change is providing a missing link between the variation in the ocean’s environment and particulate C:N:P ratios for diverse marine environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
