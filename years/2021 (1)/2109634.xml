<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Plant Genome Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Laura Lee is "Cell cycle and cell identity regulation are linked during regeneration" The host institution for the fellowship is New York University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Kenneth Birnbaum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plants have incredible regenerative capacity. Through regeneration, plants can rebuild lost organs and entire plants can be regrown from single plant cells. Clonal propagation, in which clones of plants are produced via regeneration, is a critical agricultural technique. It enables stable transmission of desirable traits in crops that might otherwise be lost through sexual reproduction. Further, it is a necessary step in some techniques used in crop engineering. However, not all varieties of plants from the same species regenerate with the same efficiency. Additionally, many important crops do not regenerate well, including maize and wheat. Improving regeneration capacity in important crop species will allow for crop optimization to combat food insecurity due to climate change. The goal of this work is to uncover the mechanism underlying differential regeneration capacity among maize varieties. Pursuit of this research will provide postdoctoral training opportunities in working with cereal crops like maize, including studying complex crop genomes and root development. The broader impacts of the project are focused on increasing access to academic and research careers for scientists from underrepresented communities through undergraduate mentorship programs. In addition, the activities funded in this initiative will support participation in the New York University department of biologyâ€™s antiracism task force, which will improve support for current and future trainees from underrepresented backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term objective of this research is to elucidate the epigenetic regulation of regeneration capacity in crop plants. The work will test the hypothesis that dynamic changes in chromatin regulate a tradeoff between regeneration and defense and is motivated by several key findings: (1) cell cycle advancement and histone acetylation remodeling are both required for regeneration, (2) changing chromatin accessibility regulates regeneration capacity, and (3) altering the defense vs. regeneration response, hypothetically controlled at the chromatin level, can improve regeneration. The research takes a unique strategy to uncover the differences in chromatin regulation between maize varieties with known differences in regeneration capacity. Chromatin will be profiled in distinct cell cycle phases and over the course of successive cell divisions to determine how cell cycles alter chromatin during regeneration. Additional experiments will monitor chromatin remodeling over the course of a regeneration assay using high-regeneration (Hi-II) and regeneration-recalcitrant (B73) Zea mays lines. Candidate genes identified in these approaches will be functionally characterized in Zea mays. The work will produce genome-wide datasets that reveal a mechanism that identifies key regulators of differential regenerative capacity. As such, this work will answer longstanding questions about the connection between cell cycle and chromatin while producing tools to improve regenerative capacity in recalcitrant crops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keywords: regeneration, chromatin, cell cycle, Zea mays, Arabidopsis thaliana, epigenetics, histone acetylation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
