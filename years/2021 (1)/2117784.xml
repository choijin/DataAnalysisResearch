<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Carnegie Mellon University is acquiring a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF-TOF) mass spectrometer to support Professor Mark Bier and colleagues. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. MALDI TOF combines gentle ionization (ideal for producing intact ions of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, synthetic polymers, and other similarly sized species) with a detection mode that offers an excellent balance between sensitivity and accuracy across a wide mass range. This highly sensitive technique allows identification and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students with this modern analytical technique. It is also used by collaborators at the University of Pittsburgh and other regional institutions as well as industrial users. The MALDI-TOF-TOF is also employed by undergraduate and graduate students and in a summer program targeting low-income minority students from Oakland Planning and Development Corporation School.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer with imaging capabilities is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially useful for studies in the development of delivery systems for protein and nucleic acid-based molecules with potential to serve as drugs and for improving atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).  The instrumentation is also used for monitoring atomically precise gold and gold-based alloy nanoclusters and studies of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. The instrument also serves researchers imaging nucleic acids in situ and those developing tools for studying RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions for potential therapeutics since they are related to lipid nanoparticle mRNA therapeutics from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna that have been afforded EUA (emergency use authorization) by the FDA for use as SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The mass spectrometer is also utilized in the design and development of chiral gamma peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as well as in other studies of modified nucleic acids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
