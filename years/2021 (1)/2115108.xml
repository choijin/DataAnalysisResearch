<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technology to increase efficiency and reduce the costs incurred in decision-making that involves multiple variables along with several possible combinations of such variables. This technology leverages the power of a Quantum Computer (QC) for a faster and more efficient computational potential, which helps businesses in rapid decision making. This proposed technology may be applied to several industry segments such as finance, logistics and supply chain, and drug discovery. In particular, logistics and supply chain companies may benefit significantly from this technology by making faster and more efficient decisions on route to optimization, warehouse management, inventory management, and last-mile delivery.  This may allow companies to reduce fuel emissions, spend less on energy, and improve customer service. Companies also may save on resource management and reduced errors in judgment, where a small fraction of cost savings result in large savings. Commercializing this technology may have an economic benefit as well as a positive impact from an environmental perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a set of algorithms to solve complex distribution problems.  Based on a COVID-19 vaccine distribution model, the solution targets advising and monitoring a safe reopening process by suggesting measures to be implemented by businesses within cities and counties.  The algorithms will also suggest effective supply distributions patterns to optimize impact on limited resource and to develop and enhance mitigation procedures and supply delivery processes for potential large-scale disasters. This proposed technology has the potential to help address critical elements relevant to emergency and disaster mitigation as well as better and more efficient distributions of goods. The goal is to develop a full-fledged software product to be used by a variety of businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
