<AbstractNarration>Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. Bowie State University seeks to enhance the quality of STEM education for undergraduate students enrolled in the biology curriculum by incorporating research-based educational approaches. Specifically, the proposal outlines strategies to implement constructivist learning theory and situated learning theory to increase student engagement with discipline-specific content. The project aims to increase the persistence of STEM majors, who ultimately enter the STEM workforce or pursue graduate STEM degrees.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are (1) to redesign Cell Biology and part of Microbiology I courses, so that all active class time are devoted to hands-on laboratory experiences and real-world applications of cell biology; (2) divide laboratory activities by themes/modules with each one approached within the context of a relatable problem that is explored through inquiry-based self-contained laboratory mini-projects (such as the emergence of cancer cells) lasting a 3-6 weeks; (3) immerse students in authentic cell biology research experiences where they will experience scientific process, and refine in their problem-solving, self-efficacy and professional communication/presentation skills; (4) hold a two-week, summer Cell Biology Boot Camp that will serve incoming STEM freshmen, a cohort that will be mentored over the course of the grant period. The effect of these interventions on student performance will be assessed periodically and the data analyses will contribute to understanding how research-intensive educational experiences impact science self-efficacy, STEM career interest, and retention in STEM majors for underrepresented students. The project will also be externally evaluated for fidelity of implementation as well as outputs and intended outcomes for efficiency and efficacy. These data will provide ongoing feedback, support and guidelines for the implementation of similar instructional approaches at other HBCUs and MSIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
