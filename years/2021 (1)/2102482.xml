<AbstractNarration>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Zhong of the State University of New York at Binghamton will study the role of oxygenation on the surface of nanoparticle catalysts in oxidation reactions of hydrocarbons. Developing active, stable and low-cost catalysts for advanced emission control systems and fuel-efficient technologies is a major part of the global drive toward energy and environmental sustainability. Low-temperature catalytic partial and complete oxidation of hydrocarbons contributes to this global drive in areas ranging from clean fuel production to clean air.  Traditional approaches require large quantity of expensive and scarce platinum group metal (PGM) in the catalysts.  In this project, Professor Zhong and his team will develop an understanding of how alloying a lower-amount of PGM with lower-cost non-PGMs can achieve a higher catalytic performance. The precise determination and control of the surface composition of the nanoscale catalysts are critical for achieving the desired catalytic performance and the societal needs in sustainability. Professor Zhong will be actively engaging in outreach activities that build upon his research to promote engagement of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These activities, including creating summer research internships in Professor Zhongâ€™s laboratory and participating in Bridges to Baccalaureate, McNair Scholars, and Smart Energy Scholars Programs, will be directed at improving the education of promising high school seniors, community college students, and underrepresented students and encouraging their interest in STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Professor Zhong and his team will develop a fundamental understanding of the role of dynamic oxygenation on the surface of nanoparticle catalysts consisting of selected noble metals (NM) alloyed with 3d transition metals (3dTM) in oxidation reactions of hydrocarbons, focusing on small hydrocarbon molecules.  The NM/3dTM nanoalloy catalysts with tunable metal compositions and controllable oxygenation on the surfaces will be prepared by molecular-engineered nucleation, growth, and nanostructuring. The detailed metal composition and the oxygenation on the surface will be correlated with the activity and stability of the catalysts in the hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.  The dynamic changes in surface active sites and intermediate species will be determined using in-situ/operando techniques such as Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
