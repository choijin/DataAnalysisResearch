<AbstractNarration>Active blowing methods have shown tremendous improvements in delay separation, lift enhancement and noise reduction over the years, however a major roadblock associated with high mass flow requirements has restricted their use on aircraft platforms. One potential method to resolve this issue is to synthesize and utilize two seemingly unique active flow control methods, a deformable flap providing a continuous wing contour and active upper-surface blowing, to develop a more efficient active flow control system that can enhance aircraft performance and control. The primary aim of this project is to investigate and determine the key factors governing the performance of active blowing on deformable surfaces. The project will also support the integration of research with graduate and undergraduate education and it will attract, educate and help retain a diverse pool of scientists/engineers including underrepresented minorities from partner institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to conduct an experimental flow-structure interaction investigation to impact our understanding of the key parameters that effect the formation and development of coherent structures near deformable wing flap with upper-surface trailing-edge blowing. Computational studies are scarce due to the high complexity of the equations that govern the flow. Experimental results focused on the coherent structures of active blowing on deformable surfaces are also sparse; therefore, the current project will produce a detailed experimental database for unsteady flow-structure interaction for this application in a low-speed wind tunnel using a state-of-the-art tomographic particle image velocimetry system to obtain velocities. These results can be used to develop a physical understanding of the problem and to improve computational tools. The project will i) determine the properties (varying slot geometry on the deformable flap, slot-height, blowing intensity and Reynolds number) that govern the performance of active blowing on deformable flaps and ii) identify and quantify the effects of geometry, frequency of actuation and blowing intensity on the formation and development on coherent structures. This project is jointly funded by the Fluid Dynamics and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
