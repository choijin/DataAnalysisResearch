<AbstractNarration>The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology-Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (CREST-PRF) track within the CREST program supports beginning CREST Center investigators with significant potential and provides them with training and research experiences that will broaden perspectives, facilitate interdisciplinary interactions and establish them in positions of leadership within the scientific community. This CREST-PRF project is aligned with the research focus of the CREST Center for Nanotechnology Center for Biomedical, Environmental and Sustainability Applications â€“ Phase II at the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez. The goal of this research is to develop an inexpensive material which will be useful in detecting water contaminants. The new material will be composed of metal nanoparticles that will enhance signals from these contaminants. The proposed work has the potential to position a new researcher to start an independent research career and become a competitive faculty member. The work also has the potential to create outreach activities for students in Western Puerto Rico public schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposal is to develop a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate made of Ag nanoparticle coated ZnO nanoshells through a less expensive methodology capable of being scaled upwards. The SERS substrate will serve to detect emerging contaminants in water, an environmental problem of increasing concern in the U.S. The proposed SERS substrate will be produced in a three-step process that includes the electrospinning of cellulose fibers and the sputtering deposition of ZnO nanoshells and of Ag nanoparticles. These are well known, less expensive techniques that can be used at large scales. The SERS performance will be evaluated as a function of the Ag nanoparticles' size as a function of sputtering time and temperature during post-deposition heat treatment.  The detection of emerging pollutants in water at trace levels will assist scientists in implementing quick remediation actions before dangerous consequences to human health and the environment occur. Thus, the proposed nanostructure as SERS substrate will expand the field of detecting trace levels of emerging pollutants in water resources. Through the host scientist's mentoring, the proposer will have an opportunity to be trained as a competitive faculty member and engage in an independent research career. The proposed outreach activities for students in public schools in Western Puerto Rico will focus on the significance of nanotechnology and how it addresses environmental issues such as water contamination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
