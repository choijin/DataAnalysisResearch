<AbstractNarration>This award will broaden participation at the 2022 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Predator-Prey Interactions by directly supporting the attendance of members of historically excluded groups, those serving in undergraduate or minority-serving institutions, and early career researchers. At the conference, attendees will participate in numerous formal and informal mentoring events, including a two-day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) open to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. These events are designed to enhance the exposure of supported attendeesâ€™ research and promote interaction and collaboration with more senior established researchers. In addition to requiring all attendees to present research at the GRS, there are 8 presentation opportunities at the main GRC that have been set aside for attendees that are supported by this award. Lastly, attendees will be invited to lead manuscripts in a Special Issue publication with topics derived from the conference discussion groups, formalizing the process through which collaborations can continue post-conference. As such, this award enhances the scientific and professional development of a more diverse group of early-career researchers who would otherwise most likely not be able to attend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference on Predator-Prey Interactions has occurred bi-annually since 2014 and the insights and novel research papers produced from these conferences have advanced the field of predator-prey interactions. Given the pervasive and critical importance of predation across animal species and ecosystems, the goal of this conference is to foster cross-pollination of ideas among disciplines from evolution and ecology to wildlife management to neurobiology and biomedicine. This interdisciplinary meeting has resulted in a variety of novel approaches, perspectives, and publications. The 2022 meeting will focus on understanding the relationship between phenotype and fitness from a functionally integrative, evolutionary perspective. As such, it will entail path-breaking advances in our understanding of animal forms, designs, and strategies that represent optimal solutions in a variety of environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
