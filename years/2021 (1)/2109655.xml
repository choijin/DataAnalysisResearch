<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports the research and training of a post-doctoral fellow and contributes to an improved understanding of the Rules of Life in innovative ways. Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are a living consortium of mosses, lichens, and cyanobacteria that inhabit the surface of dryland soils worldwide. In addition to regulating a large number of important ecosystem properties, such as soil stability and fertility, biocrusts offer new ways to test long-standing ecological theory. The project will examine important dryland biocrusts, and the soil microbial communities and nitrogen cycling that occur together with biocrusts. Specifically, the research will assess how the diversity of biocrusts and soil microbes affect key nitrogen cycle functions and how these interactions influence climate change. This research is particularly relevant to understanding how biodiversity at multiple levels impacts how ecosystems function. The fellow will also share this research with regional land managers, including through a workshop in Arches National Park and mentor local high school students through a local School to Science program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates molecular biology, biogeochemistry, and ecology to span multiple layers in the hierarchy of life (e.g., molecules, microbes, biocrusts, and ecosystem function), creating a novel approach to test biodiversity ecosystem-functioning theory. Biocrusts contain a large amount of diversity in a small area and engage in unique competitive and facilitative interactions, making them an ideal model system to test ecological theory. The fellow will assess how biocrust and microbial diversity relate to each other and how they interactively affect nitrogen cycling. The fellow will characterize biocrust diversity using a visual assessment and assess diversity of microbial communities using quantitative stable isotope probing and amplicon sequencing. To understand the biocrust ecosystem more fully, the fellow will examine marker genes for nitrogen cycling at the same time as assessing total and extractable nitrogen pools under different biocrust successional states and with simulated climate change using a one-of-a-kind in situ warming experiment. Taken together this exploration of biocrusts, associated heterotrophs, and biogeochemistry will offer a new look into the fundamental relationships between communities, diversity, and function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
