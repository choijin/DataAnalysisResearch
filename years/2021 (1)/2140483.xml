<AbstractNarration>In this increasing complex world, STEM leaders must have a broader education than science, technology, and engineering to be successful in addressing the leadership challenges required to solve the technological challenges facing the world. Rising leaders need to have a grounding in the social and behavioral sciences and an appreciation for the cultural, economic, political, and educational differences of the people and communities who will use and/or be affected by the STEM approaches they will be developing. Additionally, addressing the underrepresentation of marginalized groups in leadership positions within the US STEM enterprise is vital to ensuring that the nation has a robust and diverse STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference proposal will deliver a three-day workshop to document and learn from a multidecadal perspective the following: 1) characteristics of leaders from underrepresented groups in STEM, 2) transformative efforts that increased representation of diverse STEM leaders across various institutions (academia, public sector, non-profit sector, and private sector), 3) innovative diversity and inclusion perspectives from current leaders, 4) effective/emerging strategies regarding the development of next-generation leaders from underrepresented groups, and 5) approaches for the integration of STEM with social sciences to facilitate processes for a diversity of early and mid-career scientists and engineers to gain leadership positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the number of leaders from underrepresented groups (URGs) has increased modestly over time, this increase has lagged the increase of individuals from URGs in STEM workplaces, which themselves do not yet reflect the demographics of the Nation. This workshop has the potential of affecting various types of institutions that have lagged in utilizing fully the repository of national talent by involving policy makers at the highest level as well as strong leaders who can speak not only to the value of diversity but can also articulate the work and the processes behind their stories of success, thereby illuminating possible paths forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
