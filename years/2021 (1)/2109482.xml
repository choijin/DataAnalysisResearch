<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This project will use living collections of spring ephemeral plants at botanical gardens across the eastern US to determine whether changes in the timing of interaction with different species can help the plants adapt to climate change. Understanding the factors that help determine how species are distributed can help us understand ecology in general, and can also help inform conservation efforts. Much of the data for this project will be collected by citizen scientists, and the Fellow will engage with students by participating in outreach events at the host institution, establishing novel partnerships with local youth organizations, and mentoring local high school and college students, focusing on underrepresented groups in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Holden Arboretum in Kirtland, Ohio, is the host institution. Four additional institutions in the Midwest and southeast comprise the network of common gardens. Institutional volunteers will be trained to collect data on the timing of leaf-out, flowering, fruiting, pollination, seed dispersal, and herbivory for three spring ephemeral species in 2023-2024. These data will be used to parameterize trait species distribution models (TraitSDMs), a new statistical method that estimates the capacity of species to adapt to climate change (CC) by incorporating trait plasticity into projections of spatial distributions. Climate data will be obtained from the source of plant accessions and common gardens to predict spatial-temporal distributions of phenology traits. Traditional SDMs—which use the statistical relationship between species occurrences and climate variables to predict distributions—will also be built. It is anticipated that CC-induced poleward range shifts will be reflected in both trait- and traditional SDMs. However, because phenotypic plasticity has been shown to mitigate the effects of CC, range shifts predicted by TraitSDMs are expected to be smaller. Student interns will be recruited to support this project via data collection; interns will be further advised to develop related independent projects. The Fellow will partner with the Cleveland Footpath Foundation to develop a spring wildflower hike in an urban park, which will teach field botany skills to underserved youth while conveying the effects of CC on local habitats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
