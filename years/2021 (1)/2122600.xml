<AbstractNarration>For-profit entities in the science, health, and technology sectors have become major players in the public communication of science. Science communication can significantly influence the decisions individuals make related to health behaviors, technology adoption, and policy support. Since the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, U.S. scientists have had the right to patent and commercialize the findings of publicly funded research, which has contributed to the shifting science communication landscape. Despite the influence and prevalence of commercial science communication, little research has focused on its effects. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing provides a context in which to understand these issues. Science communication from DTC genetic testing companies is particularly important because how consumers learn about genetic science and interact with it can influence their health decisions, their support for science funding or policy, and their perceptions of related technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve the purpose of this research, this project will consist of two related studies. The first study will be a content analysis of emails from ten DTC genetic testing companies and will identify and describe how these companies communicate with their customers about science, the capabilities and limitations of their tests, and the benefits and risks of sharing genetic data. The second study, which will build on the findings from the first, will consist of a national survey of U.S. adults examining the effects of engaging with DTC genetic testing products and receiving communication from DTC genetic testing companies. The survey will inform the impact of DTC genetic testing experiences and communication on science knowledge, perceptions of genetic research, support for science, and other related outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
