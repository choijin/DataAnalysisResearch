<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This research project examines Ophiocordyceps, a fungus which is a parasite known to secrete compounds that affect the nervous system of carpenter ants. Ophiocordyceps species can change the behavior of these ants, leading them to produce characteristics including tremors, hyperactivity, and diminished social behaviors. Which fungal compounds are involved and how they modify the behavior of these ants is unknown. This research will test the targets and functions of Ophiocordyceps proteins. Doing so will increase our understanding of parasite evolution to manipulate animal hosts, and could potentially discover new pharmaceutical compounds. Further this work will generally teach us more about the insect nervous system and behavior, which may have significant agricultural implications. The fellowship will also introduce young students to science through a community science project using the iNaturalist app to encourage exploration of wilderness areas in Florida to search for ants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand the mechanism of host manipulation, this project integrates four molecular genetics techniques with behavioral assays to characterize the function of previously identified, putative secreted manipulation proteins. First, the fellow will identify the host targets for secreted candidate proteins using a Yeast-Two-Hybrid method. Next, the contribution of each gene in behavioral manipulation will be tested via CRISPR Cas9 technology to induce knockouts in Ophiocordyceps followed by infection and behavioral assays. The fellow will also test potential behavioral effects of the proteins through production in yeast and isolation for use in behavioral assays. Finally, the transferability of these biomolecules to affect general nervous system processes will be tested in C. elegans through the heterologous expression of candidate genes in E. coli strains used for feeding. To increase participation of underrepresented groups in science, this project will utilize accessibility programs from the University of Central Florida, a nationally accredited Hispanic-Serving Institution, to involve undergraduate researchers. To promote this project, the fellow will connect with K-12 classrooms through schools and museums, and through initiatives such as stemCONNECT Florida and Skype-A-Scientist. And to train the fellow for a future in academia, the fellow will participate in pedagogical academies and teaching programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
