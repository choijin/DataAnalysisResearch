<AbstractNarration>PI: Faris, Gregory&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1511082&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project, if successful, would represent a significant technological advance in support of current trends to increasingly use dyes and markers to aid visualization of critical tissue structures, improve biopsy selection, and lower adverse events in surgery and endoscopic procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal project will develop new technology for very high speed hyperspectral imaging including on-the-fly processing of acquired data for spectral computation and spectral decomposition within the period of one video frame (1/30 second). This project will extend the technology for real-time, full-frame Fourier transform spectroscopy based on a 2D-imaging, reference-scanning Michelson interferometer coupled to a high-speed camera with the data sent via a high-speed parallel optical fiber connection. The project will  impact education through training of two post-doctoral and several undergraduate students (through SRI's REU program which the PI co-directs). The project will also support SRI's unique mission in making connections between academia and industry.</AbstractNarration>
