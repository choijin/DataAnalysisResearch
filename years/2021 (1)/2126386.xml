<AbstractNarration>Climate change and the increasing incidence of extreme weather events (e.g., droughts, hurricanes, floods) are motivating researchers to initiate monitoring programs to understand the feedbacks among climate, vegetation response, and Earth surface processes in order to anticipate future conditions and resulting stresses on habitat and water resources. This project will make improvements to Dendra, a data system for environmental monitoring, so that it is available for broad use by geoscientists. Dendra enables researchers to use a wide range of field instruments to measure time varying environmental properties (e.g., rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, groundwater levels) and to facilitate making time-series data available from remote locations in real time. The data are archived, examined for errors, and tools are provided for immediate data analysis. These collective capabilities enable researchers to manage large diverse data sets, to quickly troubleshoot and analyze the data, and to test hypotheses and advance new ones. Dendra, which is currently in use by 8 organizations (e.g., state agencies, non-profits groups, and university researchers), overcomes the challenge of managing simultaneously large amounts of data from diverse environmental sensors obtained from several different manufacturers. This is emerging as a common monitoring challenge now that sensor prices have dropped (leading to large number of instruments deployed). As a result, new sensors have been developed, and real-time tracking is now possible through a variety of networking technologies. To make Dendra more widely available, this project will conduct outreach efforts and will build and share data management and development tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bring Dendra (dendra.science) into the EarthCube toolset as a Software as a Service (SaaS) system. This cloud-based service will be an expert system for use by research groups or organizations performing long-term monitoring. Dendra integrates all aspects of managing, troubleshooting, cleaning, and distributing time-series data into a single system. Dendra was developed by the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory in collaboration with the University of California Natural Reserve System and California Heartbeat Initiative and is hosted by NSFâ€™s Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). Four activities will be undertaken to bring Dendra into the EarthCube toolset. First, back end infrastructure will be built out, providing high availability and three 9 uptime (99.9%) with the web site migrated to static site hosting, and security will be enhanced with a cross-network virtual private network (VPN). Second, to enhance discoverability, the project will bring Dendra metadata into compliance with the EarthCube GeoCODES discovery resource and build a WaterOneFlow connector to become visible on the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) Hydrologic Information System. Third, management improvements will be developed in the form of a Dendra mobile app, a station wizard to ease the onboarding, and further development of the Annotation system. The Annotation system allows for data corrections without modifying the datasets, such that all derived datasets are dynamically corrected along with the source data. These same corrections can be rolled back or updated dynamically. Fourth, the project will provide user assistance and training support, including generation of training materials to make it easier for new research groups to adopt the Dendra system for their own needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
