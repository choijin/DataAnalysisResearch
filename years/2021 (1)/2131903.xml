<AbstractNarration>Crypto-currencies and smart contracts are a new wave of disruptive technology that will shape the future of money and financial transactions. Today, crypto-currencies are a billion-dollar market, and hundreds of companies are entering this space, promising exciting new markets and eco-systems. Unfortunately, usage of crypto-currencies outstrips our understanding. Currently most crypto currencies rely on heuristic designs without a solid appreciation of the necessary security properties, or any formal basis upon which strong assurance of such properties might be achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work aims to establish a rigorous scientific foundation for crypto-currencies. To achieve this, this work blends cryptography, game theory, programming languages, and systems security techniques. Expected outcomes include new crypto-currency designs with provable security properties, financially enforceable cryptographic protocols whose security properties are backed by enforceable payments in case of a breach, smart contract systems that are easy to program and formally verifiable, as well as high-assurance systems for storing and handling high-value crypto-currencies and transactions. The project will provide solutions to some of the most difficult and important technical questions surrounding the current digital-money revolution. The investigators will organize a crypto-currency speaker series that will bring together technologists, economists, social scientists, and policy-makers to foster collaborations that will shape the future of digital currencies.</AbstractNarration>

We developed new programming language techniques for cryptocurrencies, including higher-order symbolic execution techniques for contract verification and refutation.  We explored the direction of incentive compatible decentralized systems, and were able to better understand the economics behind "cryptocurrency mining", and propose game-theoretically secure consensus protocols. We also developed new techniques for securing smart contracts. We have published and disseminated our research results at major conferences in cryptography, security, distributed systems, and programming languages.    Our work led to significant impact in the cryptocurrency industry. We created a new blockchain initiative called "The Initiative For Cryptocurrencies &amp; Contracts (IC3)".
