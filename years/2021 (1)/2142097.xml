<AbstractNarration>This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project focuses on developing an understanding of the fundamental science behind how surfaces affect polymer gels. Polymer gels are networks of polymers (long-chain molecules) swollen with a solvent. Gel adhesion to other materials merges attributes such  as dry and wet, soft and hard, artificial and natural. These interfaces are fundamental to many applications, including body tissue repair, soft electronics, drug delivery, and more generally how biology interacts with machines and bulk materials. Despite the transformative advances in recent years, both fundamental and practical challenges remain that could revolutionize gel materials that interface with tissues, skin and eyes. Using recently-developed techniques, the PIs propose to directly determine gel interactions with different surfaces. By a multifaceted investigation of both hard and soft (gel) interfaces, this work will advance the development of wet-adhesion, anti-fouling, and gel-gel adhesion. In addition to the potential transformative knowledge, the research will have direct impact on STEM training of underserved communities at the local Cleveland-area, undergraduate, and graduate levels. In particular, the PI will partner with Cuyahoga Community College to create a series of educational demos designed to help adults in primary education learn scientific concepts, with an emphasis on polymer science and recycling. Looking to the future, the proposed research, education, and outreach activities will influence important areas, such as soft material technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this CAREER project is to develop an integrated educational and research program to advance the field of interfacial polymer gel physics. The primary research goal is to investigate how surfaces and external forces impact spatially-resolved polymer network dynamics. The PI's group will evaluate local polymer gel dynamics and resolve the fundamental elements of hydrogel adhesion (1) as a function of interactions using charged polyelectrolyte gels, (2) as a function of the surface topology by templating geometrically-controlled patterns to the interface, and (3) as a function of the modulus difference at the interface of two hydrogels. By testing both hard and soft (gel) surfaces, this work will advance the development of wet-adhesion, fouling, gel-gel adhesion, and the unique interactions at gel interfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research goal will be integrated with the overall education program to build trust in the local communities and engage industry and young scientists. This will be achieved in three stages: 1) Partner with Cuyahoga Community College to create a series of educational demos designed to help adults in secondary education learn scientific concepts, with an emphasis on polymer science and recycling. 2) Establish a new week-long annual workshop to educate and engage local polymer industries on the new scattering techniques used in this study. 3) Educate new leaders in polymer science by mentoring and educational outreach to Cleveland high school students through the Polymer Envoy program, yearly showcases at inverse science fairs presented at John Hay High School, and laboratory experiences for undergraduates. Overall, the educational program will advance local knowledge and appreciation of polymer science, which is one of the leading industries in the Cleveland area.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
