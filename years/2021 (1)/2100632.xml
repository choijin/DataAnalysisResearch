<AbstractNarration>The Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center (AMBIC) represents a unique opportunity to maintain national excellence and US technological leadership in the production of life-saving medicines. AMBIC is an NSF-supported Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) focused on using animal cells to produce biologic drugs. AMBIC serves as a catalyst for technology innovation by bringing together academic researchers from five universities (Johns Hopkins University (JHU), Clemson University (CU), University of Delaware (UD), University of Maryland College Park (UMD), and University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML). Industrial and federal mentors identify engineering challenges that limit the production of important medicines used to treat cancer and other diseases. Next, academic, federal, and industrial researchers work cooperatively to develop solutions to improve the quantity and quality of these drug products. These transformative advances may speed medicines to market and lower manufacturing costs, reducing health care costs for consumers by making biopharmaceuticals more affordable and available. The research conducted by AMBIC has been supported by the leading biopharma and supplier companies and federal institutes throughout Phase I and continuing into Phase II+. AMBIC contributes to the scientific community by educating students from diverse backgrounds for careers in biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMBIC's Phase II+ research goals focus on: 1) industrially-relevant biology, 2) process monitoring and control, and 3) consensus and standardization for advancing upstream biomanufacturing. Cell line stability robustness and productivity are investigated for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and other industrial mammalian hosts. Novel analytic tools, sensors, and instrumentation are developed and implemented with advanced system modeling and advanced media and culture operations are designed and deployed to generate optimized processes for developing proteins and other biologics. AMBICâ€™s industrial members include large integrated biopharma companies, manufacturers, suppliers, consultants, and federal institutes. Faculty researchers are drawn from five university sites using a centralized model including experts in CHO biology, metabolism, kinetics, and thermodynamics (JHU). CU brings expertise in advanced process control, bioreactor optimization, genomic and transcriptomic analysis, and protein glycosylation. UD offers expertise in systems and synthetic biology. UMD brings expertise in sensor and regulatory sciences. UML provides expertise in process development, analytics, and product characterization. By bringing together academic researchers and students from diverse backgrounds with industrial and federal partners, AMBIC is contributes to technology innovation in mammalian bioprocessing, ensuring the development and manufacture of the next generation of life-saving biologic medicines for patients.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the following Programs: &lt;br/&gt;Industry University Cooperative Research Centers Program in the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships - Engineering Directorate and Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) - Biological Sciences Directorate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
