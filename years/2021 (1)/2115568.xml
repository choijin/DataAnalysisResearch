<AbstractNarration>With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this pilot PPP project aims to implement academic supports that improve student learning and performance in introductory chemistry courses, thereby increasing the number of students entering chemistry and biochemistry majors. This exploratory research and development study will contribute to the knowledge base on how best to support and improve chemistry education for underserved inner-city minority students who are underprepared for college-level chemistry. The project will benefit 30 undergraduate students who are interested in chemistry and biochemistry majors but are at risk of not progressing through the general chemistry and organic chemistry course sequences. Based on lessons learned from prior implementation of a recitation section for general and organic chemistry, the project team at College of Mount Saint Vincent (CMSV) will redesign the recitation to focus on goal setting, study skills, problem-solving specific to the general chemistry and organic chemistry course sequences, and relevance of coursework to careers. The project will provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of building student skills in goal setting, problem-solving, and scientific literacy through supplemental curriculum for general chemistry and organic chemistry and the extent such skills improve student achievement and persistence in students, especially inner-city students of color. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives for the project are to implement a model of recitation and show that it supports student development of motivation, self-efficacy, problem-solving skills, ability to relate course content to real-word problems and careers, and scientific literacy. As a result, students will have improved grades in the general chemistry and organic chemistry two-course sequences, increasing the number of students who complete both courses and declare a chemistry/biochemistry major. The project team, composed of chemistry faculty and an education researcher, will investigate the following research question: How well do the planned supports increase students’ self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, connection of course content to real-world applications and careers, and scientific literacy, and do these improvements lead to higher major declaration and persistence in chemistry/biochemistry? Evidence of the effectiveness of achievement goal theory and the gradual release of responsibility model will influence pedagogy in CMSV’s science programs and contribute to strategies that help at-risk students at other HSIs. CMSV intends to build upon the results of the pilot to develop an Implementation and Evaluation Project proposal to further support the proposed recitation strategies, and the College will fully implement the redesigned recitation model to improve students’ chemistry achievement. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also draw from these approaches to generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
