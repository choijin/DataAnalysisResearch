<AbstractNarration>The Northeast Bioengineering Conference (NEBEC) has historically been a student-centered conference and the 2021 version will continue that tradition by providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to present their work. The conference will also hold state-of-the art faculty seminars in theme areas selected to reflect emerging or growing areas in BME. Notably, a significant portion of the conference is dedicated to education in BME, especially given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on instructional models. These activities will expose students and faculty to leading edge research in BME, foster interest in pursuing careers in BME research and innovation and provide networking opportunities with peers and leaders in their fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference serves the dual purpose of (1) providing a venue for undergraduate and early-stage graduate students to present their work at what will be for many their first professional-level conference, and (2) exposing these students to truly cutting-edge advances in research areas of relevance to the region and nationally. This iteration of the conference will be entirely virtual and will feature an undergraduate design competition; three Keynote addresses from distinguished faculty members with diverse research, educational and cultural backgrounds; four faculty seminar sessions in the theme areas: Neural Engineering, Regenerative Engineering, Biomaterials and Biocompatibility, and Medical Product; and a special session on education – Changing the Landscape of Education – with participation from Northeast colleagues. Outstanding submitted abstracts will be selected for podium presentations in parallel sessions grouped by topic. The remaining abstracts will be given poster presentations. Social hours with networking activities and virtual booths both for academia and industry are planned to encourage attendee engagement. The regional nature of the conference brings together faculty from neighboring schools to discover potential for new collaborations. It also exposes undergraduate students to opportunities for graduate study at nearby institutions. The networking sessions will include discussions of career opportunities in BME, with a focus on entrepreneurship in a variety of settings. The goal of the networking events is to also encourage interaction between students and the invited faculty speakers. Targeted recruitment strategies will reach a diverse audience, including those traditionally underrepresented, to broaden participation in biomedical engineering. Abstracts of presentations at the conference will be disseminated to professionals and the general public via the NEBEC.org website for 3 years following the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The 47th NEBEC iteration, hosted by the Departments of Bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh, and Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, was entirely virtual.  The meeting featured an undergraduate design competition, three keynote addresses, and three faculty seminar sessions. In addition, there was a special session on education that featured invited speakers in the field of engineering education. Outstanding submitted abstracts were selected for podium presentations in parallel sessions grouped by topic. The remaining abstracts were given poster presentations. Social hours with networking activities and virtual booths, both for academia and industry, were organized to encourage attendee engagement.  The undergraduate design competition, which has become a highlight of the conference series, provided students and their respective institutions with exposure and networking opportunities, as well as the recognition of their achievements through prize awards. For our keynote speakers, we invited three distinguished faculty members with diverse research, educational and cultural backgrounds.  The three faculty seminar sessions featured invited speakers in the theme areas of Medical Device, Neural Engineering, and Regenerative Engineering. These are three areas of growth in bioengineering, and the excellent cadre of speakers provided attendees with a view of the state of the art and future directions of the fields.  The special session on education featured invited speakers in the field of engineering education. The discussion revolved around how COVID-19 has shifted the way we think about the landscape of education, and what is necessary to try and promote educational objectives.  A total of 194 abstracts were submitted and presented at the conference. Of this total, there were 136 scientific abstracts, distributed between podium (24) and poster (112) sessions, and 58 undergraduate student design abstracts.  The conference had a total of 782 registrants (668 active users), with 486 of them comprised of undergraduate or graduate students; and 56 out of 71 Northeast institutions attended the conference, of which 19 took advantage of the exhibitor virtual booths, with the remaining exhibitors from industry (ALung Technologies, Inc., Bayer, and BioEx Consulting).  To assess the impact of the conference, a post-conference survey on three categories was shared with participants: conference benefits, conference impact, and conference feedback. A total of 55 participants completed the post-conference survey. The respondents benefitted most from the conference by gaining new knowledge (65%) and sharing experiences and lessons learned (64%).
