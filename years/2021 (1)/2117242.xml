<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award is to acquire a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) for research and educational training in the crystallographic characterization of nanostructured materials.  This new XRD will strengthen Tuskegee University’s research capabilities in the emerging field of sustainable and advanced nanomaterials. This advanced multipurpose XRD will foster collaborations between several departments at Tuskegee University, partnering institutions and local industry. With the capabilities of this instrument, researchers aim to gain a fundamental understanding of the crystal structure of various nanomaterials including next generation advanced sustainable green materials that would help reduce carbon footprint and alleviate global warming concerns and will have significant impact in education and student training in advanced research methodologies. The proposed instrumentation will improve existing curriculum in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) at Tuskegee University.  This instrument, along with other state-of-the-art facilities which exist at Tuskegee University, will boost the university’s efforts to recruit promising students to its graduate programs in MSE and undergraduate minor program in MSE. This is expected to help produce a large number of African-American graduates, from undergraduates through Ph.D students. This diverse group of students will receive transdisciplinary training through research, hands-on learning modules, and interactions across multiple universities. Integration of research and educational activities will help train next generation of globally competitive African-American scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. These research and training activities will enhance the R&amp;D enterprise and infrastructure at Tuskegee University, making it nationally competitive in the emerging fields of sustainable and advanced nanomaterials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Tuskegee University, significant efforts and resources have been invested in synthesizing a variety of nanomaterials from natural waste resources for biological, pharmaceutical, energy and polymer filler applications. For example, nanoporous carbon, and nanoparticles of calcium silicates, hydroxyapatite, and calcium carbonate have been developed in-house with precise control on the shape, size and growth patterns. In addition, efforts are ongoing to develop advanced green nanocomposites and multiferroic composite materials. Incorporation of nanoparticles will help in improving the properties of composites only when there is good dispersion and excellent interaction between the nanoparticles and host materials such as polymers and biological cells, which can and need to be ascertained through nanocrystalline structural analysis. This state of art X-ray diffraction instrument will enhance research capabilities and allow fundamental understanding of the science of crystal phase of nanoparticles and nanocomposites for structural, biological and energy applications. The proposed research instrumentation will have significant impact on education and human resources development through: a) Development of  multiferroic nanomaterials for electronic applications, b) Development of nano-biomaterials from agricultural wastes, c) Studies on effect of low temperature plasma treatment on modification of polycaprolactone, d) Development of nanofiber mats by force spinning for tissue engineering applications, e) Development of 3D printed scaffolds for tissue engineering applications, f) Characterization of drug excipient blends in the preparation of novel 3D printed implantable drug delivery systems, g) Studies on crystal structures of cellulosic biomass products, h) Low temperature growth of high quality gallium oxide thin films by magnetron sputtering, and i) Improvement of existing  curriculum in materials science and engineering at Tuskegee University (TU). A diverse group of students will receive transdisciplinary training through research, hands-on learning modules, and interactions across multiple universities. Integration of research and educational activities will help train next generation of globally competitive African-American scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. These research and training activities will enhance the R&amp;D enterprise and infrastructure at TU, making it nationally competitive in the emerging fields of sustainable and advanced nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
