<AbstractNarration>With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Matthew Jones of Rice University will explore the fundamental processes underlying the formation of metallic nanoparticles. These structures, approximately ten thousand times smaller than the width of a human hair, exhibit remarkable optical and catalytic properties that may form the basis for future technologies in biomedicine, energy storage, and computing. With this funding, Dr. Jones will expand the understanding of metallic nanoparticle formation by “seeding” their growth with smaller molecules that are atomically well-defined. Coupled to these scientific goals is a program of educational outreach that aims to improve the diversity of the nation’s STEM workforce by partnering with a local high school in Houston that caters exclusively to underserved immigrant and refugee communities. Science teachers at this school will take part in a funded summer research internship in the Jones laboratory while the students in the classrooms of these teachers will be engaged by Dr. Jones’ nanoscience outreach group via laboratory exercises and demonstrations. By creating a program that integrates the training of underrepresented students and teachers with the resources of Rice University, a pipeline of diverse, STEM-educated students will be generated who can serve the workforce needs of the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jones research group will explore the mechanisms underlying the seed-mediated synthesis of anisotropic gold nanoparticles by developing a research program that aims to characterize growth dynamics occurring at the ~1 nm length scale.  This work seeks to uncover cluster-based mechanisms for nanoparticle growth to help develop nanoscale synthesis into a more chemically-predictable science. In objective 1, a library of atomically-precise nanoclusters of differing size, symmetry, and ligand composition are to be synthesized and characterized. In objective 2, the inter- and intra-cluster growth, dissolution, and coalescence processes that result in a redistribution of the cluster population in different chemical environments will be studied. Finally, in objective 3, the role that cluster-based reactivity plays in defining the symmetry and morphology of nanoparticles grown from these precursors will be examined carefully with an eye toward establishing new approaches to predicting nanoparticle structure based upon reactivity and growth mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
