<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to power technology used in the ocean: hurricane hunters, smart buoys, weather stations, ocean internet hubs, and unmanned underwater vehicles  The project aims to create a low-cost, small-scale Wave Energy Converter (WEC) that can generate electrical energy from ocean wave motion and power nearby equipment. Unfortunately, solar panels don’t operate in low light and consume a lot of area, and wind turbines are difficult to install and stabilize on the sea. A study will be conducted to determine how to maximize the energy output of the WEC at varying wave conditions in a controlled wave tank and compared against simulation results. An accurate mathematical model will be constructed and used to guide the development of the product. The WEC product can be used by emergency relief teams to power radios or cell phones. It can power ocean instruments collecting weather data and tracking incoming hurricanes, as well as equipment at sea used to monitor and protect our nation’s coastlines.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to develop an innovative and compact Wave Energy Converter (WEC) that can offer small-scale power for oceanic instruments, emergency equipment or consumer electronics. The innovation uses a custom arrangement of gears to amplify small wave movements into rotational energy used to power an electrical generator. A computer algorithm and actuators will tune point absorbing arms to the frequencies and amplitudes of ocean waves by modifying mechanical properties of the machine. The WEC has symmetrically spaced point absorbing arms positioned circumferentially that allow the machine to capture wave energy from any direction. The size of the WEC fits within the limits of a laboratory wave tank where the performance of the machine can be maximized for power output. The machine will be analyzed with the Design of Experiments (DoE) approach which efficiently resolves factor interactions. The factors are the number of point absorbers, length of the absorbers, the buoyancy of the absorbers, and their masses. A mathematical model of the device will be created, adjusted to match actual performance, and used to further develop the product. The technical challenge is to produce roughly 10 watts of power in a package about the size and weight of an adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The charging station might be used like an electrical filling station at sea to power ocean vehicles and equipment such as hurricane hunting submarines, smart buoys, weather stations, ocean internet hubs, and unmanned underwater vehicles or aerial vehicles just to name a few.&nbsp; The project aimed to create a&nbsp;low-cost, small-scale Wave Energy Converter (WEC) that could generate electrical energy from&nbsp;ocean wave motion and power nearby equipment via an extension cord or by a wireless charging plate. Typically, charging at sea is accomplished with solar power but unfortunately, solar panels do not operate in low light conditions and they require a lot of surface area to install. In addition, wind turbines are difficult to construct and stabilize on the sea whereas a WEC simply floats on the surface of the ocean.</p> <p>Therefore, the use of ocean wave energy for equipment that must be charged and/or used in and/or near the water was investigated in the project as a possible alternative to solar or wind energy. A study was conducted to determine how to maximize the energy output of the WEC at varying wave conditions in a controlled wave tank environment and the results were compared against computer simulations of the device. The mathematical model of the WEC was used to guide the development of a product initially planned to generate six watts of power from lake and/or ocean waves.</p> <p>A significant outcome of the project was the development of a prototype wave energy converter about the size of an adult designed with three independent input arms which spun-up a central generator in a way much like a hand-pump rechargeable flashlight.</p> <p>The machine was designed to be compact and light enough to be carried by one person into the water. The WEC was tested in a university wave tank where wave conditions could be set, and the energy output of the machine could be measured. The wave tank was able to generate wave heights of up to 32 cm (1 foot) and at that height the WEC was able to produce 1.25 watts of power.</p> <p>During the study, the paddle shapes were changed along with the lengths of the power-pumping arms to determine which configuration produced the most power. The experimental results indicated that outwardly tapered paddles, much like a star shape, and short arms, were able to harvest wave energy the best.</p> <p>It was determined that a six-armed machine should produce six watts of power in more realistic wave conditions which was a crucial goal for the research project. &nbsp;Also, voltages produced by the WEC were measured to be above 12 volts which is important for charging lithium-ion or lead acid batteries of nearby equipment or within the WEC itself. &nbsp;</p> <p>Another significant outcome of the project was the development of a mathematical model of the WEC which matched the dimensions of the machine. The model was used to run numerous computer simulations of the WEC in various wave conditions that might be found in oceans or the Great Lakes.&nbsp; The model was able to predict the theoretical power output of the WEC with different paddle shapes and paddle lengths.</p> <p>The simulation results predicted 40 to 60 watts of power available in wave heights of 30 to 60 cm (1 to 2 feet) which are quite common in seas and large lakes around the globe. The proposed Phase I project may lead to the development of a much more efficient machine capable of producing 50 watts at sea, and scalable to provide ocean power for mankind at a much grander scale.</p> <p>The body of the prototype WEC was fabricated of clear acrylic so that the workings of the mechanical components could be studied. A commercial version of the product may have a top and bottom surface made of inductive charging plates similar to those developed to charge a cell phone or electric automobile.&nbsp; Vehicles may charge by landing on the upper surface or by coupling to the bottom surface.
