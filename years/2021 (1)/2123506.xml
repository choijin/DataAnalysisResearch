<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an ultra-low-cost intensive care unit (ICU) ventilator to provide critical care to underserved areas around the world. COVID-19 put a strain on the worldâ€™s medical supply and exposed the inadequate ventilator stockpile and manufacturing supply chain. The proposed technology is designed to meet the growing demands of hospitals in several markets, ranging from county health and human services to local hospitals in developing nations.  In addition, the proposed technology may enable manufacturing and repair within local regions of the developing world. As a result, there may be two benefits to underserved areas: an increase in accessibility to medical care and an increase in local medical device production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of an ultra-low-cost intensive care unit (ICU) ventilator. This development has been made possible by combining three mechanical ventilation approaches: a mechanically driven breathing circuit, a mechanically controlled positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve, and a predictive patient feedback algorithm that provides doctors with real-time patient information utilizing only five pressure sensors. These three technologies are designed to create a cost reduction while still enabling a high degree of life-saving care for the ICU or surgical setting. Initial prototypes have been tested by physicians and respiratory therapists and have provided input for the user interface to reduce the complexity associated with user training. In addition, this proposed device has been developed with components that may be sourced locally for long-term sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
