<AbstractNarration>This award supports approximately 80 selected graduate and undergraduate students studying at U.S. institutions to participate in the co-located conference event consisting of the 2022 International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC) sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Manufacturing Engineering Division (ASME/MED) and the 50th North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC) sponsored by the North American Manufacturing Research Institution of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (NAMRI/SME). These are world-class conferences in the manufacturing engineering fields involving conventional and emerging manufacturing technologies, manufacturing systems including quality control and reliability, advanced materials processing, data-driven manufacturing innovations (e.g., applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence), and sustainable manufacturing with life cycle engineering, etc. As such, MSEC and NAMRC uniquely act as global bridges between industries, government laboratories, and academic institutions. This award provides student participants with opportunities to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from industrial and governmental facilities around the world, as well as with students and faculty from both domestic and international universities. In addition to nurturing a global manufacturing vision, participants will learn about the latest research and developments in manufacturing engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide selected students with support for conference registration and accommodation. The call for student support applications will be disseminated through postings on main conference websites, announcements through conference organizers, track chairs, and symposium organizers, and direct communication with students involved in poster session, manufacturing design competition and research presentation competition. The submitted applications will go through a selection process by the conference committee. The eligibility criteria to receive the funding include the following: (1) students must be from U.S. institutions and (2) students must be actively participating in the conference through presenting a paper, a poster, or participating in a competition. Students from the underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply. The list of student awardees will be announced in the conference program. This award will enable selected student participants to improve their knowledge of manufacturing technologies and help them become engineers and researchers to lead the next generation of U.S. manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
