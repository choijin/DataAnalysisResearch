<AbstractNarration>The NSF Center for Quantum Electrodynamics for Selective Transformations (QuEST) is supported by the Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program of the Division of Chemistry. QuEST is directed by Todd Krauss at the University of Rochester, with a team that includes Pengfei Huo, William Jones and Nick Vamivakas all from the University of Rochester, Jillian Dempsey at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Nicolas Large and Zachary Tonzetich from the University of Texas-San Antonio, Teri Odom from Northwestern University and Daniel Weix from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The development of better drugs to treat diseases, new materials that are both affordable and sustainable, and new ways to harness renewable energy all depend upon the synthesis of new molecules. When making new molecules, chemists are generally bound by a well-established set of “rules” for how a given molecule will and will not react. A limited number of tools exist to tune the result of a chemical synthesis, such as by varying the temperature, shining light on the reaction, or using a metal catalyst. However, the outcomes of a chemical reaction are largely pre-determined by the fundamental nature of the reacting molecules themselves. The goal of QuEST is to discover a new tool that will allow the development of new chemical reactions that are not currently possible. QuEST will do this by performing chemical reactions inside an optical cavity. In an optical cavity, light is best described as consisting of discrete quanta called photons. When such quantum-light from inside the cavity strongly interacts with the reactant molecules in a chemical reaction, the molecules are fundamentally altered in a manner that should unlock new types of chemical reactions. The ability to direct the outcomes of chemical reactions by simply changing properties of light delivered to the system represents a completely new way to tune a particular chemical synthesis, which, in turn, has the potential to transform approaches to chemical synthesis and have broad benefits to society. QuEST will also train future leaders in the field, ensuring that they are well-prepared to communicate the excitement of quantum science applied to chemistry to a broad audience, and striving to build a cohort of developing quantum chemistry researchers that is truly diverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CCI Phase I NSF Center for Quantum Electrodynamics for Selective Transformations aims to discover uniquely selective chemical functionalizations that are enabled by the strong interaction of matter and the quantum light of an optical cavity. QuEST is exploring a fundamentally new tool for the development of selective organic chemistry by utilizing optical cavity polaritons, hybrid light-matter quasiparticles, in a manner similar to chemical catalysts. QuEST brings together methods and approaches from across organic, inorganic, materials, theoretical, and physical chemistry as well as quantum optics. QuEST aims to establish a clear understanding of how polaritons influence properties of molecules relevant for chemistry--such as potential energy surfaces--and develop effective methods to create polaritons for a broad array of molecules in solution. Model chemical reactions in Phase I have been chosen to test the fundamental mechanism and basic principles of polariton chemistry. In addition to rigorous scientific training, QuEST will instruct students in best practices for bringing quantum-chemical science to a broad audience. Efforts will be directed toward increasing diversity in the scientific pipeline through science experiences for underrepresented undergraduate students, as well as translating QuEST science into high-school laboratory activities, social media dialogues, and portable museum exhibits appropriate for all ages. This CCI presents a bold vision for facilitating the growth of an entirely new and emerging field: using quantum electrodynamics principles to enable selective chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
