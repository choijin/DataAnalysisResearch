<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for an invited NSF workshop for studying the interplay between computing hardware and the newly emerging field of nonequilibrium (stochastic) Thermodynamics. This workshop will identify open challenges, opportunities and research priorities to develop understanding of the stochastic thermodynamics of computational systems that are distributed, with multiple spatially separated subsystems, are not at thermodynamic equilibrium (and in general, not even in a stationary state), and have both substantial thermodynamic costs of communication among the subsystems and thermodynamic costs of the information processing within the subsystems. This connection between energy efficiency in information processing and thermodynamic limits could have far reaching consequences in the design of computing systems at large. The topic also has a broad appeal to natural scientists, engineers, computer scientists and has been of much recent interest in multiple disciplines. The inclusion of participants from diverse backgrounds will facilitate the scientific and professional development of early career researchers and increase the STEM workforce pipeline in these areas, as well as help to ensure inclusion of scientists from traditionally underrepresented groups. Close to half of the invitees to the workshop will be students or postdocs from different communities. The PI has had extensive recent experience in mentoring students and postdocs in the general field of the stochastic thermodynamics of computation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will assemble a set of leading researchers working to examine issues common to nonequilibrium theormodynamics and the design of computers, to describe the reasons that they should be studied from an interdisciplinary point of view, to enumerate the major challenges that lays ahead, and to create a strategy for a way forward.  A diverse group of physical theorists, electrical and computer engineers, and electronic device researchers with strong understanding of thermodynamics will participate in the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
