<AbstractNarration>Clean drinking water and sanitation are economic and policy issues that need to be addressed for sustainable growth of the US economy. A collaboration between University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Marquette University, the IUCRC for Water Equipment and Policy (WEP) provides innovative water technologies and processes to promote advancement of the water industry and conducts research to inform water policy makers. During Phase I and II, WEP has completed nearly 100 pre-competitive research projects in four thrust areas: water sensors, novel materials, innovative treatment systems, and water policy research. Through research, the WEP Center has provided innovative products and solutions to address industrial partners’ unmet/underserved needs in point-of-use technologies, emerging contaminants, sustainability, and energy conservation. In Phase III, the WEP Center aims to capitalize on past success, grow center research through new customer discovery, expand the research team through site additions, continuously refine the technology roadmap, explore new frontiers of water science for break-through technologies, and train a talented workforce to meet the nation’s needs in drinking water quality and wastewater management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) is the Lead Site of the WEP IUCRC. The UWM site’s research thrust areas include: (1) low-cost, real-time, flow and water quality sensors for smart water infrastructure applications and consumer products that reduces water leaks and prevent contamination; (2) novel materials for water applications, such as non-toxic biocide coatings, anti-fouling and anti-corrosion surfaces, and membrane and absorbent-based water filtration materials; and (3) point-of-use water treatment systems that remove or destroy contaminants in drinking water, such as arsenic, bacteria, and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Research activities at the UWM site will benefit WEP members through improved product performance while also improving STEM education, promoting entrepreneurship, attracting underrepresented students, and training the future workforce for the growing water industry. Unique resources and capabilities for collaborative research include the UWM Water Technology Accelerator which is dedicated to turning research activities into commercial products with advanced fabrication processes; the Laboratory of Nanotechnology for Sustainable Energy and Environment; and the UWM Composites Center for Advanced Materials Manufacturing which creates novel superhydrophobic and self-healing materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
