<AbstractNarration>Nanotechnology is increasingly finding uses in agriculture, medicine, energy, consumer products including electronics, environmental technologies, transportation products, and packaging. Nanotechnology deals with materials which are smaller than one-billionth of a meter at least in one dimension, and these materials are not necessarily benign in nature. There has been an effort by researchers and manufacturers to make nanomaterials sustainable with no or minimal impacts on the environment and its components. The 9th SNO Conference (November 12-13, 2020) will virtually bring together academicians, researchers, governmental workers, policy makers and the industry to discuss the gains so far and the opportunities and challenges in developing better and sustainable nanotechnology. Two leading organizations, Sustainable Nanotechnology Organization and the Nanotechnology, Occupational and Environmental Health Committee, are jointly organizing this conference for the open exchange of ideas and networking among people working in the areas of nano-based/nano-related devices and processes, green and advanced materials, education, regulations, epidemiology, fate and transport, medicine, health and safety, toxicology, risk assessment, agriculture, and water treatment. There will be a special session on the COVID-19 Pandemic focused on nano-scale phenomena of transmission and spread of the virus as well as its detection, capture, and inactivation. The aims of the conference are: (1) To provide a common platform for nanotechnology researchers for the open exchange of ideas to identify the next steps to make nanotechnology more sustainable; (2) To facilitate discussions on fundamental science and mechanisms to reduce the harmful impacts of nanotechnology on the ecosystem and (3) To create opportunities for networking among early-career researchers, young professionals, and students. The current project is aimed at recruiting early-career researchers, young professionals, and students from diverse backgrounds to the conference and encourage them to get more involved in sustainable nanotechnology related research and development, becoming the future leaders in sustainable nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 9th NANO Conference (November 12-13, 2020) will virtually bring together academicians, researchers, governmental workers, policy makers and the industry to discuss the gains so far and the opportunities and challenges in developing better and sustainable nanotechnology. The conference will play a unique role by focusing on sustainable nanotechnology. There are few forums which facilitate focused discussion on this topic. Sustainability of nanomaterials from the ecosystem perspective is the main focus of this conference. The conference will facilitate open dialogue on sustainable nanotechnology focused on the implications and applications. One of the major foci of the conference will be the risk assessment and mitigation strategies as new nanotechnology devices are developed. The special session on coronaviruses (100-200 nm in diameter) will focus on the spread and transmission pathways which involve nanoscale transport processes (e.g., diffusion, attachment onto droplets). The detection, capture, and inactivation of the viruses are heavily dependent on interfacial interactions at the nanoscale. The plenary and technical session presentations will highlight the latest developments and opportunities. The technical sessions on rapid nanosensing for viruses, epidemiology, fate and transport, and nanomedicines will complement the COVID-19 session. The session on nano agriculture will encompass the global agricultural scenario beyond the green revolution to make agriculture more efficient, resilient, and sustainable. The dedicated session on water treatment and remediation will cover emerging issues on detection and removal of emerging contaminants, disinfection byproducts, and pathogens. The nanotechnology related regulations and governance session will include state-of-the-art and future strategies. There will be sessions to discuss safe, responsible, and sustainable development and deployment of nano and advanced materials including nanomedicines. The poster session will offer interaction and networking opportunities to early-career researchers, young professionals, and students. In addition, there will be a NanoPitch Contest for students to help them develop the soft skill of presenting complex nanotechnology research to a general audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
