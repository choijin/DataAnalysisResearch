<AbstractNarration>The Arctic is warming at twice the global average rate and is projected to experience among the highest rates of precipitation increase. Locally, the Arctic hydrological cycle is an underlying control on ice sheet mass balance, ecosystems, and freshwater and radiative balances, and thereby influences feedbacks in global oceanic and atmospheric circulation. This project aims to develop a synthesis of past hydroclimate variability in the Arctic region during the Holocene with the goal to fill critical gaps in understanding of the mechanisms controlling Arctic moisture availability. Specifically, the researcher will 1) Contribute to curation of Arctic Holocene moisture-sensitive record database, 2) Apply mechanistic-based models to constrain the magnitude of precipitation changes inferred from past climate records, and 3) Synthesize moisture-sensitive records for comparison with a global Holocene climate reconstruction and climate model simulations. The data synthesis and data-model comparison will be used to test the following hypotheses:&lt;br/&gt;1. Arctic moisture-sensitive data demonstrate meridionally-coherent millennial-scale Holocene variability. Support for this hypothesis would suggest Arctic moisture availability was sensitive to large-scale meridional atmospheric transport patterns, whereas low spatial coherence among proxy records along lines of meridian could indicate local processes drove spatial variability. &lt;br/&gt;2. In the early- to mid-Holocene, a weakened and more meandering westerly jet reduced moisture transport to the North Atlantic region, while promoting strong moisture transport to eastern Beringia and other Arctic sectors. Reduced mid-latitude cyclone activity linked to a weakened westerly jet may have contributed to North American aridity in the early to mid-Holocene. In the Arctic, this mechanism would likely reduce cyclone activity in the eastern North Atlantic region, while enhancing moisture advection to Eurasia and the western Arctic. Alternatively, similar changes across all sectors may imply dynamic impacts were trivial in comparison to the thermodynamic impact of increased atmospheric moisture capacity in a warmer atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts include a greater understanding of long-term spatiotemporal variability of hydroclimate and moisture variability in the arctic region and their link to mid- to high-latitude atmospheric teleconnections. The project will produce a curated database of moisture sensitive records in the arctic region covering the Holocene which will be made publicly available. Other Broader Impacts include the development of educational materials in partnership with the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals (Northern Arizona University), creating a module for a workshop for k-12 and tribal college teachers in Northern Arizona on climate change and variability with social and human implications. The research and outreach activities will provide scientific and professional development for an early career scientist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
