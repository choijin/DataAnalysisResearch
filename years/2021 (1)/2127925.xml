<AbstractNarration>This grant will focus on gaining a fundamental understanding of embedded fiber networks and creating the tools necessary to characterize their behavior from limited available measurements. Embedded fiber networks are ubiquitous in nature, from the extracellular matrix surrounding biological cells, to branching blood vessels embedded in organs, to mothâ€™s cocoons. Understanding these systems is important because these systems are the fundamental mechanical building blocks of many types of natural and engineered biological tissue, and bio-inspired advanced materials. It is important not only to understand these systems, but also to be able to measure their mechanical behavior in a non-destructive manner so that advances in understanding can be applied in the real world. This research project will synthesize experiments, theory-based computational models, and data-driven computational models to elucidate the fundamental relationship between embedding matrix properties, fiber properties, and fiber network properties for soft embedded fiber networks undergoing large deformation. In addition, this research project will develop computational capabilities for the analysis of these systems where severely limited image-based data is used to predict both structural properties and characterize mechanical behavior. The research will be complemented by disseminating relevant data and code under open source licenses, and releasing online modules focused on applying machine learning to mechanics research. The research will also be complemented by establishing educational outreach programs at the middle school and high school levels that focus on bringing STEM education to underserved populations.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goal of this research is to define fundamental structure-function relationships in soft embedded fiber networks undergoing large deformation and create the tools needed to analyze these systems given limited available imaging data. Critically, it is necessary to develop tools to evaluate these systems non-destructively because one of their most important applications is in living systems. Thus, the research objectives of this project include: (i) curating an experimental dataset and implementing and validating a computational model of three-dimensional embedded fiber networks undergoing large deformation; (ii) understanding and delineating the different mechanical regimes of embedded fiber networks undergoing large deformation; (iii) establishing and testing a machine learning framework to rapidly and non-destructively analyze embedded fiber networks from imperfectly-paired images taken on the discrete fiber scale. The project will allow the PIs to advance the knowledge base at the interface of applied mechanics, computational mechanics, and machine learning, and establish their long-term careers in the mechanics of materials and structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
