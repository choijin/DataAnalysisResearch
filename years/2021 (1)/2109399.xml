<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The project seeks to understand the connection between the structure of ant hairs and cuticles and their thermal and optical properties in variable environmental conditions. Variation in the thermal properties of ant cuticles and hairs may allow them to heat up in cool environments and stay cool in hot environments. Patterns in thermal and optical properties will be analyzed across species along an elevational gradient in the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona, and within species across latitudinal gradients in North America (from Canada to Mexico). As the first survey of biodiversity in cuticular structures with unique thermal/optical properties, this project will inspire engineering applications for global thermal and energy challenges (solar energy capture, radiative cooling, biomimetic materials, etc.). The Fellow will also develop curricular materials about thermal properties of living organisms to be used in high-need Los Angeles schools and published in peer-reviewed education journals as well as hosting culturally responsive mentoring and grant writing workshops for minoritized students at the host institutions and national conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow will use scanning electron microscopy to analyze the microstructure of ant cuticles and hairs, using both existing museum collections of widespread North American ant species and specimens collected by the Fellow along an elevational gradient at the Southwestern Research Station in Arizona. Fourier-transform infrared thermography, reflectance spectrophotometry (from ultraviolet to mid-infrared), and finite element method modeling will be used to analyze the thermal and optical properties of ant cuticular structures. Environmental data collected using local weather stations will be used to understand if solar radiation and temperature can predict the optical/thermal properties of ant cuticular structures. The research is integrated with an education plan aimed at increasing participation of underrepresented groups by 1) developing K-12 lesson plans in partnership with Noyce Scholars and Master Teacher Fellows to be used in high-need Los Angeles schools, and 2) publishing these plans in peer-reviewed and open access education journals. In addition, the Fellow will expand culturally responsive mentoring programs for minoritized postdocs and students at California State University Dominguez Hills and University of Southern California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
