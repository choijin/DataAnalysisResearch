<AbstractNarration>The Engineering Biology Research Consortium (EBRC) brings together an inclusive community of people from academia, government, and industry to advance the field of engineering biology to address national and global needs. Engineering biology combines the knowledge, processes, and tools of biology with the principles of engineering to build organisms and systems, enable technological innovation and scientific discovery, and develop new products, services, and economic growth. EBRC facilitates collaborations between researchers and leaders with diverse expertise to tackle our nation’s most critical challenges, including crises in climate, food and water, energy, and health. Through EBRC’s efforts, experts work together to identify the concrete steps needed to achieve technical progress and breakthroughs, while actively incorporating policy, education, ethics, equity, and security considerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this project, researchers and innovators in engineering biology create forward-looking technical roadmaps that describe the research advances necessary to achieve progress toward solving significant societal challenges. EBRC’s policy and international engagement efforts provide information and insight to inform and advise policymakers to help them anticipate issues and make decisions based on a clear understanding of the engineering biology research enterprise. EBRC works to identify and address ethical, regulatory, and policy issues in ways that benefit the advancement of research while serving society responsibly. EBRC’s focus on education fosters opportunities for learning about and engaging with engineering biology to support students and develop the next generation of engineering biology leaders. The security focus builds a research culture that incorporates consideration of security throughout every stage of the research lifecycle to reduce risk while promoting benefits. Integrated into all of its efforts, EBRC endeavors to build a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community that will accelerate innovation and grow a strong, sustainable bioeconomy that benefits all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
