<AbstractNarration>This grant supports research to develop an efficient and easy-to-implement numerical framework that allows for parametric studies of the mechanics of elastic rod networks and promotes the design of novel elastic networks with target geometries and mechanical properties. Due to their light weight and high flexibility, networks consisting of thin elastic rods or strips can morph into 3D surface structures through customized design of their joints and rods. They can find wide applications at different scales, ranging from metamaterials, soft robots and deployable space antennas, to long-span deployable shelters. Understanding and designing their mechanical behavior is challenging due to their large deformations, multi stability, and intricate bifurcations. This research project will develop a numerical framework that describes their static equilibria and bifurcations and a design method that assembles network cells into functional morphing systems for mechanical, civil, and biomedical engineering as well as architectural applications, promoting the advancement of science, national health, prosperity, and welfare. The project will also provide research experiences for high school and undergraduate students through summer programs and research training for one graduate student, and outreach to the K-12 community through a science fair and exhibition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the research is to design materials and structures capable of controlling their shapes and mechanical properties by tailoring the topology, connections, and rod design of elastic networks. The research sub-tasks include: (a) derivation of a general numerical framework for conducting parametric studies of the mechanics of elastic rod networks, (b) development of a conjugate point test that determines the stability of the equilibria obtained in (a), and (c) construction of functional elastic networks from elastic polygonal cells used as building blocks. This work relates to research topics in soft matter and nonlinear mechanics, including the numerical modeling and design of deployable lightweight architectural and space structures, flexible soft robotic arms, and mechanical morphable metamaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
