<AbstractNarration>Future transportation is promising safer and more efficient traveling via connected intelligence among vehicles as well as with the transportation infrastructure.  At the same time, travelers can also be relieved from tedious driving and use vehicles as offices or entertainment rooms on the move. Essential to all these is a reliable and resilient Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Given the unique transportation environment, a satisfactorily functioning IoV is confronted with many challenges. For example, data services for transportation safety/efficiency and/or traveler convenience/comfort are often very sensitive to delays and require large bandwidth. The vehicular environments are also filled with various communication services as well as active sensing devices, which can potentially cause interferences to each other. In addition, the high mobility inherent to transportation and fluctuation of the transportation information exchange depending on the specific traffic scenario can both lead to fast-changing and possibly unpredictable dynamics. To address these challenges, this project organizes collaborative efforts to enhance spectrum utilization, sharing and management in IoV. The project will promote the interactions among multi-disciplinary experts such as electromagnetic waves, electronics, signal processing and wireless communications to create wireless innovations at different network layers. The developed technologies will provide valuable tools for foundational science and engineering research and promote societal embracing of the emergent cognitive IoV technologies. The project also has an integrated education plan that aims to prepare the workforce to address future challenges of spectrum utilization and wireless communications, while promoting and embracing diversity in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop a cognitive IoV framework with simultaneous sensing and communications via a novel dynamic RF front end. Targeting the aforementioned challenges, the proposed IoV research has three distinctive features. First, the proposed research is centered at simultaneous communications and sensing. Based on a dynamic RF front end that is innovatively designed to facilitate full duplex modes, communications and simultaneous monitoring of multiple spectrum bands with tunable granularity become possible. Secondly, the resultant IoV framework is cognitive in two counts: i) cognitive in the spectrum environment - the spectrum sensing information from devices equipped with the dynamic RF front end is used to develop algorithms to learn and track the spatiotemporal radio tomography with quantifiable uncertainty; and ii) cognitive in the physical environment - with judiciously designed waveforms that enable simultaneous communications and active physical environment sensing, the acquired information will be leveraged to enhance communications. Last but not least, the proposed cognitive IoV framework is dynamics-ready via hardware, architecture, and algorithm design: the dynamic RF front end boasts real-time tuning and control capability, the network architecture incorporates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to mobilize on-demand support for transportation/traveler data service hotspots, and reinforcement learning algorithms developed to achieve closed-loop control and management of spectrum resources will remain robust when the dynamics are unknown or unpredictable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
