<AbstractNarration>Semidefinite and polynomial optimization (SDO and PO) are topics of great theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;practical interest, with numerous applications in theoretical computer science, control theory,&lt;br/&gt;quantum information sciences, and statistics. The steady advances in efficient interior-point&lt;br/&gt;methods (IPMs) lends credence to the impactful role of SDO, as an emerging computational&lt;br/&gt;tool, in PO and quantum computing. The complexity of SDO and PO is well-known in the&lt;br/&gt;bit model of computation: there is no polynomial-time algorithm yet to find an exact optimal&lt;br/&gt;solution of these classes of optimization problems. However, even for an approximate solution,&lt;br/&gt;there are pathological instances that IPMs or relaxation hierarchies for PO fail to solve.&lt;br/&gt;In view of this challenge, the need to investigate the complexity through a broader spectrum&lt;br/&gt;of complexity measures is obvious. Such a novel approach allows for a finer classification of&lt;br/&gt;instances with high complexity. This project pursues the above goal by addressing several&lt;br/&gt;key questions on the complexity of SDO and PO, through the lens of real algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will enhance understanding of the complexity in SDO and PO&lt;br/&gt;and have the potential to impact other disciplines, including quantum information sciences,&lt;br/&gt;where the emerging area of quantum IPMs with their unique advantages offer unprecedented&lt;br/&gt;intellectual challenges. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of this project, the investigators will&lt;br/&gt;train graduate students and organize meetings by inviting experts as well as young researchers&lt;br/&gt;for fruitful interaction amongst the optimization and real algebraic geometry communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the project focuses on quantitative and algorithmic questions about the complexity&lt;br/&gt;of SDO from the perspective of the central path. Since IPMs operate in a neighborhood&lt;br/&gt;of the central path, their efficiency is influenced by the analytic and algebro-geometric properties&lt;br/&gt;of the central path. The investigators explore several complexity measures based on the&lt;br/&gt;degree, worst-case convergence rate, and geometric curvature of the central path for regular&lt;br/&gt;and near to ill-posed instances. By means of these complexity measures, in particular, one&lt;br/&gt;can quantitatively justify the complexity of IPMs on instances whose special structures exhibit&lt;br/&gt;failure of the strict complementarity condition. The second part of the project investigates the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of PO through error bounds and the topology of the feasible set. Unlike IPMs, the&lt;br/&gt;moment/sum of squares approach only deals with a sequence of objective values (rather than&lt;br/&gt;solutions), which may not adequately reflect the progress toward the optimal set. As a result,&lt;br/&gt;the current complexity bounds from the moment/sum of squares approach are purely algebraic&lt;br/&gt;with no reliance on the topology/geometry of the feasible set. The investigators will explore&lt;br/&gt;topology based complexity measures which allow for the inclusion of the Betti numbers of the&lt;br/&gt;feasible set and thus enhance PO solvers with more precise complexity estimates. That will&lt;br/&gt;rigorously explain why iterative algorithms are more likely to stop at a local optima of a PO&lt;br/&gt;problem, as the number of connected components or the holes in the feasible set increases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
