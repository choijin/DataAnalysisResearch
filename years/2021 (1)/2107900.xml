<AbstractNarration>With the support of the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Eriks Rozners of SUNY Binghamton and James A. MacKay of Elizabethtown College are studying new methods for molecular recognition of biologically significant non-coding ribonucleic acid (RNA). With the onset of biochemical technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 for DNA-editing, and the challenges associated with emerging pathogens such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus (novel coronavirus), RNA (ribonucleic acid) chemistry and biochemistry is at the forefront of research.  We know that less than 2% of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) encodes for functional proteins, while over 70% of DNA is transcribed into RNA. The non-coding RNAs play important yet not fully understood roles in regulation of biological processes. Selective recognition, imaging, and functional regulation of such RNAs will be highly useful for fundamental science and practical applications in biotechnology. This project aims to establish new ways of targeting double-stranded RNA, which has been a long-standing problem and practical limitation in RNA biochemistry. Importantly, the project will be broader in its impact through expanding interdisciplinary collaborative research across traditional institutional boundaries and fostering the training and development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce through research and mentoring activities.   The collaboration continues a 5 year partnership that has established a bridge for Elizabethtown College (a primarily undergraduate institution) students, especially women, minorities, and first generation college students for transitioning from undergraduate studies to advanced graduate studies at a research university. Work will contine toward improving STEM education of undergraduate and graduate students, and offer unique training for post-graduate students interested in exploring careers at a primarily undergraduate institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of sequence-selective RNA binders is important for understanding the biochemistry of non-coding RNAs and may strongly impact fundamental RNA biology and practical applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology. This collaborative study will develop new derivatives of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) that are potentially capable of recognizing the entire Hoogsteen face of Watson-Crick base pairs of double-stranded RNA. This is to be achieved by development of new nucleobases and binding modes that place two anti-parallel PNA strands in the major groove, each hydrogen-bonding to their respective RNA strand. The properties of the new PNAs will be optimized using synthetic organic chemistry to promote recognition of diverse sequences of double-stranded RNA, which has the potential to solve a long-standing problem in molecular recognition of RNA. If successful, this research will enable a variety of applications, such as, imaging and functional control of regulatory RNA, designer riboswitches for synthetic biology, and inhibition of biologically important RNA for fundamental studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
