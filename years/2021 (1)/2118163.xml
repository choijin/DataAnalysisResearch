<AbstractNarration>A proposal is made to fund instrumentation on the R/V Marcus Langseth, a 235â€™ Global seismic vessel with general oceanographic capabilities. The vessel is owned by Columbia University and operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University under a cooperative agreement with NSF. The Langseth is unique in the Academic Fleet in that it provides a unique combination of capabilities for imaging the oceans, the seafloor and the solid earth beneath the sea. It is the only vessel in the world dedicated to academic research that is capable of conducting 3D seismic surveys as well as extended offset 2D surveys. The tuned, linear source array, consisting of up to 36 air-guns, with a total capacity of 6,600 cu in is also unique asset of this vessel.&lt;br/&gt;All of the requested equipment in this proposal is for upgrading existing systems. Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;1) 2x Sercel Seal Radial Vibration Isolation Module (RVIM) $46,620 &lt;br/&gt;2) Concept Systems Orca Navigation System Hardware Upgrade $28,184 &lt;br/&gt;3) FGPS Seispos and P1Tools Software $27,500 &lt;br/&gt;4) 2x Sercel Seal Tail Swivels $25,696 &lt;br/&gt;       $128,000 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2021 Oceanographic Instrumentation award provided support for significantly enhanced and industry standard new multi-channel seismic (MCS) software systems and MCS component upgrades for our towed in water hydrophone streamer.  The term Multichannel refers to the fact that the towed hydropone streamers contain hundreds of channels that are recording data. In combination, these upgrades improved overall reliability and data quality with lower costs and risk of equipment failures to our operations of all MCS projects.  The Radial Vibration Isolation Modules (RVIMs) were acquired as critical spares to continue to adequately support the use of really long (6 to 9miles) offset hydrophone streamers for MCS data acquisition that have become more commonly used on new science projects.  These isolation modules provide a "shock absorber" between the towed streamer and the vessel but can be single points of failure that cannot be repaired so having units onboard ready to replace one is a necessity as these ong offset streamers can put additional stresses on MCS components.  Two new Seal Sentinel Tail Swivels that were also acquired with this award are another critical and required streamer component necessary to maintain communications and operations with the tail buoy of a MCS hydrophone streamer. These new swivels allowed us to replace older units and significantly improve the quality of the positioning of MCS data. The vessel position at head of the streamer and the tailbuoy at the end of the hydrophone streamer anchor the navigation positioning  for the MCS system on both ends. So without the tailbuoy, the end  of the streamer will only be positioned with nominal  estimated measurements, decreasing the quality of the recorded data.  During 2021, we replaced the existing navigation and positioning processing software (SPRINT) that had long been in use with an alternative, FGPS?s software package called Seispos, along with the another FGPS product, P1 Tools, software utility package that improves and enhances the data quality in multi-channel seismic projects at a lower cost.  The software can be used onshore as well for after the cruise for processing/editing that allow LDEO to support post-cruise questions on data positioning.  Lastly, we have acquired the computer server hardware necessary to implement the next generation navigation system software from Concept Systems, ORCA, which is now the industry standard replacing an older Concept Systems package Spectra. All the MCS data collected relies on the accuracy of the navigational data.  Overall, these upgrades improves both the reliability of the in water components of our data collection system as well as the processsing/navigation of the MCS data which all have a positive impact on the final data collected for the science community that use the R/V Langseth.
