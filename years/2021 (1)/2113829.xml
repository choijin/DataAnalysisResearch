<AbstractNarration>The Math For All in New Orleans Conference will be held virtually on March 5-7, 2021. The overall goal of the Math For All in New Orleans conference is to increase diversity in mathematics and expose mathematicians in the Greater New Orleans area to the wide variety of research available at nearby institutions. Due to this yearâ€™s virtual format, many participants will be also attending from different parts of the United States. The conference will include four broadly accessible plenary talks, six contributed research sessions, a diverse career panel, two workshops and a poster session. Through these avenues, the conference is designed to engage undergraduate and graduate students into a community of mathematics and prepare them for future careers in the field. The plenary speakers and panelists come from around the United States, representing multiple ethnic and mathematical backgrounds, giving students visible role models in industry and academia with whom they can identify. Participants will have the opportunity to present research and attend professional development workshops in a welcoming and inclusive environment.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference will strive to make mathematics more accessible to underrepresented groups, ultimately increasing diversity in the field. The conference will have participants representing HBCUs and smaller universities in the New Orleans area, with the goal of exposing them to a broad mathematical research community. These aspects of the conference help students be better prepared to transition to research-focused environments, which will increase retention of underrepresented groups in the mathematical fields. The conference will also stimulate discussions amongst faculty on inclusive pedagogy aimed at advancing students from underrepresented groups. The organizing committee is dedicated to amplifying the voices of underrepresented minorities in mathematics by highlighting the importance of representation, allyship, and individual actions towards changing systemic forms of oppression in mathematics. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Conference Website: http://www.math.tulane.edu/mathforallnola&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The Math For All in New Orleans conference encourages interaction between the higher education institutions of New Orleans and surrounding areas, exposing participants to a wide variety of research areas. The conference also creates a space where math faculty are exposed to new research-based techniques in math education, specifically new pedagogical methods which are aimed at making mathematics more accessible and attractive to underrepresented groups. Additionally, there was a career panel with panelists from both industry and academia to inform students about potential career paths. The conference also included two professional development workshops intended for participants at different stages in their career. Prior to the conference, we held virtual workshops for students which provided resources and help students develop presentation skills.  Broader Impacts:  The overall goal of the Math For All in New Orleans conference is to increase diversity in mathematics. The conference had a diverse group of speakers and panelists, giving students visible role models in industry and academia with whom they can identify. Math For All provides students from underrepresented groups with professional development opportunities, as well as a welcoming environment in which to develop career skills. The conference attracts talented mathematicians from HBCUs and smaller universities in the local community, and exposes them to a broad mathematical research community. These aspects of the conference help students be better prepared to transition toresearch-focused environments, which will increase retention of underrepresented groups in themathematical fields.     Outcomes:  We had a two-day conference in March 2021 virtually with 4 main speakers, 18 research talks, a panel discussion and a poster session with 17 presenters, 2 workshops, as well as many networking activities. One of the main objectives of the conference was creating an open and welcoming environment to learn mathematics. We collected participant feedback after the conference which showed a 100% of respondants felt welcomed and included throughout the conference.  The conference had participants from more than 64 different instutions around the United States and the world. Participants who attended the ?Create your personal website? workshop develop their own professional website. Some participants reported having new collaborators and mentors, finding new research interests, as well as 'a renewed interest and confidence in math'.   Two virtual poster session workshop (previous to the conference) where participants learned how to create their own scientific poster. The videos made for this poster workshop are available online for widely available use. A workshop named ?Create your personal website? in which participants created their own professional website. A workshop named ?Finding your mathematical passion: What comes after college?? where participants learned about different career possibilities for math majors. A panel discussion on career paths where panelists from different stages in their careers answered questions from the audience. The research talks and the poster session allowed graduate and undergraduate students to showcase their research. Many of these students reported this was their first talk or presentation. The networking sessions 'Conversations with mathematicians' facilitated interaction and networking between mathematicians at different stages in their career.
