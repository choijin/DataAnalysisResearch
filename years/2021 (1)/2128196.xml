<AbstractNarration>The flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, encompass the most successful living group of land plants, and include all of our major domesticated crop plants. For these reasons, understanding the evolution, development, genetics and physiology of diverse angiosperms is a major focus for plant biologists. However, successful pursuit of such research programs requires the existence of a specific set of investigative tools, particularly a well-annotated genome sequence and methods that allow for the stable insertion of experimental DNA, a process known as transformation. This project will use cutting-edge approaches to both optimize effective transformation protocols and improve the genomic resources available for a set of promising experimental angiosperm systems that represent poorly understood lineages of the flowering plant tree of life. The generation of these tools in the selected model systems has considerable potential to improve the ability to conduct comparative studies of plant biology. Moreover, dissemination of protocols developed will create a template that can be applied by other researchers to even more angiosperm models, thereby having an even broader positive impact on the field. With respect to outreach and training, activities include creating a YouTube-based video explaining how modern plant transformation works, supporting diverse training opportunities at all academic career levels from undergraduate students through postdoctoral fellows, and developing undergraduate course resources. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Recently, major breakthroughs in several species have shown that overexpressing genes that regulate morphogenesis, specifically Baby Boom/Wuschel2 (Bbm/Wus2) and Growth Regulating Factor 4/GRF Interacting Factor 1 (GRF4-GIF1), results in significantly enhanced plant transformation and regeneration. This project strives to adapt these methods on a set of diverse angiosperms, targeted because they occupy the phylogenetic gap between well-studied crop and model systems. The primary target taxa are Aquilegia coerulea (columbine, Ranunculaceae); Spirodela polyrhiza line 7498 (duckweed, Araceae); and Asparagus officinalis (asparagus, Asparagaceae). If time allows, efforts will also extend to Nymphaea thermarum (Rwandan waterlily, Nymphaeaceae) and Aristolochia fimbriata (dutchmanâ€™s pipe, Aristolochiaceae) to further circumscribe the phylogenetic backbone of the angiosperms. As a complement to the development of these key tools, the project will use next-generation sequencing to improve genomic resources for the three primary model taxa, particularly in regard to the annotation of small RNA producing loci. Education on and distribution of the developed methodologies and resources are a key component of the project. Gene constructs will be deposited in nonprofit global plasmid repositories and protocol videos will be published to enable users unfamiliar with transformation to successfully repeat the process. All sequencing data will be made publicly available as soon as completed with no embargo. Additionally, funds will support 1) the training of undergraduate researchers, leveraging already successful resources such as the NSF-supported Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) summer programs and 2) the creation of public science communication videos to improve public understanding of transgenic approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
