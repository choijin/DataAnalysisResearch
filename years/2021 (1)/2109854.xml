<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Species survival depends upon offspring surviving to adulthood, to pass their genes unto the next generation. Current research demonstrates maternally derived egg nutritive content such as some fats and proteins, can impact offspring survival. Most importantly, studies show survival is profoundly influenced by altered egg nutritive content. What remains unclear however, are the genes responsible for egg content and survivorship, and whether there is a genetic correlation between egg size and quality and offspring viability. This research proposes to successfully identify the genetic relationship between egg size, egg quality, and offspring. Identifying genes that control these traits is important for understanding fundamental evolutionary and ecological questions regarding the importance of egg quality and its influence on species survival. Furthermore, findings from this proposed study can be used as building blocks to better understand human related reproductive difficulties. This researchâ€™s broader impact initiative would provide underrepresented undergraduate students the opportunity to conduct scientific research and participate in other science related workshops and meetings. This initiative was developed to address current low numbers of underrepresented individuals in STEM fields. Participants will be exposed to a variety of training opportunities, while acquiring technical experience and mentorship alongside the fellow, a Black, female scientist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study combines QTL mapping with classical genetics and evolutionary and re-sequencing approaches, allowing for the comprehensive discovery of genes influencing complex egg traits critical for fitness. This research will test the hypothesis that there are various and large effects on genomic loci that regulate egg content, and that egg content, size, and offspring viability have a positive linear genetic relationship. The postdoctoral level initiative attached to the project is developed to establish the first university-wide Black postdoctoral organization, Blacks Supporting Blacks in STEM (BSBS). Member scholars of this organization will build a robust relationship with local communities, establish networking platforms, and create mentor/mentee pipelines to provide social support and possible research collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
