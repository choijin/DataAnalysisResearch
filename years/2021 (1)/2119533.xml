<AbstractNarration>The increasing demand for water, food, and energy resources in the face of a changing climate and continued population growth make these vital resources increasingly scarce. Food deserts are areas with limited access to nutritious and affordable food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported in 2010 that 23.5 million people in the U.S. live in food deserts. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #2 Zero Hunger is to “end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture”. The workshop will bring together diverse entities and groups to identify strategies and deliverables that are ready for acceleration to maintain the food supply chain in response to rapidly changing environmental stressors such as limited water and energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop aims to advance a technical framework for the acceleration of use-inspired convergence research in this area of national importance by bringing together practitioners from public and private institutions including Minority Serving Institutions of higher education, industrial and academic research organizations, and other stakeholders. An ecosystem approach to re-envision our science and technology research approach to sustainable food supply is the main focus of the workshop and seeks to identify a path to sustainable systems that enable food security in extreme environments and food deserts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Deserts cover about 33 percent of the world's land area, and are living environments challenged with resource degradation and desertification. The increasing demand for water, food and energy resources in the face of a changing climate and continued population growth, make these vital resources increasingly scarce. Moreover, changes in climate, land use, resource consumption, and population growth are pushing some regions to no longer be able to support regional food requirements, contributing to large-scale human migration in parts of the world. Food deserts, in a parallel concept to physical deserts, are areas with limited access to nutritious and affordable food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported in 2010 that 23.5 million people in the U.S. live in food deserts. The United Nation?s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Zero Hunger is to ?end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture?. By 2050, a global population of 9 billion will increase water demands by 55%, energy needs by 80%, and food demands by 60%. The world?s population is expected to increase from 3 billion in the late 1960?s to almost 11 billion by 2050, representing an increase in agricultural demand representing an urgency in the need to produce more food to enable food security. Total food consumption globally, is projected to increase.</p> <p>We propose NSF Convergence Accelerator tracks that are ready for accelerated convergence, and scalable solutions for sustainable systems development enabling food security in extreme environments and food deserts, including arid regions, for societal impact, employing a convergence of food, energy, water and systems. This recommendation for NSF Convergence Accelerator tracks comes out of this NSF C-Accel workshop, Sustainable Systems Enabling Food Security in Extreme Environments and Food Deserts employing a Convergence of Food, Energy, Water and Systems for Societal Impact, addressing key questions including: How can we realize a sustainable, food secure society, in extreme environments and food deserts, employing an accelerated convergence of food, energy, water and systems technologies? How do we collaborate with policy makers and other leaders to identify politically viable and socially acceptable solutions? How can we incorporate education, re-education and workforce development for jobs creation? How do we converge at an accelerated pace to accomplish the ideas, suggestions and recommendation?</p> <p>The workshop occurred virtually, May 19-21, 2021 and featured 24 world-renowned expert speakers, 15<sup>+</sup> organizing committee members, 1,060 participant registrations from academia, industry, government, NGOs, foundations and others, 422 registrations in 15 different breakout sessions, interactive and integration sessions, and 83 lightning talks. Registrations were closed early due to the large demand, and many requests to register and participate continued after the closed registration. Interest was also indicated by the website?s Google analytics showing almost 6,000 website users worldwide. A word cloud highlights the workshop?s participants? disciplines, showing both representative multiple disciplines and different stakeholders. A slack community was created with 183 active members who exchanged 1,560 messages.</p> <p>In this workshop, we identified tracks that are ready for accelerated convergence, and scalable solutions for sustainable systems development enabling food security in extreme environments and food deserts, including arid regions, for societal impact, employing a convergence of food, energy, water and systems. Also, members in the Slack community formed as a part of this workshop were asked to identify track topics and consider teaming arrangements. The following tracks and sub-tracks were identified in this workshop.</p> <p><strong>Track #1 - Assessing, Modeling and Prediction of Food Deserts, Systems and Security in Extreme Environments and Food Deserts:</strong></p> <p>Convergent teams will assess, model and predict food systems and security in extreme environments and food deserts using climate data, population growth and regional resource diminishment. Teams will use existing datasets to build upon, and using Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to build predictive models and forecasting algorithms, to forecast future food deserts and sustainable systems that will enable food security in different food insecure extreme regions.</p> <p>Convergent teams will develop a plan for workforce development, training, re-training, and integrated education to promote sustainable systems enabling food security and fool literacy. Coordinated service learning for design, implementation and evaluation should be incorporated in the plan.</p> <p><strong>Track #2 - Sustainable Food Production Systems at the Intersection of Food, Energy, Water, and Systems for Societal Impact:</strong></p> <p>Convergent teams will develop a plan for sustainable food production systems at the intersection of food, energy, water and systems, including models and prototypes.
