<AbstractNarration>Technical Description: This research project is to investigate layer-structured (BN)x(C2)1-x semiconductor alloys with an emphasis on materials growth by metal organic chemical vapor deposition, basic material properties studies, and exploration of potential applications. (BN)x(C2)1-x semiconductor alloys represent a unique material system for exploring the evolution of optical properties from far infrared to deep ultraviolet and transport properties from insulator to semi-metal in the same crystal structure. Research tasks include the probe of fundamental optical and electrical properties such as the energy bandgap and its variation with temperature and alloy composition, free, bound, and localized exciton transitions, impurity energy levels, feasibility of n- and p-type conductivity control, and carrier transport properties.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: The project trains postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of novel materials growth, characterization, nano-fabrication techniques and material/device processing using the state-of-the-art facilities. (BN)x(C2)1-x material system has the potential to complement nitride wide-bandgap semiconductors and carbon based nanostructured materials and enable the realization of chip-scale multi-spectral light sources and detectors and full spectral multi-junction solar cells. Ultimately, the materials developed could have a major impact on energy, medical, security, and communication.</AbstractNarration>
