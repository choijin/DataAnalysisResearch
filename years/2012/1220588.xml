<AbstractNarration>In this project a team of scientists from the University of California, Davis, in collaboration with researchers at the United States Geological Survey, will use geologic observations to measure the history of fault slip along the Mojave section of the San Andreas fault in Southern California (from Frazier Mountain in the northwest to Cajon Creek in the southeast). The primary goal of the project is to test the hypothesis that the average rate of motion along the Mojave section of the San Andreas fault alternated between periods of fast slip (approximately 45 mm/yr) at 1100-4500 and 6500-8000 yr ago and periods of slower motion (approximately 16 mm/yr) at 0-1100, 4500-6500, and 8000-10000 years ago. To do so, the research team will determine the history of fault motion along this section of the San Andreas fault over the last ten thousand years by measuring the ages and offsets of ten different faulted stream channels. Because each channel formed at a different time, each channel records a different period of fault motion. In particular, each channel experienced a different number of ancient earthquakes and thus accumulated a different amount of fault slip, with offsets ranging from 26 (+4/-3) m for the youngest channel to 261 (+46/-26) m for the oldest. To precisely measure the total age and total offset for each of these channels, and thus measure the slip rate since the channel formed, the research team will use careful field mapping, analysis of detailed topographic measurements, and excavations at each site. These age and offset data will then be analyzed to determine both the slip rate as averaged over the last ten thousand years and the extent to which there were statistically significant faster and slower pulses of slip within that period of motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general, active faults remain locked until they suddenly break and slip to produce an earthquake. Such motion is roughly analogous to that of a car in stop-and-go traffic. During earthquake ruptures, surface features such as stream channels or roads are often cut and displaced by the rapid fault motion. Thus, repeated earthquakes over time can result in both an accumulation of surface displacements along the fault and a time-averaged slip rate. Because faster-moving faults will produce more frequent earthquakes, determining the average rates at which faults slip is of fundamental importance for evaluating their earthquake hazards. Geological records of ancient earthquakes in the Los Angeles Basin and Eastern California Shear Zone appear to indicate that fault activity has rapidly switched between the Mojave section of the San Andreas fault and the Eastern California Shear zone, as well as other fault systems in southern California. This model has important implications regarding seismic hazards and if correct, would significantly revise understanding of the mechanical behavior of major continental fault systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Because faster-moving faults produce more frequent earthquakes, determining the rates at which faults slip is of fundamental importance for evaluating their earthquake hazards. Active faults typically remain locked until they suddenly break and slip to produce an earthquake. During such ruptures, topographic features such as stream channels can be cut and displaced by the rapid fault motion, with repeated ruptures resulting in an accumulation of surface displacements along the fault.  This process makes it possible to determine the average rate and history of slip along an active fault over periods of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years by measuring the ages and offsets of the displaced topographic features. Such data recording the geologic history of fault slip are essential for comparison against measurements of slip rate made over decades to hundreds of years.  The Mojave section of the San Andreas Fault in southern California lies within 50 km of metropolitan Los Angeles and extends from Frazier Mountain in the northwest to Cajon Creek in the southeast.  Despite its importance as a known earthquake source in the region, the slip rate along this fault has been disputed, with rates derived from dating offset geologic markers formed over the last 400 thousand years generally found to be about double those determined from survey measurements made over the last few decades (e.g., ~30 mm/yr vs. ~16 mm/yr).  In this project, scientists at the University of California, Davis and the United States Geological Survey investigated the geologic record of fault slip along the Mojave San Andreas over the last 0.5 to 40 thousand years by measuring the ages and offsets of multiple faulted stream channels. Each channel formed at a different time and thus records a different period of fault motion. In particular, each channel has experienced a different number of ancient earthquakes and thus accumulated a different amount of fault slip.  To determine the slip rate since each channel formed the team precisely measured both the total offset, using detailed field mapping and topographic measurements made with differential GPS surveys and analysis of LiDAR data, and the total age, by dating samples collected from excavations into sediments that were deposited before and/or after the channels were incised.  The study yielded the following 5 main results:   1) The average slip rate is between 28 and 52 mm/yr over the last 0.5 to 4 thousand years at 2 sites near Palmdale, CA.  2) The Late Quaternary slip rate is roughly between 38 to 43 mm/yr over last 16 to 30 thousand years, based on new mapping and dating at Little Rock Creek.  3) Previously published paleoseismic data at Wrightwood, which are widely cited as an archetypal example of short-term variation in fault slip rate, do not require such variability when uncertainties are propagated at the 2-sigma level and slip across the full fault zone is considered.  Our reassessment indicates that the Wrightwood data permit steady slip at roughly 32 to 49 mm/yr.  4) Development of a new conceptual model for the integrated structural and geomorphic evolution of alluvial channels that are intermittently blocked by bedrock shutter ridges during strike slip faulting. This model focuses on explaining the depositional and erosional response of the channel, with particular emphasis on the relationship between specific sedimentary deposits and the magnitude of slip that has accumulated since their formation.  5) Results from detailed investigations at 9 sites, 7 of which yielded robust age-offset data and 2 of which failed, but still advanced development of the conceptual model of channel formation and offset. This investigation revealed that dating offset landforms along the Mojave San Andreas is particularly difficult due to both the extreme magnitudes and complex patterns of deposition and incision during channel incision, and the inheritance of old organic material into younger deposits.  The age-offset data obtained in this study are complex and require further analysis before a history of fault slip over the last 10 thousand years can be established.
