<AbstractNarration>The vascular system of plants is a network of tubes that functions much like the veins and arteries of animals. However, in plants, vascular cells also are important for structural support, and form during the development of all plant organs. The goal of this research is to learn more about how the vascular system in plants forms, and how it can be manipulated to increase plant productivity.  Both biochemical and genetic approaches will be used to find genes that are important for making the different types of cells that form the vascular system, with the goal of identifying genes that can be manipulated to increase the amount and quality of the vasculature in plants. These genes can then be used to help develop crops that can withstand extreme conditions. In the 1960s, the vigor of standard cereal crops such as rice and wheat were limiting for food production. The creation of new varieties that were shorter and did not fall over as easily led to increased production of grains and averted a major food crisis. Today, as the citizens of the world face climate change with its more volatile weather, an understanding of how the vasculature forms is needed so that they can be manipulated to alter the strength and function of stems and other plant organs in extreme and volatile environments.  Undergraduate positions supported by this award will be filled by Arizona students from low-income backgrounds. Teachers from local high schools will be supported through this award to develop lesson plans about plant genomics and biotechnology for their high school classes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Plants have very sophisticated ways of responding to their environment and changing their growth accordingly. Well-studied examples of these behaviors include shoots growing towards light and roots responding to gravity by growing down into soil. One area that has been less studied until recently involves how plant roots perceive nutrients, and how root growth can be directed to help plants make the most of the resources found in the surrounding soil. When there are differences in the concentrations of soil nutrients such as nitrogen, plant roots can monitor the concentrations of the nutrients and direct growth in more nutrient rich areas. For example, when plant roots are exposed to low nitrogen in one area, small peptides are made locally that move through the plant vascular system to activate receptors in the shoot. This results in more root growth in areas of the root that are exposed to higher concentrations of nitrogen. In our research, we found that the receptors work both in shoots and roots. Our model is that as the peptides move through the root to the shoot, the receptors are being activated within the root to stop further root growth. In the roots that are in areas with higher nitrogen, the peptides are not made and we think the brake on further root growth is not applied. Then root growth in areas of higher nitrogen is strengthened by more signals coming from the shoot to roots. We have also identified proteins that help with this signaling system, and are studying these further.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project also contributed to development of the scientific workforce. Five PhD and two MS students were trained during this grant. In addition, 30 undergraduates and five high school students participated in independent research projects. The three PhD students that have finished their degrees are currently working in the biotechnology industry. One MS student is now in a PhD program, and four of the undergraduates attended or are currently enrolled in graduate programs, including the University of Washington, Stanford, Johns Hopkins and the University of Wisconsin. Two are in medical school, two in Pharmacy School and one finished Law school with a specialty in Biotechnology Patent Law. My students and I trained five high school teachers in the lab in the summers during this proposal and helped them develop lesson plans involving authentic research for their classes. The Tax lab continues to work with these classes even though the grant has ended. Several of the teachers work in Title I school districts in South Tucson or on the Navaho reservation. A number of the students from these schools have been encouraged to continue their studies at the University of Arizona or other local universities and community colleges, and several are supported by the Arizona Science Engineering and Math Scholars (ASEMS) program that Dr. Tax helps coordinate at the University of Arizona. Therefore, this grant has contributed to a pathway from high school to professional degrees for many students from Arizona.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/14/2019<br>      Modified by: Frans&nbsp;E&nbsp;Tax</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
