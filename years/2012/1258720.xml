<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;#1258720&lt;br/&gt;Lee, Seong-Young&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use of dimethyl ether (DME) in the internal combustion engine (ICE) has significant advantages over gasoline and diesel fuels, potentially yielding very low NOx emissions and zero particulate matter (PM).  One usage is through low-temperature combustion (LTC) strategies, the focus of which aims to (i) develop a predictive capability for DME combustion and (ii) develop a high-pressure (&gt;1500 bar) DME fuel injection system. Fundamental, phenomenological, and quantitative studies will be carried out over a wide range of pressures and temperatures, utilizing state-of-the-art experimental facilities along with strong synergistic theoretical and computational efforts.  The outcome will be a comprehensive characterization of DME high-pressure spray combustion, a determination of highly dilute DME autoignition (i.e., engine knock) phenomenon as a function of thermo-chemical and chemical kinetic parameters, development of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predictive tools for emissions and combustion efficiency, and optimization of a high pressure DME fuel system.  In this joint effort among Michigan Technological University, Argonne National Laboratory, Alternative Fuel Technology, and Navistar, the experimental facilities and expertise of individual partners will be leveraged.  Not only will this collaboration contribute to the development of an advanced ICE fueled with DME, significant educational impacts will also result. An integrated educational program provides research opportunities for students through close collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and the industrial partners.</AbstractNarration>
