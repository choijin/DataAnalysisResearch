<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to establish a methodology and to understand its fundamental mechanisms for manufacturing functionally and structurally gradient nanocomposites using three dimensional direct laser deposition and sintering.  The resulting material will be designed to closely match the characteristics of natural bone. Biocompatible, osteoconductive, advanced compositionally and structurally gradient implant biomaterials will be constructed with nitinol and titanium-based nanocomposites.   A multi-layer laser coating process will form functionally gradient nanoscale nanocomposite coatings on metal substrates.   Multi-scale, multi-physics modeling will be developed to simulate the laser direct deposition and laser sintering processes. The synthesized gradient biomaterials will be characterized for their mechanical characteristics, physical and biological properties.  Influences of different processing parameters on the coating properties will be studied to understand and find a processing window for good interfacial property and cell-materials interaction.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will result in a key enabling technology for integrating advances in biomaterials into manufacturing that lead to significantly improved implants for the orthopedic industry.  The proposed one-step process has the potential to drastically reduce manufacturing time and cost. This project will bring about an improved understanding of this bio-composite material behavior in the performance of implants.   The computer modeling will build a deeper understanding of laser deposition on the interaction between multi-component powders and the laser beam, their behavior in a molten pool and solidification.   The experiments and multiphysics modeling will combine to provide a critical scientific basis for low temperature processing of smart materials and nanocomposite powders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This goal of this project was to establish a novel methodology of producing functionally and structurally gradient nitinol-Ti6Al4V-biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP)/Ti nanocomposite and Ti6Al4V- BCP/Ti nanocomposite, through systematic experiments and integrated modeling.     Intellectual Merits  Direct synthesis of such materials has not been researched and therefore the outcomes of this research provide critical knowledge and a scientific basis in synthesizing functionally and structurally gradient bio-composites.   The following specific outcomes have been achieved.   It has been demonstrated that the key base material for implants, which is Nitinol as it has the closest mechanical properties to those of bones among all metals, can be synthesized by the laser direct deposition from the elemental powders. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated Nitinol with the prescribed transformation temperature can be synthesized from elemental powders of Ni and Ti, while building the 3D shape implants from the digital images of bones. It has been demonstrated that Nitinol is a superior implant material compared to conventional implant materials such as titanium, cobalt chrome, etc.  Its mechanical properties such as yield and fatigue strengths make Nitinol a more attractive option as future implant material. Cytotoxicity analysis of synthesized nitinol sample showed that it has promising biocompatibility and with surface modifications it can attain desirable implant grade osteoconductivity. Laser sintering of porous functional gradient coatings could be used to enhance the biocompatibility of metal implants.  In addition, NiTi microposous coating showed very good biocompatibility when the micro-nano porous structures are formed during laser processing.    Broader Impacts  This research brought about an improved understanding of this bio-composite material behavior in the performance of implants.   The integrated direct laser deposition and laser sintering used in the proposed research allowed for direct synthesis of bulk material combining nano-sized ceramic and shape memory alloy powders into gradient structure. Therefore, outcomes of this project will result in a key enabling technology for integrating advances in biomaterials into manufacturing, which leads to significantly improved implants for the orthopedic industry; this will position U.S. manufacturers to increase their share in the large $35 billion global market for orthopedic biomaterials.  The outcomes of this research will have spillover effects into other material manufacturing areas.  Graduate and undergraduates who participated in the research gained critical knowledge and one of them has been employed by an orthopedic company.  The principles and results of laser direct deposition of implants have been incorporated in the undergraduate manufacturing classes, ME363 and IE 360, PIs have been teaching.
