<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the topic of embryonic pattern formation, which is a central aspect of embryonic development in all animals. Pattern formation relies on communication between cell types as they progressively mold each other into the organs and structures that make up the body. This problem is very difficult to pursue in vertebrate animals due to their complexity. Since developmental mechanisms are highly conserved across animals, the proposed study instead addresses the problem of how one cell type directs the patterning of another cell type using sea urchin embryos, which offer an elegant patterning process in a comparatively simple system: the larval skeleton. Prior work identified multiple conserved genes that are required for skeletal patterning in sea urchin embryos; this project will use biochemical and molecular approaches to understand how these genes work together to generate the three-dimensional skeletal pattern. The results will define a mechanism for patterning as a result of communication between cell types and tissues; because the genes involved are highly conserved, this information will likely become a paradigm for patterning in more complex animals. The study will directly involve the participation of multiple undergraduate students, integrating their classroom knowledge with hands-on laboratory experiences, as well as scientific outreach to high school students in the Boston area to promote their interest in scientific careers. Finally, this project includes training of Boston area high school teachers in the summers, including classroom and laboratory experiences, with the intent of fostering the teaching of developmental biology in the high school science classroom.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding how patterns form in developing embryos is important for learning how birth defects arise and how we might prevent or treat such defects. It is also important for understanding the principles that guide tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, both of which have the potential to revolutionize medicine, but which rely on a clear, mechanistic understanding of the cellular and molecular underpinnings of the patterning processes that shape tissues, organs, and bodies.

For many decades, the identity of that "information" in the ectoderm has been mysterious. By using high throughput sequencing approaches, our group devised a screen that we used to discover several new genes whose protein products correspond to the "information" in the ectoderm. One of the genes, SLC26a2/7, encodes a sulfate transporter that is necessary to produce sulfated proteoglycans. We showed that this gene is expressed ventrally, that sulfated proteoglycans arise ventrally, and that the gene and the proteoglycans are each required for the mesenchymal cells to migrate to the ventral region, and for the primary ventral skeletal elements to form. We found another gene, Alk4/5/7, which is required for the secondary anterior elements, while a third gene, VEGF, is required for the secondary posterior elements. We found that BMP5-8 is required for the right side of the skeleton to form, while NFL is required for the right side. Finally, we found that the gene LOX is required for midline patterning. These results are summarized in Fig. 1. At the same time, we discovered that the mesenchymal cells use an ion channel that swaps hydrogen ions for potassium ions to build the skeletal mineral, and if that ion channel's function is blocked, no skeleton is formed. These results are summarized in Fig. 2. Finally, while performing our sequencing screen to discover skeletal patterning genes, we also characterized the genes normally expressed during embryonic development, and we discovered that as development proceeds, gene expression changes do not occur steadily as one might expect, but instead the changes happen abruptly at distinct timepoints, and change much less between those timepoints.

The PI mentored 9 graduate students (4 PhD students and 5 masters students), and approximately 50 undergraduate research students during the course of this project.
