<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Kent Voorhees from Colorado School of Mines and colleagues Kim Williams, Andrew Herring, Matthew Posewitz and John Spear will acquire a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI TOF/MS). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) ionization modes for laser ionization and analysis of biological materials; (b) field-flow fractionation for biomarkers for disease diagnostics; (c) characterization of energy hydrocarbons;(d) protein studies associated with developing algae feedstocks for biofuels; and (e) environmental proteomics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI TOF/MS) uses a laser to vaporize a solid sample (analyte) embedded in a material (matrix) which absorbed the analyte.  The plume of matrix and analyte vapors form ions which flow into a mass spectrometer where their mass/charge ratio is measured. This highly sensitive technique allows determination of the masses of the particles, their chemical composition and deduction of the structure of the substances under investigation. The instrumentation provided by this award will provide faculty and students the opportunity to pursue research projects at the Colorado School of Mines. The instrument will also be used by faculty, students and investigators from nearby NREL, University of Denver, University of Colorado at Denver, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Colorado State University at Pueblo, Red Rocks CC, and Metro State College.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The MALDI instrument has provided the Colorado School of Mines campus with a modern instrument that is not available in the Golden, CO area.  The MALDI mass spectrometer as been sued as an instructional tool for both graduate and undergraduate students.  During the past three years, it is estimated that 160 students have been exposed to MALDI mass spectrometry.  All of the CSM Chemistry senior students (~85) have conducted proteomics on a bacteriophage capsid protein as part of there summer session.   The instrument has also been important for several research groups and has served the basis for development of a new bacterial identification system, new materials for solar arrays and radiation detectors, and new polymer systems.  Protein profiling has received FDA approval for species-level identification of bacteria and is being used worldwide in hospitals and clinical laboratories. A more specific technique involving fatty acid profiling has been developed by CSM scientists on the NSF sponsored MALDI.  The new procedure (MOLI MS) utilizes a metal oxide which cleaves the lipid material in a bacterial extract into fatty acids followed by ionization to produce a fatty acid profile.  MOLI MS has been proven to be a strain level detector with capability of determining antibiotic resistant and susceptible organisms.  Direct comparison to the FDA approved protein profiling has shown that fatty acid profiling is more specific which results in a higher percentage of correct identification, a reduction of false negatives, and elimination of no identifications.  the MOLI MS technology has been licensed to SimulTOF Inc., Boston MA.  Molecular weight characterization is an important application of MALDI MS.        Work on solar arrays and radiation detectors has utilized MALDI to characterize the mass of their organic/hybrid semiconductor materials between 500-6000 Daltons.  Examples of materials characterized are silsesquioxanes, naphthalocyanamines, chrysenes, and aromatic amines.As an example of polymer molecular weight determination, rod-coil block copolymer molecular weights are extremely difficult using conventional methods due to the large differences in the blocks, but is critical in developing applications of these new polymers.  MALDI MS has enabled accurate and rapid characterization of the molecular weight and has proven to be the optimum method for molecular weight determination when compared to other analytical techniques.
