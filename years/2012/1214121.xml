<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Cort Anastasio of the University of California- Davis to study how photochemical reactions in snow can significantly affect the chemistry and composition of snow and the overlying atmosphere. We know relatively little about the rates or mechanisms of these processes, and further complicating matters, it appears that the photochemistry of a given solute depends on where the solute is located in/on ice. The two main goals of this proposal are to: (1) quantify how the photoreaction rates of environmentally relevant solutes vary with location in/on ice and (2) determine whether a freezing point depression model can predict solute reactivity. These goals will be achieved using laboratory experiments with carefully characterized ice samples and illumination conditions. This work has the potential to transform our understanding of molecular reactions in/on ice by revealing how chemistry varies with ice compartment and by providing an experimentally-confirmed kinetic framework that could be used to model snow chemistry. The broader impacts of this work include: (1) training and mentoring a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student, and several undergraduate students, (2) integrating research results into undergraduate and graduate courses, and (3) developing a seminar series on climate change to be offered in Sacramento to engage state, county, and city policy makers as well as the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Photochemical reactions in snow can significantly affect the chemistry and composition of the snow and the overlying atmosphere.  For example, oxidation reactions in snow can transform organic pollutants, such as carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and reduce their runoff into streams during snowmelt.  Understanding and predicting the rate of these reactions has been difficult.  In part this is because pollutants on a snow crystal can be found in three distinct locations: (1) at the ice surface, (2) in highly concentrated liquid-like regions (LLRs) within the ice, or (3) trapped as individual molecules within the ice matrix.  This distinction is important because past literature suggests that a pollutant at the ice surface is more reactive than the same pollutant located within LLRs.  A difference in location might also be important because differences in the flux of photons, which affects reaction rates.  Finally, understanding and predicting reaction rates of pollutants in snow is also difficult because we do not understand the ice concentrations of oxidants, the reactive species which play a major role in transforming environmental chemicals.      To shed light on these issues, our project had four main goals: (1) develop methods to deliver chemicals to each of the three ice locations, (2) examine whether there are differences in photon fluxes in these locations, (3) quantify whether there are differences in the photodecay of PAHs in the three ice locations, especially at the ice surface, and (4) quantify how oxidant concentrations differ between the same sample studied as ice and solution.  In addition, our broader impact activities included integrating snow chemistry research into teaching, offering seminars on the topic of climate change, and training graduate and undergraduate students in laboratory research and the scientific method.     In pursuit of the first goal we developed a method to image the location of chemicals in ice samples and used this to confirm that we can vary locations by varying sample preparation.  We then used these different preparations to measure photon fluxes in the three different ice locations.  We found only small differences between the locations.  But we also found that the reflectivity of the sample container plays a large role in the sample photon flux, which highlights the importance of measuring photon fluxes in ice photochemical studies; these measurements have been rarely made in the literature.  In addressing the third goal &ndash; to examine whether PAH photodegradation is enhanced at the ice surface &ndash; we placed PAH?s in the different ice locations and illuminated them with simulated sunlight.  In contrast with past work, we found no enhancement in PAH photodecay at the ice surface.  Rather, the rate of decay was essentially the same in all three ice locations (surface, LLRs, ice matrix) as well as in liquid solution.     To address our final goal, we made the first measurements of oxidant concentrations in illuminated samples studied as both liquid and ice.  We quantified the three photooxidants that are likely most significant for transforming organic pollutants in snow: singlet molecular oxygen (1O2*), the triplet excited state of an organic molecular (3C*), and hydroxyl radical (OH). We found that these three oxidants show very different behaviors in ice compared to in solution.  The 1O2* concentration was enhanced in the LLRs of ice by factors of approximately 10,000, which likely makes it a very significant oxidant for some pollutants in natural snows and ices.  In contrast, there was no enhancement of OH concentration in ice compared to solution.  The triplet state was an intermediate case, with an ice enhancement of approximately 100.  We were able to model these enhancements by considering how concentrations of the sources and sinks for the oxidants are different between solution and ice.  For example, the concentration of the source for 1O2* was enormously enhanced in ice (relative to the initial solution), but its sinks were not; the result is a large increase in the 1O2* concentration in ice.  In contrast, both the OH sources and sink concentrations are increased in ice, which leads to no net change in OH concentration in ice relative to solution.      Overall, the results from this project represent a major advance in our understanding of photochemical reactions in ice.  These results help clarify how concentrations of reactive species in ice are determined, which should lead to improved model predictions of chemistry in snow-covered regions.
