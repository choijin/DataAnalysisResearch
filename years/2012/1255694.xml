<AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of this project team is to learn how to design interactive graphic novels and associated serious games to help adolescents learn social problem solving skills. The intention is that these skills will not simply be learned in a way that allows the teens to say what they should do but, rather, that they will be learned in a way that results in behavior change. The project is investigating the use of graphic novels to engage teens in thinking about difficult social situations and to model for them ways of dealing effectively and in non-violent ways with those tricky situations, and they are investigating the use of associated serious games and other interactive components to promote reflection on what has been read, promote discussion around the situations, and provide opportunities for practice. This novel idea has its foundations in the approach to therapy called Cognitive Behavioral Modification and resonates with what the approach to education called Cognitive Apprenticeship suggests about promoting skills learning. The project brings together experts in Cognitive Behavioral Modification, social psychology, interactive narrative, design of graphic novels, serious games, and adolescent health and well-being. The goals of this EAGER project are to (i) synthesize social psychology, interactive narrative, and serious games approaches to envision the experiences learners need to have to learn and take on new social problem solving behaviors, (ii) begin the design of an interactive graphic novel and experiences around it that has a good chance of promoting behavior change among the targeted population of at-risk teens, and (ii) develop a strong research team that will collaborate over the long term in following through on worthy ideas that come from this initial effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential broader impacts of this work lie in the potential for (i) using graphic novels, which are easily accessible and can be of high interest to young people, to promote thinking and doing that can help teens learn new problem solving behaviors, (ii) learning how to promote productive behavior change, and (iii) identifying the roles technology can play in such learning and how to use technology well as a resource in promoting productive behavior change.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, the project envisioned young people learning critical life skills in an innovative virtual learning environment that uses an interactive graphic novel that can be easily accessed on-line or as a mobile application on mobile devices including smart phones and tablets. This research focused on increasing our knowledge about how to apply social cognitive theory (with an emphasis on increasing adolescentsÆ competence or personal efficacy) to promote learning and behavior change in a technologically rich environment, as well as answered questions about how technology and interactive narrative can best be applied to this type of innovative learning setting.  Intellectual Merit.  Adolescence is a time for developing competencies, emerging independence, negotiating peer and family relationships, and beginning to assume responsibility for oneÆs own behavior and health.  While the majority of youth successfully navigate the important transitions of this time, high rates of preventable morbidity and mortality keep some adolescents from achieving their potential of becoming productive, caring, and committed adults. Behaviors initiated during adolescence, such as substance use and abuse, early sexual behavior, and risky driving, are responsible for the majority of deaths and disabling conditions in adolescence and through the fourth decade of life.  Adolescent engagement in risk behavior is embedded within a social context with peer influence at its peak during the middle years of adolescence. Thus, the interactive graphic novel emphasized the development of general strategies for thinking about and coping with a broad range of social problems that adolescents are likely to experience during the high school years.  Technology has tremendous potential to promote learning and behavior change in adolescents. Interactive computer technology provides a promising solution to increasing behavioral interventions for teenagers as it can be designed to assess an adolescentÆs risk or skill level, and provide a convenient, individualized means for informing, enabling, motivating, and guiding individuals to make changes in their lives.
