<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Washington.  The  program offers a broad selection of student projects from almost every sub-field of physics. It makes use of the University of Washington's strong in-house "table-top" experimental programs; its machine-shop facilities including a first-rate student shop; CENPA, a DOE center-of-excellence in nuclear physics and astrophysics; and theory opportunities ranging from the Institute for Nuclear Theory to a twenty-teraflop local cluster. The award supports ten students per summer. Selection will be competitive, considering past academic performance, letters of recommendation, and taking into account the potential for impacting the student's career. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student participant will be partnered with a UW faculty advisor. Most Physics faculty members participate as advisors, as do selected faculty from affiliated departments. Student work includes: design, construction, and commissioning of instrumentation; data collection and analysis; numerical modeling; the development of software for such modeling; and theory. Not infrequently this work culminates with a journal publication.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The education of young scientists is of paramount importance to the continuing success of science in the United States. The main goal of the Physics REU program at the University of Washington is to provide an exciting and nurturing research experience for the students, one that will encourage them to pursue careers as research scientists.  The program aims to accomplish this by offering a wide variety of research projects and the opportunity to use first-rate research facilities while also providing a strong support network.  Additionally, while selection is competitive, the program strives to build a group of students that is diverse.  We received 385 applications for the summer of 2013 class which had 9 final participants, 450 applications for 2014 with 11 participants, 413 applications for the 10 positions in the summer 2015 class, and 441 applications for the 10 positions in the summer 2016 class.    Each student participant was partnered with a UW faculty advisor and their research group. Student research work included design, construction, and commissioning of instrumentation; data collection and analysis; numerical modeling; the development of software for such modeling; and theory.  All students proved capable of doing quality independent research.  The concluding presentations -- written and oral reports on the results of 10 weeks of research -- were of very high quality.  These are documented on the program's website at http://www.int.washington.edu/REU/.              Last Modified: 04/16/2017       Submitted by: Subhadeep Gupta]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
