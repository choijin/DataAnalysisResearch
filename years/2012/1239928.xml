<AbstractNarration>Abstract 1239928, Catawba College, PI Rogers-Lowery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Catawba College Noyce Scholars project brings together Catawba College with Rowan-Cabarrus Community College and the Rowan-Salisbury Schools to focus on the recruitment, preparation, and retention of STEM majors in teaching careers by blending academic preparation, professional community-building, and field experiences. To achieve these goals, the Catawba College Noyce Scholarship project has three phases:  Exploratory Internships, Scholarships, and Collegial Support Networks.   The Exploratory Internship component provides paid internships for up to 60 freshmen and sophomore students pursuing STEM majors at Rowan-Cabarrus Community College to experience teaching and recruit them to pursue a career in K-12 education. The project supports eighteen STEM majors with $18,000 scholarships in their junior and senior years of college to pursue a major in a STEM discipline and licensure in teaching at Catawba College. The program prepares STEM educators in a broad range of disciplines (biology, chemistry, environmental science, or mathematics) that are capable of teaching at a variety of grade levels by offering rigorous coursework in STEM disciplines and teacher preparation, enriched by opportunities that build social and cultural capital in the sciences and education. To supplement course work, the Scholars complete mentored experiences within the local school system, Rowan-Salisbury Schools, and in research laboratories to gain understanding of both STEM and education fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Noyce Scholars engage in activities that build social and cultural capital in the profession of education, providing a support network for retention and success during their training and careers in teaching. These activities include a cohort-building retreat and a Mentoring Program, where Scholars engage in field experiences in the classroom of a highly-effective teacher in Rowan-Salisbury Schools (RSS), the local public school system, to familiarize the Scholar with culture of public education. The Mentoring programming has the added benefit of developing a social network that supports the Scholars during their induction years. Following graduation, Scholars are required to work for four years in a high-need school district as a condition of receiving the scholarship. To support the Scholars during their induction into teaching, continued mentoring and financial support are provided.  As classroom teachers, Noyce Scholars receive funds to attend a state STEM education conference and to purchase classroom supplies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Catawba College Noyce Scholarship Program blended coursework and field-based experiences with activities to increase social and cultural capital in the STEM fields and education, which is critical to the pre-service teachers during their pre-professional training and induction into a career in teaching.   The STEM and education departments at Catawba College collaborated to develop a research-based secondary teacher preparation program for undergraduates that combined a major in Math, Biology, Chemistry, and/or Environmental Sciences with a minor in Secondary Education.  The Scholars program was modeled on a successful teacher training program (Catawba College?s Academy for Teaching) that promotes retention and success through cohort building, leadership training, and multiple, embedded, field experiences. By including a research internship, Scholars will have a greater understanding of the nature of science, which will enhance their abilities to teach STEM disciplines to their students.  Using this model 16 of 18 Scholars (2 students are still completing compliance requirements) are currently teaching STEM disciplines in high-need school districts.  Their training included cohort building leadership retreats, extensive field experiences, research internships, and coursework, and mentoring by experienced teachers after graduation.  All completers report that the activities prepared them to successfully navigate the induction years of teaching. Scholars were prepared to be reflective practitioners in the STEM education, who utilize constant assessment to drive effective classroom instruction.   Through a collaboration with Rowan-Cabarrus Community College, the Scholarship included an internship program, available to community college students, to explore careers in STEM teaching, and increase the number of secondary education teachers trained at Catawba College.  The internship program included a mentored experience at a location that provide STEM education opportunities (science centers, nature centers, and museum) and an online course in teaching (the first course required for teacher education students at Catawba College) to allow for reflection on the experience. A total of 63 students participated in the internship program.  Six students that participated in the internship program also became Scholars.  There were several valuable lessons learned from the project:   Word of mouth is the most effective means for recruiting students into the program.  Even with non-directed advertising (posters, social media ads, website, etc.), a small percentage of potential applicants (30%) were aware of the program.  Each of the students recruited were cultivated through personal connections (including the internship program). The Internship program offered to community college students was effective in helping students consider a career in STEM education.  While only 38% of the internships indicated that they had decided to pursue teaching as a career, 83% of interns indicated that the internship was instrumental in them making decisions about their careers, including decisions to not pursue STEM teaching as a career. While all Scholars indicated that the teacher education program, combined with support activities, was effective in preparing them for careers in teaching, the mentored research internship was noted as the most valuable experience, as it helped them become more confident in the subject matter.
