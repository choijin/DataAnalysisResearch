<AbstractNarration>Miller&lt;br/&gt;1261833&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GAGE Facility:  Geodesy Advancing Geosciences and EarthScope Cooperative Agreement (CA) supports advancement of cutting-edge community geodetic research around the world.  Over the last two decades, space-based geodetic observations have enabled measurement of the motions of the Earth?s surface and crust at many different scales, with unprecedented spatial and temporal detail and increased precision, leading to fundamental discoveries in continental deformation, plate boundary processes, the earthquake cycle, the geometry and dynamics of magmatic systems, continental groundwater storage and hydrologic loading.  Space geodesy furthers research on earthquake and tsunami hazards, volcanic eruptions, coastal subsidence, wetlands health, soil moisture and groundwater distribution. Of particular importance are contributions to understanding of processes related to climate dynamics, including hurricane tracking and intensity, sea level rise, and changes in mountain glaciers and large polar ice sheets.  As global population disproportionately increases in hazards-prone coastal and tectonically active regions of the US and across the globe, the societal relevance of quantifying, understanding, and potentially mitigating natural hazards grows. Geoscientists using global geodetic infrastructure coupled with leading edge techniques are well poised to advance basic research that is in the U.S. and global public interest as the challenges of living on a dynamic planet escalate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF-funded geodesy investigators are active on every continent, across a broad spectrum of the geosciences, and facilitated by data and engineering services that are now merged under the GAGE Facility.  GAGE continues operations of: 1) the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), an integrated set of geodetic networks that includes 1100 continuous GPS sites (with ~350 high-rate, low-latency data streams and ~125 surface meteorological sensors), 78 borehole strainmeters and seismometers, and 6 long-baseline laser strainmeters, and tiltmeters on several volcanoes; 2) global engineering and data services primarily to NSF-funded investigators who use terrestrial and satellite geodetic technologies in their research and provision of network operations support to community GPS networks and NASA?s Global GNSS Network (GGN); and 3) Education and community outreach actvities.   NSF?s Division of Polar Programs (PLR) contributes to the GAGE Facility support of PI research and GPS networks in Greenland and Antarctica.  NASA contributes to the GAGE Facility to support the GGN and the activities of the IGS Central Bureau, which underlie the internationally coordinated reference frame products that make high-precision geodesy possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

GAGE also supported geodetic imaging through terrestrial lidar scanning (TLS) and support of InSAR satellite technology. During this award, the data were found to inform many more aspects of science than originally intended and the societal benefit of the facility far exceed expectations.

Graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and scientists (both early career and established) participated in technical training to process data for scientific research. Over the 5-year period, GAGE supported nearly 100 interns who worked in areas of geoscience research and technical work supporting the GAGE facility. More than 85% of these interns are working in geosciences, geodesy-related fields, or are pursuing advanced degrees in geosciences. GAGE worked closely with educators (K-12 and higher education) to develop age-appropriate materials to use in classrooms and out-of-school settings, and provided professional development to educators to help them implement these materials. Outreach activities and materials such as posters, playing cards, rulers and calendars were disseminated to the general public to share how the GAGE facility-supported work is benefiting the broader population and the nation. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Charles&nbsp;M&nbsp;Meertens</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1261833/1261833_10276029_1556573052972_antarctica--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1261833/1261833_10276029_1556573052972_antarctica--rgov-800width.jpg" title="GPS station on an Antarctic ice stream"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1261833/1261833_10276029_1556573052972_antarctica--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="GPS station on an Antarctic ice stream"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Continued support of polar science enabled scientists to better understand the dynamics of our planet?s ice sheets.

The data from these instruments had far reaching implications regarding earthquakes, volcanic unrest, land subsidence, landslides, extraction or injection of fluids, loading or unloading of water, ice and snow, and other Earth processes.

Advances in research are multi-disciplinary, including: global geodesy and plate tectonics, geosciences, Earth system science, earthquake processes, Earth mantle properties, active magmatic systems, plate boundary zone deformation, intraplate deformation and glacial isostatic adjustment, atmospheric science, global change, polar science, hydrogeodesy, and seismogeodesy.   Operational activities impacted by the work of the GAGE Facility and community include tropical storm forecasting through integration of precipitable water vapor into forecast models, development of and ingestion of data into an earthquake early warning system on the west coast of the U.S., proof-of-concept of a tsunami early warning system in the eastern Pacific Ocean, development of a hydro-network used for water resource planning including drought monitoring and mitigation, volcano monitoring of major volcanoes in the western U.S. and Alaska, surveying and navigation, and a revision of the national seismic hazard maps which are used by the government, private, and the public to inform municipal planning, insurance risk and rates, and exposure of facilities and supply chains to natural hazards.   Specific examples of the applicability of GAGE-supported science and data include:  Sounding of the atmosphere through GPS (i.e., satellite to receiver pathways) to measure total electron content in the ionosphere and precipitable water vapor in the troposphere impacts research regarding space weather, severe weather, and atmospheric dynamics. Probing of surface conditions through GPS reflectrometry (i.e., satellite to surface to receiver pathways) to measure soil moisture, snow depth, vegetation moisture index, and other features, provides crucial information regarding the water cycle and water resources. Advances in satellite systems through the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and innovations in GPS and GNSS receivers, other instrumentation, data processing, computing power, and cyberinfrastructure have allowed the scientific community to better address an array of critical scientific and societal problems using space and terrestrial geodetic techniques?in geographically distributed areas.        In addition to scientific advances, the GAGE Facility played a key role in educating and informing U.S. citizens about geosciences and geodesy as well as training the next generation of geoscientists. Graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and scientists (both early career and established) participated in technical training to process data for scientific research. Over the 5-year period, GAGE supported nearly 100 interns who worked in areas of geoscience research and technical work supporting the GAGE facility. More than 85% of these interns are working in geosciences, geodesy-related fields, or are pursuing advanced degrees in geosciences. GAGE worked closely with educators (K-12 and higher education) to develop age-appropriate materials to use in classrooms and out-of-school settings, and provided professional development to educators to help them implement these materials. Outreach activities and materials such as posters, playing cards, rulers and calendars were disseminated to the general public to share how the GAGE facility-supported work is benefiting the broader population and the nation.
