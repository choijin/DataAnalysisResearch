<AbstractNarration>This action funds Kevin H. Miller of the University of Florida to conduct a research project, entitled "Infrared Transmission Study of Electric and Magnetic Excitations in Novel Single Crystals" during the summer of 2012 at the University of Wollongong in Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia.  The host scientist is Professor Roger A. Lewis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in searching for magnon and electromagnon excitations in novel multiferroic and magnetoelectric single crystals.  More specifically, the proposed research involveds terahertz transmission measurements on FeTe2O5Br, CuSe2O5, and Cu3Bi(SeO3)2O2Cl to investigate the existence of magnetoelectric coupling in these materials.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved the use of far infrared light (terahertz region) to probe low energy absorptions in novel crystals utilizing a simplistic transmission geometry.  The crystals studied were chosen based on their potential as candidates for future technological devices; understanding of the fundamental (basic science) concepts driving the results was a secondary but serendipitous outcome of the research.  The motivation for studying low energy absorptions relates to the fact that minute changes in such absorptions can drastically affect a materialÆs overall properties, thus rendering it very useful for future electronic devices.      At the conclusion of the project, five crystals had been thoroughly characterized using far infrared light, the most interesting of which was Cu3Bi(SeO3)2O2Cl (CBSCl).  CBSCl exhibited a low energy absorption which was alterable by manipulating both temperature and weak external magnetic fields.  The tuning of temperature and magnetic fields correlated to changes in the materials properties, and the fundamental science behind this observed phenomenon is now well understood.  A technical discussion of the results has recently been published (K. H. Miller et al., Physical Review B 86, 174104).  Now that the underlying mechanisms of CBSCl are understood, efforts are underway to advantageously alter the parent material, thus facilitating more precise control of the materialÆs properties.      An additional benefit of the project involved the advancement of far infrared (terahertz) sources of light and detection.  The aforementioned efforts assist the developments towards future terahertz technologies (e.g., terahertz processors for computers).       Moving forward, the PI anticipates future collaboration with the University of Wollongong, Australia, as both parties greatly benefited from the initial encounter.
