<AbstractNarration>This action funds Zachary B. Haber of the University of Nevada, Reno to conduct a research project, entitled "Development of prefabricated bridge columns with innovative structural design and connections," during the summer of 2012 at The National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) in Taipei, Taiwan. The host scientists are Prof. Kuo-Chun Chang of National Taiwan University and Prof. Yu-Chen Ou of National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to develop novel prefabricated concrete bridge columns that can be rapidly assembled and utilize innovative structural details. These new elements are being developed by integrating technologies developed and tested independently and brought together in this project. There are a number of advantages to the new design, including rapid replacement of of bridges during construction, repair, and replacement after severe natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, flooding, and hurricanes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Brief Background: Accelerated bridge construction (ABC) is a construction technique that is becoming very popular in the United States.  The use of ABC can have many benefits such as reduced overall project cost, reduced construction time (weeks instead of months), and can generally lessen the impact of construction on the public.  To effectively execute ABC projects, bridge designers use prefabricated concrete elements that can be quickly assembled to form a functional structural system. It is advantageous to the bridge designer if these systems emulate the design and behavior of conventional cast-in-place concrete bridge construction.  If this can be achieved, typical analysis and design procedures can be used.  The difficulty with designing prefabricated member with the intent to emulate conventional construction is usually encountered in the design and detailing of connections.  This is because connections play a critical role in the stability of the structure when it is subjected to an earthquake.  The use of mechanical reinforcing bar splices has become one option for creating moment connections between precast columns and cast-in-place (or precast) footings. Of the many commercially available devices, grouted sleeve splices (Fig. 1) have emerged as one of the more practical options because they have been specially developed for precast construction and can potentially be used with emulative design procedures. These devices have been employed in Japan and Taiwan for high-rise building construction for a number of years, and more recently have gained the attention of US bridge designers. However, there is currently very little information regarding the behavior of this connection type.       Objective: The main objective of this project was to obtain data and information related to the use of grouted sleeve reinforcing bar coupler in reinforced concrete (RC) columns in Taiwan along with develop computer models for predicting the behavior of these devices. Much of the research related to the use of grouted couplers in Taiwan has been conducted at the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE), which was the host institution of the PI.

The PI also engaged in ongoing research at NCREE, which focused on tested bridge columns with innovative steel reinforcement details (Fig. 4).  The PI also participated in numerous educational cultural endeavors, which were both technical and non-technical in nature. Such activities included visiting the 921 Earthquake Museum of Taiwan.  This museum provides exhibits and information on the "Chi-Chi" earthquake, which...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
