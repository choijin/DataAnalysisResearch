<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the effects of atmospheric water vapor on the formation of organic nitrates and secondary organic aerosol. Measurements of the product branching ratio for the reaction HOCH2CH2O2 (HEP, 2-hydroxyethyl peroxy) + NO as a function of temperature and water vapor are predicted to show that high concentrations of atmospheric water vapor can lead to the increased formation of organic nitrates. Additionally, this research will investigate the potential that under certain conditions, hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2) in the presence of water vapor can form complexes that become nucleating seeds for the formation of secondary aerosols. The results will connect the gas phase chemistry of peroxy radicals (HO2 and RO2) with the formation of secondary aerosol as a function of water vapor concentration, initial radical concentration, temperature, and reaction time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High levels of water vapor in the atmosphere may have an important effect on the formation of organic nitrates and secondary organic aerosol (from gas-to-particle transformations). Organic nitrates in the atmosphere are relatively inert and can provide a mechanism for long-range transport of pollution from one region to another. Understanding and quantifying the formation of secondary organic aerosol is critical for predicting their direct and indirect effects on climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Aerosols are known to affect the climate and human health both directly and indirectly. Two types of aerosols exist in the atmosphere, primary and secondary.  Primary aerosol particles are introduced directly into the atmosphere and include sources such as soot, mineral dust, sea salt and pollen.  Secondary particles are formed from gases and grow in size over time. The formation and growth of secondary particles is typically modeled using classical nucleation theory (CNT).   One of the most studied systems for new particle formation is sulfuric acid reacting with water vapor.  Figure 1 shows pictorially how this process is modeled to occur.  In the first step, SO2 is converted into H2SO4 which complexes with water molecules.  This H2SO4-H2O complex acts as the nucleating seed for new particle growth.  This complex can grow with the addition of water and H2SO4 molecules until it can reach a diameter in excess of 1 micrometer in size.   The number of particles in the atmosphere predicted by models is often several times smaller than measured concentrations.  To reconcile the difference between measured and modeled particle concentrations requires identification of new mechanisms for particle formation.  Formation of a nucleating seed is the first step in particle formation.  We experimentally and computationally tested the hypothesis that organic acids and radicals (molecules with unpaired electrons) can serve as nucleating seeds.  Particle formation was studied with both formic acid (HC(O)OH) and HO2 radical as nucleating seeds.  HO2 radical is the most abundant radical in the atmosphere, and previous work has shown that HO2 radical can hydrogen-bond with water to form an HO2-H2O complex which can serve as the nucleating seed.  This hypothesis was tested using a slow-flow reactor coupled to two scanning mobility particle sizers (SMPS) (Figure 2). Particle size distributions and concentrations were measured as functions of reaction time, initial concentration of HO2 radical, formic acid, and concentration of water vapor.  The experimental instrument and method were tested with formic acid and water vapor, a previously studied system.  The experimental work was complemented with high level ab initio studies on both the HC(O)OH-H2O and HO2-H2O complexes.  The computational studies provided valuable insights into the mechanism and thermodynamics of new particle formation.  The results of this work also suggest that radicals and organic acids commonly found in the atmosphere react with NH3, NH2(CH3), NH(CH3)2 or N(CH3)3 to serve as nucleating sites for generation of particles in the atmosphere.   These new mechanisms for particle formation may help close the gap between measured and modeled concentrations of particles in the atmosphere.
