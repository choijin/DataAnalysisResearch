<AbstractNarration>The San Jose State University (SJSU) Science Research and Teaching Scholars program is providing an average of fifteen $8,700/year scholarships over this four-year project to students majoring in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Geology, Meterology or Physics/Astronomy.  The primary objective being achieved is the preparation of strong scientists capable of becoming high school teachers, scientists in the workforce, or students pursuing graduate degrees in STEM, each after completing their baccalaureate degree.   The well-designed program is improving the STEM workforce by enabling strong academic performance of Scholars and by providing experiences that allow each Scholar to identify the best career path appropriate to them.  Vigorous campus recruiting efforts are leading to a robust applicant pool from which Scholars are selected based on their GPA, documented financial need, their commitment to a career as a scientist, and letters of recommendation.  Scholars are supported with Academic Excellence Workshops, Summer Preparation Courses, a Graduate School Preparation Seminar, Research Techniques Workshops, on-campus research opportunities, teaching apprenticeships, and faculty mentoring.  Close involvement with local industry includes seminars and workplace tours.  SJSU has a diverse undergraduate student population and serves Silicon Valley.  As undergraduate researchers the Scholars are enhancing research productivity at SJSU while enjoying their first scientific work experience.  Scholars are also gaining teaching experience by service as facilitators for Academic Excellence Workshops, Summer Preparation courses, teaching lab courses, or through service learning programs like Tutor-to-Teach.  Successful Scholars are serving as role models for future STEM majors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project's overall objective was to award scholarships to qualified San Jose State University (SJSU) students.  The students were known as the College of Science Research and Teaching Scholars (CoSRaTS) since the award was to support students from five science majors in the College of Science at SJSU: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Geology and Meteorology.  The students had to meet a minimum set of criteria in terms of GPA, financial aid and career objectives.  The Scholars were very strongly encouraged to become research active since undergraduate research is a well-known high impact educational activity that motivates students to continue in STEM.  Students selected for scholarships had to indicate a career goal of advanced degree in STEM, teaching K-12 in a STEM field or working as a scientist in industry, government or public sector.   The grant was funded from June 1, 2013 to August 31, 2019.  During these six years forty-nine students received scholarships from this program.  Forty completed the program.  Key outcomes of the programs are:  1)  Students were retained in STEM majors.  It is common for many students to leave STEM majors. The STEM retention rate for students in CoSRaTS program was 98%.   Only one of the 49 students left a STEM major. The rest have graduated or are still pursuing STEM degrees at SJSU and are close to graduation.  2) The CoSRaTS program had a higher graduation rate than SJSU as a whole.  At this point in time, out of the 48 students who were retained in STEM, 44 have graduated for a graduation rate of 92%.  Three of the remaining four should graduate within a semester and the last student, who left the program due to lack of financial need from the grant, will graduate in the next two years, so the program expects to reach a 100% graduation rate (or 98% if we include the student who left the STEM major). Out of the 48 students, fifteen indicated that they were from underrepresented minority backgrounds.  Of these fifteen, fourteen have graduated and one will graduate in Fall 2019.  This is a current graduation rate of 93%, expected to become 100% in Dec of 2019.  Sixteen of the students were transfer students from community college.  Of these sixteen, one left the STEM major, thirteen have graduated and two are expected to graduate by the end of Fall 2019.  Thus the current graduation rate for transfer students supported by CoSRaTS is 81% and expected to be 94% by the end of Fall 2019.  3)  Historically very few students in STEM at SJSU continued to STEM PhD degrees.  During the last ten years the number of students that have been continuing to PhD graduate programs has increased in part because of this grant.  For this cohort of 49 students, nine so far have started PhD programs and five have started MS programs.  We are aware that some students who have yet to graduate or recently graduated are also strongly considering graduate degrees in STEM.  So far two of our scholars secured NSF Graduate Research Fellowships a third student received an Honorary Mention from the program.
