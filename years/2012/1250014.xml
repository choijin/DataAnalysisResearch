<AbstractNarration>With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Adam Watson and an interdisciplinary team of researchers will complete a three-year investigation of the social and economic organization of Ancestral Pueblo society in the Chaco Canyon region of present-day northwestern New Mexico. The team includes specialists in archaeology and mechanical engineering to explore the relationship between trends in craft production, manufacturing techniques, and microscopic wear-traces artifacts employed in different production processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coalescence and transformation of many dispersed farming communities in and around Chaco Canyon during the Bonito phase (850-1140 CE) is one of the most widely cited examples of the emergence of politically complex society in pre-Columbian North America. The development of social stratification, the regional propagation of Chacoan ideology, great house construction, and thriving long-distance trade networks are among the principal changes associated with the Bonito phase. Despite more than a century of archaeological research in the canyon, however, the extent to which these social, political, and economic developments entailed corresponding shifts in the economic organization of the society remains unclear. Although previous studies have shown that large quantities of ceramics and raw materials flowed into the canyon from outlying regions, until recently there was little indication of what may have been produced locally and provided in exchange. Though largely invisible archaeologically, perishable craft industries such as basketry, textiles, and hide-working represented a major sector of the Chacoan economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates changes in the spatial organization and scale of craft production through the study of the previously unanalyzed collection of bone artifacts from Pueblo Bonito, an assemblage remarkable for both its size and diversity. Overall trends in tool manufacture and use can be assessed in terms of raw material choice and the relative intensity of basketry, textile, and hide manufacturing in which these tools were utilized. The study of bone artifacts using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), for example, permits the exploration of microwear patterns that can then be used to differentiate the types of crafts being manufactured. The introduction of texture analysis techniques originally developed for applications in mechanical engineering allows the identification of quantifiable parameters of variation in use-wear. On the basis of these data, the study will evaluate the hypothesis that the sociopolitical changes evident in Chacoan societal development was paralleled by increasing economic complexity in the form of craft specialization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implications of this study are far-reaching and extend beyond the ongoing regional debates with the potential to advance studies of political economy, hierarchy, craft specialization, prehistoric bone industries, and microwear analysis. Drawing upon recent advances in the fields of surface metrology and mechanical engineering this research applies new scientific methods to address longstanding archaeological questions. The creation of a web-based database that documents variation in microwear is a critical step for reducing inter-observer error, improving repeatability, and resolving key debates in the analysis of use-wear. Through the American Museum of Natural History Science Research Mentoring Program and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students will participate in data collection and laboratory analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The UNESCO World Heritage site of Chaco Canyon witnessed a cultural transformation (850-1140 CE) that remains one of the most widely cited cases of emergent societal complexity in pre-Columbian North America. Although debate persists over the forces and processes that spurred development, there is widespread agreement among scholars that in the 9th century these communities emerged as the core of a regional network of unprecedented size and scope that flourished for three centuries. However, the extent to which these developments entailed corresponding shifts in economic organization remains unclear.</p> <p>Recent research in the pre-Columbian Pueblo Southwest has demonstrated the importance of understanding trends in bone industries that closely track other, related economic sectors such as perishable craft production. A vital next step in this line of inquiry is the identification of specific types of production activities in which bone tools are employed and variation across time and space.</p> <p>This project investigated the large bone artifact collection from Pueblo Bonito &ndash; the only great house for which an essentially complete bone artifact collection exists. The research pursued two lines of inquiry: a) collection of AMS radiocarbon dates to improve the chronological framework; and b) application of recent advancements in microwear analysis to identify use-wear traces attributable to different material classes, e.g., plant fiber and animal hide, and thereby measure the relative significance of different forms of craft production.</p> <p>With funding from the National Science Foundation, archaeologists at the American Museum of Natural History fully documented the remarkable bone artifact assemblage from Pueblo Bonito, obtained nearly 70 new AMS radiocarbon dates and, in collaboration with mechanical engineers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, demonstrated the feasibility of identifying differential patterns of microwear on bone implements, consistent with a variety of craft production activities.</p> <p>AMS radiocarbon results (n = 69) were collected and analyzed for a spatially broad sample (Figures 1-3) providing crucial temporal control of depositional contexts within Pueblo Bonito. This analysis yielded unexpected and unprecedented insight into Mesoamerican acquisition networks and the ceremonial use of birds in Chaco. The acquisition of macaws proved to be markedly earlier and more sustained than many researchers have hypothesized; the results were published in 2015 article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The new AMS dates obtained for Golden Eagles are striking in that all eagle remains, with the exception of isolated outliers, post-date AD 1000. This suggests a discrete shift in ritual use of birds in Pueblo Bonito and perhaps Chaco more broadly &ndash; the implications will be explored more fully in a forthcoming peer-reviewed publication.</p> <p>Analysis of surface texture on experimental tools (Figures 4-6) by researchers in the Surface Metrology Laboratory at WPI revealed that: a) Conventional (ISO) parameters are effective in discriminating wear traces; b) multi-scale geometric characterizations of surface wear are similarly effective in identifying statistical similarities as a function of scale; and c) in terms of repeatability, tool edges rather than planar faces provide more consistent and therefore more reliable results in differentiating microwear patterns.</p> <p>In an effort to evaluate the feasibility of differentiating use-wear and to support the development of a database of variation in wear, conventional roughness values were explored. The results showed that, of the conventional parameters considered, two measures, Average Roughness (S<sub>a</sub>) and Average Maximum Height (S<sub>z</sub>), hold the most promise for differentiating types of wear but should be applied concurrently. Kurtosis (S<sub>ku</sub>) was determined to be a less reliable indicator of wear-type.</p> <p>In this study, four specimens were compared using area-scale analysis: 1) Plant-working vs. Hide-working; 2) Plant-working vs. Sandstone Abrasion; 3) Hide-working vs. Sandstone Abrasion; and 4) 2 Hide-working tools. Measurements were always compared within tool-type to demonstrate repeatability and in each case, measurements were indistinguishable.</p> <p>In the first comparison, the difference in the area-scale relationship between plant-working and hide-working was found to be significant at larger scales (greater than 1 &micro;m&sup2;).&nbsp; The difference between surfaces abraded by sandstone only and those subsequently subjected to abrasion by plant fibers are most significant at larger scales (1 to 10<sup>3</sup> &micro;m&sup2;).&nbsp; Comparison of a sandstone-abraded surface and a surface exposed to prolonged friction with softened deer hide revealed differences discernible and significant at only finer scales (10<sup>-1</sup> to 1 &micro;m&sup2;).&nbsp; Finally, as an additional control, two separate hide-working tools were compared and the difference in wear was not significant.</p> <p>Our results refined the chronology for one of Chaco Canyon&rsquo;s largest and most-studied sites and illustrated that texture analysis methods, developed within the mechanical engineering discipline, show great promise for advancing the study of bone tool manufacture and use. Analysis revealed the usefulness of both traditional roughness measures and multi-scale geometric analysis using area-scale fractal techniques for characterizing and discriminating microtopographic differences as a function of tool use.</p> <p>Our data will be available to researchers through the publicly accessible Chaco Research Archive web site in the near future.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Adam&nbsp;Watson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1250014/1250014_10227388_1530583688283_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1250014/1250014_10227388_1530583688283_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Plan of Pueblo Bonito"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1250014/1250014_10227388_1530583688283_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Plan of Pueblo Bonito"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: Plan of Pueblo Bonito, contexts to be sampled highlighted in blue (AMNH Anthropology Collections), red (AMNH Ornithology Collections), and gray (Smithsonian NMNH Collections)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Edward Triplett, Chaco Research Archive, University of Virginia, http://www.chacoarchive.org).</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Adam&nbsp;Watson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Plan of Pueblo Bonito</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1250014/1250014_10227388_1530583748386_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1250014/1250014_10227388_1530583748386_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="AMS Dates for Scarlet Macaws"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1250014/1250014_10227388_1530583748386_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="AMS Dates for Scarlet Macaws"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2: AMS Dates for Scarlet Macaws (Ara macao) from Pueblo Bonito and Pueblo del Arroyo in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico;

In the first comparison, the difference in the area-scale relationship between plant-working and hide-working was found to be significant at larger scales (greater than 1 &micro;m&sup2;).  The difference between surfaces abraded by sandstone only and those subsequently subjected to abrasion by plant fibers are most significant at larger scales (1 to 103 &micro;m&sup2;).  Comparison of a sandstone-abraded surface and a surface exposed to prolonged friction with softened deer hide revealed differences discernible and significant at only finer scales (10-1 to 1 &micro;m&sup2;).  Finally, as an additional control, two separate hide-working tools were compared and the difference in wear was not significant.  Our results refined the chronology for one of Chaco Canyon?s largest and most-studied sites and illustrated that texture analysis methods, developed within the mechanical engineering discipline, show great promise for advancing the study of bone tool manufacture and use. Analysis revealed the usefulness of both traditional roughness measures and multi-scale geometric analysis using area-scale fractal techniques for characterizing and discriminating microtopographic differences as a function of tool use.  Our data will be available to researchers through the publicly accessible Chaco Research Archive web site in the near future.
