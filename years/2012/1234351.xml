<AbstractNarration>A scientist from the University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, will make high quality chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) measurements during the 2013 GEOTRACES cruise to the Eastern Tropical South Pacific Ocean.  These measurements will provide an overall oceanographic context for the cruise, as well as contribute to the interpretation of GEOTRACES trace elements and their isotopes (TEIs) by characterizing the physical processes which can affect their speciation and internal cycling.  In addition, for the low oxygen waters in the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), the researcher will distinguish water that is old as a result of physical circulation processes from recently renewed, yet low oxygen waters due to biochemical processes.  Tracer ages will help constrain the residence times of the OMZ layers.  Secondly, rates of biochemically important processes such as apparent oxygen utilization and denitrification in upwelling areas, the OMZ, and low nitrate regions will be compared with estimates from historical data.  Lastly, ventilated thermocline and intermediate water masses within which TEIs reside will be identified and their effective time scales of circulation from the source regions will be estimated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of the broader impacts, the scientist will continue her active participation in the National Science Foundation ADVANCE program, as well as the Mentoring Physical Oceanography Women to Increase Retention (MPOWIR) program.  One graduate student will be supported and trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the Earth has warmed due to increasing greenhouse gases, most of the heat has been absorbed by the ocean. The ocean provides at least half of the oxygen to the Earth?s atmosphere. The ocean provides about half of the oxygen that living organisms breathe.  Climate models suggest that warming associated with greenhouse gases will lead to increased stratification and decreased solubility of gases in the ocean.  Both increased stratification and decreased solubility will negatively impact the global ocean oxygen reservoir and in particular the oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). OMZs are located adjacent to - eastward and equatorward of subtropical gyres.  The OMZs are regions isolated by the subtropical gyre circulation; and they have high productivity due to upwelling along the coast.  Oxygen concentrations in the ocean and in the OMZs have been shown to be affected by climate change; however, the processes affecting these changes are not well understood or quantified.  Our work compares recent Geotraces (2013) observations to historical data (1990s). We find that the OMZ shows signs of vertical expansion probably due to increased biological activity.
