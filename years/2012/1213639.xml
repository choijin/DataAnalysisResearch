<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professors Krishna Foster of California State University- Los Angeles and Donald Dabdub of the University of California- Irvine in a collaborative effort that will investigate the chemical kinetics of oxy-polyaromatic hydrocarbons (oxy-PAH) in surrogates of particulate matter to elucidate the impact of this chemistry on the oxidizing capacity of the lower atmosphere. Photolytically excited oxy-PAH readily transfer energy to ground state molecular oxygen, producing the reactive oxygen species singlet molecular oxygen. This proposal is based on the premise that these reactions may take place on aged particulate matter, and consequently, impacts the oxidation capacity of the lower atmosphere. Innovative aspects of the proposal include the application of emerging quantitative HPLC/MS techniques for oxy-PAH to the discipline of chemical kinetics and MS analysis of gaseous mixtures. This is an interdisciplinary, collaborative project between a chemistry professor at a non-Ph.D. granting Hispanic Serving Institution and an engineering professor at a local Ph.D. granting institution. This model maximizes resources by advancing science and developing human resources simultaneously. Success of the proposed research will improve air quality models, and consequently, impact millions of people, especially those living in urban areas. The inclusion of undergraduates from groups underrepresented in the sciences, reflective of the California State University- Los Angeles population, will be a high priority. This project has the potential to increase the number of underrepresented students who select careers in the chemical sciences and pursue graduate education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to determine the impact of air pollutants on the oxidation capacity of the lower atmosphere.  The pollutants under investigation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), have the ability to store solar energy in their electronic structures.  This energy is readily transferred to molecular oxygen producing an aggressive oxidant known as singlet molecular oxygen, which can proceed to efficiently oxidize alkenes.  Characterizing the efficiency of the energy transfer from PAH to molecular oxygen is essential for determining the significance of these reactions on air quality, especially in polluted urban atmospheres. Results of this project include the measurement of singlet oxygen sensitizer quantum yields that quantify the efficiency of energy transfer from irradiated PAH to molecular oxygen.  All five PAH and oxidized PAH derivatives tested resulted in extremely high quantum yields with energy transfer efficiencies ranging from 70% - 100%.  Adding this new chemistry to a three-dimensional air quality model resulted in a significant increase in the calculated amount of secondary organic aerosol in the Los Angeles air basin.  Additional experiments were run to characterize the products of oxidized alkenes produced when singlet molecular oxygen formed via energy transfer from PAH was present.  Broader impacts of this research include research training for twelve undergraduate and Masters degree students at a comprehensive, urban university.  Eight of these students were from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences, and five have gone on to pursue their PhD degrees in the molecular sciences launching their own scientific careers.
