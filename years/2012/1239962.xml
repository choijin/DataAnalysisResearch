<AbstractNarration>Parallelism is everywhere in computing systems (such as multicore laptops), and in high end supercomputers.  To program these machines, Message Passing Interface (MPI), which is a de facto standard of portable application programmer interfaces, was being developed by industry, academia, and government participants since 1993.  However, MPI-based parallel programs have traditionally failed to continue to work when hardware faults occur.  Hardware faults are becoming a bigger problem for parallel systems as they grow in size and speed. This work introduces a new solution to fault tolerance at scale for MPI-based programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research advances current state of fault-tolerant MPI by exploring a possibility of applying transactional parallel programming techniques. The main idea is to explore how MPI-based parallel applications benefit from transactions to achieve fault tolerance.  The success of the proposed approach will change the design of middleware, application programmer interfaces, and scalable subsystems that support such parallel programs (such as input-output systems).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this NSF EAGER were as follows: * Design of an alternative fault-tolerant approach to the Message Passing Interface that differs substantially in approach and substance from standards being developed and other previous and on-going research.  * Early prototyping of the application programmer interface of that set of add-on operations.  * A study of the literature involving containment domains for fault tolerance and the use of a transactional model for fault tolerance in non-parallel computing settings.  * Publications and presentations at conferences and at the Message Passing Interface Forum (MPI Forum), concerning this work.  * Collaboraion with Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, concerning this work and potential follow-ons.  * Substantial progress by one student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham toward the completion of his PhD related to this work.  * Support for the advancement of additional students at UAB regarding fault-tolerant parallel computing research.  Our conclusion thus far is that the use of lightweight transactions with a non-blocking subset of the MPI-3 (and MPI-4) standards, leads to a significantly enhanced strategy for providing resilient parallel programming as compared to other options being considered by others.    The potential for utilizing "partial consensus" or "consensus with timeout" represents an additional area of promise from what we learned during the period of performance.
