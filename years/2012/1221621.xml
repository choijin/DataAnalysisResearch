<AbstractNarration>Following on the outcomes of an NSF-funded conference to this project's principal investigator, a team of educators, scientists, and communication experts from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, University of Massachusetts Boston, Hofstra, University, the Boston Museum of Science and other professionals is implementing a full-scale development project to investigate the impact of an Out-of-Home Multi-Media (OHMM) exhibit on adults riding Boston's subway system (the "T"). The project's goal is to design, implement, and study the efficacy of an OHMM model for free-choice science learning about our changing climate. A rotating exhibit of twelve specially designed placards, posters, as well as virtual, web-based learning resources linked to the exhibit content will potentially engage over 420,000 adult riders per day along two of the T's four lines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless access throughout light rail systems and the rise of smart phones represent a confluence of factors making an innovative form of engagement possible. The work is positioned to test this new model for informal science education and potentially could be expanded in Boston and into other cities around the country.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Americans learn the vast majority of their science outside of classroom settings. While much effort is spent on developing national, state, and district-wide science curricula in schools and colleges in addition to &nbsp;science exhibits in free-choice learning establishments across the nation to ensure basic science literacy, less effort is spent on exploring effective strategies for the public to engage in science learning in their daily lives. ScienceToGo.org was an award-winning collaboration, led by UMass Lowell that included the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), UMass Boston, Texas State University, and the Museum of Science, that gave people living and visiting Boston the opportunity to learn science in the most unexpected places such as riding a subway train while commuting to work or walking down the sidewalk.</p> <p>For 14 months spanning across parts of 2013 and 2014, the ScienceToGo.org team explored new ways to share science with the public using &ldquo;out-of-home media&rdquo; by combining posters on the platforms and placards inside the train cars of the T (Boston&rsquo;s public subway system) with physical exhibits and events around the City of Boston. Online resources, text interfaces, and social media were used to further engage those individuals that wanted to learn more. When designing the out-of-home media science education products, ScienceToGo.org chose to focus on climate change, one of the most important and challenging issues of our time.&nbsp; Our target audience was the 400,000+ daily riders on the Red and Orange lines of the Boston T&mdash;80% were regular commuters with the rest described as occasional riders. Ozzie the Ostrich, our spokescharacter, and his friends proved to be memorable, widely appealing, and effective at stimulating engagement.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Humor proved to be an important component for engaging riders as it provided an avenue to deliver serious content in a non-threatening and non-judgmental way, while text messaging allowed engaged riders to learn more about specific questions we posed each month.&nbsp;</p> <p>Results indicate 73% of riders saw the ostrich posters, and of those who saw the signage, 85% engaged with the campaign by reading, thinking about, and/or talking about the posters, and 16% reported actively interacting with the ScienceToGo.org campaign by going to the website, Facebook page, Twitter feed, and/or text interface.&nbsp;Also, a majority of the riders surveyed found the posters to be <em>very </em>or <em>extremely </em>successful at catching attention, being entertaining, teaching about climate change, and showing ways to slow climate change.&nbsp; Just under half of riders found the posters successful at making them want to learn more about climate change and illustrating how climate change impacts Boston.&nbsp; The riders who were most likely to further engage with the posters were frequent treatment line riders, riders younger than 50, and science museum enthusiasts.&nbsp;In addition, above-ground events featuring colorful 9 ft. ostrich-shaped educational art installations were well-received by the community with an estimated 110,000 people walking by the ostrich displays, and about 18% of those people stopping and engaging with them.&nbsp;</p> <p>In February 2015, David Lustick, the Principal Investigator, was honored by the White House as a Champion of Change.&nbsp; ScienceToGo.org was discussed as an exemplar of how to address climate literacy within a specific community.&nbsp; In June 2015, the ScienceToGo.org Research Team was honored by the Mayor of Boston with their prestigious &lsquo;Greenovate Award&rsquo; given to individuals and projects that demonstrate effective leadership in environmental education. Overall, ScienceToGo.org demonstrated that out-of-home media can be an effective mode of informal science education about important issues to a large number and diverse set of individuals who might not normally seek out opportunities to learn science. Humor along with a consistent, recognizable character taking a journey alongside regular T-riders, and multiple opportunities to interact and learn more proved to be effective strategies. ScienceToGo.org captured the imagination of many viewers, informal educators, and decision-makers and suggests that innovative adverting and communication strategies may take their place alongside textbooks and classrooms in educating the public about science.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;F&nbsp;Chen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol">
