<AbstractNarration>The research supported by this award is concerned with the analysis and numerical modeling of problems that arise in the basic and applied physics of liquid crystals.  Specifically, this award will support research in two interrelated areas: (1) development of more efficient numerical methods for characterizing the equilibrium orientational properties of liquid crystals in the large-scale regime (three space dimensions) and (2) refined analysis of the nature of the coupling between liquid crystal orientational order and electric fields.  The most commonly used models for liquid crystals at experimental and device scales are macroscopic continuum director models, which model local average orientation in terms of a unit-length vector field (the "director field"). The principal investigator will use techniques from numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization (saddle point problems, nullspace methods, reduced Hessian methods, preconditioning) to develop efficient solvers that deal effectively with the pointwise unit-length constraint associated with discretizations of such models, for which current approaches are inadequate in large-scale settings.  Most liquid crystal devices and experiments utilize electric fields to control liquid crystal order, and the interaction between liquid crystal orientation and local electric field poses both numerical and analytical challenges (due to coupled equilibrium equations, free energies failing to be positive definite, and anomalous behavior of instability thresholds). The principal investigator will develop a variationally based, unified stability framework capable of providing computable local stability criteria for numerical solutions (in the discretized setting) and also capable of explaining anomalous instability thresholds (in the continuum setting).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid crystal materials exist in a complex fluid phase that exhibits orientational order of molecular axes at the microscopic level, just like a crystal.  Virtually all of their material properties are anisotropic, that is, they are direction dependent (unlike ordinary liquids which look and behave the same in all directions).  The orientational properties can therefore be coupled to a variety of external fields (electromagnetic, optical, temperature gradients, acoustic waves, etc.). The well-known use of liquid crystals in optical displays makes use of this behavior. However, the special properties of these materials make them useful in a much wider range of technological applications, including also drug delivery systems, soft actuators, biosensors, and others.  Scientific computing is widely used in this area to optimize the performance of devices, to analyze experiments, and to validate the theory that is used to describe such devices.  This award will support the development of advanced computational techniques for the numerical exploration of equilibrium orientational properties of large, complicated, modern liquid crystal systems associated with realistic devices and experiments, especially those involving coupled electric fields.  Special attention is given to the nature of the coupling between the liquid crystal order and an applied electric field and to electric-field-induced instabilities of orientational order, which underlie the functioning of most devices and for which a deeper understanding is needed.  The research will be carried out in collaboration with interdisciplinary and international partners, and it will impact applications and technologies using liquid crystals through improved performance analysis tools and techniques for interpreting experiments.  The impact is expected to extend to the numerical modeling of ferromagnetic materials such as magnetic films used in hard drives, where models with similar features arise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant has supported research on liquid crystal materials, the numerical modeling of liquid crystal devices and experiments, and the interactions of these materials with electric fields.  The liquid crystal phase is a fluid state of matter (realized by certain materials in certain ranges of temperature or concentration) in which there is some form of molecular orientational order.  Such materials exhibit a number of interesting properties, including their ability to influence light propagation, which is the basis for their widespread use in display technologies.  In all but the simplest settings, it is necessary to rely on scientific computation to determine the properties and behaviors of liquid crystal materials in given devices or experiments.  The mathematical models of such systems are complicated and have features that make them challenging to deal with in such numerical modeling and computation.  Once well enough understood, however, these unique features can be exploited to advantage, and this was the main thrust of the first half of this research.  Liquid crystals are responsive to external fields, and these can be used to control the orientational properties, which in turn control the optical properties.  Commonly used for experiments are magnetic fields or electric fields (or sometimes a combination of both); whereas devices are almost always controlled by electric fields.  There are some subtle differences between the coupling of magnetic fields versus electric fields with the liquid crystal orientational properties, and some of these differences remain not fully appreciated (or simply wrong) in standard references.  Since virtually all liquid crystal devices are controlled by electric fields, the second half of this research project was devoted to these aspects.  We note that this grant was suspended for two years while the Principal Investigator worked as a Temporary Program Manager at the National Science Foundation.  In the area of numerical methods, two main results have been obtained, both focusing on solution algorithms for the large systems of equations that result when such mathematical models are "discretized" (put in a form that is amenable to computer solution).  All such solution procedures are "iterative" in nature, that is, they perform a certain process over and over again, successively improving an initial guess for the solution until an acceptable accuracy has been obtained.  The main results of our research in this area have been the development of an improved iteration procedure plus an acceleration procedure (a "preconditioner") for a part of the algorithm that is repeated several times in each iterative step.  These algorithmic improvements have resulted in solution procedures that take less execution time (are more efficient) and which converge to desired solutions from less accurate initial guesses (are more robust).  This part of the research has been in collaboration with a numerical analyst in Scotland and has appeared in journal publications.  Two main results have also been obtained in the area of electric-field effects.  The first of these concerns the discovery and analysis of a difference between magnetic-field versus electric-field induced "instabilities" (abrupt changes in orientational properties as a critical field strength is reached) whereby in certain particular geometries, electric-field instabilities occur at a higher field strength than predicted by the simplistic analysis found in standard references.  This corrects and explains a misunderstanding that has existed for many years.  The second result in this area concerns the forces and pressures inside a liquid crystal material under the influence of an electric field, correcting previously accepted (but incorrect) formulations found in the literature.  Correct formulations for such forces are needed for accurate modeling of flows of liquid crystals under the influence of electric fields (as occurs, for example, during "switching" in liquid crystal cells in display devices).  These results have not appeared in print as of this time.  It is hoped that they will have a strong impact on the modeling of liquid crystal systems (devices and experiments) under the influence of electric fields.
