<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;31 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1219431&lt;br/&gt;Institution: San Jose State University, Moss Landing Marine Labs&lt;br/&gt;PI:  S. Lamerdin&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI:  J. Harvey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the San Jose State University, Moss Landing Marine Labs (MLML) for use aboard the R/V POINT SUR; namely a new global distress communication suite (GMDSS), a forward-looking sonar, an oily water separator, and a night vision thermal imaging camera.  These items will either allow the vessel to meet regulatory requirements or enhance operational safety; particularly for the planned Antarctic deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The R/V POINT SUR supports federally-funded scientific research in the Pacific Northwest in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Pubic outreach is also achieved through the State?s Center for Integrative Coastal Observation, Research and Education program (CI-CORE) and the Alliance for Coastal Technologies program (ACT), real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house events.  The POINT SUR is scheduled to complete over 60 NSF sponsored days in 2012.</AbstractNarration>
