<AbstractNarration>Across the Arctic, paleolimnological records provide some of the few key archives documenting rates of ecological change in this region over the Holocene. In particular, striking changes in communities of diatoms (a type of algae that responds rapidly to environmental change and leaves a fossil in lake sediments) have occurred over the last 150 years, with species generally associated with warmer conditions increasing at unprecedented rates in the sediment record. However, changes in diatom assemblages in lake sediments from west Greenland are different from those in the rest of the Arctic in that they are rich in these 'warmer' water diatoms throughout the Holocene. This difference has raised questions about what we can use diatoms to infer in the Arctic, and suggests the need to clarify the ecological traits of key diatom taxa in order to advance our understanding of drivers of change. Recent research in alpine regions reveals that key diatom species that are used as indicators of 20th century warming in both arctic and alpine lakes respond specifically to both climate-induced changes in energy (mixing depths) and mass inputs (nutrients) to lake ecosystems. This suggests that spatially- and temporally-variable interactions between climate-induced changes in the physical and chemical structure of lakes may drive diatom community changes, but this is currently untested in arctic lakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will couple comparative lake sampling with both small- and large-scale experiments to provide key ecological information that will enable interpretation of climate- induced ecological changes from several existing diatom records from southwest Greenland. The objective of this project is to determine the effects of climate-driven changes in nutrients and water column stability on the relative abundances of key diatom taxa, and to apply that information to existing diatom records to determine climate-induced changes in these lake ecosystems. A suite of lakes will be sampled to determine the factors controlling the distributions of key diatom species. A small-scale experiment will be conducted to assess the importance of nutrients and incubation depth on the abundances of these key diatom species. A large-scale experiment (whole lake manipulation) will be conducted to assess the importance of thermal stratification on these diatoms, which will be tested by deepening the mixed layer of a lake that typically stratifies thermallyduring the summer. This large-scale experiment will be the first whole-lake ecosystem test of the importance of changing energy influx on the community structure of these arctic lakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide support for a postdoctoral research associate at the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine. The postdoctoral associate will gain valuable experience conducting arctic ecosystems research, mentoring undergraduate students, and working in a multidisciplinary institute focused on multiple aspects of climate change. This research will also involve two undergraduates over the course of the project. A distributed graduate seminar focused on climate change and high latitude and altitude lake ecosystems will be developed and taught in conjunction with ecologists from four countries. Data from this project will be made available through the NOAA paleoclimate database and website, and the Diatom Paleolimnology Data Cooperative website.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Greenland is one of the most rapidly changing areas of the planet, and it is important to understand the environmental history of such changing areas. It is also important to provide a longer-term perspective on environmental change across the Arctic system, of which Greenland is an important component. Diatoms, a type of single-celled algae that lives in lakes, are one tool that can provide this long-term perspective of environmental conditions. This is because these organisms leave a fossil behind in lake sediments, and they are highly responsive to changes in the environment. For example, some species will become more abundant with salinity increases, while others become more abundant as waters freshen. While there are many diatom fossil records from lakes in Greenland, they are difficult to interpret due to a lack of explicit ecological information for key species. The objective of this project was to collect this ecological information for key species so that fossil records can be more easily interpreted. Specifically, the objective of this project was to determine the effects of environmental changes that alter nutrients as well as water column mixing (i.e. circulation) on the success of key diatom taxa. To achieve this objective, we assessed how species are distributed across lakes today. We also conducted experiments at different scales, from small containers to an entire lake. The research activities also enabled us to clarify patterns of lake response to seasons, in particular how earlier or later ice off from lakes might affect lake mixing for the summer season. All of the research activities revealed that light and nutrients are important for diatoms, but there are different relationships for different species. For example, the small diatom <em>Discostella stelligera</em> is associated with higher light and moderate nutrients, found in shallower mixing of lake waters, which in this area is often found when spring is cooler and summer is warmer. In contrast, the diatom <em>Lindavia intermedia</em> is associated with lower light, found in deeper mixing of lake waters, which in this area occurs with warmer spring conditions. This ecological information can now be used by paleolimnologists to infer past environmental conditions from diatom fossil records in this area. The project activities resulted in the production of seven peer-reviewed journal articles and ten presentations at scientific conferences. Training was provided for one postdoctoral associate, four graduate students (three in Environmental Sciences and one in Communication), and one undergraduate student. A Virtual Field Experience for middle school students was produced and disseminated, and NSF&rsquo;s Science Nation released a short video about the project. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/04/2017<br>      Modified by: Jasmine&nbsp;Saros</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1203434/1203434_10184106_1488646319103_Cyclotella--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1203434/1203434_10184106_1488646319103_Cyclotella--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cyclotella"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1203434/1203434_10184106_1488646319103_Cyclotella--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cyclotella"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Example of a diatom fossil found in lake sediments</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jeffery Stone</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jasmine&nbsp;Saros</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cyclotella</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
