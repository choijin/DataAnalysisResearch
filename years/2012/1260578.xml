<AbstractNarration>Mapping and sampling of a portion of the mid-Atlantic spreading center, where a unique geochemical signature was determined for a 1980's 'popping rock' sample, will take advantage of recent recognition that tectonic deformation may play a role in focusing volatile fluxing from the mantle. Geophysical mapping, targeted sampling by ROV, and a complete suite of post-cruise geochemical analyses aim to determine whether the early quantification of mantle volatiles was representative for the region and/or whether such signatures cluster only near faults, thus implying localized fluxing. Such finding could uproot long-standing inferences about background mantle volatile contents. Students will be introduced to marine research and a postdoc will delve into a new aspect of spreading center processes. Collaboration with IPGP France will train these young scientists in integrated, international, interdisciplinary geoscience.</AbstractNarration>

The program began with a semester long course on marine geology field techniques, which culminated in development of student projects designed to leverage data to be collected during the cruise. The four students then participated in the 2018 field expedition followed by a 6-week summer research program where they pursued projects of their own design.  Three of the students subsequently presented results of their efforts at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December, 2018.
