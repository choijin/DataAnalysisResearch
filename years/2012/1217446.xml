<AbstractNarration>This award will support the URI Graduate School of Oceanography Marine Office in its ongoing efforts to operate R/V Endeavor in support of our nations oceanographic science community for CY 2012. R/V Endeavor has had a 35-year record of efficient, safe, and flexible ship operations combined with a commitment to invest in the future. This is a five-year cooperative agreement, and funding for each year of the agreement will be negotiated and is dependent on the number of days at sea in support of NSF-funded research. R/V Endeavor operates as a UNOLS ship, adhering to the UNOLS safety standards, and NSF inspections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical merit, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2012 R/V Endeavor will take four NSF sponsored research programs to sea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These peer-reviewed projects supported by operations on R/V Endeavor in 2012 have been rigorously evaluated for scientific and intellectual merit as an integral part of the NSF grant review and award process. The competitive nature of the award granting process ensures a very high level of intellectual merit. Knowledge gained and the discoveries made by the research programs supported by R/V Endeavor will enhance understanding of the oceans and address a broad range of important scientific questions. The goal of this proposal is to provide funding support to safely and productively operate and maintain R/V Endeavor in 2012 and to ensure it is maintained to support its planned life-cycle. This support is an essential prerequisite for safe and successful scientific missions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boarder Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The State of Rhode Island-supported RI Endeavor Program provides Rhode Islanders with direct access to the scientific research and educational capabilities of RV Endeavor. As part of the RI Endeavor Program, educators are provided &lt;br/&gt;The Rhode Island Teacher At Sea (RITAS) Program, designed by the Office of Marine Programs (OMP), establishes sustainable partnerships among ocean scientists, researchers and teachers who live and teach in Rhode Island. Teachers selected for the RITAS Program will become part of a scientific research team conducting ocean science research while cruising aboard the RV Endeavor. &amp;#8232;&amp;#8232;All K-12 educators of Science, Technology, Art, Math, English and History are invited to apply. There is no application deadline. &lt;br/&gt;GSO is unique in the breadth, success, and national and international reputation of its public service and outreach programs. Four groups at the Narragansett Bay Campus are actively engaged in concerted public service and outreach efforts: the Coastal Institute (CI), Coastal Resources Center (CRC), Office of Marine Programs (OMP), and Rhode Island Sea Grant (RISG).</AbstractNarration>

In the past seven years the Endeavor operated in Canada, all along the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, Iceland, the Azores, off the Western coast of Africa, and the eastern offshores of South America. Endeavor also carried 53 different Principal Investigators along with their crews of scientists, engineers, technicians, observers, and students on these expeditions. In this time frame the ship's crew and Marine Technicians safely and successfully completed 123 science missions.  The continued support of the URI-GSO Marine Office in its role as operator of the Endeavor greatly benefits the science community at large and here at the Graduate School of Oceanography. Both Graduate and Undergraduate students experienced firsthand the world of seagoing oceanography.  The University of Rhode Island participated in a large number of outreach programs in which the Endeavor operation plays both major and minor roles. The State of Rhode Island-supported Rhode Island Endeavor Program (RIEP) provided Rhode Islanders with direct access to the scientific research and educational capabilities of Endeavor. As part of the Rhode Island Endeavor Program, educators were provided sea-going research experiences through the RI Teacher at Sea Program ( https://web.uri.edu/gso/research/outreach/rhode-island-teachers-at-sea-program/). They participated in the cruises, and related their experiences to their school children ashore through various means.  The Endeavor was also utilized by Principle Investigators Dr. Clare Reimers/OSU and Dr. David Ullman/URI-GSO in 2013 for a Chief Scientist Training Cruise.  New scientists were instructed on initiating proposals for scheduled ship time, conducting pre-cruise meetings, and everything they need to consider in advance of leading an expedition at sea. URI-GSO helped in hosting these UNOLS sessions and facility tours. At sea the scientists learned how to manage a cruise as a PI or Chief Scientist while carring out water column and seafloor sampling including net tows, multi-coring, performing CTD casts, and gathering ADCP data.  Along with the various physical, geological, chemical, and biological data collected, the Endeavor continued as one of the leading research ships in the nation for submission of marine weather observations to the National Weather Service?s Voluntary Observing Ship Program.  Annually Endeavor averaged a transmission of over 7,000 discrete in-situ weather observations that help refine critical real-time maritime weather observations and define the global climate to help measure extreme weather events, climate variability, and long-term climate changes.
