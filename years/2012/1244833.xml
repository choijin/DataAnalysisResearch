<AbstractNarration>The project is expanding the WeBWork homework delivery tool into engineering. It generates a repository of WeBWorK engineering problems for three core, semester-long, sophomore-level engineering courses: Statics and Mechanics of Materials, Electrical Engineering and Circuits, and Thermodynamics. The problem library is being made available worldwide for free public utilization. The project includes a research component to study the effect of online engineering homework on student learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the electronic nature of the freely available repository, this project has the potential to impact students and faculty from a broad range of schools, including minority institutions, community colleges and non-PhD-granting institutions. The project builds on the success of WeBWorK in mathematics and expands it to engineering. The project team continues to embrace the open-source concept as a means to expand the project and disseminate results, thereby enhancing infrastructure in engineering education. A project website is being created and maintained, which updates the engineering community about assessment studies, journal publications, and training opportunities. In addition to in-house training, a two-day workshop is being hosted for ten external participants, and a workshop is being offered at an American Society for Engineering Education annual meeting. The research and assessment from this project has the potential to shape future directions in engineering education.</AbstractNarration>

The project met and exceeded this objective with the creation of over 550 problems for these three courses as well as an advanced mechanics of materials course.
