<AbstractNarration>This project is to design, develop, operate, and analyse the results of a 6U CubeSat mission named the Lower Atmosphere/Ionosphere Coupling Experiment (LAICE). The overarching objective to investigate the gravity wave-driven coupling between the terrestrial atmosphere and the lower thermosphere/ ionosphere. In-situ instrumentation will measure the perturbations the waves produce in both neutral and ion densities at F-region heights, while on-board photometers will simultaneously measure the wavelengths and amplitudes of the wave fields in the upper mesosphere. Subsequent modeling coupled with meteorological data will reveal the connections between tropospheric storms and the MLTI system using state-of-the-art ray tracing techniques that include the effects of wave dissipation. The ionospheric ion density and temperature will be measured in-situ via the retarding potential analysis (RPA) technique.  The electronics for the RPA will be built at Virginia Tech, but will involve only minor modifications to the flight proven UT Dallas design.  The in-situ upper atmospheric neutral gas density will be measured by two distinct sensors: a traditional Bayard-Alpert (BA) ion gauge provided by the Aerospace Corporation, and new, diamond-like carbon (DLC) microtip-based gauge design that is better adapted to the power constraints of a CubeSat mission.  The University of Illinois will provide a suite of nadir-viewing photometers to measure perturbations in the O2 (0-0) Atmospheric (A) and O2 Herzberg I (HI) band airglow emissions in the 90-100 km region during the nighttime portion of the orbit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mission is the first of its kind; no previous satellite experiment has ever been devoted to identifying causal gravity wave links between the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere, and no previous experiment has systematically mapped active gravity wave regions at low and middle latitudes through direct observation of their ionospheric effects.  These waves are a vitally important but under-explored facet of atmospheric physics.  They strongly influence the dynamics of the media through which they travel by modifying the structure of the atmosphere at altitudes well above their source regions, and they may seed the development of plasma instabilities that scintillate and disrupt radio propagation.  The fundamental science goals of the experiment are to: 1) systematically observe gravity waves with large vertical wavelengths at lower F-region heights, and correlate on a global scale remotely-sensed wave-induced airglow perturbations in the upper mesosphere with in-situ measurements of ion and neutral density fluctuations at higher altitudes, and 2) produce global maps of active gravity wave regions in the mid- and low-latitude ionosphere over multiple seasons at all local times, so that global patterns and climatological variations can be quantitatively compared to and correlated with terrestrial weather systems via modeling.  The challenging cubesat mission is a high-risk effort but one with immensely high potential pay-off in providing a unique observational dataset of fundamental thermosphere and ionosphere parameters and related cutting-edge scientific findings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active collaborations between engineering students at Virginia Tech and the University of Illinois will be established during the design, fabrication, integration, and environmental testing of the LAICE payloads and spacecraft; at least 60 undergraduates will participate in one or more phases of the development work, and in subsequent data analysis activities.  Strong collaboration will occur between the schools in instrumentation systems, satellite communications, and data analysis. Facilities at both institutions will be used to test, integrate, and calibrate spaceflight hardware, and results will be presented at annual small-spacecraft conferences.  All data and scientific findings that flow from the experiment will be made publicly available via a web interface established for this purpose.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  LAICE (Lower Atmosphere Ionosphere Coupling Experiment) is a low Earth orbit (LEO) collaborative cubesat mission focused on understanding how atmospheric gravity waves generated by weather systems in the lower atmosphere propagate and deliver energy and effects on the winds in the mesosphere, lower thermosphere, and ionosphere (MLTI). These waves are important,  under-explored facet of atmospheric physics. They strongly influence the dynamics of the media through which they travel by modifying the structure of the atmosphere at altitudes well above their source regions.               LAICE is the first large (6U) CubeSat funded by the NSF.  Most CubeSats are 1/6-1/2 the volume of LAICE .  It is the first satellite investigation to attempt to connect the causes and effects of these waves in three widely different altitude ranges, in a global mission.   In-situ instrumentation aboard the LAICE satellite will measure perturbations produced by these waves in the neutral and ion densities in the ionosphere, while onboard light sensors will simultaneously measure the amplitudes of the wave fields produced in a thin airglow layer at 95 km, where atmospheric waves perturb the airglow brightness. Subsequent modeling coupled with meteorological data will provide the basis to investigate the connections between selected weather distrubances and the upper atmosphere/ionosphere using state-of-the-art ray tracing techniques that include the effects of wave dissipation.              The satellite has been assembled and tested in a chamber which simulates the space environment.  It is going through some minor repairs and coding of the onboard computer, after which it will be delivered to NASA in the spring, 2018 for a deployment to the International Space Station.  Subsequent to delivery to ISS, NASA will deploy the satellite using a facility called ?nanoracks?.  In that process, the deployer is directed to open a compartment from which the satellite enters space, free of the ISS, and becomes controlled by the ground station teams at the U of Illinois and Virginia Tech.  Some of the engineering data will be relayed to and from the satellite from both Universities, but most of the science data will be transferred to a receiver at the NASA, Wallops Island, Virginia facility.  The satellite will initially be in a 400 km altitude, circular orbit, at 52o inclination, enabling it to make both mid and low latitude studies.  The orbital lifetime of the satellite is expected to be approximately 2 years.               The satellite, including the payloads to make the scientific measurements, has taken ~5 years to build, largely by graduate and undergraduate students combined from both universities.  More than 200 undergraduate students have been involved in the process of building the satellite and the ground infrastructure used for testing.  In the final phase, the NSF funds has been spent except for parts, from summer, 2016- fall, 2017.  The engineering achievements and testing of the satellite and payloads in this time frame has been accomplished by a large force of volunteer students, primarily undergraduates, all of whom are dedicated to see the LAICE satellite successfully deployed and making scientific measurements.  The experience the students gain from the hands on experience with a large, systems engineering progect has tremendous value to their education, that would not have been available to them without this project.
