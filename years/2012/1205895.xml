<AbstractNarration>This project is a collaborative effort between Bryn Mawr College and Ursinus College in which we are exploring the coherent control of interactions among ultracold Rydberg atoms with a combination of experimental and computational efforts.  When atoms in an ultracold gas are excited to weakly bound Rydberg states, they can exchange energy through a dipole-dipole interaction.  In many cases this energy exchange proceeds quickly enough that the atoms are essentially stationary, resembling an amorphous solid.  This leads to complicated many-body processes during the energy exchange that can be manipulated with a variety of techniques.  We are focusing our efforts on coherently controlling the dipole-dipole energy exchange among atoms by exciting coherent superpositions of initial states, arranging the Rydberg atoms in particular spatial patterns, and manipulating the geometry and timing of the electric field used to tune this energy exchange into resonance. These experiments are helping to expand the toolkit for controlling atomic interactions.  We are modeling the experiments using parallel computing resources in order to contribute to the understanding of the complex many-body interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cold Rydberg atoms provide a rich system in which to explore a range of fundamental physics that is of interest to a broad segment of the community.  The precision with which both the internal structure of each atom and the spatial arrangement of these atoms can be controlled will allow us to study many-body and correlation effects for a range of configurations.  The interest in ultracold gases coupled by long range dipole-dipole interactions has grown rapidly in recent years and is being explored using atoms with large magnetic spins and heteronuclear molecules as well as Rydberg atoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will engage undergraduates, with particular attention to attracting female students, at both Bryn Mawr and Ursinus in computational and experimental research on ultracold Rydberg atoms.  Bryn Mawr and Ursinus are small, national liberal arts colleges located in close proximity in southeastern Pennsylvania.  Bryn Mawr awards a small number of PhDs and this project will also support a graduate student.  The collaborative nature of the project will broaden opportunities for students at both institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="TextBody">Rydberg atoms are those in which an outer electron is excited to a high-energy state and is consequently only weakly bound to the atom. The exaggerated properties of Rydberg atoms &ndash; relatively large sizes, strong interatomic interactions, sensitivity to external fields &ndash; make them ideal laboratories for quantum physics. Studying Rydberg atoms themselves can yield insights into fundamental quantum physics while they can also be used to model more difficult-to-study systems. In our work, we have explored the way the interactions among Rydberg atoms can redistribute energy over space and time and we have examined the ionization process with an eye toward controlling it.</p> <p class="TextBody">&nbsp;</p> <p class="TextBody">Two Rydberg atoms can exchange energy when the outer electron in one atom falls to a lower state while the outer electron in the other atom jumps to a correspondingly higher state. This process only works efficiently when the first electron&rsquo;s energy loss is the same as the second electron&rsquo;s energy gain; in other words, energy must be conserved. Fortunately, the energy levels of Rydberg atoms are easily manipulated by experimentally applied electric and magnetic fields. This means that it is relatively easy to arrange for the interaction to occur and, furthermore, to control the interaction by turning it on and off.</p> <p class="TextBody">&nbsp;</p> <p class="TextBody">In our recent work, we have studied, both in experiment and simulation, the way in which Rydberg atom interactions can redistribute energy. In one experiment, we excited two parallel columns of atoms, separated by a few thousandths of a millimeter, to different Rydberg states. One column of atoms was in a higher energy state than the other column and the atoms in different columns could exchange energy as described above. We measured which atoms were in the higher energy state by ionizing those atoms and sending the resulting electron to a detector. Along their path to the detector were electric fields that spread the signal out in space giving us a magnified picture of the spatial energy distribution. We measured the energy distribution at different times and the results are shown in Fig. 1.</p> <p class="TextBody">&nbsp;</p> <p class="TextBody">We also examined a similar system in supercomputer simulations. In this experiment, we were interested in the effect that the initial positions of the atoms would have on the way the energy spread through the system. The energy exchange between two atoms also depends on the way that they are oriented with respect to each other. Thus, if we control the orientation, we can control the way in which the energy moves among the atoms. As shown in Fig. 2, the energy spreads more quickly in different directions, depending upon the way in which the atoms are initially oriented by an experimentally applied electric field.</p> <p class="TextBody">&nbsp;</p> <p class="TextBody">In a separate set of experiments, we have studied the ionization of the Rydberg electron. Ionizing and detecting this electron is a widely used experimental technique for measuring the energy and state distribution in a sample of Rydberg atoms (as described in our experiments above). We excited the Rydberg electron to a superposition of three states that are closely spaced in energy. To ionize this electron, a rapidly increasing electric field is applied to the atom. This field not only strips the electron from the atom, but it also shifts the many available energy levels so that the electron follows a complicated path to ionization, as shown in Fig. 3, where each of the initial states are shown in a different color.</p> <p class="TextBody">&nbsp;</p> <p class="TextBody">The map shown in Fig. 3 is the result of a calculation on a supercomputer that accurately accounts for the signal that we measure on our detector. It is evident from this map that the different paths from the different initial states overlap. These different overlapping paths interfere with each other, producing a signal that oscillates with a frequency characteristic of the energy separation between the states. These oscillations are visible in the data of Fig. 4 as intensity variations along vertical strips of the image.</p> <p class="TextBody">&nbsp;</p> <p class="TextBody">These interference effects are the key to our newest experiment, in which we aim to control the electron&rsquo;s path to ionization. By using a genetic algorithm to evolve a customized rapidly rising electric field, we can use interference to cancel out paths that we do not want the electron to take, while enhancing the paths that we do want. Controlling the electron&rsquo;s path to ionization could greatly improve this important experimental technique.</p> <p class="TextBody">&nbsp;</p> <p class="TextBody">Three graduate and 10 undergraduate students from Bryn Mawr College as well as 19 undergraduate students from Ursinus College were involved in this project. The students and faculty from the two groups met regularly throughout the course of this project. While the Ursinus group led the computational work and the Bryn Mawr group led the experimental work, the close collaboration between the two significantly broadened the experience for all students.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/26/2016<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;W&nbsp;Noel</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1205895/1205895_10201017_1472169075242_imaging--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1205895/1205895_10201017_1472169075242_imaging--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 1:  Spread of energy over time among Rydberg atoms"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1205895/1205895_10201017_1472169075242_imaging--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 1:  Spread of energy over time among Rydberg atoms"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Rudibium atoms are initially excited to two different states in two regions of space; the high energy state is the lower region.
