<AbstractNarration>This project addresses how, when, and why organisms diversify and become distinct species. The focal system is an under-studied biodiversity hotspot:  Mexican pine-oak woodlands. Sampling of 34 emblematic vertebrates will occur across four major mountain ranges in Mexico and linked regions in the United States. Species include 21 birds, 4 amphibians, and 9 reptiles. DNA data will be collected using novel techniques that capture hundreds of genomic regions, which will be assayed to determine:   (1) if there are overlooked cryptic species; (2) whether common barriers (e.g. lowland regions) have influenced diversification across species; and (3) whether the timing of species origins coincides with periods of mountain building or glacial cycling through deep time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will uncover new biodiversity in a part of the world that is known for its species richness and that is under severe threat from habitat loss. Knowing the basic units of biodiversity is the first step toward mitigating such threats. This study will also help understand how biodiversity is generated and over what timescale. All specimens collected will be deposited in natural history collections at two U.S. museums, and will be available for many other studies -- natural history collections are public repositories of biodiversity with virtually limitless future potential on subjects ranging from public health and disease to basic science.</AbstractNarration>

These species are generally co-distributed across the same mountains, some of which are not connected to one another.

These include two new rattlesnake species, a new lizard, and likely new salamanders and frogs. More species will continue to be discovered with our data as analysis continues by us and by the community at large as our data become open-access. In terms of broad-scale results, we found that among birds, there is more movement and interbreeding among mountain ranges that one might suspect from prior studies. This is not the case among reptiles and amphibians, however, where divergences among mountains are older. The most recent mountain range in Mexico, the Transvolcanic Belt, seemed to have played an outsized role not just in diversification during its uplift, but as a later conduit for species dispersal across Mexico. Our project significantly developed both lab and computer based resources for biodiversity study. The results of this project helped show that the molecular markers we used are ideal for this kind of research, contributing to the broad use of these markers in the evolution and systematics community.

This project contributed to professional training of one female postdoc from an under-represented group and four female undergraduates, two of whom are from under-represented groups. This project also brought in two high school teachers from nearby underserved schools for training. Over 25 other undergraduate researchers were introduced to the project, and 220 undergraduates learned how results of the research fit into modern evolutionary and avian biology research. Products of this project enhanced a natural history collection of Mexican birds, the world&rsquo;s largest, where students and the public learn about biodiversity.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/30/2017<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;Mccormack</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258205/1258205_10235466_1498847115049_Moore_Lab_Tour_crop--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258205/1258205_10235466_1498847115049_Moore_Lab_Tour_crop--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Moore Lab Tour"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258205/1258205_10235466_1498847115049_Moore_Lab_Tour_crop--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Moore Lab Tour"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Collections Manager James Maley gives a tour of the Moore Lab collection to the public, one way results of the research were disseminated.</div> <div class="imageCredit">John McCormack</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;Mccormack</div> <div class="imageTitle">Moore Lab Tour</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258205/1258205_10235466_1498847727856_PhotoMay17,103020PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258205/1258205_10235466_1498847727856_PhotoMay17,103020PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Undergraduate Experiences"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258205/1258205_10235466_1498847727856_PhotoMay17,103020PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Undergraduate Experiences"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Undergraduate Liz Connors holds a snake on a field trip.
