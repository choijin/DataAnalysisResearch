<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator will study the arithmetic of integral models of Shimura varieties, with particular emphasis on explicit Arakelov theory and the relations between intersection multiplicities of special cycles and the coefficients of Eisenstein series.  The prototype of such a relation is the Gross-Zagier theorem, whose proof proceeds by computing the arithmetic intersection multiplicities of Heegner points on modular curves, and then comparing these multiplicities with the Fourier coefficients of the kernel function for the Rankin-Selberg convolution L-function.  The PI will prove similar relations for cycles on unitary and orthogonal Shimura varieties, and use these relations to prove Gross-Zagier type theorems for modular forms of higher weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shimura varieties are particular kinds of higher-dimensional surfaces, and their rich geometry and arithmetic puts them among the central objects of study in modern mathematics.  They play an essential role in the Langlands program, which is of increasing interest in theoretical physics, and are essential tools for understanding elliptic curves and abelian varieties, which have applications to cryptography.  The Principal Investigator's research into Shimura varieties is motivated partly by their connections to the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, one the the Clay Mathematics Institute's million-dollar Millenium Prize Problems.  The strongest known results in the direction of this conjecture come from work of Gross and Zagier, whose methods relied on the detailed study of one-dimensional Shimura varieties called modular curves.  The PI will study higher dimensional versions of these results in order to better understand the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, and its generalizations and variants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project deals with the area of pure mathematics known as arithmetic geometry.  At its heart, this subject is about solving systems of polynomial equations.  The set of all solutions to such a system is called a variety.  It is a geometric object, and one hopes to understand it first by applying geometric methods so as to gain insight into the structure of the solutions.  Among its practical applications, the field of arithmetic geometry has come to play a central role in cryptography.   Certain systems of polynomial equations define special geometric objects called Shimura varieties, which have played a central role in number theory and representation theory for at least the last 50 years.  Because these geometric objects have close connections with representation theory (e.g. the theory of modular forms), they are easier to understand than a general variety.  Thus Shimura varieties are a natural testing ground for conjectures.     One of the major open problems in arithmetic geometry is the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture, which predicts that certain aspects of the geometry of varieties is governed by an analytic quantity: the order of vanishing of an L-function.  The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture on ranks of elliptic curves is a special case of this.   The Beilinson-Bloch conjecture is far from solved, but Shimura varieties of unitary and orthogonal type are a natural place to begin its study.   The PI's results include the construction of certain subvarieties of Shimura varieties of unitary and orthogonal type, and results proving that the intersection geometry of these subvarieties is controlled by L-functions.  This provides a bridge leading between the geometric and analytic worlds, which is expected to lead to new cases of the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture; this is the subject of the PI's continuing research.    In addition to its intellectual merit, the broader impacts of the award include the training of Ph.D. students in the mathematical sciences.
