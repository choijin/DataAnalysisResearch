<AbstractNarration>Millions of people around the world carry heavy loads, causing significant stress to their bodies.  This can lead to musculoskeletal injury, which is the second most common reason for seeing a doctor in the United States.  Based on previous NSF-funded research on load carrying during locomotion, the team has developed a proof-of-concept handle suspension technology for carrying loads that significantly reduce the likelihood of injury.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this I-Corps support, the team will investigate the commercial potential of the proposed effort.  Musculoskeletal injuries are common and cost over $850 billion/year in the United States alone.  If successfully commercialized, it is believed that the proposed innovation has the potential to address this significant market opportunity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our overall objective was to test the potential for the commercialization of elastic load carrying devices.  Very low stiffness elastic load carrying devices have the potential to reduce peak loads acting on the body while carrying heavy loads which could reduce the risk of injury.    Intellectual Merit: As part of the NSF I-CORPS program training, our team developed and tested business models using an interview-based hypothesis testing method.  We tested multiple hypotheses regarding the potential benefits of a hand-held elastic suspension device, as well as hypotheses regarding who would benefit.  It was determined that in different industry sectors there are situations where heavy loads are carried.  Across these industires, there is a wide range of conditions and the needs for a hand-held suspension device may be tailored for different applications.  There were also particular needs in different industries for how an elastic-suspension technology would be integrated with existing systems.  As part of our project, we also tested and confirmed the ability of a prototype hand-held suspension to reduce the peak forces acting on the body.  Broader Impacts: The hand-held load carrying suspension has the potential to reduce peak forces acting on the body.  Reduced loads may be associated with lower risk of injury.  Due to the potential general benefits to society of devices that reduce forces acting on the body, there remains potential for commercialization of this technology.
