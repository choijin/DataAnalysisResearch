<AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports research on societal aspects of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. The project will address a number of questions such as how different understandings of the disaster are emerging in Japan and the US, how underlying ideas about nuclear power are changing in the disaster's wake, and what implications these developments have for policy and governance. The researchers will use both quantitative and qualitative methods, including discourse analysis and interviews. The project will compare Japanese and US discourses about Fukushima in three domains: Mass media coverage, legal and policy documents, and stakeholder perspectives from science, industry, and civil society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear power has reemerged as a clean energy source in a time of rising concern with climate change. Public anxiety concerning nuclear accidents remains a key obstacle to further development of this energy technology. It is therefore critically important for scholars and policymakers to understand how events such as the reactor meltdown at Fukushima are interpreted, reported, and affect public attitudes. Since reactor safety and nuclear waste management are matters of international concern, it is also important to understand cross-national similarities and differences in the characterization and communication of nuclear risks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have a number of broader impacts. It will facilitate postdoctoral training and human resources development, inform risk communication practices, and offer advice to bodies such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency.</AbstractNarration>

It addressed how different attitudes toward nuclear technology emerged in both countries, how the disaster altered historical understandings, and the implications of these developments for future nuclear governance. The project analyzed media coverage, legal and policy documents, and ethnographic data from Fukushima and several other sites with strong ties to nuclear technology (e.g., Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Three Mile Island, and Hanford).

Key findings were disseminated through publications in English and Japanese; conferences and workshops; an exhibit; and a new course. The project also led to a longer-term collaboration on transnational nuclear history with French colleagues to explore how sociopolitical factors shaped public understandings of nuclear power.    Five sets of findings emerged from the project.  (1) Historical analysis revealed previously neglected entanglements between national-level narratives on nuclear technology in the two countries. In particular the significant legacy of the postwar US Occupation of Japan and of Cold War politics is reflected in popular and policy understandings of nuclear risks. These cross-national dynamics help explain the carefully maintained boundary between military and civilian uses of nuclear technology in both countries, holding that the risks from one are independent of the other and ensuring that the memory of Hiroshima did not significantly dampen Japanese enthusiasm for nuclear power.  (2) The dominant national-level imaginaries in both countries framed nuclear technology as an instrument of nation-building, treating nuclear power as a key determinant of national security, technological prowess, energy independence, and industrial competitiveness. These national interests long overpowered, and to some degree suppressed, contrary local narratives. In Japan, local opposition to siting, debates on radiation exposure effects for workers and residents, and post-disaster mobilization regarding radiation safety, compensation, and community recovery were eclipsed by the discourse on collective national benefits and deference to state expertise. In the US, by contrast, local opposition proved powerful enough to generate an effective moratorium on nuclear power plants after the Three Mile Island accident, but public perceptions were consistently dismissed by policy analysts and risk experts as evidence of lay ignorance and irrationality.  (3) Trivialization of the local responses contributed in both countries to a persistent downplaying of radiation?s health effects, which, in turn, significantly shaped national discourses on nuclear technology. Diminishing radiation?s biological and genetic effects, as well as the uncertainty and contestation surrounding pertinent knowledge claims, played a crucial role in the development and "success" of both civilian and military nuclear programs and supported expert narratives of risk "containment."  (4) In Japan, the disaster initially prompted widespread reflection on the nation?s nuclear history. It provided symbolic resources to critics of nuclear technology, facilitating more stringent and transparent regulatory approaches and curbing a nuclear renaissance, even as a clean energy solution to the climate challenge.
