<AbstractNarration>This objective of this research award is to create a new generalization of cellular self-organization as a way to automate the design and control of complex and interdisciplinary systems. Concepts from nature such as evolution, cellular organization, and self-organizing behavior serve as the inspiration for the research. The researchers are creating a software framework built on four elements: graphs, fields, rules, and rule decisions. The graphs are used to define system architecture and dimensions and exist within a three-dimensional physics-based simulator environment with pertinent internal state variables (positions, velocities, accelerations, temperatures, stresses, etc.). Rules and rule decisions govern how graphs change in response to state variables and external field effects like gravity or temperature in a manner that mimics true physical and biological effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computational framework will enable the ?cyber-physical boundary? to be easily shifted. For example, the framework would serve as a design automation tool to design a device before fabrication (simulating the environment of the device virtually) and also used as a control system for the device in actual operation so that the device might adapt to changes in the environment. This would occur by monitoring real-world fields from external sensors and transforming the graph or configuration of the resulting reconfigurable device. The research is a generalization of various published techniques (e.g. cellular automaton, topology optimization, and claytronics) under a single method. Such a framework is necessary for solving interdisciplinary and multi-physics design problems such as those found in mechatronics and robotics. The results will be widely disseminated for greatest impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With this award, a new approach of cellular self-organization was explored as a way to design and operate complex engineered systems. Dealing with unforeseeable changing situations, often seen in exploratory and hazardous task domains, requires systems that can adapt to changing tasks and varying environments. Taking advantage of the flexibility of multi-agent systems, we investigated a self-organizing systems approach, in which mechanical cells or agents organize themselves as the environment and tasks change based on a set of predefined rules. To enable self-organizing systems to perform realistic tasks, a two-field (i.e., task-field and social-field) framework was introduced to capture task complexity and agent behaviors, and a rule-based social structuring mechanism was tested to facilitate self-organizing for better system performance. To facilitate system design and optimization, a genetic algorithm (GA) based computational synthesis framework was developed.  One major obstacle to developing successful complex engineered systems is the unknown and potentially harmful interactions among system components. For a self-organizing system, behavior rules can be designed so that the interactions have only local effects and the emergent behavior of the system satisfy global function requirements. The concepts of the task-field (describing the tasks and their environment) and social-field (describing the relationships between agents) are introduced for agents to interact locally in the similar way as gravity field for planetary systems and morphogen or chemical field in biological systems found in the nature. When tasks are complex, social structuring (i.e., introducing structures among agents) plays a very important rule. Furthermore, in order to design such self-organizing systems through evolution (i.e., hundreds or thousands of generations), a computational synthesis framework was needed.  The intellectual merit of achieved from this research includes: (1) new cellular self-organizing system design through a novel two-field based behavioral regulation approach for emergence of global functions from local agent behaviors, (2) a design ontology framework and a genetic algorithm based computational synthesis methodology for designing self organizing systems, (3) a social rule based dynamic structuring mechanism to form complex agent structures, and (4) a set of design insights for guiding task field formation and social structuring for systems dealing various types of tasks.   In addition, the research has several broader impacts, of which the most important one is that it opened a new door with a bottom-up approach for designing complex engineered systems in order to achieve adaptive functions through emergence. This approach is essential for developing future complex systems that must be able to adapt to both task changes and the changes in the operating environment. Multiple undergraduate and graduate students, including minority students, participated in, and were trained by, this award.  Through the research supported by this award, the following outcomes have been found.  The two-field concept and a two-field based approach have been demonstrated to be a valid means for facilitating self-organizing behaviors among multiple mechanical agents. The concept of "social rules" is basic for defining social fields, and those of "rules" and "rule decisions" are basic for defining social behavior or agent structuring among self-organizing agents.  Embedding parametric information into a DNA-like formation has made it possible to evolve more desirable emergent behaviors through computational simulations. Defining fitness functions and genetic behavior has important impact on the evolutionary design process.  The results thus far are domain dependent. Further research is needed to understand general properties of this approach.  A parametric behavior modeling based system design approach has been established for developing self-organ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
