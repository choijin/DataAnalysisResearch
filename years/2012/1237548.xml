<AbstractNarration>Single-molecule fluorescence (SMF) is a powerful technique to determine the formation of one or more intermediates, and to study the kinetics of the processes from the instant before an enzyme interacts with the DNA until the release of the enzymatic product, one molecule at a time. Steady-state fluorescence and other ensemble average techniques used in previous DNA base flipping studies provide information about the average state of a large number of molecules. Ensemble averaged measurements can mask fluctuations in the formation of intermediate enzyme-substrate complexes and lead to different interpretations of the enzymatic process. In the area of DNA base flipping it still remains to be answered if the enzyme "pushes" the nucleotide out of the helix (active mechanism) or if the enzyme binds to a provisional flipped base (passive mechanism). New single molecule approaches to fully assess the kinetics mechanism of the base flipping process are needed. UV irradiation causes carcinogen-lesions within DNA, including the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), which are the most common type of UV DNA damage. T4 endonuclease V (T4 endo V) is a bacterial DNA repair enzyme that eliminates CPD. The crystal structure of T4 endo V shows that when the enzyme is in a complex with a helical DNA containing a thymine dimer, the 5' complementary adenine is flipped out, binding the damage site. The long-term goal is to understand at the molecular level how the enzyme finds the damage, and how, when, and why the base flipping occurs to repair damaged DNA. The goal of this work is to fully understand the repair mechanism of T4 endo V and to determine the conditions (salt, pH, etc.) that could maximize the repair process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damage to DNA bases can result in mutations and lead to cell death. For example, UV irradiation can result in mutations that could block replication if the systems designed to repair these damages fail. However, living organisms have enzymes to repair DNA, and many of these enzymes perform a base flipping process to recognize, gain access to, and repair damaged nucleotides. This project will study how this process works by looking at single molecules fluorescence instead of using large-scale ensemble methods. The proposed project will be performed in a Hispanic Service Institution, where the students that will participate in this project will have opportunities to learn a variety of techniques that connect the fields of Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and Physical Chemistry. Many of these techniques are increasingly used in many areas of biophysical research and the experience will inspire students to continue graduate studies in this and other related fields.</AbstractNarration>
