<AbstractNarration>The goals of this project are to develop and adapt an instructional system based on innovative curricular materials (Infograms, or graphic symbolic summaries), to implement this instructional system in undergraduate Biology classes, and to determine its learning outcomes. This project is based on a preliminary study that led to improved student comprehension of complex material, boosted conceptual understanding, enhanced retention of knowledge and metacognition, increased student confidence, and created more positive attitudes towards learning. Performance of students utilizing infograms is being compared in a quasi-experimental design to a control group that is not using infograms but otherwise is using the same curricular materials and is taking the same tests. This Infogram approach is being tested with a large number of students, and its efficacy is being assessed and documented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has Intellectual Merit because it employs existing knowledge of STEM education and is expanding this knowledge by integrating education and education research. This project is enhancing the understanding of learning by exploring how students encode and retrieve information using graphic symbolic representations. This project is producing a new model for student learning improvement and exemplary materials that can be easily adapted in other disciplines and by other sites at college and K-12 levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts are being realized through the improved instruction at CUNY New York City College of Technology, which has a large population of under-represented students in STEM, and by the dissemination mechanisms. These dissemination mechanisms include peer-reviewed publications, presentations at workshops and STEM education conferences, college and K-12 faculty workshops, and web-based media.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The outcomes and findings of this research include the innovative educational materials called Infograms, first suggested in this NSF proposal, which were developed and optimized over the four-year period. The set of Infograms covers all the content in the first semester Anatomy and Physiology course, a required course for health professionals taken by hundreds of thousands of students in the US every semester. The Infograms translate the curriculum into the graphic symbolic narrative using pictograms, abbreviations, key words, simple graphs and tables. Each chapter in the textbook is condensed to a one-page graphic symbolic summary supplemented by the side notes, term list, brief description and homework assignment. The Infogram-related learning activities make Infograms meaningful for the students, help students encode and retrieve information more effectively and see the connections between the concepts in the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; of the topic. The students using Infograms outperformed the students in a control group that was not using Infograms but otherwise was using the same curricular materials and was taking the same tests. The difference between the Infogram and control groups was statistically significant and consistent over the course of the project. &nbsp;</p> <p>The most surprising and significant finding of the research was the evidence-based realization that the higher levels of abstraction in educational graphics may be more effective for human cognition than more detailed images that often lead to the cognitive overload and students&rsquo; confusion. We developed the methodology of the Infogram design that gradually evolved as our understanding of the graphic symbolic representation deepened. This methodology was summarized in five peer-reviewed publications that resulted from the project. We also produced Infogram-based educational videos that accumulated more than 130K views in more than 170 countries and generated positive feedback that confirmed our conclusions. In class and online, Infogram learning improved student comprehension of complex material, boosted conceptual understanding, enhanced retention of knowledge, increased student confidence, and created more positive attitudes towards science and education. The products and findings were disseminated over the internet, in peer-reviewed publications and in presentations at the regional, national and international research conferences and professional meetings.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Vasiliy&nbsp;Kolchenko</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245655/1245655_10248682_1504141887548_Fig.1.InfogramforWeek1-IntroductiontoAnatomyandPhysiology--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245655/1245655_10248682_1504141887548_Fig.1.InfogramforWeek1-IntroductiontoAnatomyandPhysiology--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Original Infogram for Week 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245655/1245655_10248682_1504141887548_Fig.1.InfogramforWeek1-IntroductiontoAnatomyandPhysiology--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Original Infogram for Week 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Introduction to Anatomy and Physiology</div> <div class="imageCredit">V.
