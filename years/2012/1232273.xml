<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to investigate the soliton dynamics in mid-infrared quantum-cascade lasers. The soliton effect originates in the cancellation between the group velocity dispersion and self-phase modulation.  Such effect may play a key role in the generation of ultra-short pulses by mid-infrared quantum-cascade lasers, which are important to major applications such as biomedical sensing and environmental control. The elucidation of the underlying physics may therefore enable a new class of compact ultrafast lasers in the mid-infrared region since group velocity dispersion and self-phase modulation are simultaneously present in the same structure and are both associated with the intersubband transitions in quantum-cascade lasers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is that the proposed research will make significant contributions to the understanding of ultrafast dynamics in quantum cascade lasers. Such devices are of intense interest for mid-infrared and far-infrared continuous-wave as well as for short-pulsed sources. The transformative of this research is that results from the investigation could be applied to design a new type of quantum cascade laser medium yielding shortened mid-infrared pulses through bandgap engineering.  The design will be pursued through the collaboration with an experimental group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are in providing excellent multidisciplinary training in the area of nanophotonics within a research environment. Two Master?s students are expected to participate in this research. This program will also provide training opportunities for local K-12 teachers and high-school students through workshops. The results from the proposed research will be published in the scientific and engineering literature and presented at conferences.</AbstractNarration>
