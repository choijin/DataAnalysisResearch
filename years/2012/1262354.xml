<AbstractNarration>This REU Site program for Tire Engineering is a multidisciplinary research program for undergraduate students. This site will train 10 undergraduate students each year by providing them with research as well as hands-on training that will help them with their future education as well as career opportunities. The students are subjected to all aspects of tire engineering and are provided with individual challenging research projects that include conceptual, theoretical and numerical design and analysis, and hands-on components in state-of-the-art research laboratories. The individual research projects are integrated into an interdisciplinary, team-based environment where research results will be used to prove a hypothesis. Talented community college and university undergraduate students, particularly underrepresented and women, are recruited to conduct research in this field. Through this REU Site, a diverse program is created and students are motivated to continue their studies towards a bachelor degree (for the community college students) and a graduate degree (for the university students). This project is fully supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Engineering Education and Centers.</AbstractNarration>

In total, 33 students conducted research on 27 different projects and worked in 5 different laboratories. These projects were defined by 7 different faculty and were in various subjects related to tire and automotive engineering. Each year, a minimum of 4 students were recruited from the Virginia Western Community College (VWCC). The rest were from Virginia Tech and other universities. 90% of the students from VWCC&nbsp;decided to pursue a BS degree in engineering and attended Virginia Tech. Out of the rest of the students, seven decided to join graduate school. The students worked with several MS and PhD students and as they stated, this was very educational. There were several designes which were implemented in the labs. There were two published conference papers. One student was hired to run Center for Tire Research (CenTiRe) lab since he attended the program in 2014. There were several patentable devices which were designed and built.
