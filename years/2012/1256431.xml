<AbstractNarration>The objective of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) collaborative project is to conduct a critical review and to develop a set of set of requirements for protocols and architectures for extensible, adaptable, and scalable manufacturing.  Revolutionary advances in Information Technology (IT) have fueled the ubiquitous use of the Internet which has rapidly changed the manner in which we work, live and play. Impact of Internet technologies can be seen in diverse areas of national priority such as health care, energy and public safety. These advances have also promoted e-commerce for cyber shopping, communication and other service markets. However, in the general domain of manufacturing, the adoption of these IT advances has not been widespread due to unique challenges. There is a great need to investigate issues related to web-architectures that can foster an organic, community-involved development of software tools.  Based on these requirements, the plan is to either identify existing architectures or propose an innovative architecture for the manufacturing context outlined. This architecture needs to enable enterprise partners (in the broader manufacturing community) to use, modify and adapt existing software tools essential to their own activities but also interface with this web-based architecture so that various manufacturing and related service activities can be realized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such a web architecture will seek to foster a larger community-involved development and response that promotes more widespread use of software tools by the enterprises involved in manufacturing and related activities. At a functional level, such an architecture needs to also facilitate related entities (i.e., humans, services, resources) to adapt, modify and collaborate to achieve simple-to-complex manufacturing activities.  Findings will be published in a peer-reviewed conference as well as other journal publications in order to engage the pertinent manufacturing and computer science communities. Findings will also be posted on the project website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project focused on topics of relevance to an emerging area called cyber manufacturing.  Its objective was to study and identify the fundamental building blocks of an architecture which will enable individuals or enterprises needing manufacturing services to easily obtain them over the web.  we also explored the possibility of an architecture which can foster new collaborations in global manufacturing.  We completed an extensive review of papers, reports and articles in this area of relevance.  We finally submitted a formal list of the core characteristics of this web architecture.  Some of our important findings are summarized below:  There is need for additional      research on addressing what we refer to as æsemantic interoperabilityÆ issues.      This has to do with computers and software tools not being able to      understand relationships and terms (as the Internet was not designed to      support such understanding). We conclude that there is a æsemantic gapÆ      between advanced manufacturing needs, and their mapping to resources      available on the web; such research has not received the æfocusÆ and      æimportanceÆ that should have been given to develop advanced manufacturing      applications Understanding relationships in      a manufacturing collaboration is key to adapting and using software tools      from one manufacturing context (eg: satellite assembly) to another      manufacturing context of interest to a user (eg: assembly of a different      product such as an assembly of a table); the goal is to promote      openly-available bottom-up web software components that can be composed      easily and re-used in multiple contexts, and thus transform todayÆs      top-down software perfection expected in collaboration tools available in      the market. Cloud based technologies hold      the potential to overcome some of the drawbacks of the existing      architectures for agile and productive interactions of distributed      collaborators (such as reducing maintenance costs due to pay-as-you-go      resource rentals, supporting use of thin clients that enable mobility and      large-data set handling, etc)            Broader Impacts:  we participated in outreach events including the 2013, 2014 and 2015 US Ignite Summit to highlight our findings. we also presented several papers at conferences and published results in journal papers. We also held several outreach activities with K-12 students in Oklahoma including summer camps and workshops on the campus of Oklahoma State University             Last Modified: 11/29/2015       Submitted by: J.
