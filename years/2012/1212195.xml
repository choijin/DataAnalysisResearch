<AbstractNarration>Although cosmic rays were discovered almost a century ago the details of where and how they are accelerated and how they propagate to us remain somewhat mysterious.  Acceleration can occur in many cosmic sources, including spinning, magnetized neutron stars, massive black holes, gamma ray bursts, shock waves expanding from supernova explosions, and even similar but larger shocks surrounding clusters of galaxies.  The field is being revitalized by recent discoveries, and by greatly improved measurements of the spectra and composition of cosmic rays.  This project is a theoretical investigation of cosmic particle acceleration mechanisms spanning several sites and responding to recent observations.  It will explore the mechanism known as unipolar induction, and analyze in detail how particles can acquire energy and momentum in very small steps, such as in the vicinity of shock fronts.  Qualitatively new types of magnetic reconnection and relativistic shock fronts will be studied using both simple analysis and more detailed simulations.  The results should help to explain recent surprising observations of cosmic sources, throughout the seventy octave electromagnetic spectrum and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These problems have been only partially understood despite a century of attention, and tackling them both observationally and through simulation will require quite sophisticated tools.  The work links broadly to the study of solar weather, and of magnetic and inertial fusion, topics of strong public interest and societal concern.  A student will receive valuable training in plasma astrophysics, which is a good preparation for many other fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to advance our understanding of the acceleration of protons, electrons and positrons under cosmic conditions. The principle results include:  -- a new, general explanation of how the famous Crab Nebula produces gamma ray flares in less than a day depite being many light years across. This process has been termed "magnetoluminescence"  -- an improved model for the acceleration of cosmic rays by supernova remnants in the presence of neutral gas  -- a proposal that Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (with energies approaching this of a home run baseball) be accelerated by giant accretion shock fronts surround rich clusters of galaxies  -- a theoretical study of the stability of force-free equilibria under relativistic conditions which demonstrates the development of large scale magnetic structure from small scale structure  A common theme connecting much of this research is the notion that "ropes" of twisted magnetic field lines can release energy rapidly by untangling and more slowly, but very efficiently, by reconnecting.  Supplementary investigations include:  -- an analysis of the small compact feature observed close to the pulsar that powers the Crab Nebula. This had been proposed to be due to a relativistic shock front. However, recent adaptive optics and X-ray observations are incompatible with several predictions of this model  -- application of the results from the Crab Nebula flaring to analogous phenomena observed in the relativistic jets flowing away form the massive black holes in the nuclei of active galaxies.    -- a major review of the Crab Nebula  The intellectual merit of this proposal is in advancing our understanding of a widespread cosmic phenomenon. Our uncertain understanding of astrophysical particle acceleration limits what we can learn from the large telescope employed in high energy astrophysics observation  The broader impact is that several of the investigations pertain to extreme electromagnetic behavior found in other locales from magnetic fusion devices to the heliosphere. Studying how nature accelerates particles to energies nearly a hundred million times those attainable in the laboratory may also lead to new types of terrestrial particle accelerator.
