<AbstractNarration>The primary objective of this study is to determine how alterations in hydrology impact the carbon dynamics of Everglade fresh water marshes. Eddy covariance flux measurements will quantify carbon exchange (CO2 and CH4) from both short and long hydroperiod (the duration of inundation) marshes in the southern Florida Everglades. The expected results of these studies will lead to an improved understanding of how changes in wetland hydrology and vegetation structure influence the balance between the uptake and release of CO2 and CH4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Everglade watershed provides an excellent opportunity to study the effects of hydroperiod on wetland carbon balance, especially since water management practices are likely to change substantially in the near future due to the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. This watershed is also important due to its peat-forming wetlands that contain vulnerable stocks of soil carbon. Because wetland ecosystems are of great significance globally in sequestering carbon dioxide and releasing methane, and many are threatened by changes in land use and climate, research is needed to provide better estimates of their role in providing an overall carbon balance on regional and global scales.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Human activities have caused considerable change to the delivery of water into the Everglades freshwater marshes, and with it, considerable change to the ability of these systems to sequester carbon.  Whereas previous indications are that these systems were considerable carbon sinks, we found that only small amounts of carbon dioxide were taken up in both a short- and long-hydro period marsh sites over each year of this study.  When emissions of methane are considered along with the carbon dioxide balance, both marshes currently appear to be increasing greenhouse warming potentials, which describe how much heat is trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases.  However, we did find seasonal variation, with small amounts of methane consumed by the short-hydro period site during the dry season, when water tables were well below the surface of the soil.    Our study has also provided value-added benefits to several other projects regionally, nationally and globally.  To date, data from our study have been downloaded from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) more than 165 times during the past two years.  The data have been used for a large number of synthesis studies, which are trying to reduce uncertainties regional and global carbon budgets.  In addition, our data have contributed to synthesis activities within Everglades National Park.  We have combined our data with data from the Long-Term Ecological Research program, the Park Service and South Florida Water Management District to assess cold temperature weather anomalies and their role in ecosystem activity.  We determined that water buffered freeze events in ecosystems located closest to the coast, and that those with greater standing water were less affected by cold temperatures and had less of a reduction in carbon dioxide sequestration.      This study also provided a variety of training and teaching opportunities for stakeholders within the community.  Starr and Oberbauer introduced findings from the study to approximately 250 students from classes that they taught at the University of Alabama and Florida International University.  Starr further presented data from this study to a group of advanced biogeochemistry students (Ph.D. students and Postdoctoral scientist from 15 countries) at the ICOS-NEON Carbon Workshop (France, 2015).  Oberbauer?s group also gave a demonstration of photosynthesis measurement on Everglades plants for ~2000 students at the Fairchild Challenge (Florida, 2014). The Fairchild Challenge has been recognized as a benchmark for exceptional STEM education and for empowering elementary and high school students to become the next generation of scientists, researchers, educated voters, policy makers, and environmentally-minded citizens. This research project also directly trained two post-doctoral scientists, three graduate students and five undergraduates over the project duration.
