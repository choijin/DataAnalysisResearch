<AbstractNarration>SES-1259129&lt;br/&gt;Joseph Galaskiewicz &lt;br/&gt;University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study examines conditions that contribute to children's quality of life.  Does the availability of organizational resources in a community affect children's well being?  Why do certain neighborhoods have more organizational resources than others?  What changes have taken place over the last decade in the wake of the Great Recession?  In answering these questions we hope to understand why some neighborhoods are better places for children to live than others.     The project will complete telephone surveys with 1,100 households in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area with children between 5 and 12 and ask about what children did ?last Saturday? and about the family?s use of medical providers over the last six months.  This replicates a survey the investigator conducted in 2003-04.  Using a variety of sources the investigator also collects data on the locations of establishments which provide activities for children in 2013 and match these with comparable geo-coded establishments for 2003, 2007, 2008, and 2009.  These data will provide information on which neighborhoods and suburbs increased/decreased their stock of organizational resources over the last decade, and, comparing the 2003-04 to 2013-14 survey results, if this resulted in families changing their utilization of neighborhood resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has broader significance, because children?s access to different types of organizational resources is important for their educational, emotional, and social development.  Research findings have the potential to help us better understand why and how organizational resources are distributed geographically and if they make a difference in the lives of children.  Also, results could generate insights to inform policies that would ensure that neighborhoods provide productive organizational options for their young residents.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merits  Our first goal was to see if the spatial distribution of organizational resources affected familiesÆ well-being.  Our theory of spatial capital argues that familiesÆ life chances are a function not only of their financial, cultural, and social capital, but also their spatial capital.  The latter refers to familiesÆ ability to access resources in their community and includes not only their physical proximity to various organizational resources, but also their information and transportation technologies, communication skills, and where they are situated in the urban transportation network.   Many communities experience catastrophes that are either natural or manmade. What makes for a resilient community?  While much attention is focused on the important role of businesses and federal relief agencies, we believe the number of local governmental facilities and nonprofit organizations is important in explaining resiliency.  These organizations not only buffer residents from exogenous shocks, they can also help neighborhoods to rebuild by facilitating access to external funds and maintaining social solidarity among discouraged residents.   Findings  Our first research question was: Does the number of different types of establishments located near to a family (e.g., doctorsÆ offices, parks, stores, restaurants, churches, etc.) affect their utilization of these facilities?  We examined two types of behaviors: the activities that children engaged in on Saturdays during the school year and the procurement of routine health care for children.  The data were gathered from a survey of households in the Phoenix urbanized areas with children between the ages of 5 and 12 years old in 2013-14.   In her Ph.D. dissertation, Kathryn F. Anderson analyzed the provision of routine health care.  She found that families were more likely to utilize a physicianÆs office, as their regular source of care, than a clinic, if there were more physician offices, health care practitioners, or health care services in their immediate neighborhood.  However, whether or not the child had health insurance was more likely to affect the use of an emergency room on a regular basis or not having any regular source of care.  Further, she found that there were far fewer health care organizations in areas that were heavily Latino.  Going forward, we will extend this line of research to analyze childrenÆs leisure activities on Saturday.   Our second research question was: Which areas of the Phoenix urbanized area experienced the greatest growth, decline, and recovery of governmental facilities, for-profits, and nonprofits between 2003 and 2007, 2007 and 2009, and 2009 and 2013?  Were government facilities or nonprofits more likely to withstand the Great Recession and survive as compared to for-profits?  The units of analysis were 646 census tracts, the data were counts of government, for-profit, and nonprofit establishments per capita, and we used spatial regression models.     As expected, for-profits experienced more growth/decline than either nonprofit or government organizations (see Figure 1).  In all three periods, their growth and decline was a function of increases and decreases in tractsÆ median home values.  There was not much change in the number of government facilities over the ten year period, but government facilities closed in tracts that experienced a drop in median home values between 2007 and 2009.  Nonprofits experienced moderate growth and decline, but between 2003 and 2007 and between 2009 and 2013, their growth and decline was unrelated to changes in median home values.  However, between 2007 and 2009, nonprofit growth and decline were tied to changes in tractsÆ median home values similar to for-profits and governments. Apparently, government and nonprofit organizations were insulated from normal fluctuations in the housing market, but they too capitulated in tracts most affected by its collapse.
