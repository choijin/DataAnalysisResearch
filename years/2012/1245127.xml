<AbstractNarration>The modern world is awash in data, greatly amplifying the necessity of statistics education.  Introductory statistics courses are often both large and populated by students from a diverse array of backgrounds.  Tailoring what is said to these students with an awareness of their interests and goals and an understanding of their background and progress can substantially improve their learning experience.  This is true for all students - from those likely to struggle to those who most easily master the material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this project, learning analytics techniques are being used to drive personalized instruction for each of the 1400 students who take Stats 250 each term at the University of Michigan.  A detailed portrait of the student's background, interests and goals is being created as well as a real-time state of each student's academic progress by collating the rich array of data captured from student work in the LectureTools active learning environment. Given these portraits, the E2Coach system is using computer tailored communication technology to individually address each student and enabling interaction with the student as if they sat down with the instructional team for the course for an expert coaching session.</AbstractNarration>

Computer tailored communication techniques are well established in the world of public health, where their ability to help large, diverse groups of individuals achieve challenging goals has been extensively tested. Here at the University of Michigan we have implemented the first major application of these tools to education, launching a personalized coaching system called E2Coach.  In the course of this grant, we adapted an original E2Coach tool built for physics courses to support our statistics class.

This allows us to measure performance relative to expectations which account for many student properties, including prior classroom performance. Placing students in four usage groups ranging from non-users to heavy users, we find performance improvements as large as half a letter grade associated with the impact of E2Coach.
