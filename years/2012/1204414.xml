<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Given a billiard table in the form of an arbitrary polygon, what can be said about the trajectory of a ball as it travels around the table?  If the polygon is a square, then the trajectory is either periodic, or it gets arbitrarily close to every point in the square after sufficient time has elapsed.  Such a seemingly simple question leads to deep and interesting mathematics that lie at the intersection of geometry and dynamical systems and have applications to other fields of math, such as mathematical physics.  During the duration of the Fellowship, the PI addressed this problem through the study of Lyapunov exponents that behaved anomalously, classifications of certain geometric objects inspired by billiards, and the resolution of a question inspired by mathematical physics.  This resulted in the publication of 6 research papers in peer-reviewed journals, 16 seminar presentations, and 12 conference presentations.  As noted in the original project proposal, in spite of the technical knowledge one needs to address the most difficult problems in the subject, the inspiration for the field arises from polygons whose geometry is already accessible to high school students.  Relying on this knowledge, the PI was able to mentor a student in the Directed Reading Program at the University of Chicago.  Her project involved understanding how the dynamics of SL(2,R) on the unit tangent bundle of the modular curve relates to billiards in the square.  At the end of the quarter she gave a presentation on her results to her fellow students.  The NSF Fellowship not only allowed the PI to resolve many research problems, but it illuminated new patterns that will inspire future investigations.  Furthermore, the success of the undergraduate student?s project demonstrates that motivated undergraduates have the potential to resolve questions that would be of interest to researchers and that "translation surfaces," which are the mathematical objects used to study a particular class of polygonal billiards, could be a valuable instructional tool for teachers because they facilitate the visualization of abstract mathematical concepts.  In summary, the NSF Fellowship was tremendously valuable to the development of the PI as a research mathematician and a teacher.  It gave the PI the opportunity to investigate numerous directions in his research under the guidance of many leading researchers and to grow as an instructor of mathematics.
