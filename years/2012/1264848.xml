<AbstractNarration>1264848/1264832&lt;br/&gt;Kaunas/Gregory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the 13 million yearly fractures that occur in the United States, about 10% fail to repair and in extreme cases result in immobility or amputation. While autologous bone grafts are the most effective method to heal complex defects, the available graft material is limited, and the procedure involves additional surgery known to cause chronic donor-site pain in many patients. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been intensely investigated for their ability to promote bone healing, but results have been variable and disappointing. This is at least partly due insufficient retention of hMSCs at the site of injury for sufficient time to achieve engraftment and promote repair. In an attempt to solve these problems, hMSCs have been treated with the small molecule PPARÃ£ inhibitor GW9662 to produce osteogenically-enhanced hMSCs (OEhMSCs). These OEhMSCs produce extracellular matrix (hMatrix) that dramatically increases hMSC retention and osteorepair in calvarial defects. The central hypothesis for this project is that an injectable microsphere vehicle co-administering GW9662, hMatrix and hMSCs will promote osteo-repair through a mechanism that involves extended hMSC retention, trophic factor secretion and paracrine activation of the host stroma. To test this, composite microspheres will be constructed and assessed for GW9662 delivery and hMatrix presentation to hMSCs in culture, as well as for their ability to promote repair of critical-sized defects in a mouse calvarial model. Finally, soluble factors secreted by hMSCs responsible for promoting osteoregeneration will be identified. These studies will lay the groundwork for translating this novel hMSC-based method for osteo-repair to the clinic. Successful completion of this project could lead to a revolutionary new method for bone repair that could effectively dismiss the need for autologus bone graft in regenerative orthopedics. These studies are based on the concept that providing an in vivo-like microenvironment stimulates hMSCs to behave as they do during normal tissue generation. This concept applies to hMSC-mediated healing in general, thus the knowledge gained from the proposed studies may eventally be applied to the regeneration of other tissue targets. The methods and concepts used to construct and evaluate the microsphere composites will be broadly disseminated in journals and conferences and incorporated into courses taught at Texas A&amp;M. The PI has a record of successfully mentoring undergraduate researchers from underrepresented populations in his lab; the proposed project will provide additional opportunities for undergraduate research in the laboratory. As part of the project, two graduate students will be supported for their doctoral studies. The PI and the graduate students will each participate in outreach to high schools in the greater Houston area and develop media for broad use in the Texas school system.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported the design, production and testing of hydrogel microcarriers for delivery of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) as a bone repair therapeutic. Clinical trials for bone regeneration therapies utilizing hMSCs have shown disappointing results, at least in part due to variability in hMSC quality between hMSC donors and poor retention of the implanted cells. Treating hMSC cultures with a drug (GW9662) differentiates the cells into osteo-enhanced hMSCs (OEhMSCs) with the beneficial effects of boosting osteogenic activity of hMSCs regardless of who the cells are harvested from and also inducing the production of an extracellular matrix (ECM) that resembles regenerating bone matrix. The goal of this project was to establish a method for fabricating ECM-coated injectable microcarriers and assessing their ability to heal calvarial bone defects in mice.</p> <p>Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) microcarriers were produced using a 3D printed flow-focusing device produced by stereolithography (Fig. 1A). The GelMA prepolymer was mixed with lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) photoinitiator and flowed through a central tube with mineral oil and surfactant flowing in a concentric outer tube. This resulted in controlled and rapid production of droplets whose size depended on the ratio of flow rates of the GelMA and mineral oil streams (Fig. 1B). Exposure of UV light to the photoinitiator catalyzed covalent crosslinking of methacrylate groups on GelMA to result in solid hydrogel microcarriers. The microcarriers were mixed with hMSCs (Fig. 1C, Step 1) and cultured within a rotating bioreactor in the presence of GW9662 to induce deposition of ECM (Fig. 1C, Step 2). The microcarriers were then processed to remove the cellular material and leave the decellularized ECM (referred to as bioconditioning), resulting in bioconditioned GelMA microcarriers (Fig. 1C, Step 3). Bioconditioned GelMA microcarriers were covered with a fibrillar matrix that contained Collagen VI and XII, but bare GelMA microcarriers did not (Fig. 2 A vs. B). Collagen VI and XII staining is strong indicator of osteogenic matrix deposition since the matrix deposited by hMSCs that are not treated with GW9662 lacks these unique collagen subtypes.</p> <p>hMSCs cultured in the presence of GW9662 on bare GelMA microcarriers showed modest increases in secretion of of angiogenic and osteogenic factors associated with bone repair compared to hMSCs cultured on bare GelMA microcarriers that were not exposed to GW9662 (Fig. 3A-F). Culturing hMSCs on bioconditioned microcarriers, however, showed significant upregulation of these factors (Fig. 3A-F). As expected, hMSCs cultured on bare GelMA microcarriers upregulated expression of Collagens VI and XII when treated with GW9662 (Fig. 3G-H). Interestingly, hMSCs cultured on bioconditioned microcarriers did not increase Collagen VI and decreased Collagen XII expression compared to hMSCs cultured on bare GelMA microcarriers. hMSCs treated with GW9662 and cultured on bioconditioned microcarriers dramatically upregulated expression of BMP2 in the hMSCs (Fig. 3I). These results suggest that bioconditioning instructs the cells to no longer generate additional ECM, but instead express osteogenic BMP2 and other osteogenic and angiogenic factors associated with bone repair.</p> <p>&nbsp;These results support our claim that the bioconditioned microcarriers represent a material with the bioactive properties of autograft that can be co-administered with a patient?s own hMSCs. To further test this claim, we co-administering hMSCs and bioconditioned microcarriers into a mouse skull defect, which resulted in healing within just 4 weeks that was at least as good as that achieved with bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP2), the therapeutic of choice for surgeons treating difficult cases needing bone repair or fusion (Fig. 4).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/13/2019<br>      Modified by: Roland&nbsp;R&nbsp;Kaunas</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1264848/1264848_10291572_1565733411629_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1264848/1264848_10291572_1565733411629_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1264848/1264848_10291572_1565733411629_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">3D printed flow-focusing device (A) that produces GelMA droplets whose size depends on the ratio of flow rates of oil and GelMA streams (B).
