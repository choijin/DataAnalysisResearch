<AbstractNarration>Geomoto is a Track 1 game/learning project, designed to foster engaging and deep conceptual learning of geoscience topics. The project will create a digital game learning module that leverages embodied learning technologies, such as Microsoft Kinect or SMALLab, to track students' physical motions and integrate them into a game/simulation experience designed to develop their understanding of dynamic geoscience concepts. Geomoto will bring common misconceptions to the surface and include opportunities for students to correct their understanding through experience and interaction. This project links state standards to game mechanics, simulations, and embodied-learning interactions that make student thinking explicit at all levels, including conceptual, procedural and conditional. Through interacting with this dynamic system, students will form a conceptualization of the earth as a fluid, multilayered, complex and interrelated dynamic system rather than as a static, homogenous object. The Geomoto project merges the assessment-driven game-learning design practices of the GameDesk Institute with content experts from Caltech's Tectonics Observatory, Boston University, Michigan State University, Bill Nye the Science Guy and the Planetary Society, and the New York Hall of Science to foster deep conceptual learning of geoscience topics. The project includes experimental studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the modules for yielding strong learning outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In our original proposal of this project, we stated that we would actively engage students in difficult geoscience topics by allowing them to experience firsthand the cause-and-effect relationship of their actions in detailed and immersive game environments. Throughout the project period, we tested two main hypotheses:  Students would be highly motivated to learn about geoscience if it were situated within specific experiential and embodied contexts, with well-developed simulation, embodied, and game-based learning environments. Such environments allow students to deeply interact with the content domain by fostering conceptual understanding and understanding of the processes that scientists engage in.   While we initially focused on embodied learning through digital interfaces and environments, we began incorporating other modalities, such as simulations and field games, into our games. We believed that multiple modalities would allow for transfer of knowledge across multiple contexts, serving as novel reinforcements of geoscience concepts. Thus, when re-visiting our hypotheses, we decided that instead of creating just one game with one technology, we were going to create a series of games using many modalities.   Furthermore, this approach enabled us to focus on conceptual learning rather than rote memorization of discrete facts; by engaging with similar practices and content through different contexts, we believed students would develop a toolset of skills (reasoning, hypothesizing, experimenting) that are essential to any field of study.  When we tested our hypotheses in the pilot evaluation, it became clear that enjoyment of the geoscience games were correlated with deep conceptual and procedural understanding of geoscience concepts.  Below is a list of outcomes that were completed for this project:  Five learning modules/games: Five digital scenarios using the space simulator Universe Sandbox that cover formation of the universe, galaxy, and planetary bodies A field game that covers the principles of accretion A Layers of the Earth game using the SMALLab embodied learning technology that covers layers of the earth and earthÆs surface A Continental Drift game using the Leap Motion Controller that covers continental drift and earthÆs surface. Tutorial video can be found here: http://vimeo.com/98674900 A Plate Tectonics game using the Leap Motion Controller that covers plate tectonics, earthquakes, earthÆs surface, and land formation. Tutorial video can be found here: http://vimeo.com/98674901  A series of videos that detail the goals of the project and summarizes our design process and findings from pilot implementation. The main video can be found here: http://vimeo.com/101570313 . We've also created individual videos documenting the user testing of our games. Layers of the Earth: http://vimeo.com/97530164 Continental Drift: http://vimeo.com/97526912 Plate Tectonics: http://vimeo.com/97527436 Active Accretion Field Game/Universe Sandbox/Layers of the Earth : http://vimeo.com/87731892  Curricula/lesson plans (document attached in our "Final Project Report") for the each of the games we developed  where we incorporated best teaching practices from our curriculum team and network of experienced teachers. Each lesson plan explores how interactivity, simulation, game mechanics, and embodiment can support a variety of learning outcomes. Each section provides a (1) general description of the experience, (2) a  series of steps of the interactive experience and (3) how it relates to learning, and (4) a list of the learning outcomes. An evaluation report (document attached in our "Final Project Report") of our geoscience games. The report shows details that assessments for the modules indicated significant knowledge gains from pretest to posttest after roughly one class period of game play. Moreover, results from the evaluation study suggest that the geoscience games are both engaging and educational.        Last Modified: 10/30/20...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
