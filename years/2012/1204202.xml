<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is t  attract young scientists to Earth Sciences research in the high latitudes through attendance at a series of summer schools and participation in field projects, thus promoting further collaborations and networking. The goal will be accomplished through a suite of four summer schools for groups of about 15-20 graduate students, as well as development of online course materials. Each course will consist of a classroom component and, more importantly, field experiences, hands-on activities/mini-projects, and presentations designed for communication to a broader general audience. Systematic pre- and post- surveys will provide metrics of summer school success.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Four summer schools were organized in 2013-2016 by the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) in collaboration with other institutions at UAF and universities nation- and worldwide: 2013:  Arctic oceanography Students participated in a 5-week cruise onboard a Russian icebreaker with lectures by scientists and involvement by students in research activities while on the ship. 2014:  Glaciology Students spent two weeks at a glacier field site, made measurements on glaciers and participated in classroom activities at McCarthy, AK 2015:  Arctic terrestrial ecology Students spent one week at IARC, where scientists presented research on terrestrial ecology, then one week in the field at Toolik LTER site; project presentations were made by students on return to UAF. 2016:  Modeling of the Arctic system Two weeks of presentations on Arctic system modeling by speakers from UAF and outside Alaska; trips to local field sites; mini-projects working with models and/or model output. 88 students attended the four events in 2013-2016.  Researchers from various institutions provided summer school background lectures and contributed to mini-projects. Each summer school consisted of lectures, field trips and work on theme-related mini-projects. Each student worked as a member of a small team guided by an instructor, and presented their results in a ?mini? student conference at the end of the course.  Students presented their own research in a poster or oral session.   An outreach specialist from the Miami Science Museum (MSM), Lindsay Bartholomew, joined the summer schools in 2013 and 2014. She taught modules on science communication and was responsible for the blog on the MSM website.  An IARC website and IARC Summer School Facebook page were also means of communicating with the public. A number of post-school outreach events such as presentations, interviews classroom activities etc., were conducted by participating instructors and students at their home institutions, towns and other locations, including AGU and EGU conferences, in the months following the summer schools.  A number of mini-projects resulted in continuing collaboration: Impact of Arctic Superstorm of 2012 on sea ice; Arctic Dipole, Polar Amplification, Fronts in the Arctic and their impact on sea ice (2013); Models for hydrology and sliding on the Kennicott glacier (2014); Impact of declining sea ice on land processes (2016)).  One project of the McCarthy school resulted in a peer-reviewed paper with two of the students as first authors. The young scientists who participated in our summer schools fully recognized and appreciated the value and the challenges of obtaining in-situ field data and modeling of the components of the Arctic System.  As these scientists advance in their careers, they will be in positions to develop observing strategies, modeling and measurement programs, thereby bringing their experience to bear on maximizing the efficiency of the observational infrastructure for the Arctic and modeling products. Measurements, data collected with student assistance provide a clearer understanding of how the observational science is done.  Lectures serve as a solid theoretical support for the hands-on activities. All pre-and post-event tests conducted by the education specialist indicated that students left with an improved understanding of the state of the art of the arctic science.  Longitudinal survey conducted with all students showed that 88% of the respondents rated the overall long-term impact of participating in the program on the professional career as excellent and very good.   Long-term benefits were described as:  Experiencing the Arctic and key issues including climate change (88%) Awareness of and better skills in field research methods and hands-on data collection (75%) International networking opportunities and contacts resulting in collaborative research projects (65% of respondents)  Increased scientific knowledge and understanding about Arctic systems and modeling (64%) Increased motivation to continue in the field of Arctic research (61%)  Introduction to various Arctic research fields (55%)  Successful job applications (34%), and Successful grant applications (30%).   The IARC Summer School Facebook page has become a site for communicating information about job opportunities, conferences for students and everyone interested. The ?fans? screenshot of the insights illustrates that expectedly, we are reaching out most actively to people in their mid 20s-30s (Figure 1).

Based on the success of the IARC Summer School program since 2003, a new project for three summer schools, jointly with Tromsoe University, University of Calgary and UAF has been funded by the Norwegian Research Council in 2016.  A proposal for a new round of summer schools to the NSF is under development in coordination with the project funded by Norway.
