<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate a broad-based non-invasive, single-step Urine Malaria Test (UMT-Pf/Pv) for the clinical diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and P. vivax (Pv) malaria, which account for ~800,000 deaths a year. Since malaria deaths occur within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, the ability to manage malaria at home or in village settings where most cases occur would (i) facilitate prompt access to antimalarial treatment, (ii) target treatment to those who need it, and (iii) reduce malaria mortality. In this project, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to novel poly-asparagine protein fragments identified in the urine of febrile malaria patients will be used to develop a UMT-Pf/Pv dipstick. The four overlapping specific aims are to (1) perform a detailed characterization of the diagnostic utility of MAbs developed in Phase I; (2) develop, test and optimize a prototype to meet design input specifications; (3) implement preliminary performance evaluation studies to evaluate sensitivity/specificity, and; (4)undertake preliminary clinical testing. As a non-invasive alternative to blood-based tests, the UMT-Pf/Pv could facilitate the delivery of rapid malaria diagnosis in settings across all geographical areas where malaria is endemic, markedly impacting the way malaria is diagnosed and treated worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a broad-based one-step urine test for the home-based or point-of-care diagnosis of clinical Pf and/or Pv malaria in persons with fever. With the UMT-Pf/Pv dipstick, the number of steps that the operator is required to perform is significantly reduced, permitting greater utility, convenience and reliability in primary care settings. The test will also facilitate the effective integration of malaria RDTs into private sector malaria case management and encourage wider acceptability of clinical malaria diagnosis in endemic regions, especially in rural areas and in places where mixed infections frequently occur.  Overall, the test has the potential to markedly impact the way over 95% of all clinical malaria is diagnosed and treated, and drive current global efforts toward home-based or point-of-care testing for malaria prior to treatment in all cases of fever, as mandated by the World Health Organization. Since it is based on the same platform as current RDTs, this test can be easily integrated into current healthcare structures to provide significant benefits to public health in most endemic countries. No such test is currently available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Immunochromatographic malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have recently become the mainstay of current global malaria control efforts, particularly in point-of-care settings, particularly in community/rural settings where most cases of fever are managed. The use of current blood-based rapid tests for universal malaria testing especially in home or point-of-care settings is limited in part due to the requirement for blood, and the inherent risk associated with its multistep format. So, public health experts have consistently desired the use of urine over blood as sample for malaria test in patients with fever. Understandably, the relatively poor outcome of blood RDTs tested with urine sample is due in part to the fact that urinary parasite proteins are denatued and/or proteolytically cleaved.  In this project, we successfully applied the complement of bioinformatics, recombinant DNA technology and protein engineering of urine-excreted paraiste protein fragments to generate novel recombinant monoclonal antibody reagents. These antibody reagents were specifically reactive to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and P. vivax malaria parasite proteins excreted in malaria patient urine. The Pf antibody reagent was used to develop a single non-invasive urine-based test, which was initially evaluated using archival urine samples.  The clinical product development effort focused on engineering a UMT dipstick that can directly test fresh patient urine sample without the requirement for a pre-test sample processing step. Limited UMT field testing using freshly collected urine samples demonstrated 84% sensitivity (i.e. in truly positive malaria patients, the UMT was able to accurately confirm positive diagnosis 84% of the time), and 83% specificity (i.e. the UMT is able to accurately tell negative patients also 83% of the time) (Oguonu et al, Malaria J. 2014, 13:403). The UMT performance has now been fully clinically validated in a pivotal clinical trial. As the first non-blood test for malaria, we believe that the test offers a suitable tool that could facilitate universal malaria testing in all public and private healthcare settings.
