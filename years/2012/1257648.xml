<AbstractNarration>Sixty years ago, barred tiger salamanders from Texas were introduced into California, where they hybridized with native, endangered California tiger salamanders. The result is a completely novel landscape in which some salamander populations are composed entirely of hybrid individuals and some are largely, or completely comprised of individuals with native genes. For the last 25 years, the Shaffer laboratory has collected and stored tissue samples from across the range of the California tiger salamander, providing a unique data set to study the distribution and spread of non-native genes. The current research project uses cutting-edge genomic tools to characterize historical and contemporary salamander populations, and to track the spread of thousands of non-native genes as they invaded the native range of the California tiger salamander over the last quarter century. Many species hybridize in nature, and the movement of genes between species is an important component of understanding how species adapt to changing environments. This project provides an unparalleled opportunity study the spread of genes between species in real time as it occurs in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research also addresses a fundamental, and difficult issue in the conservation of endangered species: what is the conservation value of hybrids? Hybridization is generally viewed as a serious threat to endangered species, since hybrids are not genetically the same as individuals in the ancestral species, and hybrids are usually not protected. This research will directly confront the role of hybrids in endangered species management by providing conservation agencies the opportunity to better understand how hybridization proceeds in nature. Additionally, the PIs will provide training and support for graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, and will contribute resources for K-12 education.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Endangered species management requires that we seek to protect native species in their native habitat to the maximum extent possible. When hybridization between an endangered native species and a non-native exotic occurs, management can be particularly challenging. For 35 years, we have studied the population biology and genetics of the California tiger salamander, a large species that occurs only in the fertile plains and prairies of California&rsquo;s Great Central Valley. In the 1950&rsquo;s, thousands of non-native tiger salamanders from Texas and New Mexico were introduced into California, and we have been studying the hybridization of these two species for 20 years. With funding from this award, we expanded our work to become one of the most comprehensive analyses of hybridization in the wild in any species, and without a doubt the most extensive and complete for an endangered species. We developed a completely novel 5237-gene toolkit that allowed us to look at hybridization across the genome in unprecedented detail. Because we have archived tissues going back to the early 1980&rsquo;s, we can track the movement of non-native genes, showing how and where they increase their range by hybrid vigor, and some places where native genes are able to hold their own or occasionally even outcompete the non-natives. We are using these results to work closely with land managers and resource agencies, primarily the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management, to build a scientifically rigorous plan to hold at bay, and potentially reverse the spread of these non-native genes. Doing so is a critical step in downlisting, and delisting the California tiger salamander from the US Endangered Species list. We have also completely side projects on endangered Eastern tiger salamanders on Long Island, NY and critically endangered newts in the Lycia coast of Turkey. In so doing, we have brought our new technology and conservation genomics tools to agency and academic colleagues across the US and beyond.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/09/2018<br>      Modified by: H.
