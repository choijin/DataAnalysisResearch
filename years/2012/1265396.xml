<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program of the Chemistry Division,, Professor William J. Evans of the Department of Chemistry of the University of California, Irvine, and his students will utilize the unique properties of the rare earth metals, i.e., the lanthanides, yttrium, and scandium, to explore new aspects of redox chemistry, i.e., the reduction/oxidation reactions that constitute one of the two most general classes of chemical reactions.  Because the rare earth metals represent extremes in the periodic table due to their unusual physical properties, they are an excellent set of elements for expanding the limits of this fundamental reaction type.  The chemistry of the (N2)3- and (NO)2- radicals, new reduced forms of diatomic molecules of biological, industrial, and atmospheric significance that were discovered via the rare earths, will be examined.  The reasons why (N2)3- is so effective in forming single molecule magnets with the highest blocking temperatures known to date will be pursued.  The reactivity and physical properties of seven new rare earth oxidation states, the divalent cations of Y, Ho, Er, Tb, Pr, Gd, and Lu, discovered while exploring the reductive reactions that generated the anionic radicals above, will also be examined.  In addition, the recent discovery of reductive photochemistry for rare earth complexes, found in a reaction powerful enough to reduce dinitrogen to the anion (N=N)2-, will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because redox reactions are central to so many processes in life and are critical to processes important in global sustainability such as solar water splitting and dinitrogen reduction, this research can have a broad impact on science and technology.  More specifically, the reductive rare earth metal based discovery of the (N2)3- and (NO)2- radical anions has implications in biological, industrial, and atmospheric dinitrogen and nitrogen oxide chemistry.  The (N2)3- radical also has demonstrated a new approach to the synthesis of single molecule magnets, entities that could have far-reaching implications in energy utilization and data storage.  In general, this project allows the exploration of an under-developed set of elements, the rare earth metals, which are a valuable national resource with many technological applications, while providing training to students in f element chemistry that is essential to addressing issues associated with radioactive waste disposal while training the next generation of students in this field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to utilize the unique properties of the rare-earth metals, i.e. the lanthanides, yttrium, and scandium, to make advances in redox chemistry.  Redox reactions are of fundamental importance in sustainable chemistry since they constitute one of the two basic reaction types in chemistry (the other class is acid-base reactions).  For example, processes such as solar water splitting to generate hydrogen and dinitrogen reduction for fertilizer production rely on redox reactions.  Both areas need to be improved to solve global problems involving carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  This project focused on the rare-earth metals since they represent extremes among the elements in the periodic table and constitute an excellent set of metals for exploring the limits of reactivity.   It was also a goal of this project to train the next generation of scientists who will have experience with the rare-earth metals.  These metals have been designated critical national resources due to their importance to energy, national security, defense, and the economy.  For example, they are essential components in energy-efficient lighting, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and any device containing a magnet.  Since there are concerns about their global supply, it is essential to have experts trained in this area to be able to use them most efficiently.  This project has focused on the discovery of new oxidation states for seven rare-earth elements, namely yttrium, praseodymium, gadolinium, terbium, holmium, erbium, and lutetium.  One fundamental characteristic of any metal is the extent to which it loses electrons to form charged species in different oxidation states.  Extensive testing had established the limits of available oxidation states of the elements.  Hence, it was surprising that seven new oxidation states were discovered as part of this project.  Since the range of oxidation states is critical to the redox chemistry of an element, the expansion of oxidation states that occurred in this project allowed exploration of redox chemistry in new ways.  The discovery of the new oxidation states revealed that it was possible for the rare-earth metals to adopt a different electronic structure, i.e. the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus, from what had been previously known.  If the metal is surrounded with the proper chemical units (ligands) in the proper geometry, a new electronic configuration was possible allowing isolation of new oxidation states.  The new electronic configuration was a blend of that found in transition metals, such as titanium, and in the rare-earth metals.  Consequently, these new ions are unlike any metal ions previously known.  The results from this project force us to change the way we think about the chemistry of the rare-earth metals and also raise interesting questions on a broader scale about reduction chemistry, oxidation states, electron configurations, and molecular magnetism for all metals.  The new electronic configurations have led to metal complexes with the highest magnetic moments observed to date for complexes of a single metal.  The new +2 oxidation states of dysprosium and holmium are more magnetic than any other metal ions.  These two new +2 ions offer the possibility of making more powerful, energy-efficient magnets, a result that will have broad implications.  It is worth noting that all of these discoveries originated from a project that initially had a completely different target, namely dinitrogen fixation.  Since it was thought that no new oxidation states could be discovered and the maximum in magnetic properties for a metal had been achieved, these breakthroughs were not research targets.  Fortunately, the study the reduction of dinitrogen using the unusual characteristics of the rare-earth metals led to results upon which this project was based.
