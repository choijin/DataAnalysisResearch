<AbstractNarration>The increasingly common multi-core/many-core CPU architectures&lt;br/&gt;are effective for accelerating programs√¢?? execution only when&lt;br/&gt;sufficient parallelism is maintained. For data-intensive&lt;br/&gt;programs the increased parallelism can severely compromise I/O&lt;br/&gt;efficiency: when a sequential program is parallelized, not only&lt;br/&gt;computations, but also the I/O operations associated with them, can&lt;br/&gt;be distributed among multiple processes. Because the execution&lt;br/&gt;order of the processes is usually determined by the scheduler at&lt;br/&gt;runtime, the relative progress of processes is nondeterministic&lt;br/&gt;and the order in which the processes issue their I/O requests is&lt;br/&gt;accordingly nondeterministic. It is this I/O nondeterminism that&lt;br/&gt;can substantially compromise I/O efficiency, and thus program&lt;br/&gt;performance, by negating the advantages of parallel execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this problem the PI proposes a facility built either&lt;br/&gt;in the operating system kernel or in the runtime to streamline&lt;br/&gt;the service of I/O requests from different processes of a&lt;br/&gt;parallel program. The major distinction from conventional&lt;br/&gt;techniques for improving I/O performance is in the coordination&lt;br/&gt;of I/O request issuance, via I/O-aware process scheduling, to&lt;br/&gt;improve the locality of these requests for I/O-intensive&lt;br/&gt;multithreaded and MPI programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed research would introduce a disruptive&lt;br/&gt;technique for data-centric computing to effectively relieve the&lt;br/&gt;I/O bottleneck. This project also provides abundant research&lt;br/&gt;training opportunities for students, especially under-represented&lt;br/&gt;minority students in the southeast Michigan area, to help relieve&lt;br/&gt;the shortage of IT professionals with expertise in parallel&lt;br/&gt;computing and storage systems.</AbstractNarration>
