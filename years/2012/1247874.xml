<AbstractNarration>Objective:  The objective of this program is to create nano-devices using single- and few-layer forms of selected crystalline layered semiconductors as building blocks for the next-generation nano-electronic components that work at high frequencies above 10 GHz. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit is this program will conduct exploratory studies on the design and construction of novel two-dimensional nanostructures for high-frequency nano-electronic applications.  If successful, the proposed work will develop suitable layered materials, elucidate electron transport mechanisms in these two-dimensional materials, develop device schemes for high-speed electronics, and establish the foundation for their future integration in industry.  The outcome of the research will shed light on both the fundamental research and technological applications at the nanoscale.  The transformative nature of this project includes the potential to provide new materials platforms and novel device schemes which may change the landscape of future high-speed integrated nano-electronic industry. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  The broader impacts are: (1) the program will open new avenues for interdisciplinary research with significant technological and fundamental impact, thus benefiting the society at large through research breakthroughs and knowledge dissemination; and (2) the program will boost the participation of many underrepresented groups in science and technology, through integrated education and dissemination efforts at the University of Houston (the second most ethnically diverse research university in the nation): student training, outreach to local K-12 students and teachers, and knowledge dissemination to the scientific communities and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual Merit: This EAGER project has investigated various single- and few-layer crystalline layered 2D semiconductors as building blocks for the next-generation nano-electronic/photonic systems.  The project team had significant accomplishments in identifying the potential of a few important layered 2D materials for nano-electronic/photonic applications, including: SnS2 (with a band gap of 2.1 eV) [De et al., Nanotechnology 24, 025202 (2013)], SnS2-xSex (with a band gap tunable continuously from 2.1 eV for SnS2 to 1.0 eV for SnSe2 by varying the selenium content) [two papers: Pan et al., Applied Physics Letters 103, 093108 (2013), and Hadjiev et al., Physical Review B 87, 104302 (2013)], CVD-grown single crystal of MoS2 [Wu et al., Applied Physics Letters 102, 142106 (2013)], and halides such as ZrNBr [De et al., Applied Physics Letters 103, 043107 (2013)].  Moreover, the PIÆs group demonstrated the first successful CVD synthesis of thin crystals of SnS2 and SnS, and invented a novel approach to the controlled synthesis of thin crystal arrays of representative layered semiconductors (including SnS2 and SnS) at predefined locations on chip, which opens a pathway for scalable manufacturing of layered 2D semiconductor devices for practical applications in integrated nano-electronics/photonics [Peng et al., US Patent Application, filed in 2014].  This work was presented as an Invited Conference Talk in the SPIE Defense and Security Symposium (DSS 14): Micro-Nanotechnology Sensors, Systems, and Applications Conference, Baltimore,  MD, May 5, 2014.  With CVD-synthesized high-quality thin crystalline SnS2 layers, the team further demonstrated the application of SnS2 layers as high-speed photo-detectors with photo-current response time ~ 5 &mu;s, an order of magnitude faster than the best response time (~70 &mu;s) reported for other layered 2D semiconductors (Su et al., research paper submitted).  Additionally, the project team has investigated novel topological materials such as CuxBi2Se3 [Peng et al., Physical Review B 88, 024515 (2013)] and revealed new electron transport phenomena in other layered materials such as PdBi2 and ZrTe3.     Broader Impact: The prototype devices of layered 2D semiconductors implemented in the EAGER project can serve as building blocks for future nano-electronics/photonics, and may lead to commercial products widely used by the general public.  This project also trained graduate and undergraduate students to be the future workforce in science and engineering, and engaged high-school students and the general public via outreach activities to attract interests in science and engineering.  For example, one graduate student supported by this project has successfully obtained PhD degree and received a job offer from a leading semiconductor company: Intel Corp, and a few other graduate students made solid progresses towards their degrees.  The project team also engaged local and international collaborations.  In addition, a high school student from St. John's School, Vincent Zhang, worked in this project and won the first prize in the final presentation for the Houston High School Science Club program in 2012.  Other significant dissemination efforts include: (1) student participations in the TcSUH Student Symposium with award-winning research presentations; (2) oral research presentations in the American Physics Society March meeting and SPIE conferences; and (3) peer-reviewed research publications in leading physics or nano-science journals.
