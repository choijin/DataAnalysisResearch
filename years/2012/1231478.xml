<AbstractNarration>The US-China workshop on environmental monitoring for public health and disaster recovery will be held at Yellow Mountains, Anhui, China on August 7-8, 2012. The workshop will include one keynote speech session, one position papers session, one panel session, five technical sessions, and one summary session. There will be approximately 20 US participants and 20 Chinese participants. The objective of this workshop is to bring together experts in the field of environmental monitoring from the U.S. and China, and to promote and sustain mutually beneficial research and education collaboration between the U.S. and China in this field. Via wireless sensing and network technologies, large-scale environmental monitoring systems offer major promise to realize these goals. Workshop topics include foundational sensing, network calculus theory; novel sensor architectures and protocols; and supporting platforms and technologies for the above applications. The workshop can foster substantial opportunities for fundamental research breakthroughs in this field that can bring about international research and educational impacts. The workshop anticipates establishing a research agenda for environmental monitoring for public health and disaster recovery; identify new environmental monitoring research problems, challenges, potential solutions, and future directions; and form five to seven teams that will examine unique topics in environmental monitoring. These theories, architectures, and protocols will enable novel platforms for proactive, patient-centric healthcare and real-time disaster recovery. All workshop research topics, discussions, and outcomes will be presented online. Female and minority faculty are especially encouraged to present their research at the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
