<AbstractNarration>This project is establishing a two semester series of biochemistry laboratory courses, Biochemistry I and II, in which students carry out class research projects that are an outgrowth of the research projects of on-campus faculty.  Students present their work at the end of each semester.  A unique feature of the project is an advisory board composed of industry representatives and faculty from nearby institutions.  The board helps critique student presentations and the design and implementation of the project itself.  Approximately 130 students/year will benefit from this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:   The rigorous evaluation plan includes comparison of the knowledge, skills, and scientific insights gained by students in the research centered courses to those gained by students taking the more traditional standard lab modules centered courses. The research topics are current and challenging but appropriate for the students.  Examples include: structure-function relationships for dihydrofolate  reductase and indole-2-glycerol phosphate synthase, screening of kinase inhibitors against new targets, and experiments in soil enzymology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  if successful this approach is one that could be adapted by many urban universities close to centers of appropriate industries and research centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the grant period, we fundamentally transformed our existing biochemistry laboratory curriculum at MSU.  The new curriculum was designed with significant external input about the needs of the modern research environment. Compared to the old curriculum, the new, revised curriculum  much more closely simulates the modern research environment.  We interviewed professional biochemists in both industry and academia to better understand the needs of the modern research environment. The interview data was used to create a survey, which was given to a larger group.  The findings from the interview and the survey indicated that rather than focusing on specific experimental techniques, it was important to work on transferrable skills including experimental design, troubleshooting, laboratory calculations and communication. The survey results were published and used to guide the transformation of our curriculum as described below.   We created a new set of 11 "inquiry" modules for our biochemistry laboratory course that  emphasize research skills, including critical and creative thinking, experimental design, collaboration, and communication skills, to better prepare students for a successful career after graduation. These modules are freely available for use. We now implement these inquiry modules exclusively. Students must design their own experiments, trouble shoot them, perform the necessary laboratory calculations, conduct a research project in groups and present their work to industry biochemists. The first biochemistry laboraotry course is followed by an advanced Biochemistry Laboratory course called Experimental Biochemistry II where student groups design their own semester long research projects. This new curriculum replaces the old, cookbook style curriculum in all sections of experimental biochemistry and all sections and instructors exclusively now use the new curriculum.   The new curriculum impacts all the sections of Experimental Biochemistry I  and Experimental Biochemistry II,  which are offered during the Fall and Spring semesters, respectively.  There are typically approximately 60 - 70 people enrolled in 3-4 sections of the first course and 24 students enrolled accross 2 sections of the second course, each year.  Over the grant period, we investigated the impact of the new inquiry learning environment on student skill growth.  For two years, we ran inquiry and cookbook (traditional approach) sections of Experimental Biochemistry I in parallel.  We analyzed the impact of the new inquiry environment compared to the cookbook environmnet on student learnign gains in laboratory math skills and experimental design ability.  We found that the inquiry modules resulted in significantly larger gains in laboratory math skills and the ability to design experiments compared to the old and more  traditional "cookbook" lab environment.   In summary, the funding transformed how students learn biochemistry at Montclair State University.  The new inquiry modules are availabe for adoption at no cost. We investigated the impacts and found that students had signficantly higher learning gains in the new inquiry biochemistry laboratory environment compared to the traditional cookbook style experience,where students are given detailed protocols to follow. The findings were disseminated in two scientific publications and in many presentations and will likely support other faculty interested in adopting an inquiry style laboratory teaching environmnet for biochemistry.
