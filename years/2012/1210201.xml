<AbstractNarration>This action funds Peter Greene of University of California, Davis to conduct a research project, entitled "Modifying magnetic nanostructures for high density information storage," during the summer of 2012 at National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu.  The host scientist is Prof. Chih-Huang Lai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to determine the time dependant coercivity of tailored magnetic nanostructures constructed of Cobalt and Palladium super-lattices using magneto optical kerr effect (MOKE).  This study gives important, quantitative insight into the viability of graded anisotropy magnetic media as the basis for future hard disk drive media.  Magnetic recording media form the backbone of large scale data storage. The need for even higher density data storage media is ever increasing. No other technology is as prevalent or as scalable as magnetic recording. However, the point where the sizes of magnetic bits are measured in number of atoms is quickly being approached. It is this issue that motivates the research: how to create ultra dense yet stable and useable magnetic media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to analyze the thermal stability of nano-scale magnetic bits with structures tailored at the atomic level. The value of this research lies twofold in its direct application to magnetic recording media and the fundamental understanding of magnetic behavior at the nano-scale.  As magnetic recording media marches towards increasing areal density, the individual magnetic elements which store the data necessarily become smaller in smaller. In order for those elements to maintain the written data, they must be made with higher magnetic anisotropy. In other words they must be made more difficult to switch the magnetization in order to protect the written information from random thermal fluctuations. However, making the magnetic elements harder also makes them more difficult to write information into. This problem is compounded by the necessity to make the read/write head smaller which lowers the maximum obtainable magnetic field. Several proposed schemes have been advanced to tackle this issue including energy assisted reversal (i.e. heat, microwave, light, etc.), structural tailoring, and compositional tailoring to name a few.  We have pursued a variant of structural tailoring known as anisotropy grading. This method involves modifying the magnetic easy axis within the magnetic element as a function of depth from strong uniaxial, out of plane anisotropy at the base of the element to near zero anisotropy (i.e. magnetic moment is free to point any direction) at the top of the element. Using this method we aimed to separate the thermal stability of the magnetic element from the writability. This is possible because the strongly anisotropic base acts as an anchor resisting random thermal switching while the low anisotropy surface easily nucleates a domain wall when exposed to an external field. The domain wall then easily propagates vertically through the element, making the element easier to write.  To test this hypothesis we created four Co/Pd multilayer film structures. We varied the Co thickness to control the anisotropy.  Uniform; high anisotropy sample Bilayer; half high anisotropy and half low anisotropy Trilayer; half high anisotropy, a quarter mid, and a quarter low anisotropy Continuous; half high anisotropy and half continuously varied from high to zero   We then patterned these samples into varies arrays of dots with diameters from 700 to 70nm. We then measured the thermal stability of these arrays and the stability against applied magnetic fields, what we referred to as writability previously.  We have found evidence to support the claim that anisotropy grading can separate the writability from the thermal stability. We also found that the previous theoretical result for the scaling of the energy barrier for graded structures does indeed hold. In addition we have studied the effect of patterning the films into dot arrays and analyzed the scaling of the thermal and field energy barriers with respect to dot size.  Thus, our results are twofold successful as we confirm that the graded structure is advantageous to future technological applications. We also confirm a fundamental theoretical result on the scaling of the thermal energy barriers in graded magnetic anisotropy structures.
