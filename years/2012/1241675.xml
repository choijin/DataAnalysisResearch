<AbstractNarration>The CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at the University of South Alabama (USA) prepares at least 20 highly qualified Information Assurance (IA) and cybersecurity professionals for service in federal, state, local, and tribal governmental agencies. The project develops a Cyber Scholars Program that expands the national IA academic reach to students throughout the Gulf Coast region, increasing diversity and capacity of the national cybersecurity workforce. The USA School of Computing (SoC) has three ABET-accredited computing programs, including a health informatics degree program that offers substantial interaction in IA and a unique opportunity to attract women into the computing field. The project collaborates with local minority institutions such as Bishop State Community College, a designated underrepresented institution, and other community colleges in the region, raising awareness of cybersecurity issues in a wide variety of rural communities. USA has a strong K-12 outreach program in partnership with industry and government agencies, including an annual GEMS (Girls Exploring Math &amp; Science) conference for middle school girls and Summer Security Seminars for high school students.</AbstractNarration>

The Center for Forensics, Information Technology, and Security (CFITS) at USA provides an organizational covering for activities in support of the Cyber Scholars program.</p> <p>The USA Cyber Scholars program began in 2011, and has included awards under grant DUE-1241675, a renewal grant DGE-1564518, and a collaborative sub-contract with Mississippi State University in 2011. Since inception, the Cyber Scholars program has awarded 44 scholarships total and graduated 27 students, with 16 students still completing their academic programs.&nbsp; Overall, 26 students have been placed in permanent positions within federal, state, and local agencies including the NSA, FBI, DHS, GAO, EPA, MITRE, US Navy's NAVSEA, US Air Force Research Lab, John Hopkins University, and several national DoE laboratories such as Sandia, Oak Ridge, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, Idaho, and MIT Lincoln Labs.</p> <p>Under grant award DUE-1241675, 24 scholarship awards were given with 23 students successfully completing the program and 22 being placed in full-time positions. Of the awards under the grant, 71% were given to male students and 29% were female, with 13% of our cohort coming from underrepresented groups. Student recruitment during the award period has resulted in 76 applications with 41 scholarships offered and 40 awarded. Of those who applied for the program, 81% of applicants were existing USA students who were made aware of the program as a result of advertising, curriculum outreach, research initiatives, and public announcements. 19% of applicants were students at other universities and were made aware of the program though web-site advertising, direct mailing, press releases, media interviews, and PI presentations. Of our applicant pool, 44% were current undergraduate students and 56% were existing graduates students. Applicants also came from diverse academic backgrounds which includes 76% from STEM-based majors (e.g. CS, IT, IS, EE, CpE, Math) and 24% from non-STEM majors (e.g. Law, Graphics Design, Theater, International Studies, Business). The applicant pool also consisted of 71% male / 29% female and 24% of applicants were in underrepresented ethnic groups.&nbsp; A local partner school program supported by CFITS has allowed recruitment of students through K-12 STEM outreach activities that have reached over 10,000 students since inception of the program.</p> <p>Cyber Scholar students focus on cybersecurity research during their programs. To date, this has resulted in publication of 21 peer-reviewed conference and journal articles, 24 poster/abstract/work-in-progress presentations at academic venues, 16 Masters theses, and 4 research projects.&nbsp; Professional development of Cyber Scholar students during the grant period supported a wide variety of opportunities, including mentorship opportunities in NSA-sponsored GenCyber camps, engagement of K-12 students in on-campus cyber learning activities, and support of BEST robotics programs in local schools. SFS students also actively participated in the Southeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (SECCDC), National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (NCCDC), and the Cyber 9/12 challenge. Cohort members grew their cybersecurity skills through participation in various capture-the-flag, coding hackathons, and cyber competitions including NSA Codebreaker Challenge, RSI Hackathon, FBI&rsquo;s DC3 challenge, TAMUHack, NYU CSAW, DOE CyberChallenge, picoCTF, and the National Cyber League.</p> <p>The SFS program has allowed USA to forge new partnerships with federal agencies such as the US Army Corps of Engineers ERDC (Vicksburg, MS), the Army's AMRDEC (Huntsville, AL), the USAF 46th Test Wing (Eglin AFB, FL), and FBI field offices in Mobile and Montgomery, AL. Overall, the Cyber Scholars program has opened up incredible opportunities for students in underrepresented groups that come from the southeast region and has provided a lasting impact on the curriculum, research, and professional development opportunities available at the University of South Alabama.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/13/2018<br>      Modified by:
