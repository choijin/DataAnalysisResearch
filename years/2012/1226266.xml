<AbstractNarration>Yale University doctoral candidate Adrienne Cohen, supervised by Dr. Michael McGovern, will investigate the relationship between expressive culture and political-economic change in post socialist contexts. The researcher proposes a reciprocal relationship between expressive practice and political economy in which  political-economic dynamics are expressed through performance and performing artists play a role in calling new social and ethical orders into being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research to investigate this proposition will be conducted in Guinea, West Africa, and in the United States. The Guinean socialist state of Sékou Tourés (1958-84), like other socialist states in other parts of the world, subsidized the modernization of expressive culture, particularly dance and percussion, in the service of nationalist politics. When socialism ended with Touré's death, the new regime drastically reduced government arts patronage.  Performing artists, abandoned by the state, formed private troupes and began to emigrate in the 1990s, many taking up residence in the United States. This project engages two generations of dancers and percussionists from Guinea: one trained during the socialist period, and the other trained in the post socialist era.  Through multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork among artists in Guinea's capital city of Conakry, and among transmigrant artists in California and New York, this study examines post socialist conditions of economic and cultural exchange between Guinea and its diaspora.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data collection throughout the study will involve a combination of ethnographic methods, including: semi-structured interviews, participant observation, archival media research, migration narratives, and focus groups, in which participants discuss video and audio recordings of relevant performances. The research is important because it will be the first to address the convergence of performing arts, post socialism, and transmigration; it will contribute a new dimension to theories of socialism and its aftermath under conditions of globalization and transnationalism. Funding this research also supports the education of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This dissertation examines a community of performing artists from Conakry Guinea, whose expressive forms and value systems were profoundly shaped by the cultural policy of GuineaÆs socialist state (1958-84).  It explores tensions over ethics and aesthetics between two generations of artists&mdash;one trained during the Revolution, and the other trained after 1984&mdash;and asks how social and cultural reproduction proceeds when the political-economic armature of the country has been suddenly and completely transformed. The shift from a centralized allocative socialist state to a postsocialist, simulacral one, operating in an era of neoliberal globalism, was a sea change for this urban artist community. Not only did the formal structures, funding sources, and administrative units governing artistsÆ profession cease to exist with the socialist state, the ideological infrastructure within which which these contemporary arts had been constructed was also called into question. The rhetoric of Guinean socialism/postcolonial nationalism, which was largely inseparable in the popular imagination from the person of independence president Ahmed Sekou Toure, promised rapid modernization, human dignity, and international reknown for Guinea. Not least for artists, it promised that their work was valuable and foundational to this process.           In contemporary Conakry, where the failures of postcolonial nationalism have become all too palpable, this artist community continues to thrive.  In place of the RevolutionÆs grand narratives and authoritative structures, grassroots forms of association and meaning-making emerge.  In this contemporary context, how are the values and idioms of a socialist past recast, reshuffled, or discarded? How do youth reinvent their profession while maintaining ties with the older generation and with the ideals on which the profession was initially founded?  Most significantly for anthropological knowledge production, how does this cultural microchosm speak to African urbanism, transnational belonging, and postsocialist analytics on a global scale? This dissertation investigates how contemporary performers construct themselves as persons, ethical beings, and capable actors, mobilizing affective media that reaches out in time and space&mdash;iconically and indexically conjuring elements of the past and summoning potential futures.               The research for this dissertation, funded in part by the National Science Foundation, took place in three phases: the first took place in Conakry, Guinea from Sept 2012-April 2013.

Through interviews with Conakry resident artists as well as visiting migrants who reside in countries as diverse as Japan, Iceland, France, the U.S., and Sweeden, I was able to obtain substantial information about transnational migrants and Conakry residents alike, and was able to observe their interactions in their home city. The research in Oakland offered more opportunity to delve into the lives and imaginative worlds of migrants, and to compare some of the fantasies and performances of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
