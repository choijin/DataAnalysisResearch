<AbstractNarration>The objectives of the research are to: 1) improve the understanding of dynamics of orographic and environmental influences on tropical cyclone (TC) track deflection over the Appalachians and other mesoscale mountain ranges; 2) determine major control parameters and moist flow regimes for orographic precipitation associated with TCs over mesoscale mountains; and 3) understand the interaction of microphysical and dynamical processes in enhancing precipitation associated with TCs over mesoscale mountains. To accomplish the above objectives, both idealized and real-case numerical simulations using the research version of Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF version 3) developed at National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) will be performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The research will improve the fundamental understanding of the dynamics of orographic influences on TC track deflection over the Appalachians and other mesoscale mountain ranges, which, in turn, will improve the prediction of rainfall distribution.  The studies of major control parameters, moist flow regimes, and interaction of microphysical and dynamical processes associated with TCs over mesoscale mountains will help improve the microphysics and planetary boundary-layer parameterization schemes, which, in turn, will help improve quantitative precipitation forecasts over the Appalachians as well as other mountains that share similar environments.  All these research efforts are consistent with one of the major initiatives of the U.S. Weather Research Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;A fundamental understanding of heavy orographic precipitation associated with the passage of tropical cyclones should lead to improvements in the quantitative forecasts of precipitation and hydrological prediction of flooding and, thus, advance the protection of life and property in areas near mountains. The project will educate and train two graduate students and two undergraduate students at North Carolina A&amp;T State University.  Most of the students in the university come from underrepresented populations and the Co-PI is a female scientist. The students and faculty worked on the project will contribute information to local high-school teachers and students through various science programs. The research results derived from the project will be used to develop a new graduate course that fills the gap between mountain meteorology and hurricane dynamics.  Offering of the course through UCAR's COMET virtual education program will be attempted to allow a large number of students and scientists to be impacted by it. Existing University-Government and international collaborations will be strengthened as students supported by the project will have opportunities to interact with atmospheric scientists in NCAR, NOAA, Taiwan, and Madagascar.</AbstractNarration>

Lin, Co-PI: L. Liu) include: (1) TC tracks are more sensitive to the cumulus parameterization schemes and less sensitive to microphysics parameterization schemes, and orographic rain associated with the passage of TCs are more sensitive to microphysics schemes; (2) Track discontinuity is determined by basic flow and vortex Froude numbers, as found in Lin et al. (2005).&nbsp; In addition, the vortex Rossby number also plays an important role; (3) the effect of mountain height, which can be represented by the basic and vortex Froude numbers, on the bogus TC is significant (Lin et al. 2016 JAS); (4) Track deflection is very sensitive to landfall location and approach angle. The hurricane track deflection influenced by the Appalachian Mountains is not significant due to relatively larger Vortex Froude numbers. The track deflection for TCs moving along the idealized Appalachian Mountains is stronger compared to those passing over from the east (Liu et al. 2016 Frontiers); (5) the ability of a hurricane to undergo rapid intensification (RI) is more likely to be smaller in sizes initially than those that do not (Carrasco et al. 2014); (6) The moist flow regimes and precipitation enhancements are found to be sensitive to dynamical and microphysical interactions, such as the gravity waves, severe downslope wind, and turbulence under high wind situation. In addition to the three moist flow regimes found in Chu and Lin (2000) at lower wind speeds, a new flow regime (Regime IV) is found for higher wind speeds (U&gt; 36 m/s) and is characterized with gravity waves and heavy precipitation and lack of upper-level wave breaking and turbulence over the lee slope (Sever and Lin 2017 JAS). (7) In mountainous region, the combined Thompson microphysics and Grell cumulus parameterization schemes make a better quantitative precipitation forecast, while in plain region, the combined Thompson microphysics and Kain-Frisch cumulus parameterization schemes are the best (Jung and Lin 2016); (8) Blocking effects on a supercell thunderstorm are dominative compared to the terrain-induced environmental heterogeneity downwind of the mountain ; and (9) Proposed a orographic rain index to predict orographic rain distribution for TC passing over mesoscale mountains (Rostom, 2015). &nbsp;</p> <p>Our major educational outcomes included the training of: (1) 11 Ph.D. students, (2) 10 M.S. students, and (3) 3 undergraduate students in numerical modeling and data analysis.
