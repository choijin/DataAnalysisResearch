<AbstractNarration>Amazonia is Earth's most iconic center of biological diversity and endemism and is among the most important terrestrial biomes due to its contributions to global systems ecology. This project seeks to answer an overarching question in biodiversity science: How was the modern Amazonian biota and its environment assembled across space and time?  The research is designed to understand the evolutionary and environmental-ecological history of late Neogene-Recent Amazonia through a comparative approach that integrates across the disciplines of systematics, population biology, ecosystem structure and function, geology, Earth systems modeling and remote sensing, and environmental history. The project also investigates how biotic and environmental change over this time-period influenced Amazonian functional diversity in biogeochemical flows, and how these, in turn, shaped the dimensions of biodiversity seen today as well as the history of global-scale changes in biogeochemical cycling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, which is a collaboration with Brazilian scientists and funding agencies, represents the most integrative examination of Amazonian biodiversity and its history to date.  The approaches taken describe a methodological template for analyzing information about the history of biotic and environmental change across large, ecologically complex landscapes that can be generalized to other systems.  The project creates a large framework for formal and informal education including the training of students, development of a major museum exhibit on Amazonia, workshops for K-12 STEM teachers, publications in professional educational journals, and a web portal, The Evolutionary Encyclopedia of Amazonian Biodiversity, that will make all results available to the public, as well as serve as an informational platform about Amazonian biodiversity and its global importance. This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Amazonia is among the most important terrestrial biomes  because of its abundance and diversity of life.  Amazonian forests are for global atmospheric carbon levels and flood mitigation for the countries that contain it.   This project seeks to answer important questions in biodiversity science. namely, how did the modern diversity of Amazonian plants and animals biota and what has been the impact on that diversity by the geological changes that have taken place in the area over timeits environment assembled across space and time? The New York Botanical Garden Herbarium has perhaps the largest collection of herbarium specimens from Amazonia in the world, as the result of more than 50 years of research and collaboration with Brazilian scientists. For this project, the The New York Botanical Garden contributed  species occurrence data derived from herbarium specimens that provide verifiable evidence of what plants are growing, or have grown, in Amazonia. To contribute these data to the project, we provided digitized information from specimens belonging to two important plant families in Amazonia: Lecythidaceae, Melastomataceae.  These data were mostly digitized with funding from previous grants, but many lacked the data needed to plot the occurrence of the plants represented by the specimens on a map.  Therefore, our primary contribution to the project was to provide georeferences for approximately 148,000 specimens, including those of the three target families.   We were also charged with creating distributions of these species using GIS technology so that the occurrence of species could be mapped, and could be combined with other datasets produced through the project.  Approximately 50 maps for Lecythidaceae were produced, and data for approximately 2500 specimens of Melastomataceae were submitted for mapping by other project collaborators.Through a series of workshops with staff from the University of Florida and University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, we have developed and tested a methodology for determining how many data points are needed in order to get an accurate picture of the distribution of a species in Amazonia.  This project provided training in georeferencing, mapping, project management and interpretation of species distribution data to three post graduate students.  A workshops about the biology of the Lecythidaceae family was taught by Dr. Scott Mori in Manaus, Brazil in 2014, and a georeferencing workshop was held at The New York Botanical Garden  in 2014 to teach the georeferencing techniques that were adopted for this project.  The results from this project are four peer-reviewed published articles, a presentation on georeferencing techniques at the 2015 meeting of the Society for the Preservation of Natural History  Collections, and considerable content for the Lecythidaceae Pages, a website with definitive information about the family produced and managed by Dr. Scott Mori.
