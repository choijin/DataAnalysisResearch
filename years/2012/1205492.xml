<AbstractNarration>Computing increasingly permeates daily lives, yet few appreciate the growing presence of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) in common computing activities; e.g., modern laptops' processors contain multiple cores and special-purpose devices such as graphics processors (GPUs).  With increasing availability of powerful PDC technology, familiarity with single-processor computers and sequential computing no longer constitutes computer literacy.  Technological developments point to the need for a broad-based skill set in PDC at all levels of higher education in disciplines such as Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and the related computational disciplines.  The rapid changes in technology challenge educators to decide what to teach and how to teach it.  Students and employers face similar challenges in characterizing "basic" expertise in computing.  The PIs are addressing these challenges via a project devoted to creating and sustaining curricular and educational infrastructure to facilitate the teaching of PDC topics in undergraduate computer-related curricula.  The goal is for every graduating student to become skilled in PDC technology, hence be prepared to enter tomorrow's workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project embodies multiple synergistic activities that develop:  flexible PDC curricula for a spectrum of academic programs and institutions; mechanisms that help individuals maintain currency; instructional materials for PDC-related topics; experience-based guidelines for injecting PDC into curricula.  A signature activity is competitions for early adopters of PDC curricula (winners receive seed funds, equipment donations from industry) and workshops and training sessions to foster awareness and adoption of PDC curricula.  Feedback from early adopters and coordination with the ACM/IEEE 2013 CS Curriculum Taskforce steers future development of both the PDC curricular guidelines and of strategies for deploying PDC material within computing curricula at a larger scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by CISE, OCI, and EHR/DUE.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) now permeates most computing activities. The ubiquity of computing devices containing multicore processors and graphics processors (GPUs), along with the rapidly growing importance of data science and machine learning, are making most users dependent on parallel processing. Increasing use of web-based services, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things, is weaving distributed computing into the fabric of modern society.  Thus we face significant challenges for transforming computer science (CS) and computer engineering (CE) education to prepare students to enter the 21st century workforce.   Many aspects of current CS and CE curricula in the United States are stuck in the sequential model of computing that came to dominate the 20th century. Recent curriculum recommendations (e.g., ACM 2013) have begun to address the need for change, and some early adopters have been pioneering new approaches. However, there is much left to do. Given that PDC was previously considered a somewhat exotic and specialized subfield, many current faculty did not receive instruction in it, and thus there is a great need for professional development to bootstrap the educational workforce?s training in its use.  The goal of our work, following the guidance we developed for the ACM curriculum, has been to help instructors migrate courses in the first two years of undergraduate CS and CE programs from the sequential model toward embracing PDC. Our focus on the early years is based on the understanding that students should start to grasp these aspects of problem solving from the very beginning, rather than having to unlearn sequential problem solving approaches to be able to think in terms of PDC.      Project Outcomes  Under this grant, the Center for Parallel and Distributed Computing Curriculum Development and Educational Resources (CDER), developed the undergraduate curriculum guideline for PDC that informed the ACM Computer Science Curricula 2013. The curriculum guideline was written in coordination with the IEEE Technical Committee on Parallel Processing through a multi-year process with input from a diverse set of stakeholders.  Since 2011, CDER has sponsored sixteen workshops devoted to PDC education: The EduPar series, held in conjunction with the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, has been offered from 2011 through 2018. EduHPC, held with Supercomputing, has been offered in 2013 - 2017. Euro-EduPar has been held with EuroPar in 2015 - 2017.  The latter two are expected to run again in 2018. We have participated in thirteen panel sessions at various conferences and workshops, including special sessions we organized at SIGCSE, and given five invited talks.  Following publication of the curriculum guideline, we worked to encourage adoption by awarding 141 small curriculum development grants in seven competitive rounds (two each in 2011and 2012, one each in 2013 - 2015). Many of the grant recipients were able to report the results of their experimental course offerings at our workshops because of additional travel grants. Not only did this enable them to present their work, but also to network with other instructors and build a community of early adopters. We obtained additional funding from Intel that enabled international participation, and hardware grants from NVIDIA to enable some adopters to introduce GPU programming to their students. We estimate that well over 3000 students were trained in PDC just through the experimental courses, and many thousands more will have been trained through ongoing offerings.  To facilitate adoption of PDC topics in courses, we published a book of novel material for instructors (how to teach specific topics) and students (supplements that could be used with existing texts). The book chapters were a combination of early adopter submissions and material solicited from pioneering educators. A second book was subsequently developed, and we are looking for a new publisher, since the original publisher reorganized and is no longer producing monographs. We also published a Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing special issue containing the best papers from several years of our workshops.   We built a publicly available cluster parallel processor to facilitate PDC education efforts by instructors across the country, and set up an online repository for contributed course materials, software, and data. A web site was also constructed for public distribution of the curriculum, workshop papers, reports from meetings, draft chapters from the book, and information about the early adopter grants.   We are now embarking on an update of the curriculum, and working to extend it to include the high school level through the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles course, which reaches students across many STEM disciplines. The project has thus achieved intellectual merit in the form of novel curriculum guidance and instructional approaches, and broader impact by influencing CS and CE education worldwide to better prepare the workforce of tomorrow to be able to solve important problems using the kinds of systems that have become ubiquitous in the 21st century.
