<AbstractNarration>Males and females have nearly identical genomes, yet males and females can differ dramatically in appearance, physiology, and behavior. The proximate explanation for sex differences in phenotype is differences in gene expression, i.e., which genes are ?turned on or off? in males and females. But exactly how gender affects gene expression is an open question where much remains to be learned. Hormones such as testosterone are likely candidates for controlling differences in gene expression of genes in males and females. To date much of the research in this area has focused on experimental manipulation of hormones, rather than on the role of natural, individual variation in levels of circulating hormone. The research supported by this award asks two primary questions: (1) what genes and gene networks are affected by natural, individual variation in testosterone phenotype, and (2) how do males and females differ in affected genes and gene networks? The dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), a North-American songbird, will be the subject of study because of the recent development of genomic tools in this system and the wealth of historical data on its natural history, response to testosterone, and sex differences in behavior; all studied in a wild population. Successful completion of the aims of this project will enhance our understanding of the genes and gene networks that are related to natural variation in testosterone. The research proposed here will have broader impacts because it will provide unique opportunities for undergraduate research: the preliminary stages of this research have already led to undergraduate research opportunities for four individuals from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award provided two important types of support: reasearch findings and preparation of an academic. The research supported by this grant has extended our understanding of the dark-eyed junco. This project is the culmination of the development of genomic tools  for an ecological-model system (the dark-eyed junco). Our initial results indicate that males and females share a core group of genes regulated by individual variation in testosterone, but that each sex further regulates a large number of genes in a sex-specific manner. These core genes appear to be responsible for many of the primary effects of testosterone on phenotype, while the sex-specific genes appear to modulate the specific outcomes for each sex. This may reflect sex-specific phenotypic responses, or it may be that females are regulating genes to reduce the negative-effects of testosterone. Further analyses of the data already in hand may allow us to discriminate between these hypotheses. The tools  developed and their application to novel ecological questions provides a  framework for future genomic analyses of the junco (many already  underway and funded by NIH and international agencies based on this  work). Further the ease and speed with which these tools emerged may  provide a model for researchers investigating other species to develop  similar tools. The identification of specific genes and pathways (along with the  general pattern of findings) will provide many biomarkers to test for  environmental androgen contamination, as well as open new questions for  the study of endocrinology and sexual dimorphism. In particular, the additional genomic resources are being leveraged to extend analyses to questions of population genomics and speciation. The direct findings have showed us some of the substantial differences in gene expression between male and female juncos, which will inform future understanding of sex differences in multiple species. Our investigation of individual variation has shown that some of the behavioral and physiological variation that is related to testosterone is mediated by changes in gene expression. For career development, this grant allowed me to complete my dissertation rapidly with high quality research, prepared me for a productive post-doctoral position (supported by both HHMI and NSF), and put me in the strong position that allowed me to obtain a tenure-track position teaching at a small undergraduate institution.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/02/2014<br>      Modified by: Mark&nbsp;Peterson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
