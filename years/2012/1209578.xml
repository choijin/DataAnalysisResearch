<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Materials World Network project will synthesize, characterize and study experimentally, properties of high temperature superconductors such as the cuprates, whose carrier concentrations will be electrostatic altered in field effect transistor geometries employing an electronic double layer transistor (EDLT) technique that uses ionic liquids as gate dielectrics. In effect electrostatic doping would replace chemical doping.  Since carrier concentration is a control parameter that governs the properties of these systems, this approach will facilitate the investigation of systems through continuous and reversible changes of carrier concentration.  The program includes studies of X-ray scattering and superfluid density to supplement the usual measurements of electrical transport and magneto-transport.  Electronic double layer transistors contain a gate electrode, a layer into which charge can be accumulated or depleted, source and drain electrodes, as well as electrodes for measuring longitudinal and transverse voltages. Ionic liquids are molten salts consisting of large ions such that their Coulomb interaction is sufficiently small to make them room temperature liquids. Upon applying a gate voltage, ions move to the surface of the layer to be doped, forming an electric double layer such that with the charge induced, acts as a capacitor of nanoscale thickness. The charge accumulation or depletion layers formed using EDLTs may be the order of just a few unit cells in thickness and will contain high electric fields and electric field gradients.  The doped layer may be a two-dimensional rather than a three-dimensional superconductor.  It is thus not a given that electrostatic doping is completely equivalent to chemical doping to the same charge level.  On the other hand, when the microscopic process of electric field doping becomes well understood, considerable insight into the rich physics of the cuprates may be gained. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This Materials World Network project will employ ionic liquid field effect transistor configurations to electrostatically alter charge carrier densities, and study the resultant changes in the physical properties of high temperature superconductors. The usual approach to this is to prepare samples with different chemical compositions.  This new approach eliminates the need to do this, speeding the rate of exploration. Ionic liquids, which are molten salts at room temperature, replace the gate insulator in the field effect transistor configuration. Their use can facilitate charge transfers more than 100 times greater than achievable with conventional insulators, because of the formation of an electronic double layer, which is in effect a capacitor with a nanometer scale gap.  The broader impacts of the proposed program include training of graduate students in a traditional physics Ph.D. program and providing a venue for useful and positive research experiences for undergraduates from both Minnesota and elsewhere. In addition, this international effort will allow for strong interaction of personnel from the US and Spain, which will broaden the experience of young scientists in the global scientific community.  Finally, the work described in this proposal may have an impact on the search for new superconductors, which is one of the grand challenges of contemporary condensed matter and materials physics.  It could demonstrate that electrostatic doping is a viable alternative to traditional chemical doping in this quest.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Condensed Matter Physics program and the Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program linked the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities with the Complutense University of Madrid.  The goals of the program were to study selected properties of cuprate superconductors as a function of their doping, which was to be varied by electrostatically using ionic liquids.  The program trained two Ph.D. students who are now working for high-technology companies, and exposed them to international collaboration. The doping technique used may have a major impact on the search for new superconductors and other complex materials with potentially novel properties, as it could provide a far simpler alternative to traditional chemical doping.  In each cuprate family there is an antiferromagnetic insulating parent compound.  Metallic and superconducting behavior is achieved by chemical substitution, a process that is referred to as "doping."  Over a certain doping range the compound is superconducting.  It is important to understand the doping phase diagram.  Unfortunately a new sample is required for each composition, making the process of exploring the doping-dependence of properties a very tedious affair. The electrostatic approach can be used to change the carrier concentration of a single sample continuously.  Thin films of the cuprates, YBa2Cu3O7-x and La2CuO4+x were incorporated as the channels of field effect transistors (FETs).  They were effectively one electrode in a capacitor where the other electrode was the gate.   The configuration used, employed an ionic liquid rather than a solid dielectric as the gate insulator.  The operation of this FET differs from that of an FET with a solid gate insulator, in that if the gate is charged while the ionic liquid is in the liquid state, instead of the insulator developing a volume polarization, the positive ions migrate to the negative electrode and the negative ions to the positive electrode, where they induce opposite charges in their respective electrodes and form configurations which are called electric double layers (EDLs).  The EDL is an old concept, first discussed in the 1850s by von Helmholtz. In EDL transistors, there are effectively two nanometer thickness capacitors, one at each electrode.  This nanometer thickness is responsible for the very large charge densities that can be induced.   Ionic liquids are organic molten salts, which are liquid at room temperature and somewhat below.  The ions are mobile at temperatures down to those at which the ionic liquid freezes.  Thus changing the gate voltage is carried out at temperatures where the ions are mobile and the measurements are made at low temperatures.  To systematically change the carrier concentration and to measure physical properties at low temperatures requires cycling back and forth between the temperature of interest and the charging temperature.   We measured the electrical  and Hall resistances of YBa2Cu3O7-x and La2CuO4+x as a function of carrier concentration and temperature.  We carried out simultaneous measurements of the resistance and the superconducting penetration depth of La2CuO4+x as a function of carrier concentration and temperature.  The penetration depth is determined at nonzero frequencies using a special mutual inductance setup.  Finally we carried out simultaneous X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies and measurements of resistance as a function of carrier concentration on films of YBa2Cu3O7-x.    We developed a phase diagram for the properties of YBa2Cu3O7-x and La2CuO4+x as a function of carrier concentration.  We characterized the superconductor-insulator transition of YBa2Cu3O7-x and La2CuO4+x as the carrier concentration was reduced. Stoichiometric La2CuO4+x is an insulator, but with excess oxygen it is a superconductor with a 45 K transition temperature.  We found it possible to continuously change the transition temperature by gating.  With simultaneous measurements of the resistance vs. temperature and the superconducting penetration depth, we were able to demonstrate that electrostatically doped La2CuO4+x satisfies Homes scaling, which relates the transition temperature, penetration depth and conductivity at the transition.  This had been previously demonstrated using many different superconducting materials, but never on a single sample.   We also addressed the issue as to whether ionic liquid gating is solely a physical process.  Experiments on VO2 led to the conclusion that it involves the formation of oxygen vacancies. These results underscore the debate on the true nature, electrostatic vs. electrochemical, of the doping process.  We addressed this problem by simultaneous ionic liquid gating and X?ray absorption experiments with YBa2Cu3O7?X.  Pronounced spectral changes were observed at the Cu K?edge concomitant with the superconductor?to?insulator transition, indicating modification of the Cu coordination resulting from the de-oxygenation of the CuO chains.  This was confirmed by first principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations, carried out by collaborators.  Thus the doping process is both electrostatic and electrochemical.  Beyond providing evidence of the importance of chemical doping in EDL gating experiments with superconducting cuprates, this work shows that interfacing correlated oxides with ionic liquids enables a delicate control of oxygen content paving the way to novel electrochemical concepts in the modification of complex oxides. These X-ray experiements involve several trips to synchrotron facilities in France and Brazil.                    Last Modified: 09/02/2016       Submitted by: Allen M Goldman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
