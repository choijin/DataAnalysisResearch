<AbstractNarration>Human activities have dramatically increased nitrogen inputs into many rivers and lakes, causing algal blooms that threaten economic and recreational uses of those waters. Lake Taihu, the third largest lake in China, experiences damaging blooms of toxic cyanobacteria as a result of excessive nutrient inputs. The identities, nitrogen processing capabilities, and activities of microbial communities in Lake Taihu will be examined to determine if nitrogen processing can be predicted from knowledge of the identity and genetic makeup of those communities. Various components of the nitrogen cycle will be measured and linked to representative molecular markers which, coupled with high throughput genetic sequencing, will provide a genetic database of nitrogen-cycling processes in freshwater ecosystems. A goal of the project will be to link microbial taxonomic, genetic, and functional data in a model that can predict how reduction of nutrient inputs will affect toxic cyanobacterial blooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have broad applicability to the management of aquatic systems that are threatened by excessive nutrient inputs, a problem that is increasing worldwide. Additional broader impacts will include training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, international student exchanges, training of a postdoctoral researcher, and incorporation of science journalism students into field studies to promote adult scientific literacy.</AbstractNarration>

The resulting rates help collaborators link quantitative and phytogenetically relevant molecular markers to ecosystem function and to construct an ecosystem model to resolve taxonomic-genetic-functional diversity.  Specific objectives of this project were to quantify rates of N transformations including nitrification, denitrification, dissimilatoryt reduction to ammonium (DNRA), ammonium regeneration, and potenitial ammonium and urea uptake in the water column and/or sediments of Taihu Lake.   An ancillary goal was to conduct experiments to examin mechanisms of organic N compound mineralization, which are applicable to Taihu Lake and other comparable ecosystems world-wide,  Gardner and colleagues developed a Community Biological Ammonium Demand (CBAD) concept model to relate CyanoHABS to available N conditions and dynamics.  We speculate, and provide experimental evidence, that high algal production, with degradation of labile fresh organic material  and oxygen gas depletion, coincides with N removal gradients extending from tributary nutrient sources.  Our mechanistic conceptual model suggests that high nutrient inputs into warm shallow regions fo lakes promote: (1) high microbial production, (2) high N cycling rates, (3) dominance of non-fixing CyanoHABs, and (4) production and rapid turnover of labile organic matter that enhances N removal via denitrification in shallow polluited regions of large lakes.  A manuscript "Community Biological Ammonium Demand (CBAD): A Mechanstic Explanation for Cyanobacterial Blooms in Eutrophic Lakes" was submitted recently for publication.
