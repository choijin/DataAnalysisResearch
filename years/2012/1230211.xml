<AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will bring together an international group of scholars to discuss the social studies of science and technology in Latin American contexts. In doing so, it will form new networks among North American, South American, and European scholars who use concepts and frameworks from science and technology studies (STS) to study science and technology in Latin America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international focus of this workshop will provide new perspectives and ways of thinking about science and technology, including the role of adaptation and translation of science and technology across cultures. Workshop participants will analyze how Latin American experiences broaden our understandings of science and technology; make visible the assumptions, values, and ethical dimensions of science and engineering practices; and push the interdisciplinary field of STS in new directions. The proposed workshop will also advance a new wave of new scholarship and showcase and make accessible some of the best STS scholarship by Latin American academics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will engage members of the Indiana University at Bloomington community with STS scholarship on Latin America. More broadly, it will enhance infrastructure for research and education by advancing the formation of an intellectual community dedicated to the study of science and technology in Latin American contexts. It will benefit society by providing information for science and technology policy formation once the revised workshop papers are published. It will also broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, since academics from Latin American institutions (and North American scholars who study STS in the global south) are underrepresented in the international STS community. The workshop findings will be compiled in an edited volume, which will be distributed internationally by MIT Press.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project resulted in an international workshop and an edited volume on the social study of science and technology in Latin America.        The international workshop "Studying Science and Technology in Latin America: Beyond Imported Magic," took place on the Bloomington campus August 24-25, 2012.  Twenty-two paper presenters traveled from nine countries to take part in the workshop. The countries represented included Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States.     The first day of the workshop featured three public lectures from high-profile speakers ("luminaries") who are conducting cutting-edge research on the study of science and technology in Latin America. These were lively talks given by Ivan da Costa Marques ("Ontological Politics and Latin American Local Knowledges"), Julia Rodriguez ("Study the Skulls and Bones: Latin America as a Site of Inquiry into the Origins of Humanity"), and David Hess ("The New Developmentalism: Brazil, the U.S., and Green Transitions"). Members of the Indiana University faculty and student body (graduate and undergraduate) attended the talks, as did members of the Bloomington community. At the conclusion of the first day, all invited workshop participants delivered three minute "lightning talks" to let audience members see the breadth of research present at the workshop.       The second day of the workshop was restricted to invited participants and consisted of discussing pre-circulated papers in three breakout groups. Each luminary was charged with leading a breakout group and preparing, in advance, written comments for each paper in the group. This format allowed workshop participants to receive two forms of peer review: oral comments from group members, and oral and written comments from a senior scholar. Participants included the twenty-two paper presenters, six members of the Indiana University faculty (representing American Studies, CLACS, Criminal Justice, Informatics and Computing, Anthropology and Gender Studies), and four graduate students.      After the workshop, participants revised their papers for inclusion in the edited volume Beyond Imported Magic: Science, Technology and Society in Latin America. This manuscript was submitted to MIT Press for peer review, was revised, and is now in production and scheduled for publication in 2014.      This project has intellectual merit because its focus on Latin America enriches the literature on science and technology studies and makes it more inclusive. Research presented in the workshop and edited volume demonstrates why Latin American experiences, and experiences of the Global South more generally, are central to understanding varying processes of global scientific and technological knowledge production, as well as instances of local adaptation and innovation.Moreover, the workshop and book made accessible in English some of the best STS scholarship by Latin American academics.

Latin American academics may similarly face challenges connecting with their counterparts in North America and Europe. Approximately half of the participants in the workshop and edited volume are from Latin American institutions.     The project has broader impact because it broadened the participation in the international STS community of underrepresented groups, including academics from Latin American institutions. It enhanced the infrastructure for research and education by forming an intellectual community dedicated to the study of science and technology in Latin America. It also contributed to the advancement of understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students. Graduate students participated in the workshop as invited participants, note takers, translators, and (along with undergraduate students) as ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
