<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to demonstrate novel silicon-integratible graphene-based&lt;br/&gt;devices, including the metal-oxide-graphene-silicon field-effect transistor to achieve drain&lt;br/&gt;current saturation with a zero bandgap, and the graphene-insulator-graphene junction to achieve&lt;br/&gt;resonance tunneling. These devices are expected to harness the enormous momentum behind&lt;br/&gt;silicon manufacturing, exploit the unique advantages graphene while circumventing serious&lt;br/&gt;challenges, thus find niche applications for technology entry, and eventually enter the&lt;br/&gt;mainstream digital arena with full potential enabled by future progress.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This project represents coherent research efforts spanning materials, concepts,&lt;br/&gt;and implementation. The materials growth research will seek answers to fundamental questions&lt;br/&gt;about heteroepitaxy of two-dimensional layers. Novel device concepts, with deep roots in&lt;br/&gt;proven ideas (modulation doping and resonant tunneling), uniquely take advantage of the&lt;br/&gt;material properties. Implementation of the concepts incorporates realistic engineering&lt;br/&gt;considerations from materials and processing to structures and modeling, and represents sound&lt;br/&gt;engineering practice.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: New discoveries will be introduced to undergraduate and graduate students, not&lt;br/&gt;only to convey knowledge, but also to stimulate curiosity and enthusiasm. Outreach activities&lt;br/&gt;such as the PI's partnership with a local high school will impact K-12 science and math&lt;br/&gt;education. The nature of the proposed research provides an excellent multidisciplinary research&lt;br/&gt;platform for graduate students. This project will enhance diversity by involving and training&lt;br/&gt;female graduate students and by recruiting young minds from underrepresented groups. The&lt;br/&gt;success of this research will potentially create US jobs by complementing the dominant, largely&lt;br/&gt;overseas silicon-based fabrication with graphene-based niche technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program aimed at schemes of graphene-based, silicon-integratible electronic devices for practical applications.  Due to the lack of a band gap, two-dimensional (2D), unmodified graphene does not provide a switching solution for conventional digital logic.

Therefore, the long-term goal of the research was not to replace silicon, but is heterogeneous integration.   In the early stages of the program, the focus was on the growth of graphene and its insulator companion -- hexagonal boron nitride, a 2D material isostructural to graphene needed in graphene-based devices.  The materials growth work resulted in the demonstration of the new concept of "heteroepitaxy in two dimensions" through the synthesis and characterization of graphene/h-BN in-plane heterostructures (see accompanying image).  This work significantly impacted the field of 2D materials by inspiring a large number of works on in-plane heterostructures of 2D materials.
