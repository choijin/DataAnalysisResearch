<AbstractNarration>This proposal studies phase transition waves in liquid aerosols, including one-dimensional traveling waves and three-dimensional spherically symmetric standing waves. These waves can be subsonic, supersonic or transonic; the PI aims to characterize all possible wave patterns, completing a partial list obtained by Fan, Lin and Wechselberger. The proposal also studies some related problems: phase transition and chemical reaction waves in porous media, stability of KPP-type waves in large bounded domains, multi-front wave patterns described by a concatenation of simple traveling waves, and numerical methods for computing traveling waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this proposal is to study the liquid-vapor phase transition in liquid aerosols, suspensions of fine liquid droplets in a gas, such as the gasoline-air mixture in the fuel injection nozzle of a combustion engine cylinder.  The PI will investigate evaporation waves in conical nozzles as models of evaporation of fuel in injection nozzles of gasoline engines. Understanding the parameter regime for the existence and stability of such waves is important, and can help achieve a well-mixed fuel and air ratio before ignition, which in turn will help improve the fuel efficiency of the engine and reduce emission of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons into the environment.  In addition, the PI will study some related problems on phase transition that have applications to fuel cell batteries and oil recovery processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In a modern internal combustion engine, it is important that gasoline is evaporated and well mixed with air before ignited by sparks. Lin and his collaborators find exact conditions under which liquid-air mixture can evaporate completely.  This ensures better combustion inside the engine cylinder which can improve the fuel efficiency of the engine and reduce the pollution to the environment.  The work of Lin and Martin Wechselberger solves the problem under what conditions a transonic evaporation wave can exist in the coupled p-system and phase transition model.  Opposite to the above, it is also important to understand the liquefaction /condensation process, we find conditions for the liquefaction to occur which can have applications to weather forecast and chemical process.  Related to the study of evaporation condensation process is the study of traveling or standing waves.   In the work with Schecter, we study the interaction of multiple traveling waves. We developed a method that can show the stability of the concatenated wave if the path of the waves spread out and if each wave component is stable.  In the work on coupled electronic circuits (Chua's circuits), we use a PDE model to analyze the array of many identical circuits. We find that the PDE system can have periodic and chaotic waves. This may have applications in understanding waves in neural and cardiovascular networks.   Sometimes a single traveling wave can bifurcate into several nearby traveling waves. Mathematically this is related to the study of bifurcation of  homoclinic/heterocinic orbits in differential equations. In the work with Bin Long and Changrong Zhu, we solved a special case on the bifurcation of degenerate homoclinic orbits where the bifurcation is determined by two quadratic equations.
