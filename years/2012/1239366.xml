<AbstractNarration>This project develops an integrated framework of communications, computation and control for understanding wide-area power system performance in the face of unpredictable disturbances. The power system is chosen as a particularly challenging cyber physical system (CPS) due to its extreme dimension, geographic reach and high reliability requirements. The following tasks are studied in the proposed research: (a) a Partial Difference Equation (PdE) framework to model the impact of network topology on the power system stability; (b) the design of a communication network for CPS, based on the PdE modeling;(c) the design of a control system, which addresses the challenges such as fast response and resource constraints; (d) the design of a computing infrastructure, which addresses the computation for controlling the power network, in particular, the communication complexity for controlling the power network in both cases of one-snapshot computation and iterative computations; and (e) the test and evaluation for both small scale system models of several hundred buses and very large system models of ~50,000 buses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work contributes to the broader understanding of CPS with high reliability requirements, particularly, critical infrastructures such as the power grid. Modern infrastructures are complex systems of communications and computation tied to the controls of the physical system. The proposed research contributes to improved reliability by addressing the propagation of disturbances and advancing the understanding of geographically distributed CPS. The PIs plan to open multiple courses on CPS related to the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit   This work sought to develop a integrated framework of communications, computation and control for understanding wide-area power system performance in the face of unpredictable disturbances. The primary contributions of this work include:    - introduced a wave-based model with partial differential equations to represent the spatial distribituion of the power grid. This model  informs the traditional model that cannot capture the wave-like  phenomena of disturbances clearly. We have a developed a distributed  control approach with spatial variation in both voltage magnitude and  phase.  - investigated  traditional ordinary differential equation models for trade-offs between  centralized, decentralized and distributed controls in limiting the impact of disturbances. - developed robust control methods for fault tolerance based on the  concepts of reconfiguration for virtual sensors and virtual actuators. - created a new framework for switched mode design of the grid for remedial action schemes    - designed new communication schemes, including source coding and data traffic scheduling, that are aware of physical dynamics. For the source coding, the quantization scheme for the system state uses a codebook that is adaptive to the system state of the physical dynamics. For data traffic scheduling in networks of physical dynamics, the transmission opportunity is scheduled based on the situation of available packets by employing dynamic programming.  Broader Impacts   The inter-disciplinary essence of the proposed research lent itself to cross-disciplinary collaboration and education. Investigators in applied mathematics, communications systems, control theory and power systems jointly guided graduate students  and developed new course curricula.
