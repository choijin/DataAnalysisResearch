<AbstractNarration>Mutation is the source of genetic variation and organismal diversity, yet its precise contribution to evolution remains a fundamental problem in biology. This study combines next gen sequencing with classical mutation accumulation (MA) studies to describe sequence-level mutation rates. The researchers will employ whole genome sequencing to quantify the mutation rate and the spectrum of mutations in multiple genetic backgrounds of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequencing will be done on 100 MA lines derived from the Columbia accession of Arabidopsis thaliana, which have been assessed for performance in six natural field environments. Additional sequencing will include 40 lines from each of 8 additional sets of MA lines, established from naturally-collected founder genotypes from France and Sweden, and 50 lines from natural North American selections that have been identified to contain a unique haplotype grouping and divergence pattern of mutations similar to that found in classical MA lines. These data will estimate with much greater accuracy the type and rates of spontaneous mutation at the sequence level and will allow the research team to decompose the spectrum of mutations and connect them to field performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The synthesis of these datasets will enable the determination of which types of mutations are more likely to be beneficial, deleterious or neutral, and whether the effects of certain types of identified mutations are consistent across environments. There are societal, scientific and educational broader impacts to improving our understanding of mutations in plants. Mutation rates are important in plant breeding, in predicting evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds, and in predicting evolutionary responses of plants to major environmental changes such as climate change. Undergraduate students will have early access to sequence data and the opportunity to participate in the project. The researchers will develop a web-based educational module that allows students to learn 1) the causes and types of mutation 2) strategies for studying mutation 3) the importance of mutation to evolution and to human health and 4) how to use databases describing real mutations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mutations are changes in DNA sequence that result from mistakes when DNA is copied.  Some of these errors can be passed on to offspring.  These mutations are the source of the genetic variation we observe across organisms and are also responsible for genetically based diseases of humans. Despite the biological importance of mutations, we still have much to learn about their basic biology, including how often new mutations occur, the rate of different types of mutations, and their effects on the health of the organism.     The goal of our project is to accurately estimate the overall rate of mutation at the sequence level and to further explore what the rate of different types of mutations are. Our research is conducted using a plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis thaliana has been studied by plant geneticists for decades, and the genetics of this plant are better understood than any other.  To study new mutations, we start with a single plant, and then create multiple new lineages from its offspring.  Each of these new lineages is then propagated for many generations. Within each lineage unique mutations occur and accumulate, gradually contributing to differentiation among the lineages.     For this project, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of lineages that had accumulated these mutations for a known number of generations.  We conducted our studies on sets of plants that had several different starting points:  plants from a line that had been cultivated in a laboratory for many generations, plants collected from natural populations from the native range of the plant, and plants collected from the non-native range of North America.     For the laboratory line, we found that at each position within the genome of A. thaliana there was an approximately 7 out of one billion chance each generation of a mutation at that position.  However, the probability of mutation was not the same for all parts of the genome.  Some parts of the genome, known as transposable elements, gradually spread through the genome by making copies of themselves over the course of many generations.  Our results indicate that these parts of the genomes also mutate more quickly than other areas.      We also compared the result of the mutations observed from our experimental lines with the types of variation in DNA sequence observed across natural populations.  We found that uneven patterns of mutations found in our experimental lines matched many of the patterns found in natural populations, with some of the exact same mutations occurring in both groups.  Our finding suggests that a substantive proportion of natural variation is determined by the mutation process.  In comparing the mutation rates between sets of experimental lines that started from different initial parents (different genetic starting points) we did not observe significant variation in the mutation rate at the single base pair level among sets of lines, although there are some differences between lines for the rates of larger mutations that affect groups of bases.  Our result suggests that overall most Arabidopsis thaliana individuals have similar mutation properties.  Because some of our experimental sets of mutation lines had also been grown under field conditions, we were able to combine our analyses to understand how the number and type of mutation affected plant performance.  In general, we found that mutations were more likely to have harmful effects when the plants were grown in a novel environment, compared to when they were grown at their home site.     The intellectual outcome of the research will allow biologists to better understand how mutations produce variation at the DNA level and to make more accurate estimates of the contribution of mutation to long term biological phenomena.     The broader impacts of the project include training of three students and two postdoctoral researchers. Two of the students participated in international collaborations, including participating in field work in France and Sweden.  The other student was an undergraduate who became the lead programmer helping to build a game-themed educational module that teaches the basics of mutation biology.  The project helped to build links between computer science and biology at the institution of the principal investigator.   In addition, understanding the mutation rate in plants could assist plant breeders to improve agricultural production.  Also, understanding how mutation rates vary across the genome will also help understand the influence of sequence changes on the potential for causing disease in plants and other species.
