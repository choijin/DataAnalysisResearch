<AbstractNarration>This project will use a two-dimensional electromagnetic Darwin particle-in-cell simulation determine self-consistently how whistler waves are generated in the magnetosphere for a variety of conditions and to understand the ensuing wave-particle interactions. Non-linear wave-particle and wave-wave interactions are important aspects of this problem necessitating the use of particle in cell simulations. Recent observational and theoretical work has shown that whistler-mode waves can propagate obliquely with respect to the ambient magnetic field, so a multidimensional approach is required. The simulations will be run on a next-generation computational platform that will allow the inclusion of realistic parameters for the radiation belt region and will be used in close coordination with observed wave and particle data to study the growth, amplitudes, and wave propagation characteristics of whistler waves and for chorus waves, the formation of their structured spectra, and the general effects whistlers have on electrons in terms of energization and pitch angle scattering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whistler waves, which are ubiquitous in the radiation belt region, play a major role in the transport, acceleration and loss of electrons. Whistlers are observed with a variety of characteristics and are sometimes smooth and unstructured, but other times are observed as bursty and structured.  The structured and bursty types of emissions are commonly referred to as chorus. Understanding the role waves play in the formation of relativistic electron populations in the radiation belt region is key to space weather studies because of the deleterious effects these electrons can have on satellites. The research program here uses a first principles, self-consistent simulation approach to understand the fundamental problem concerning the origin of VLF whistler waves and the energization of inner-magnetospheric plasmas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A study has been carried out to understand the generation and consequences of naturally occuring electromagnetic waves called "chorus" in the radiation belt region of space around the Earth.  The energization of particles and the generation of electromagnetic emissions in and around the radiation belt region contribute to "space weather", which can affect spacecraft orbting the Earth and in extreme cases can affect ground based electrical systems on the Earth's surface.  Using large scale numerical simulation models and data from the NASA Van Allen Probes spacecraft mission, It has been found that when charged particles (electrons) are injected into the radiation belt region from much further away in space with certain energy characteristics, chorus mode emissions can be generated.  Due to non-linear processes, the generated wave spectrum broadens somewhat in frequency, in agreement with Van Allen Probe observations of chorus waves.  The chorus waves also tend to interact with local electrons, transforming particle energy from motion that is predominantly perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field direction into motion parallel to the ambient magnetic field.  This wave-particle energy transformation can scatter electrons into the so-called "loss cone", whereby particles inside the loss cone can then precipitate into the Earth's ionosphere at auroral zone latitudes.  The charged particles that originally generate chorus are injected from a region outside the radiation belt much further from the Earth known as the magnetotail, where the process of magnetic reconnection can energize electrons and transport them towards the Earth.  The observed bursty nature of the chorus emissions can be due either to repeated electron injections from the magnetotail or the periodic mirror bounce process when the loss cone empties via precipitation into Earth's ionosphere, or possibly by some combination of both processes.
