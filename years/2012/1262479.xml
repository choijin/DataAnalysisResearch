<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Viktor V. Zhdankin of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of Minnesota Duluth will explore the chemistry of trivalent and pentavalent iodine compounds, which are efficient and environmentally benign oxidizing reagents with numerous applications in organic synthesis.  While organohypervalent iodine compounds are well-established stoichiometric reagents, little progress has been made in the development of new catalytic reactions promoted by hypervalent iodine.  Studies of new, metal-free catalytic reactions based on hypervalent iodine chemistry and an exploratory search for new and potentially useful organohypervalent iodine compounds are proposed.  Synthetically useful methodologies based on the new, iodoarene-catalyzed oxidative transformations, such as the Hofmann rearrangement of amides to amines and the oxidative heterocyclization reactions leading to isoxazole derivatives and N-substituted indoles, will be investigated.  Organoiodine-catalyzed enantioselective aziridination reactions on the basis of a recently discovered metal-free catalytic procedure for the aziridination of alkenes using organic iodide as catalyst will also be studied.  An exploratory study on the preparation, structural characterization, and chemical properties of new, potentially useful hypervalent iodine amides, imides, and ylides will be also performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New synthetic methodology based on organohypervalent iodine chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as it utilizes non-toxic compounds of iodine as catalysts or recyclable reagents in aqueous solutions.  Successful development of this methodology will have an impact on any area of activity in which the synthesis of molecules is needed, such as the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industry, and the biological and chemical research activities.  In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Organic compounds of polyvalent iodine, which are also known under the general name of hypervalent iodine reagents, have chemical properties similar to the derivatives of transition metals, but without the toxicity and environmental problems of these heavy metal congeners.  While hypervalent iodine compounds are well-established stoichiometric reagents, little progress has previously been made in the development of catalytic reactions promoted by hypervalent iodine.

In particular, efficient, transition metal-free synthetic procedure for dicyanocyclopropanation of alkenes using catalytic amounts of molecular iodine as a precatalyst and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as a terminal oxidant under mild conditions has been developed. Several new, ?green' recyclable hypervalent iodine reagents have been developed such as the pseudocyclic triflate derivative of benziodoxole (IBA-OTf). This highly electrophilic reagent readily reacts with various organic substrates to give the corresponding products in good yields. In addition, synthetic and structural studies of several new classes of hypervalent iodine compounds have been performed.

The saccharin-based imidoiodanes are excellent reagents for the transfer of the saccharin group to organic substrates.  All these new, environmentally benign iodine reagents are potentially important for the development of green industrial technologies.   The results of this project during 2013-2017 were published in 34 papers (including four reviews and three book chapters), reported as nine presentations at national ACS meetings (including a lecture at the national Award Symposium at the 249 ACS Meeting in Spring 2015), and presented as invited lectures at the National Symposium QuimiUNAM in Mexico (November 2013), the International Conference on Chemical Bonding, Kauai, HI (July 2013), the 4th International Conference on Hypervalent Iodine Chemistry, Narita, Japan (July 2014), the 5th International Conference on Hypervalent Iodine Chemistry, Les Diablerets, Switzerland (July 2016), and the International Symposium on Elementoorganic Chemistry, Kunshan, China (November 2014) and presented as invited seminars in 17 universities.

Zhdankin, V.V. (author), John Wiley &amp; Sons: Chichester, 2014, 480 pages.
