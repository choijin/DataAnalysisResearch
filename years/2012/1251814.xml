<AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to determine the link between topographic uplift, erosion and exhumation, pre-existing geologic boundaries, and the underlying mantle dynamics that drive deformation.  The field area is the Salmon River suture zone of western Idaho, which is the boundary between Precambrian North America underlying most of Idaho and younger (Phanerozoic) accreted terranes of the Blue Mountains in Oregon.  The Idaho batholith formed exclusively on the North American side of this boundary.  Post-collision and ongoing deformation affect different parts of the region differently, representing differences in pre-existing geologic structure and/or in deep driving forces. The timing, rates, and amounts of uplift of the various mountain ranges will be related to the current subsurface geometry -- determined using seismic data -- to identify motions in the Earth?s crust and mantle that elevated topography on regional scales.  The work entails a combination of seismic data analyses, to provide a detailed sub-surface architecture, and thermochronology, to determing the timing of uplift and exhumation of rocks from depth and the development of the current topography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work spans three main study areas and includes a final project synthesis:  1) Documentation of the exhumation path of the Atlanta lobe of the Idaho batholith to determine if it was uplifted by younger magmatism; 2) Evaluation of potential differential exhumation along the trans-Challis fault zone that cross-cuts the Idaho batholith; and 3) Documentation of exhumation in the Blue Mountains, in order to compare its history to that of adjacent North America.  A particular focus is whether the Salmon River suture zone was reactivated by post-Columbia River Basalt extension. The combination of the thermochronology and seismic results with recent geology, geochronology, and geochemistry studies will allow synthesis of a regional tectonic evolution and can illuminate the relationship between inherited lithospheric structures and active tectonic processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two graduate and two undergraduate students at the University of Florida and Virginia Tech are directly supported by this work.  Tectonic synthesis will involve graduate students at all three institutions, several of whom are funded by other sources.</AbstractNarration>
