<AbstractNarration>The REU Site: Arctic and Antarctic CReSIS (AaA-REU) program will involve 75 undergraduates over a three-year period with five pre-service RET students each year. This project is a continuation of the REU Site program that has operated at Elizabeth City State University and other CReSIS (Center for Remote Sensing of the Ice Sheets) institutions since 2010. The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.  The vision for this project is driven by the compelling need to draw on the integration of polar research and education to attract a diverse pool of talented students into polar-related careers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The AaA-REU project will be interdisciplinary in focus and will make innovative, cost-effective use of cyberinfrastructure. The project builds upon existing partnerships in polar science, engineering, education, and cyberinfrastructure -- partnerships that provide access to extensive CReSIS resources under the direction of an experienced team of educators and researchers. It is expected that the demographics of the participants will reflect the exciting minority percentages that were realized during the past CReSIS-REU award.</AbstractNarration>

The project was conducted for eight weeks each summer, with on-line mentoring and follow-up during the academic year. Students were placed at Elizabeth City State University (ECSU), The University of Kansas (KU), Indiana University (IU), and Pennsylvania State University (PSU).   Broader impacts:  The program also included a Research Experience for Teachers (RET) component, which involved pre-service STEM education majors.  Women made up 42% to 63% and minorities made up 58% to 93% of the program participants.  A significant number of the participants came from outside the host institutions including 12 minority serving institutions and 11 non-MSIs.  RET students were STEM education majors placed at ECSU and at KU where there was significant education activity.  Haskell Indian Nation partnered with the RET component of the AaA to send 5 Native American Indian participants to design Ice, Ice Baby Lessons; study glacial striations; and consequences of sea level rise on metropolitan coastal cities in America.  Intellectual merit:  REU students under the direction of Dr. Malcolm LeCompte and Dr. Linda Hayden at Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) conducted a research project to quantify ice margin changes in the Amundsen Sea region using LIMA as a benchmark. They discovered an ice shelf that had gradually shrunk from 1972 to 2003 and has failed to reform.  The feature is a former ice shelf occupying an embayment along the southern side of Canisteo Peninsula 12.5 miles north of Suchland Islands and approximately 20 miles north northwest of Cranton Bay.

The AaA REU program, which developed out of the NSF STC Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) led by Dr. Prasad Gogineni, received supplements to pilot Glacier Exploration experiences.  AaA-GEX provided students with a polar field experience (in the Juneau Ice Field and in Norway), augmented by mentoring and sustained engagement with the polar community.
