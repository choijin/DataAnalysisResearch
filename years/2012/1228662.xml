<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1228662&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Guangshu Zhai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed instrument will support the body of research at The University of Iowa on trace organic compounds and their metabolites in the environment and living organisms by increasing capacity and capabilities. This instrument will allow in-depth studies within our ongoing projects, including the transport and fate of hormones in plants (Zhai and Schnoor), hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs in poplars (Zhai and Schnoor), rats (Robertson) and human blood (Hornbuckle); organic pollutants by extreme flood events (Hornbuckle, Just, Schnoor); PCBs sulfate metabolites of PCBs in poplars (Zhai and Schnoor), rats (Robertson and Duffel); the enantioselective metabolism of chiral PCBs and their metabolites (Zhai, Schnoor, and Lehlmer); PCB-related compounds in the environment (Hornbuckle, Lehmler, Thorne) and others. All the organic compounds mentioned above have the potential of great harm to our health and environment. All the researchers in this team will use this LC-MS/MS to address many public concerns on the health of environment and human beings. All the findings of these researches will greatly advance our knowledge and understanding of the behavior, fate and toxicological mechanisms of organic pollutants in the environment and alert people to take suitable protective measures.</AbstractNarration>
