<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the efficiency issues with existing solar harvesting technology and the excessive power consumed by the power management circuitry. The proposed technology addresses the solar performance issues by including a low-power Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm to maximize solar collection efficiency under variable lighting conditions. The patented technology reduces the power consumed in the charging electronics by 60x over existing products. The solar power solutions developed will minimize the charging time while meeting portable form-factor requirements in both indoor and outdoor lighting conditions. The first development phase will define specifications and develop system level implementations for portable charging and standalone off-grid applications. In the second phase, technologies used in the prototype systems will be integrated into a single device to further reduce overall size and system costs. The final product of this Phase II effort will be single-chip integrated power management devices for portable charging applications and standalone autonomous off-grid systems. These devices will deliver class-leading solar conversion efficiency both indoors and outdoors, and have revolutionary power dissipation levels that will enable new applications and markets that were not possible with products on the market today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to improve the environment, enable new markets, and provide opportunities, jobs, and tax revenue. In the past, solar energy harvesting was not taken seriously due to lack of flexibility and portability. Early solar panels and harvesting electronics were too inefficient and expensive to be useable, and remained a niche product. With advances in harvesting and charging technologies, solar power can be used effectively in many consumer standalone and portable applications. The proliferation of these efficient, cost-effective solar and low-power solutions can reduce a system?s carbon footprint. Utilizing this proposal?s technology and working closely with solar panel manufacturers, solar charging and energy harvesting becomes a viable alternative to replaceable batteries and grid-power. North American consumers use approximately 200,000 tons of cell batteries each year, 95% of which end up as waste. High-efficiency solar rechargeable systems can reduce the amount of toxic battery waste that ends up in neighborhood landfills. In addition to the positive environmental impact, the technology enables new markets and growth in existing markets which allows firms to grow and provide opportunities, jobs and more than an estimated $1.5 million in federal income tax revenue over the next 5 years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Triune Systems successfully completed all technical objectives outlined in its Phase II plan.  The team demonstrated a fully functional micro inverter harvesting solution as well as a harvesting solution for portable applications.   Triune leveraged internal IP as well as its low-cost maximum point power tracking (MPPT-lite&trade;) algorithm.   The results of this research and development have relaized  commercially viable solar harvesting products.       Triune SystemsÃ† goal was to successfully apply the MPPT-lite&trade;, nanoSmart&reg;, and pseudo-MPPT circuits and algorithms for micro-solar and micro-harvesting systems that will encompass a wide variety of panel configurations under indoor and outdoor lighting conditions as well as use for other alternative harvesting schemes such as RF harvesting.  Mini-charging application solutions have been  developed with a focus on minimizing the charging time required while considering form-factor considerations necessary for portable products.  These applications will also address circuit configurations of indoor-only, outdoor-only, and indoor/outdoor lighting and environment conditions.  In addition, scaling of the technologies for higher power applications have been developed.  Triune Systems created five integrated circuit products which help manage MPPT tracking and charge either a battery or can place energy directly onto the AC grid.  In addtion to these products, Triune has created system level solutions that realize harvesting  ranging from 0.1W to 300W.  The lower power systems application are ideal for Internet-of-Things (IoT) system solutions.  The Triune solution provides a cost and size effective solution that can provide IoT products to work autonomously.  Medium power (5-20W) leverage the MPPT-lite technology and provide a streamlined build of materials for these system solutions.  The high power solutions leverage MPPT tracking with isolated power conversion that can provide loads to a storage element or directly onto the AC grid.   As a result of these integrated products and systems, Triune has a scalable solution for harvesting of energy to a storage element.   In addition, the micro-harvesting solutions developed can be used in alternative harvesting solutions such as piezo and wireless (RF) charging.     Triune Systems will continue to develop new products relating to harvesting solutions for battery systems as well as for on-grid systems.  The intent is to capitalize through product sales and outside investment.                  Last Modified: 03/02/2015       Submitted by: Wayne Chen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
