<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to develop variable-geometry dies for extruding complex plastic parts. Unlike most existing polymer extrusion dies, which have a single fixed geometry, design techniques will be created to build novel moving dies that morph between different shapes. Coordination of multiple actuators during the extrusion process will impose these changes in shape. The actuator locations will be optimized to provide the mechanical advantage required to resist the sizable pressure loads inside the extruder. The optimization will be accomplished with a genetic algorithm that considers the many design constraints, which include avoiding interference of moving parts, eliminating obstructions to the flow of the molten plastic, achieving a reasonably sized die, and minimizing actuator power consumption. Experimental work will develop new ways to manage the leakage of molten plastic within the die due to its moving parts. Prototype variable-geometry dies will be built and tested on a production extruder operated by an industrial collaborator. Validation experiments will derive empirical relationships between changes in the die geometry, extruder screw speed, and plastic temperature to provide process control settings that yield defect-free parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to create the next generation of polymer extrusion dies that can produce a wider variety of more complex plastic parts. Specifically, the work aims to enable polymer extrusion to replace injection molding for a class of plastic parts, thereby simultaneously reducing production costs and manufacturing time. Additionally, it aspires to offer designers the flexibility to create novel engineering solutions with entirely new plastic parts of varying cross sectional shape. The developed design tools will have broader application to creating other variable-geometry structures such as morphing aircraft wings and micro-scale extrusion dies.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Extrusion is a process in which polymer pellets are melted and pushed by a rotating screw through a die. Extrusion is popular in a wide range of applications including the manufacture of pipes, household siding, decorative molding, drinking straws, gutter systems, weather stripping, and window framing components. Because this process happens continuously, extrusion benefits from speeds and costs superior to other polymer processing technologies. The extrusion die&rsquo;s function is to shape the molten polymer into the desired cross section. Conventional extrusion uses a stationary die in the continuous manufacture of plastic products and is therefore limited to making parts of constant cross-section. Prior to this research, the extrusion process did not have the flexibility to accommodate a wider range of more complex products due to the limitations of stationary die design.</p> <p>This research introduced an entirely new class of dies called variable polymer extrusion dies. These new dies include moving parts that change the orifice cross-section as the molten polymer flows through. As such, these dies are capable of producing plastic parts of greater complexity than any currently extruded via conventional technology while maintaining comparable repeatability. The high speeds and low costs compared to other polymer processing technologies makes this new class of dies economically desirable. Key advances of this research include various design options for including the moving parts inside the die that allow the molten plastic to flow through it while limiting the flow into those moving parts.</p> <p>This research also established methods for the systematic development of variable-geometry extrusion dies driven by the desired shape-change in the final part&rsquo;s cross section.

The collaboration resulted in a variety of advances in shape-changing mechanism theory and variable-geometry die design from fundamental theory, through mechanical design, prototyping and testing, and into the control of the die&rsquo;s actuators for improved extruded part accuracy.

This research also generated a variety of projects and motivating examples, including hardware for students to interact with, throughout the University of Dayton&rsquo;s mechanical systems classes which range from first-year into graduate level coursework.
