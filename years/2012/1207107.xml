<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research Digitization TCN: Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN): A Model for Collections Digitization to Promote Taxonomic and Ecological Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN) brings together 10 diverse arthropod collections at universities and museums throughout the Southwest to create a virtual network of ground dwelling arthropods which are notably responsive to temporal and spatial environmental changes. These 10 collections document much of the Southwest's biodiversity, but currently the data associated with millions of arthropod specimens are not easily accessible. To overcome this, SCAN will develop methods for integrating existing databases, catalogue-image specimens, develop new electronic identification techniques, and produce a virtual library of ground-dwelling arthropods (beetles, grasshoppers, spiders, ants). In addition the project will work with the existing project Filtered Push to increase the capacity of experts to provide remote identifications and annotations of data that can be sent throughout the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comprehensive SCAN online library and expert information will be available to the public as well as professionals in taxonomy, ecology, and climate change science. Smaller institutions will be provided increased access to large data sets for promoting research. The SCAN datasets will support a number of ongoing projects examining the effects of environmental and land-use change on individual arthropod species. By increasing access to this information, SCAN will stimulate new research and increased awareness in biodiversity conservation throughout the region. Over 50 undergraduates also will be trained in cyberinfrastructure, systematics, and ecology. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource, iDigBio.org.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN) initially brought together 10 small-to-large-sized arthropod collections located in the megadiverse but taxonomically underexplored ecoregion of the southwestern United States and adjoining Mexico to create a virtual collection network.  The primary goal of this network was to digitize label data for over one million insect and arachnid specimens housed in regional museums.  This comprehensive data set and thousands of representative images provides a critical resource for conducting both taxonomic and ecological research.  In collaboration with iDigBio, we have expanded this network to North America and beyond and we have solicited participation of 43 additional collections.  This has led to the production of 3.7 million occurrence records and 120,000 images covering a range of arthropods.  We have developed huge data sets for our five target groups of ground-dwelling arthropods, ants, grasshoppers, spiders, and carabid and tenebrionid beetles.  We serve 1.7 million records just for these five focal groups, which serve key ecological roles in both natural and managed ecosystems.  Our data portal is open to anyone who wants to access collection data and it makes accessible large data sets for research from the 8.8 million records we serve.  We also host research-grade observation data from iNaturalist, the largest citizen science biodiversity program.  In total, we provide occurrence data for 100,000 species, of which approximately 8,000 have enough occurrence data to allow meaningful estimates regarding their current and future suitable habitat requirements.  We have initiated several education-outreach projects, including 3D virtual augmentation species cards for K&ndash;16 students, establishing ground-dwelling arthropod inventories at middle schools, creating checklists for national parks and monuments, and mapping exercises for university classes studying biodiversity.  We have been a leader in developing software to capture, annotate and serve biodiversity data to scientists and the public.  SCAN also serves as a model for the development of future regional arthropod collection networks to digitize the estimated 240 million additional specimens housed in United States museums.
