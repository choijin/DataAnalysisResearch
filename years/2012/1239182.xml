<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to develop fundamental theory, efficient algorithms, and realistic&lt;br/&gt;experiments for the analysis and design of safety-critical cyber-physical transportation systems&lt;br/&gt;with human operators. The research focuses on preventing crashes between automobiles at road&lt;br/&gt;intersections, since these account for about 40% of overall vehicle crashes. Specifically, the main&lt;br/&gt;objective of this work is to design provably safe driver-assist systems that understand driver?s&lt;br/&gt;intentions and provide warnings/overrides to prevent collisions. In order to pursue this goal,&lt;br/&gt;hybrid automata models for the driver-vehicles-intersection system, incorporating driver&lt;br/&gt;behavior and performance as an integral part, are derived from human-factors experiments. A&lt;br/&gt;partial order of these hybrid automata models is constructed, according to confidence levels on&lt;br/&gt;the model parameters. The driver-assist design problem is then formulated as a set of partially&lt;br/&gt;ordered hybrid differential games with imperfect information, in which games are ordered&lt;br/&gt;according to parameter confidence levels. The resulting designs are validated experimentally in&lt;br/&gt;a driving simulator and in large-scale computer simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research leverages the potential of embedded control and communication technologies to&lt;br/&gt;prevent crashes at traffic intersections, by enabling networks of smart vehicles to cooperate with&lt;br/&gt;each other, with the surrounding infrastructure, and with their drivers to make transportation&lt;br/&gt;safer, more enjoyable, and more efficient. The work is based on a collaboration among&lt;br/&gt;researchers in formal methods, autonomous control, and human factors who are studying realistic and&lt;br/&gt;provably correct warning/override algorithms that can be readily transitioned to production&lt;br/&gt;vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://ares.lids.mit.edu/intersections</AbstractNarration>
