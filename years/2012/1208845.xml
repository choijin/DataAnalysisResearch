<AbstractNarration>Darwin's theory of evolution explained that millions of species are related, and dealt biologists and paleontologists the enormous challenge of discovering the branching pattern of the Tree of Life. Work on this great challenge is producing a map of species-relatedness through Earth history, and answering questions such as "what is the closest relative of a species?" and "what species make important products?" To do this scientists draw on all heritable features, including genotypes (e.g., DNA) and phenotypes (e.g., anatomy). Studying phenotypes, however, has remained complicated and slow, because it has not been revolutionized by computer science and engineering innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A team of biologists, computer scientists, and paleontologists will extend and adapt methods from computer vision, machine learning, crowd-sourcing and natural language processing to enable rapid and automated study of phenotypes for the Tree of Life on a vast scale. The three-year goal is to release large phenomic datasets built using new methods, and to provide the public and scientific community with tools for future work. Planned is the training of teachers and students (kindergarten - postdoctoral levels) and the engagement of "citizen scien-tists." Enormous phenomic datasets, many with images, will fill an important public interest in biodiversity and the fossil record.</AbstractNarration>

Phenomics is the study of phenotypes &ndash; the observable characters of organisms such as their physical and behavioral characters &ndash; in other words, everything but their genes. While collecting gene sequence data has become cheap and fast, collecting phenotype data remains a slow, expensive, and largely manual process.

The role of the plant data team was to serve as a real world test case for software developers, to keep tool building targeted and relevant. The plant data team assembled over 800 images of leaves and flowers for over 250 species of the Liliales (the order containing Lilies and their close relatives) and defined 57 characters that have to do with leaf shape, leaf vein patterns, flower shape, and flower color. All images and characters are stored on Morphobank (<a href="http://morphobank.org/index.php">http://morphobank.org/index.php</a>) and on the Bisque platform at CyVerse (<a href="http://bisque.iplantcollaborative.org/">http://bisque.iplantcollaborative.org/</a>) and are being made publicly available as publications are completed.</p> <p>Using the plant and other images, workflows for extracting phenotypic data from images were created using Crowd Sourcing and Computer Vision methods.
