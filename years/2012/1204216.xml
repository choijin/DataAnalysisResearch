<AbstractNarration>Understanding the impacts of climate change on freshwater ecosystems is highly dependent on quantifying the associated changes in instream temperatures. However, this can be complicated because these temperatures are related to both changing meteorology (e.g., air temperature and precipitation) and hydrology (e.g., instream flows and lateral inflows). The ability to predict climate related changes on instream thermal regimes in Arctic streams is limited by the minimal understanding of key processes and the availability of data to quantify heat fluxes. The investigators hypothesize that the dominant heat fluxes within Arctic streams are similar to those in temperate climates but that the relative magnitude of the heat fluxes differ, and that quantification of lateral inflows is key in predicting water temperatures. To test this hypothesis, they would address three research questions regarding 1) the changing importance of key heat fluxes throughout the warm season; 2) the importance of lateral inflows to understanding instream temperature regimes; and 3) the sensitivity of instream temperatures to climate change drivers. To answer the first two questions, they would: quantify heat fluxes using data collection and modeling efforts in two representative arctic river types (alluvial and peat lined, beaded) near Toolik Lake, Alaska; adapt instream temperature models based on prior temperate zone hydrologic research to determine which heat fluxes are necessary to predict the spatial and temporal variability of Arctic instream temperatures; and use differential gauging at the reach and basin scales, along with distributed instream temperatures and other measures, to quantify hillslope-stream connectivity and lateral inflows. Given these results, they would address question 3 by conducting sensitivity analyses of anticipated climatic variability to identify the key hydrologic and meteorological drivers of instream temperature regimes. Ultimately, they would develop an Arctic-specific temperature model that provides predictive capabilities of instream temperatures. In the course of this research, the investigators would develop related curriculum exercises in close collaboration with high school science teachers in both Utah and Alaska, and subsequently make these available nationally. Graduate and undergraduate students would participate in the field and analytical work, and the investigators would share their results with local communities in Alaska who depend on aquatic resources for food.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Arctic regions of the world are undergoing climate change resulting in general warming.  How this atmospheric warming will impact temperature sensitive surface water bodies (streams and lakes) and associated flora and fauna is unknown.  The main goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict the thermal regime of these streams under present conditions and then use the model (developed by Utah State University) to predict future changes in these climate impacted water bodies.  Because Arctic regions lack measurements of many important enviromental variables (short wave and long wave radiation both in and out, lateral fluxes off of hillslopes, sensible heat flux, stream flows, etc.) needed to characterize the thermal regime of streams, this project was also field intensive with measurements of numerous energy and water fluxes (fluxes that are expected to change significantly during climate change).  In this continuous permafrost environment it was discovered that surface storage above the permafrost table was more extensive than previously assumed.  Earlier observations documented that the stream channel of the Kuparuk River often went dry, although there was water in the channel both above and below this "dry reach" during relatively dry periods of the warm season.  This was a process that was not considered initially in the model.  This environmental data has been made available to other scientists at the National Science Foundation Arctic Data Center: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/#view/doi:10.18739/A2K87V       Last Modified: 02/28/2018       Submitted by: Douglas L Kane]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
