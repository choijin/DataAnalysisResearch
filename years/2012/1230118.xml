<AbstractNarration>This project will combine two types of data analysis strategies that are common in different fields.  In cognitive psychology, the state of the art is cognitive process modeling.  Data are analyzed by fitting mathematical representations of cognitive functions to data and interpreting the obtained parameter estimates.  In psychometrics, the most common form of data analysis involves latent variable modeling.  Batteries of small tests, each individual test imperfect, are jointly analyzed to uncover unobservable underlying factors, such as general intelligence or specific abilities.  Cognitive modeling succeeds in extracting more information from data, whereas psychometrical methods are useful for pooling information across tasks or participants.  Combining these two traditions involves the formal challenges of applying latent variable structure to cognitive model parameters, integrating the mathematical assumptions of both strategies, and investigating the effects of those combined assumptions.  The project also involves technical challenges, such as implementing the methods in software.  A new hybrid method called cognitive structural equation modeling will be applied in a retrospective analyses of data on cognitive executive functions and data on facets of working memory.  Additionally, a cognitive structural equation model will be used to investigate the stability of participants' behavior in cognitive tasks over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new method will be particularly well suited for the simultaneous analysis of different cognitive tasks in order to uncover underlying structure in participants' aptitude in the tasks.  Improvements in psychological measurement are potentially useful in a variety of contexts, ranging from fundamental research in perception, cognition, memory, decision making, emotion, and development, to applied measurement in educational testing, job selection, and psychodiagnosis.  Software developed as part of this project will be made freely available to researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A cognitive latent variable model framework was successfully developed using MATLAB and JAGS.  Among several published applications is a retrospective study of the transfer-of-training phenomenon, in which changes in cognitive ability are tracked on an individual basis.  The framework was additionally applied in an experimental study on the effects of the expectation of physical discomfort on decision making; an aptitute/treatment interaction study on the diagnostic relationship of dysphoria and impaired information processing (via cognitive malingering); a retrospective study on the effect of exposure to religious expression on prosocial behavior; the development of a measurement instrument for positive social relationships (a.k.a. "felt love"); a neurocognitive study on the effects of attention on perceptual decision-making; and others.  Throughout, the project included a commitment to teaching/training, dissemination, and transparency of the implementation (through open source software).  Four graduate and two undergraduate students received hands-on lab training in the techniques and methods involved in cognitive latent variable analysis.  Our novel methods were disseminated through conference presentations, free software, tutorials, manuals and theoretical papers.  The new methods inspired three offshoot projects.  The first offshoot involves the measurement of felt love over time and its relationship to subjective well-being. A second offshoot involves the modeling of the scientific publication process as a behavioral process, which may allow researchers to correct publications that were systematically biased by the editorial process. The final offshoot involves the simultaneous analysis of neurophysiological and behavioral data for more accurate measurement and diagnosis.
