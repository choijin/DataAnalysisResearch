<AbstractNarration>The PI's research explores fundamental relationships between physical systems and the efficiency of algorithms, looking at applications in Economics, Nanotechnology, Computing and Physics that can benefit from this joint lens. For instance, the Schelling model of segregation was developed in the economics community in 1971. In this model, residents within a community assess their personal comfort with the racial distribution in their local neighborhood and they are more inclined to move if they are dissatisfied. Schelling showed that even if every member of the community is satisfied with having half of their neighbors be of the opposite race, even small preference for one's own race leads to global segregation. Thus, micromotives can bring about macrobehavior without any centralized influence. The PI will explore variants of this model for 2-dimensional models using insights from computing and physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also consider natural stochastic processes occurring in the context of self-organizing lists and nanotechnology. The first is a fundamental question about biased permutations arising from list update algorithms for minimizing total search costs. The problem can be modeled as a question about permutations under nearest-neighbor transpositions in which items are biased to be put in the correct order. The second is a nanotechnology problem concerning growth processes arising in the context of tile-based self-assembly, where tiles are constructed from DNA. The rates of convergence of these two sampling algorithms are closely related, and the PI has developed new approaches to try to better understand their convergence properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last, the award addresses fundamental questions at the interface of computing and physics.  Determining the mixing time of Markov chains is often the vital step in proving the efficiency of many approximation algorithms based on random sampling. One of the richest sources for sampling problems is statistical physics, where the state space of the Markov chain represents the states of a physical system and sampling lends insight into the thermodynamic properties of the model. By exploring parallels between phase transitions in both fields, the PI will address fundamental questions about physical systems while searching for better approaches to sampling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research component of the proposal explores the fundamental relationship between physical systems and the efficiency of algorithms.  For many sampling and approximate counting problems, local algorithms based on Markov chains are known to be efficient for some settings of the system parameters, and inefficient for others.  There is often a phase transition that controls the efficiency or inefficiency of these algorihtms, much like phase transitions in the underlying physical models being sampled.  In this project, the goals are to further our understanding of the connection between sampling and the underlying physical properties, to find better algorithmic methods when Markov chains are prohibitively slow, and to study applications where these connections provide insights.  The applications we explore include problems from Economics, Nanotechnology, Computing and Physics.  Much of this work explores how bias can influence the convergence rate of a sampling algorithm based on Markov chains as well as properties of the stationary distributions themselves.  We find that we can gain significant insight by introducing bias into unbiased models and ocnsidering the effects as the bias changes, and we can better understand biased models by delving deeper into their unbiased counterparts.  Intellectual Merit:  The project makes fundamental contributions in several fields. In statistical physics, for example, the "hard-core model" represents lattice gases whose particles must not overlap in space.  It is believed that there is a phase transition as the activity of the model is increased.  We reduce the lower bound on phase coexistence by a factor of 10 (from 50 to 5, when the conjectured value is 3.79), thereby providing a much tigher upper bound on the critical point where the phase transition occurs, if it exists.  In another collaboration, we rigorously prove a long-standing conjecture that there is phase coexistence for the 3-coloring model on the Caresian lattice in sufficiently high dimensions.  This work helped deepen the connections between mixing times of local algorithms and phase structure of the underlying physical systems.    Applying computer science principles to a model from economics, we gave the first rigorous analysis of a randomized variant on the Schelling model of segregation.  This model was introduced as a model of micro-motives influencing macro-behavior.  Our analysis of the limiting behavior gives insight into the composition of neighborhoods in the long term and shows that neighborhoods will become homogenous at high bias and stay integrated (and heterogenous) at low bias.  In work motivated by standard computer science protocols, we explore the behavior of sampling problems motivated by combinatorics and self-organizing lists.  These include biased permutations, 3-orientations of planar triangulations, and adapted colorings of graphs.  Here we show families that will converge quickly under a generalized biased permutation algorithm.  Broader Impact:  The PI is very active advocating for women in academia as the ADVANCE Professor of Computing at Georgia Tech, including organizing workshops and events at Georgia Tech and participating on panels on diversity and review committees externally. Three of the Ph.D. students supported by this grant are women, and two have since graduated.  She regularly presents work to broad audiences, including undergraduates and women in other sciences.  The PI is very active in the math and cs communities, and during the period of this grant served on the Board of Governors of the IMA (chair in 2014), the Committee for the Advancement of Theoretical Computer Science, the SODA Steering Committee, the AMS Editorial Boards Committee, and she was just selected to join the International Scientific Advisory Committee of the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques in Montreal, Canada.  The PI has also continued her strong track record promoting interdisciplinary research and training.  For the last 2 years she has been the director of the Algorithms and Randomness Center at Georgia Tech, and has tried to form bridges and facilitate collaboration across campus and with industry.  She is currently co-leading the Georgia Tech Strategic Initiative in Data Engineering and Science, and has been helping to build a new Institute promoting research at the border of foundations (HPC, machine learning, algorithms) and application domains (energy, materials, health).  Next Spring she is the co-chair of the organizing committee of the 2016 SIAM Conference on Discrete Mathematics, a cross-cutting meeting in discrete mathematics that occurs every 2 years.
