<AbstractNarration>Professor Bruce Gibb at the University of New Orleans is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to study the supramolecular chemistry of self-assembling systems in aqueous solution and to devise chemically complex systems possessing unusual properties. The first aim of this project is to investigate new separation protocols that utilize selective molecular encapsulation. In these systems, supramolecular structures encapsulate selected targets of complex chemical mixtures, isolating them from the bulk reactive environment. The second aim is to devise multi-(supra)molecular systems that evolve to equilibrium slowly and demonstrate unusual relationships between the components and the net overall state of the system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies investigate the properties of nano-sized capsules that are formed in water. The capsules trap other molecules within their interior and, much like familiar capsules for drug formulations, engender a physical separation between what is within the capsule and what lies outside. At the molecular level this separation leads to many unusual phenomena, two of which are being investigated in this program of study. They are: 1) New ways to bring about the separation of chemicals that cannot be separated by current technologies, with impact in areas such as biological and dietary science; 2) Complex chemical systems whose overall properties are greater than the sum of their parts. Complex systems demonstrate emergence, or properties and phenomena that only arise through synergism. Life-forms are considered complex systems, and the proposed studies will aid in disentangling the complex intertwining of different processes. The research project will offer a stimulating research environment for the education and training of students, including members of the underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the everyday world containers are utilized to store, transport, and separate items.  Chemists can also use containers to accomplish these tasks.  For example, chemists can use containers to separate complex mixtures of chemicals; protocols that are important in the pharmaceutical industry, in soil remediation at Superfund Sites, and indeed any area or field where it is imperative that impurities are removed.   This project concerns very small containers.  These "nano-containers" spontaneously form in water and possess inner-spaces approximately one-billionth the size of a small dust particle.  As a result, when even the smallest of molecules is stored inside they constantly bump into the sides of the vessel.  The result of this is that these containers are exceedingly selective in regards to what they can store.  Our research group has investigated these nano-vessels in two ways.  First, we have been investigating how to control their formation.  This is an important goal because it allows us to control their size and hence their separation properties.  Second, we have been examining how they can bring about the separation of complex mixtures; including examples of key feed-stocks for the petroleum and fine-chemicals industry, as well as normally inseparable mixtures of mono-unsaturated fatty acid derivatives.  This last topic is particularly important to garner more details about the health issues of trans-fatty acids.  In combination, these two sets of studies are helping to bring the technology of nano-containers to realization, and hence open up new types of separation protocols.
