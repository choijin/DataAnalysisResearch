<AbstractNarration>University of Michigan doctoral student Jennifer Lee Johnson, supervised by Dr. Rebecca Hardin, will investigate the gendered practices and politics of working with and managing fish in Uganda's fisheries.  Focusing on Lake Victoria (Nyanja), this project is guided by the overarching proposition that women are, and have long been, crucial to sustaining fisheries-related economies.  Though women's work sustains a socially and ecologically cosmopolitan Nyanja, accounts and analyses of their role in fisheries have been virtually invisible in the environmental history, economic anthropology, and managerial science of this lake, as in studies of many other freshwater and marine fisheries.  This research seeks to contribute findings that will partially fill this gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Co-PI will conduct 15 months of fieldwork in Uganda, investigating how a shifting and gendered set of vernacular fisheries practices are intimately bound up in the politics of comfort, commerce and control along Uganda's shore (or "littoral") areas.  She will employ multiple social science research methods, including: participant observation at selected littoral sites, in markets, and in formal managerial settings; career history interviews with a purposeful sample of women and men who work with fish; oral history interviews with elders residing at littoral sites; discourse analysis of the 'received wisdoms' recounted in scholarly, professional, media and archival sources; and descriptive GIS mapping of diverse fisheries supply chains.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this study will advance the scientific understanding of social-ecological interactions in historically and contemporarily dynamic resource-interdependent societies.  This study's focus on how fisheries-related economies produce particular kinds of protein and income and create gendered relationships of interdependence and social difference within and across nation states will contribute to environmental anthropology, the anthropology of Africa, and the growing field of multi-species ethnography.  By developing concepts of vernacular practice and littoral politics, this study will also make important theoretical and methodological contributions to contemporary debates in technical resource governance and sustainability and development studies more broadly.  Funding for this research also supports the training of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The majority of people who work in fisheries live on the margins of the long-industrialized world, and yet, produce at least half of all wild protein consumed globally.  Despite the importance of their work to food security and soverignty at various scales, socially rich analysis of their lives and work is scarce.  Instead, scholarly and popular attention to fisheries, particularly in Africa, has forced accounts of fishing and fisheries into economic, ecological, and social managerial frameworks that have thus far failed to sustain fish populations and fisheries-related economies.   The co-PI conducted over 15 months of fieldwork following fish, people, and ideas about fish and people in Uganda to investigate the overarching proposition that women are vital to sustaining local, regional, and intercontinental fisheries-based economies, though their work is often overlooked.  The co-PI participated in, observed, and documented  contemporary everyday and eventful moments at key mainland and island  fishing sites while tracking movements, meanings, and materials forms that women  (and men) generated through their work with fish. She also conducted  in-depth and iterative interviews with a purposeful sample of littoral  residents and resident managers (n=70), which will be placed in dialogue with received wisdoms recounted in  scholarly, professional and media accounts collected throughout this and  previous phases of research.
