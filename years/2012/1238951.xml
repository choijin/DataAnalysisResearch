<AbstractNarration>EarthCube is focused on community-driven development of an integrated and interoperable knowledge management system for data in the geo- and environmental sciences. By utilizing a cooperative, as opposed to competitive, process like that which created the Internet and Open Source software, EarthCube will attack the recalcitrant and persistent problems that so far have prevented adequate access to and the analysis, visualization, and interoperability of the vast storehouses of disparate geoscience data and data types residing in distributed and diverse data systems. This awards funds a series of broad, inclusive community interactions to gather adequate information and requirements to create a roadmap for a critical capability (governance) in the development of EarthCube, a major new NSF initiative. Community/stakeholder buy-in and adoption of standards; common tools and aproaches, if possible; best practices; cyberinfrastructure protocols; and workflows are essential to any holistic approach to creating an interoperable and service-oriented architecture that serves the needs of the geoscience research community wishing to do data-enabled science. The funded series of online/virtual workshops that will engage a brod spectrum of the geoscience community were considered innovative and exciting, especially the proposed application of social networking outreach utilities to engage early career scientists and students. A prime deliverable of the project will be a road map of how to move forward in terms of setting up broadly agreed upon structures to oversee the development of EarthCube activities in the associated working groups and concept grants. Broader impacts of the work include converging on mutually agreed upon processes to allow decision making with regard to whether or not standards or specific protocols should be established, and if so what they should be. They also include the fostering of close interaction between communities that do not commonly interact with one another (the geosciences and those in cyberinfrastructure and computer science) and focusing them on the common goal of creating a new paradigm in data and knowledge management in the geosciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Launched in mid-2011, EarthCube has become the flagship project for the NSF Cyberinfrastructure 21st Century Science and Engineering (CIF21) program, which is a leading component of the White House "Big Data" initiative launched in early 2012. The fundamental goal of EarthCube is to facilitate cross-domain coordination by building a unified, adaptive, scalable and sustainable cyberinfrastructure and knowledge management system that enables transformative advances in geosciences research and education (NSF, 2009).  The EarthCube Governance Community Group, led by the Governance Steering Committee, was formed March 2012 and tasked with writing a roadmap on how to EarthCube governance forward. This group was composed of individuals representing the Earth, ocean, atmospheric, computer, information and social sciences, and represented a broad cross-section of the burgeoning EarthCube community. The group conducted six months of research on governance theory and models, historical infrastructure case studies, and community feedback and engagement, and analyzed over 80 published resources on governance and historical infrastructure development, reviewed a dozen different organizations to serve as governance case studies, and collected community feedback on governance from more than 100 people in 25 different virtual and in-person workshops, plenary sessions, presentations, and project calls, in addition to comments posted on the EarthCube Governance Group Website (http://earthcube.ning.com/group/governance).  This research and community outreach culminated in the EarthCube Governance Roadmap: Documentation, Research, and Recommendations, which aimed to provide the National Science Foundation and other interested parties with a cross-spectrum of ideas and concepts from the relevant Earth science stakeholder communities regarding key elements needed for an initial EarthCube governance framework. The 238-page, comprehensive Governance Roadmap outlined the tasks and next steps to move EarthCube governance forward.  The Roadmap recommended a process for EarthCube that accommodates an organic governance system or system of systems, arguing that while EarthCube might begin with a single governing entity or structure, it would likely evolve into a collective of governing bodies as warranted, in order to be successful. Additionally, the Roadmap argues for a need to be flexible to accommodate a range of governance models that meet the needs of each of the sub-discipline communities, achieve the goals of the National Science Foundation (NSF), have the ability to address foreseen and unforeseen challenges, and be able to adequately address requirements identified by EarthCube community constituents.  The Roadmap also recommended EarthCube governance should be put in place in large part before the execution of other predominantly technical roadmaps in order to provide groups and individuals focusing on more technical aspects of EarthCube with guidance to make informed decisions about the management environment in which they will operate. Accordingly, the Roadmap put forth a series of next steps with action items and target dates:  August 31, 2012: Determine the Governance Framework to meet community needs and NSF goals for successful cyberinfrastructure.  August 31, 2012: Determine the stakeholder community and identify initial governance committee for engaging the community for input on the governance framework developed in Step 1. Date TBD: Establish Terms of Reference for EarthCube Governance. Date TBD: Implement the suggested EarthCube Governance Terms of Reference.   The Roadmap was delivered to NSF and the EarthCube community at the second NSF-sponsored charrette in June 2012. The roadmap is cited multiple times in the NSF EarthCube Solicitation 13-529: Developing a Community-Driven Data and Knowledge Environment for the Geosciences (http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13529/nsf13529.pdf).
