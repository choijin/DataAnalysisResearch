<AbstractNarration>The emerging wireless paradigm of dynamic spectrum access via cognitive radio technology has been increasingly recognized for its great potential in drastically enhancing spectrum utilization efficiency. The basic requirements of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are to protect licensed primary users and provide reliable dynamic spectrum access to secondary cognitive users, which give rise to a new fundamental issue in spectrum access related security. This project develops a comprehensive security system that lays down a secure backbone for CRNs that coexist with primary networks under various network architectures and spectrum coexistence paradigms. The developed security measures are coherently embedded into the entire CRN, from the very beginning of the spectrum sensing stage to the dynamic spectrum access process until the data communication stage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Targeting three main sources of CRN security vulnerability, our research objectives and thrusts include: 1) systematically identify the unique primary user related attacks in CRNs and develop a suite of attack detection and defense mechanisms; 2) develop secure and robust strategies of dynamic spectrum access for benign cognitive users; 3) design confidential and anonymous mechanisms to solve the distinct challenges in privacy protection, taking full advantage of the unprecedented flexibility that CRNs offer in dynamic spectrum utilization. This project lays out the foundation for the development of enabling security technologies for the new paradigm of dynamic spectrum sharing, which in turn can substantially improve the spectrum utilization efficiency of wireless networks, offering a multitude of new cognitive radio devices and wireless services with secure and reliable spectrum access.</AbstractNarration>

From the methodology perspective, many security mechanisms for CRNs cannot rely on traditional digital cryptography techniques developed for legacy networks, due to the unique vulnerability and attacks that CRNs is expose to.  By fully exploring the unique characteristics and challenges of CRN security provisioning, this project developed security measures that can be coherently embedded into the entire CRN, from the very beginning of the spectrum sensing stage to the DSA process until the data communication stage. We also exploited unique CRN features to realize innovative security measures tailored for CRNs.

To this end, the activities within the project duration address the following aspects: 1) CRN security related to spectrum sensing and cognition; 2) CRN security related to dynamic spectrum access and management; 3) CRN security related to user privacy in the open access paradigm; 4) development of a ns-2/ns-3 based CRN simulation tool to meet our own research needs and to facilitate the overall R&amp;D effort of the CRN community in general.  Specifically, the following research activities have been conducted:  1)      CRN security related to spectrum sensing and cognition: Development of robust sensing countermeasures for primary user relevant attacks; Research on various effective spectrum sensing and cognition schemes in CRNs; Research on secure fusion strategy in collaborative spectrum sensing.  2)      CRN security related to dynamic spectrum access and management: Development of DSA based confidentiality/cryptography mechanisms for CRNs; Research on security related to DSA in realistic heterogeneous CRN co-existence environment; Research on anti-jamming mechanisms in CRNs; Development of effective mechanisms to overcome pollution attacks.  3)      CRN security related to user privacy in the open access paradigm: Research on security-oriented DSA for network access controls in CRNs.     We found the following significant results:  1)    Effective licensed receiver detection and authentication solutions to counteract the primary user emulation (PUE) attack dedicated to its genuine form, licensed receiver emulation (LRE) attack;  2)    Cyclic feature detection with Sub-Nyquist sampling for wideband spectrum sensing which is efficient in computation and feasible in hardware implementation;  3)    Cooperative spectrum sensing based on matrix rank minimization which can be used to effectively detect spectrum opportunities for CRNs with low spectrum utilization;  4)    A soft-decision based secure fusion strategy which is effective to protect against spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack with any distributed malicious user?s flip rates by making use of sensing reports from all secondary users;    5)    Confidentiality oriented DSA algorithms which protect communication content privacy through random spectrum accessing patterns yet achieve high spectrum utility;  6)    An effective coexistence framework to achieve fair spectrum allocation wherein  passive CRNs will be assigned with sufficient resources as well to meet their minimum QoS requirements;    7)    A robust and effective virtual MIMO based anti-jamming approach countering against the jamming attack on the "static" common control channel of low-power CRNs;  8)    An effective forward error correction (FEC) driven network coding (NC) based mechanism to overcome pollution attacks in relay node featured CRNs;  9)    A security-oriented DSA based on the integration of DSA with network access control by optimizing both confidentiality and average throughput per user simultaneously.  The broader Impacts include: 1) this project laid out the foundation for the development of enabling security technologies for the new paradigm of dynamic spectrum sharing; 2) the research findings of this project are publicly available for other researchers worldwide through conference/journal publications and via shared codes of a NS2/NS3 based CRN simulator on the lab website; 3) the project has involved 1 graduated PhD, 3 PhD candidates and 2 MS graduated students. The project has trained the students in both theoretical foundations as well as experimental tools, and contributed to prepare the students for their future career; 4) it enhanced curriculum by incorporating problem-solving techniques into graduate courses.
