<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The core of this project is a one quarter long, six quarter credits undergraduate laboratory course centered on sequencing the genome of an agriculturally significant bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens. In addition to lectures covering traditional curriculum, students will perform original research (sequence the segments of DNA, trouble shoot, assure the validity of their data, analyze and infer the significance of their results and communicate their data to peers and faculty). The synergistic activity of critiquing current original research articles in the topics covered in lecture connects the research experience to the students' theoretical learning and informs student analysis of their own data. Community college partners include Olympic, Clark, Tacoma and Everett Community Colleges. Other partners include the USDA ARS Root Disease Biological Control Research Unit and Washington State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The aim of this project is to enable community colleges throughout the broad Seattle Tacoma region of Washington state to incorporate an authentic research experience within their traditional laboratory  curricula. It is based on a highly successful model designed and implemented by the PI at Bellevue Community College and involves a considerable amount of professional development for the faculty involved. The results will be a set of faculty with new disciplinary related skills in genomics, students who have been part of a scholarly project, community colleges with an enhanced curriculum, and important information gathered about an agriculturally important Pseudomonas species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education</AbstractNarration>

Our goals as stated in the grant proposal were to:  Goal 1: Create transformative changes in science education by integrating easily adoptable authentic research experiences into community college curricula.  Obj. 1.1: Introduce the authentic research experience version of the majors' biology course into 15 community colleges in the Pacific Northwest Region.  Obj. 1.2: Introduce specialized research courses adapted from the original ComGen model into the curriculum of 5 community colleges.  Obj. 1.3: Develop easily adoptable authentic research experiences for the allied health and non-majors' biology courses.  Goal 2: Build faculty and institutional capacity for providing authentic research experiences to community college students.  Goal 3: Build a sustainable research network to help enrich and expand project impact.   Obj. 3.1: Connect community college faculty with research faculty to form a collaborative community of practice.   Obj. 3.2: Extend the internship, field trip, and conference attendance opportunities to students at the target community colleges.     Over 5 years of funding the ComGen - Authentic Research Experience Expansion project met all of our goals and achieved the following broader impacts in relation to our goals:   Providing authentic research experiences for approximately 2,378 students in specialized research courses, majors and non-biology and pre-allied health classes across 26 different community colleges and universities in Washington State, Dissemination and implementation of a comprehensive quarter long authentic research curriculum based on current genomics research where each student pair produces novel results and presents their findings at 21 community colleges, The creation of formative and summative assessments to measure and track student learning outcomes from course based research, The development of a coherent theory informed teaching philosophy and pedagogy for course-based research that transfers across disciplines, Implementation of a faculty development model used to train faculty in this pedagogy and scale innovative specialized research projects into mainstream majors' and non-majors' courses, The formation of a vibrant community of practice of 72 faculty from 26 different community colleges and universities that meet annually, share curriculum and resources, and provide implementation support to each other, Technical training of 51 faculty and lab technicians in DNA sequencing laboratory protocols and techniques.  Technical training of 21 faculty in a new microbiology curriculum on DNA barcoding.  Incorporating discovery as a major theme in the college's strategic plan (Tacoma Community College, Bellevue College, Lower Colombia College), The publication of 5 journal articles, book chapters or web vignettes and 4 conference presentations.   The creation of a new Dean of Undergraduate Research position (Bellevue College), Institutionalizing the ComGen courses/activities across the life sciences and beyond to other STEM departments (Bellevue College, Lower Columbia College, Clark College), The formation of an interdisciplinary faculty research group who received external funding to redesign 100 level courses into course-based research experiences in psychology, anthropology, chemistry and biology.

This working group is currently seeking support of the State Board of Community and Technical colleges. Preliminary discussions about designing a 2 year to 4-year transfer pipeline for undergraduate researchers from Bellevue College to University of Washington Bothell.    The ComGen project has built critical capacity in Washington State for community college faculty to provide innovative research opportunities to every science student in an equitable and accessible way.
