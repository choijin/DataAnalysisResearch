<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;This research will investigate how Antarctic peatbanks have responded to documented past warm climates on the Western Antarctic Peninsula over the last 1000 years. The work will extend understanding of climate controls on peat carbon accumulation to Antarctic peatbanks thus enabling a bi-polar perspective of ?first responder? ecosystem processes under warmer climate conditions. Understanding climate and ecosystem histories will help reveal processes and mechanisms that control the functioning of these and other polar ecosystems. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate outcomes of ?natural climate-warming experiments? that have occurred in the AP region at 65 degrees south over the last 1000 years. They will focus on two warm climate intervals in the Western Antarctic Peninsula: (1) the recent and ongoing warming of up to 6Â°C in the last century, and (2) the Medieval Warm Period that occurred ~800 years ago. By collecting and analyzing peat cores and other biological and environmental data, the investigators will derive an independent temperature reconstruction from oxygen isotopes of moss cellulose over the last 1000 years to assess peatbank carbon response to documented warm climate conditions. The overall goal of the proposed project is to document formation ages and temporal changes in carbon-accumulating ecosystems over the last millennium in response to climate change as reconstructed from independent proxies. Also, their data will allow the investigators to understand the nature of reconstructed climate change in relation to atmosphere circulation and ocean conditions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This research is directly relevant to understanding polar processes affecting soil carbon dynamics and will support an early career researcher. This project will provide training for undergraduate students, graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow and will develop teaching modules and outreach activities on polar climate and ecosystem changes.</AbstractNarration>

The results and findings were derived from moss and peat samples collected during their single-season fieldwork conducted in February-March 2014 (G-094-P). The key findings from their observations and laboratory analysis include:  "Novel" peat-forming ecosystems appeared during past warm climate conditions before "the Little Ice Age" (LIA), including a Deschampsia antarctica (Antarctic hairgrass) bog at 2300-1200 cal yr BP and a moss-dominated peatland at 2700-2100 cal BP, both of these types of ecosystems do not occur in the Antarctic Peninsula at present.  Peatbanks or peat deposits are &gt;2500 years old around 65&deg;S, much older than the previously reported 800 years old basal age, representing a new age for the earliest peat-forming conditions.  Widespread black "dead" mosses re-exposed from retreating ice on two islands are dated at the onset of the cold "LIA" as shown at other sites in the region but mosses from shrinking permanent snow are dated around 1850 AD, corresponding with the increase in snowfall. We were able to provide a first estimate of the speed of ice advance using these moss kill ages. Peat-core records show sensitive multi-centennial-scale oscillations in abundance between dry- and wet-adapted moss species and in the degree of peat decomposition, likely caused by regional climate changes.  A network of peatbank sites from 61&deg; to 67&deg;S all show evidence for unprecedented growth conditions over recent decades that are unprecedented during the last two millennia.  Surface and belowground microclimatic conditions (temperature and moisture) show much greater difference between north- and south-facing slopes than atmosphere conditions (including air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation) that likely explain the large differences in peat initiation ages (500 vs. 2500 years old) and accumulation rates on these contrasting slopes, due to radiation-modulated changes in surface thermal and moisture conditions.      In summary, these represent a robust climate record from the coastal low-elevation terrestrial region on the basis of multiple lines of peat-based evidence. The record can be used to compare with paleoclimate records from marine and ice cores to better understand the large-magnitude natural climate variability caused by local and global feedbacks operated in the region through the atmosphere-ocean-ice-land interactions. Furthermore, the documented ecosystem transformations provide insight into understanding terrestrial ecosystem sensitivity to rapidly changing climate in the Antarctic Peninsula.     The project so far has resulted in four manuscripts, including one already published on basal peatbank and dead moss ages and the discovery of Deschampsia (Antarctic hairgrass) bogs and their climate implications, with three more manuscripts in review; one doctoral dissertation (in progress); and 11 abstracts for presentations at national and international scientific conferences (including 6 talks and 5 posters).
