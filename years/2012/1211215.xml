<AbstractNarration>This is part of a collaborative project with three universities to conduct a detailed study of circumstellar gas around rapidly rotating A-type dwarf stars. An A-type main-sequence star is burning hydrogen and ais distinguished by having spectra showing strong hydrogen absoprtion lines.  Some of these A type stars also have low metal abundances in their surface layers and are sometimes referred to as "Lambda Boo" stars, after lambda Bootis, the first one to show these features.  This project will focus on observing the gas emission in order to constrain models of accretion from disk to the star and to better understand planetary formation and evolution models.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have broader impacts of contributing to knowledge of stellar and planetary system evolution.  These institutions will also add a significant undergraduate educational component, involving students in the data acquisition, reduction, analysis, and publication of results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Lambda Bootis stars are a class of peculiar A-type stars that show, in many cases, marked abundances of the heavier elements relative to the sun, but near solar abundances of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.  How that peculiar abundance pattern came about is not clear; the prevailing hypothesis is that Lambda Boo stars accrete metal-depleted gas from their immediate environments -- most probably a circumstellar disk or shell of gas and dust.  The heavier elements precipitate out into dust grains, which are then expelled by radiation pressure from the star, and the metal-depleted gas is accreted onto the surface of the star. This results in metal underabundances on the surface of the star.  Indeed, many Lambda Boo stars are associated with dust and gas.  The famous star, HR 8799, a very dusty Lambda Boo star, also hosts the first directly imaged exoplanets. We hypothesize that the "Lambda Boo" state is associated with planet formation. But only 64 Lambda Boo stars were known at the beginning of this study.  One of our goals was to refine techniques for identifying a star as a Lambda Boo star. Our other goal was to discover many more Lambda Boo stars to help us to understand the characteristics of this interesting class of stars.  To do that, we would need to employ both archival data (including data from the GALEX, WISE, and Spitzer space telescopes), and new observations to assess the prevalence of dust and gas in the circumstellar environments of these stars.  For the first goal we reviewed the extensive literature on the Lambda Boo stars, and identified 212 stars that had been classified as Lambda Boo stars in the past.  We then devised new and improved criteria, involving both ultraviolet and visible spectra that would enable us to positively identify a star as a Lambda Boo star.  Using a uniform set of criteria, we then examined those 212 candidates and were able to identify 64 bona fide Lambda Boo stars.  As it turns out, a number of those stars are young protostars which are clearly in the stage of planet formation.  The second goal -- to discover many more Lambda Boo stars -- is still ongoing. This requires observing stars in both the northern and southern hemispheres with a spectrograph, and using those spectra to determine whether or not those stars belong to the Lambda Boo class.  But Lambda Boo stars make up only 2% of the A-type stars in the sky, and so without a technique to sift out unlikely candidates, we would have to observe thousands of stars to significantly increase the number of known Lambda Boo stars.  We did find a way to increase the probability of finding a Lambda Boo star by choosing candidates based on cross-correlations of the TYCHO, 2MASS, and GALEX catalogs.  We obtained observing time on the 1.9-meter telescope of the South African Astronomical Observatory, and acquired spectra of 294 Lambda Boo candidates.  Of those 294, we classified 50 as Lambda Boo stars -- a 78% increase in the number of Lambda Boo stars.  We are currently carrying out similar observations in the northern hemisphere using the 1.8-meter Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (Mt. Graham, AZ) and the 0.8-meter telescope of the Dark Sky Observatory (Appalachian State University, North Carolina).  We have used archival data from the WISE space telescope, which observed in the infrared part of the spectrum, to analyze the 50 new Lambda Boo stars, and have found that 15% have clear signs of circumstellar dust.  This is a lower percentage than we expected, but we will be combining those data with the anticipated data from the northern hemisphere to come up with a more accurate estimate.  We have also observed a number of Lambda Boo stars with high spectral resolution with the Nordic Optical Telescope (Canary Islands) to study the presence of gas in the environments of those stars.  This work is ongoing.       Last Modified: 10/18/2016       Submitted by: Richard O Gray]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
