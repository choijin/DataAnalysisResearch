<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to study novel device concepts in split-off quantum dots and to develop high performance photodetectors responding up to the terahertz range. The unique integration of split-off transitions allows genuine bound-to-bound transitions in quantum dots, multi-color operation and tailoring spectral response, while having the advantage of three-spatial confinement for carriers. The approaches are to investigate photovoltaic structures containing quantum dots and dots in wells. The ultimate goal is to develop split-off quantum dot photodetectors operating at elevated temperatures with high detectivity and sensitivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to develop a novel technology for optoelectronic devices. The proposed novel concept of split-off quantum dots addresses limitations presently associated with regular quantum dot photodetectors, yielding higher performance. Covering the entire range from visible to infrared, split-off quantum dots can also be an ideal photovoltaic material for fully absorbing solar energy reaching the Earth. Hence, this project should advance the optoelectronic device field and innovate the renewable energy arena.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are the new device concepts for quantum dot semiconductor research which could not only drastically improve detector technology but also revolutionize the solar energy conversion research. The education and outreach efforts will provide highly competent post-doctoral, graduate, undergraduate students and K-12 teachers (P-16) supported by NSF REU/RET supplements in both fundamental research and the state-of-the-art technological area. Highly sensitive detectors operating at high temperatures will have a vast range of applications in military/defense, industrial, and civilian endeavors, creating major potential economic advantages.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The spectral response of photodetectors is determined by a cutoff wavelength limit &lambda;_c that is related to the activation energy of the semiconductor structure  (&Delta;) through the relationship &lambda;_c = hc/&Delta;. This spectral rule dominates device design and intrinsically limits the long-wavelength response and controls the dark current of the detector.   We reported a novel, technique to extend the &lambda;_c beyond this standard rule enabling a very long-wavelength infrared response with a designed shorter wavelength.  The experimental photoresponse is fitted using an escape cone model,   considering a quasi-Fermi distribution of hot holes at a hot hole temperature (TH), which is much higher than the lattice temperature  (TL). The simulated results are found to be in good agreement with experimental data, justifying the model used. The measured dark current was found to agree well with fits obtained from a 3D carrier drift model using the designed value.

Optimizing the emitter thickness of the graded barrier to enhance the absorption efficiency, and increase the escape probability and lower the dark current, enhances the specific detectivity of devices. A patent application is pending on this novel technique of wavelength extension.   We have shown that the Implementation of a current blocking barrier increases the specific detectivity (D*)  of an internal photoemission type detector by two orders of magnitude at 77 K. At zero bias, the resistance-area product shows a five order enhancement due to the current blocking barrier, with the responsivity reduced by only a factor of 1.5.       Replacing the GaAs emitter by   GaMnAs was also studied.  Due to the significantly high concentration of holes, GaMnAs-based IPE detector resembles a Schottky-barrier detector, which has the higher absorption and thus enhanced spectral response by comparing with the previously reported p-type GaAs/AlGaAs detectors.                We have proposed a model to predict the quantum dot (QD) size (height and base) accurately to determine the absorption peaks and corresponding absorption coefficient. We also compute the absorption coefficient of the QD  with different size distributions to verify the results calculated using this model with the reported experimental and other theoretical results. In this model, the intersublevel absorption peak energy and absorption coefficient of non-uniform  QD ensembles were calculated analytically. The effect of size variations and distribution of QDs on their energy states was analyzed. The influence of the aspect ratio of the QDs on the optical transitions was also studied.  InAs/GaAs  QD  and dots-in-well (DWELL) infrared photodetector (QDIP) based on p-type - valence-band inter sublevel hole transitions were also reported. Two response bands observed at 1.5&ndash;3 and 3&ndash; 10  &mu;m are due to optical transitions from the heavy-hole to spin-orbit split-off QD level and from the heavy-hole to heavy-hole level, respectively.
