<AbstractNarration>This project will document a suspected peak in marine animal diversity in the Earth?s most diverse marine realm. Investigators from the California Academy of Sciences (CAS), in collaboration with numerous other US and Philippine institutions, will document the kinds of marine organisms in the Coral Triangle of Southeast Asia, focusing on the "center of the center of biodiversity," the Verde Island Passage (VIP) of Luzon, Philippines. Researchers will assess the extreme biodiversity across the VIP to determine species distributions, analyze genetic diversity among species, and discover new species, including in the Twilight Zone, accessible through advanced underwater technology that allows exploration at depths below those reached with traditional scuba diving.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will establish crucial baseline information on biodiversity at key VIP localities before further impact of global climate change and human development activities. Results will inform regional and global conservation and management policies, and engage the public in protecting coral reef communities integral to oceanic and human health. Data and collections will be preserved and cataloged, and will be available for study into the future.</AbstractNarration>

Evidence supporting this idea comes from studying a wide range of taxa, including marine algae, sponges, soft corals, hard corals, crustaceans (amphipods, decapods and barnacles), snalis and slugs, segmented worms, sand dollars and sea urchins and fishes. The exploration of the twilight zone was also highly successful and included deep dives to 150 m depth over three field seasons. Many new species resulted from these explorations and are documented in seveal recent publications. More than 50 scientific papers and one popular field guide to the nudibranchs of the Indo-Pacific. The explorations from the eastern boundary of the Verde Island Passage (VIP) around Romblon Island yielded new information about the diversity of the entire VIP. Speciesnot found in other portions of the VIP from prior studies were found in Romblon, including many novel taxa. All of these data further corroborate the previous work in the western and central VIP that suggests that diversity is highest in the central VIP, but unique species are represented in each portion of the VIP.
