<AbstractNarration>A high throughput (HTP) sequencing system will be acquired by the University of New Hampshire (UNH) to enable Northern New England research groups using genome-enabled technologies to explore basic questions in ecology, evolution, and biodiversity.  This research will catalyze the generation of new interdisciplinary knowledge of fundamental biological processes and advance the role of genomics and bioinformatics across traditional biological disciplines.  The instrument, an Illumina HiSeq 2500, is both fast and flexible, suited to a large array of applications.  It will support the research and training programs of 16 existing laboratories at UNH, four new UNH Assistant Professors, and 8 research groups at regional undergraduate institutions using genomics to address the basic biological question: ?How do organisms respond to changes in their environment??  Users will benefit from this local, well-managed, shared instrument through (1) dramatic reductions in wait times for sample analyses, (2) intensive sample management to contain costs and maximize data output, and (3) comprehensive onsite technical and bioinformatics support. The Illumina HiSeq 2500 will be housed in the UNH Hubbard Center for Genome Studies (HCGS), an established DNA core facility with a service-driven technical, management, and bioinformatics team.  The HCGS also serves as a regional bioinformatics core facility, meeting the bioinformatics and connectivity needs of scientists throughout northern New England. Management, storage, and security of the data generated by the HTP sequencing system will be provided by a dedicated IT team and infrastructure in the UNH Research Computing and Instrumentation Core Facility.  To interpret and utilize the data effectively, two full-time Ph.D.-level bioinformatics staff will be dedicated to HTP sequence analysis. In addition, the HCGS works extensively with computer science faculty and students to promote the cross-disciplinary development of bioinformatics expertise. This team approach and infrastructure will ensure the efficient operation of the sequencing platform and will allow its use by the broadest number of research programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNH is a national leader in promoting research experiences for undergraduates; the anticipated major users of this HTP sequencing system exemplify this commitment in their own research programs.  The new sequencing system will support such research experiences for undergraduate students, and also provide research opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. To complement and support the research activities, a series of workshops will be held to provide training for students (and faculty) in HTP sequencing applications and the associated bioinformatics tools.  In addition, data generated by this system will be integrated into courses in the biology curricula of participating institutions, supporting the adoption of these technologies in diverse fields. The research programs that will use this instrument already have a strong record of participation by diverse students and faculty, attracting students through programs such as the McNair Scholars, UNH Project SMART, and UNH REAP, and building faculty partnerships through collaborative research projects with historically black colleges and universities. This participation is expected to continue, and grow, as the new HTP sequencing system facilitates exploration of new areas of genomics and the application of informatics to answering a wider range of research questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:                  Access to the Illumina HiSeq platform has improved the research infrastructure at UNH in a variety of ways. Before the award to purchase the Illumina instrument, genomics researchers at UNH often faced long wait-times at other facilities, and lacked opportunities to develop the knowledge and skill sets within their labs to work with genomic data.  Instead of waiting several months for samples to be processed at an offsite core facility, our users? wait time is now usually less than 10 days from sample submission.  In addition to this dramatically reduced wait time, our intensive sample management often allows users to test libraries or to share part of a lane (which is extremely useful in pilot projects), which helps keep the costs low for our users.  When we acquired the Illumina instrument, we knew that the users would need comprehensive technical support for data management and analysis.  This support has catalyzed interdisciplinary partnerships among our faculty and students.  Since the instrument arrived at UNH, six new faculty members have been hired that use the sequencing capacity and associated bioinformatics support made possible under this award.  Broader Impacts:                  The research supported by the Illumina instrument has been transformative in research and educational endeavors at UNH and across the state of New Hampshire.  At UNH three undergraduate classes routinely submit samples as the basis for class/lab projects.  About ten undergraduate research projects have submitted samples or used data generated from the Illumina instrument, and approximately 70 graduate students and 20 post-docs at UNH are actively pursuing genomics research using the Illumina instrument.  Furthermore, the Hubbard Center for Genome Studies has hosted 5 high school students for summer research projects since the instrumentation was purchased.  UNH also participates in the NH-INBRE (NIH grant) with Dartmouth and is the genomics and bioinformatics core for that grant.  Through this INBRE mechanism, researchers and their students at seven primarily undergraduate schools (state-wide) have gained access to high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics training.  Several classes and an iSURF program have used data generated on the instrument as well as the bioinformatics training offered to analyze the data.  This instrumentation platform (Illumina HiSeq 2500) and our ability to intensively manage the workflow make it possible to incorporate next-generation sequencing and analysis into the curriculum of UNH faculty and at are NH-INBRE partner institutions.  The Illumina instrument has developed our expertise in next generation sequencing methodologies to the point that PI Thomas has been invited to lecture in the Applied Bioinformatics and the Environmental Genomics workshops at Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratories (MDIBL) each year (20-25 students per workshop each year).  Our expertise has also enabled our facility to participate in two study group initiatives led by the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF).  Numerous outreach programs and summer science camps in STEM disciplines are hosted on-campus (for middle and high school grades) often include a lecture on bioinformatics and genomics, as well as a tour of the Hubbard Center for Genome Studies and the core facility where the instrument is located.  Other Information and Metrics:                  In addition to the information above, having access to this Illumina platform on campus has furthered the research capabilities of UNH and has been critical in attracting new grant funding to campus, and continues to be a focal point for new proposals being submitted.  The capabilities of this platform has been a focal point for bringing together interdisciplinary researchers to submit major collaborative grants to the NSF EPSCOR and NIH COBRE programs.   Our throughput has vastly exceeded the expectations we had when had originally requested the HiSeq instrument.  To date, we have generated approximately 30 terabases of data, performed 287 successful runs with 735 lanes.  We have a customer base of nearly 120 registered users from 8 countries.
