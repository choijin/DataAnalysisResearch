<AbstractNarration>This Center for Chemical Innovation will develop new catalytic chemistries that enable the use of CO2 as a sustainable feedstock for manufacture of large-scale commodity chemicals. The Center brings together researchers with expertise in organometallic synthesis, computational catalyst design, chemical synthesis of advanced catalyst support architectures, and catalyst and electrocatalyst performance testing to focus on the conversion of carbon dioxide into three chemical commodities: ethylene, acrylates, and formate. These chemical products currently are produced on a multimillion-ton scale annually from petroleum feedstocks, and are themselves feedstocks for more complex chemical products and high-value plastics. Three strategic areas of research and innovation are proposed that taken together support the overall vision of the proposed CCI: (1) to gain new fundamental insight into the mechanisms by which metallic catalysts activate CO2 to initiate its conversion, (2) to co-develop with industrial partners new processes that incorporate activated CO2 in the industrial synthesis of commodity targets, and (3) to co-develop with industrial and utility partners new approaches to compressing and purifying CO2 from power plant flue gases into a physical state suitable for utilization as a concentrated chemical feedstock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful development of CO2 as an alternative feedstock would profoundly impact the sustainability and societal footprint of the chemical industry. Collaborative student training, an emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship development, and public outreach are also key components of this proposed CCI.  Members of underrepresented minorities will be engaged at both Brown and Yale Universities through the Leadership Alliance Program, a national consortium of 32 institutions of higher learning, headquartered at Brown University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program supports research centers that can address major, long-term fundamental chemical research challenges that have a high probability of both producing transformative research and leading to innovation. These Centers will attract broad scientific and public interest by sharing the results of their approach to this challenging question.</AbstractNarration>

The conversion of CO2 into industrial chemicals is a promising alternative because of the great abundance of CO2. Previous studies have demonstrated that this greenhouse gas can serve as a readily available and inexpensive source of carbon in the synthesis of more complex organic molecules, but fundamental advances are needed in order to increase the range of compounds that can be synthesized from CO2.

Our center achieved this goal with several key advancements in the catalytic conversion of CO2 by demonstrating: (a) precise synthetic control over catalyst dimensions combined with theoretical modeling leads to catalysts with the highest reported faradaic efficiencies for converting CO2 to CO; (b) electrochemical reduction of CO2 is altered &mdash; in terms of product distribution (i.e., selectivity), FE and onset potential &mdash; when three-dimensional (3D) electrodes are used in the presence of chemical additives; and (c) clathrate hydrates used as electrolyte additive significantly changes product selectivity and faradaic efficiency of CO2 conversion to higher hydrocarbons.  By achieving our scientific goal, this new knowledge has the potential to impact the chemical industry by markedly reducing both their carbon footprint and their vulnerability to price fluctuations associated with petroleum-based starting materials.
