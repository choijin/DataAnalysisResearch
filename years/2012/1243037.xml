<AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to decipher mechanisms of lysosome biogenesis.  Lysosomes are the main membrane-bound, degradative organelles of eukaryotic cells.  In addition to degrading endocytosed molecules from the extracellular medium, lysosomes regulate multiple essential cellular processes, including degrading material for turnover of cellular organelles, degrading material to respond to starvation, degrading signaling receptors to regulate developmental pathways, fusing with the plasma membrane to initiate wound healing, and mediating some cell death pathways.  Given this central importance of lysosomes, it is striking that little is known about basic principles of how lysosomes are formed, the process of lysosome biogenesis.  Fundamental to the understanding of how lysosome biogenesis is regulated requires identifying the proteins that function in this process.  The aim of this project is to characterize six novel proteins that were identified as regulators of lysosome biogenesis.  Using sophisticated genetic and cell biological tests in the C. elegans model system, this project will determine how these proteins interact to modulate the dynamic membrane events required to form a new lysosome.  These approaches are likely to provide mechanistic molecular insight into lysosome biogenesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;First, this project will transform current views of membrane transport by establishing a molecular model of lysosome biogenesis.  Second, this research program will continue to support a strong training mission in undergraduate student research.  The P.I. has a strong record of undergraduate training, particularly with students from under-represented groups.  The majority of these students eventually enter into graduate programs and pursue a career in science.  Most of students that will be trained on the present project will be encouraged to present their work at research conferences and will be authors on peer-reviewed publications emerging from the work.  This research program will serve as a platform for the scientific development of the next generations of scientists and health professionals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Lysosomes are the major membrane-bound degradative organelles in eukaryotic cells.  Lysosomes degrade material internalized from the extracellular space in addition to autophagic material, thus providing nutrients and metabolites that are essential for cell growth and function.  In addition to this metabolic function, lysosomes function in healing damage to the plasma membrane and participate in some pathways of cell death.  Despite this essential function of lysosomes, nothing is known about the origin of these organelles, how they are formed.              Our studies utilize the powerful genetics in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans in parallel with quantitative live imaging studies in mammalian cells to uncover the molecular regulation of lysosome formation.  We are using forward and genome-wide, reverse genetic methods in C. elegans to identify novel genes that function in lysosome formation.  We identified several genes that function in various aspects of lysosome biology and confirmed the function of four of these in lysosome formation.  In addition, using genetic suppressor analysis in C. elegans, we uncovered a novel pathway that coordinates lysosome formation with previous membrane trafficking steps in eukaryotic cells.  Our identification of novel proteins that function in lysosome formation opens up several avenues of investigation, notably quantitative live imaging studies of lysosome formation in mammalian cells that we established and that will lead to the first biomechanical model of lysosome formation.     Broader Impacts:  Our studies are transforming the field of lysosome biology by providing a molecular mechanism for lysosome formation.  This will impact many fields of biology, including studies on endocytosis, autophagy, cell signaling, wound healing, and cell death.  In addition, our studies will allow a more in depth analysis of the defects in ~50 human diseases referred to as lysosomal storage disorders.              Undergraduate students performed most of the studies in my laboratory.  I use my research as a vehicle to train undergraduate students and to retain them in research and teaching careers.  In the past fifteen years as a faculty member, I have had one research specialist, one graduate student, two postdoctoral scientists, and 39 undergraduate student researchers who remain in my laboratory for an average of two years, including summers when funds are available. I directly mentor all of my undergraduate students such that I personally supervise their research and assist them in preparing for their future careers.  34 of the 39 undergraduate students have graduated and include eighteen (53%) female and six (18%) minority students.  Of the 34 students who have graduated, 31 (91%) are in or have completed graduate studies (Ph.D., M.D., D.D.S., &hellip;), two are working as research specialists in other laboratories (one is applying to Ph.D. programs), and one is pursuing a career as a social worker/counselor.   Thus, the majority of my students continue their graduate studies in science or in health-related fields.          Last Modified: 05/01/2016       Submitted by: Hanna Fares]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
