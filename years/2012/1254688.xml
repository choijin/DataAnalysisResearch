<AbstractNarration>1254688 (Babbitt) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will quantify and characterize projected end-of-life (EOL) flows and attendant resource implications associated with deployment of lithium-ion batteries required for broad adoption of electric vehicles. While these batteries are a promising energy storage solution, their potential environmental tradeoffs are not well characterized. Recent work has focused on supply side issues, such as lithium availability, but key uncertainties surround the emergence and management of these batteries in the waste stream and the ability of domestic recycling infrastructure to recover scarce and valuable materials from a highly variable mix of discarded batteries. A proactive approach is required to prevent potential impacts of EOL battery generation and management. This project will generate a comprehensive assessment of EOL battery flows and material recovery potential, and to do so, will combine novel industrial ecology models with empirical approaches. The integrated research and education plan will address four challenges: (1) The volume and rate that lithium-ion batteries will reach the waste stream are unknown and not easily estimated with existing industrial ecology methods like material flow analysis (MFA), due to the "mismatch" between life spans of batteries and vehicles in which they are used. This project will adapt age-structured population models from biological ecology to create a "mixed lifespan material flow model" to forecast future waste flows of lithium-ion batteries; (2) Implementing this model is dependent on estimates of battery and vehicle life spans and future adoption rates, which are not fully characterized. Surveys, scenario modeling, and empirical methods will be used to parameterize the MFA and create fundamental data that can inform future study on batteries and sustainability; (3) The extent to which critical minerals and other valuable metals can be recovered to the global supply chain through battery recycling is unknown. This project will combine material flow results with empirical characterization of EOL battery material content and an assessment of domestic lithium-ion battery recycling capacity. This "reverse supply chain" will be evaluated against estimates of material demand required for battery adoption; (4) Systems-level sustainability considerations are often absent when new technology is developed. An integrated education program on "Life Cycle Thinking for Energy Storage Systems" will be built from research findings and shared with key stakeholders. The approach and industrial ecology models applied here provide insight to EOL batteries, but are translatable to other sectors (e.g., renewable energy systems). Research will be integrated into educational modules developed for a series of summer enrichment programs aimed at engaging K-12 students, primarily from underrepresented groups, in battery and sustainability research and inspiring them to pursue a sustainable engineering career.</AbstractNarration>

However, deploying low-carbon energy solutions depends on parallel development of battery technologies used to power electric vehicles and store intermittent renewable energy. As lithium-ion batteries are increasingly adopted for these applications, new sustainability challenges emerge: rapid material consumption and generation of a waste stream with unknown composition and impacts.

We determined that material commodity values are a major factor in recycling economics. Battery manufacturers are driving continued innovation towards low cost cathode and anode materials, but shifting away from high-value metals like cobalt results in reduced economic incentives for battery recyclers. As a result, policy and market interventions are required to incentivize closed-loop systems.&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The waste forecasting model we created was also used to determine that a significant fraction of used batteries retain much of their original energy storage capacity. While no longer suitable for electric vehicle use, these batteries show promise for second-life applications, such as renewable energy storage, back-up power, and electric grid load management. We investigated the technical and sustainability dimensions of a circular economy model for battery management from a life cycle basis. Findings demonstrated that second-life battery applications can provide the greatest economic and environmental benefits by extending battery lifespan and avoiding the production and use of less-efficient battery storage options. Battery reuse can also provide social benefits, particularly if it facilitates adoption of distributed renewable energy systems or creates back-up power for critical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The project also investigated the sustainability issues surrounding materials contained within lithium-ion batteries.

Research was also integrated into educational outreach aimed at increasing understanding of and interest in engineering education and careers. Hands-on activities, demonstrations, and educational programs were created and delivered to over 80 female K-12 students per year during Women in Engineering at RIT summer camps.
