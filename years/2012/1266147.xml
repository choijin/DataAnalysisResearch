<AbstractNarration>The center seeks to establish a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) in order to conduct research to improve configuration analytics and automation capabilities in order to enable their integration for efficient, accurate and timely operations, management and defense of complex networked information technology (IT) systems and environments. By addressing the challenges of configuration analytics and automation, the center intends to improve enterprise IT system and service manageability, performance, assurability, security and sustainability.  The effort plans to apply innovative analytics and automation to complex networked systems including: enterprise networking of clouds and data centers, software defined networking, hybrid and cyber-physical systems, smart critical infrastructures, mission-oriented networks (sensor-actuator networks), virtual overlays, social networks and mobile systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future system complexity and the potential of misconfiguration is likely&lt;br/&gt;to increase significantly as technology progresses toward "smart" cyber infrastructure and ?open? configurable platforms making configuration analytics and automation essential for realizing continued productivity and competitiveness improvements from the cyber-economy.  Working with its Industrial Advisory Board, the center plans to have a significant impact in this area and provide a source of talented graduates to industry. The center plans to have a strong educational component that includes training undergraduate and graduate students in this area, creating a new multidisciplinary certificate on Configuration Analytics at UNCC, and involving minority and under-represented students through courses, seminars, workshops and research projects.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project sought to establish the NSF I/UCRC Center for Configurations Analytics and Automation (CCAA) at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte and George Mason University.  CCAA was renamed as the Center for Cybersecurity Analytics and Automation last year (It was felt that this renaming was necessary to accurately reflect the research activities of CCAA), and Colorado State University was added as a university member of the consortium.    The mission of the CCAA is to build the critical mass of inter-disciplinary academic researchers and industry partners for advancing the science and state-of-the-arts of security analytics and automation by developing and integrating innovative sense-making and decision-making for automated adaptive cyber defense that offers minimal human involvement and with provable and measurable security and resiliency properties.  As analytics of cybersecurity configurations continue to be a key research area in the Center, the scope and capabilities of CCAA have evolved to include formal and data-driven analytics of various cyber artifacts including logs, alerts, traffic traces, incident reports, malware analysis, STIX reports, and unstructured text from threat intelligence sources for automated threat/risk determination and mitigation. The evolution and reshaping of CCAA?s scope has prompted the proposed renaming of the Center.   CCAA projects cover wide range of application domains including critical infrastructure (financial, ICS, power girds), large-scale enterprise IT systems and data centers, cloud and Software-Defined Networking, cyber-physical systems, and Internet-of-Things systems.
