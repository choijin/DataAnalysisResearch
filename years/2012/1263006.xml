<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed at synthesizing a series of new electron deficient semiconducting polymers that can rival fullerenes in electronic properties for applications in bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells.  This proposed work plans to establish the structure/property relationship of these types of organic polymers through structural design, synthesis, and physical studies.  A series of new electron-deficient monomers have been proposed, which allow the development of three types of accepting polymers:  1. electron-deficient polymers with tetrahedron atomic centers along the polymer backbone;  2. polymers that can chelate with boron trifluoride to form charge transfer complexes;  3. polymers that exhibit planar structures.  Detailed structural and physical characterizations of these polymers will be conducted.  Standardized solar cell configuration will be used as a platform to characterize the materials properties.  This work will impact basic polymer chemistry and organic electronics.  Approaches to integrating this work with educational efforts, especially in attracting underrepresented students and industrial outreach, are also included.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To convert solar energy into electricity, positive-negative charge-transporting junctions, "p-n junctions", are needed in inorganic solar cells.  Similarly, organic solar cells require both p- and n-types of semiconducting materials.  Much progress has been made in recent years in developing p-type semiconducting polymers.  However, n-type materials used in organic solar cells rely mainly on expensive fullerene (C60 or C70) derivatives.  This project plans to develop electron-deficient semiconducting polymers that rival or surpass the properties of fullerene derivatives and to establish structure/property relationships of electron-deficient polymers.  The resulting polymers will be candidates to replace expensive fullerenes. These materials could also find wide applications in organic electronics.  The fundamental chemistry developed will enrich our understanding of the synthesis of electron accepting polymers and monomers.  The successful completion of this project will have impact in several areas, ranging from basic polymer chemistry, molecular photophysics, materials science, and renewable energy.  The proposed work involves an interdisciplinary effort that integrates chemistry, materials science, and molecular photophysics to explore new science, thus offering a broad spectrum of research and educational opportunities to students. Efforts to attract under-representative minority students will be made.  Students working in this program will be well prepared for future opportunities in the area of organic/materials chemistry and organic electronic materials.  The new materials generated will have impact on sustainable energy and the electronics industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Final outcomes report:  1.     Revealed design principles of n-type semiconducting polymers for all-polymer solar cells.  Synthesized a new monomer that will be the building motif for a series of electron-accepting polymers.  Identified a solvent system that helps to control morphology in all-polymer solar cells.  2.     Revealed that internal polarization is important for designing better accepting polymers.  Morphology control by using different solvent combination is crucial to optimize all polymer solar cells.  Plasmonic enhancement also works in all polymer solar cells.  3.     A new compound based on PDI cluster was found to be an effective acceptor with organic photovoltaic (OPV) performances rival to fullerene derivatives. The design principle guided synthesis of  other members of acceptor series exhibiting high performances.  4.     Ternary Blend Polymer Solar Cells with Enhanced Power Conversion Efficiency were developed.  The operating mechanisms for these ternary OPV systems were elucidated, indicating the importance of energy transfer and electron (hole) relay processes.  Research also revealed the template effect of supramolecular assembling process of the third components on OPV performances.   5.     Further studies indicated that the new acceptor molecule was an effective third component in ternary solar cells, leading to ternary solar cells with a power conversion efficiency value surpassing10%.   6.     Succeeded in recruiting minority undergraduate students (2) and female high school students (3), all of them moved on to advanced studies.   7.     The program offered as a platform for training short term international visiting students (5).  8.     The project offered excellent opportunities for postdoctoral training (2), who became assistant professor in academic institutes.  9.     18 Research Articles and 2 Review articles made possible by this grant, accumulating more than 1400 citations already (Google Scholar 6/30/17).  10.  4 theses defended by graduate students working on this grant.  11.  A provisional patent is filed.                 Last Modified: 06/26/2017       Submitted by: Luping Yu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
