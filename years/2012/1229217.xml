<AbstractNarration>This award to Florida State University is for the development of a unique ultrafast magneto-optical spectroscopy system using the new Split-Florida Helix 25 T magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL).  Access to optical probes in high magnetic fields (i.e. &gt; 10 T) is critical to the scientific missions of understanding quantum phenomena and strong electron-electron correlations in condensed matter systems, chemical bonding, and mechanisms of natural reactivity in biological systems.  The development of this instrument will enable unprecedented free-space ultrafast and continuous-wave optical investigations in the otherwise inaccessible phase regimes of liquid helium temperatures (4 K) and ultra-high DC magnetic fields (25 T).  These experiments will provide insight into fundamental processes that cannot be accessed at zero or low magnetic fields and will have an important impact in areas that include: a) probing the limits of quantum coherence in complex materials through THz measurements of dephasing times, b) exploring quantum mechanical correlations in chemical changes, c) Imaging excitons and spins in organic systems, and d) understanding interactions and changes in oxidation states in organic complexes, including bioproteins.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new ultrafast spectroscopy system will be available to the international scientific community through the user program at the NHMFL.  The instrumentation will enable a transformative alternative to existing methods of materials investigations where photons will probe individual quantum states and interactions that are the origin of electronic and magnetic behavior in materials.  The combination of unprecedented free-space optical access and the latest generation of ultrafast laser technology will enable seminal techniques such as multi-dimensional femtosecond spectroscopy, studies in the terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and magnetic circular dichroism imaging in high magnetic fields.  The scientific program addresses fundamental research questions that have implications for our future quality of life and include studying the formation and breaking of Cooper pairs in the superconducting state, the formation of magnetic states in organic semiconductors, the oxireductase - an electron transfer process present in all living organisms, and correlations between excited states in complex biological molecules.  This award will enable never-before-possible scientific pursuits while providing unique educational opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers, who will be the primary operators of the instrument.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project was to create an integrated system for magneto-optical spectroscopy that was fully compatible with the 25 T Split-Florida Helix magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL).  The instrumentation that forms this magneto-optical system has been completed and put into the service of NHMFL Users, who travel from all over the world to utilize the highest dc magnetic fields for their scientific research.  The combination of this instrumentation with the 25 T Split-Florida Helix magnet has created a unique tool for optical spectroscopy that is unavailable at any other national or international science facility. As part of this development, Florida State University collaborated with sub-awarded institutions University of Vermont and University of Alabama at Birmingham to construct the proposed instrumentation.  Access to optical probes in high magnetic fields (i.e. &gt; 10 T) is critical to the scientific mission of understanding characteristic properties of living and chemical systems as well as new solid state materials.  The probes constructed in this project provide insight into how matter behaves on its most fundamental or 'quantum' basis. Research in this area is often fundamentally linked with magnetism and high applied magnetic fields.  For example, magnetic fields are often an important tool by which a scientist may tune these quantum interactions.  If we begin to understand how properties of matter emerge from the fundamental quantum interactions, then a scientific foundation is built on which to attempt to engineer materials with new or desired properties.  Our work provides a unique window geared towards helping build this scientific foundation for systems in biology, chemistry, physics, and materials science.  The instrumentation funded by this project supported the education and training of nearly two dozen students over its entire term.  This count only enumerates the students who were part of the PI's and sub-awarded co-investigators's research groups.  As NHMFL Users have begun using this equipment, the count of students whose work or research has utilized this instrumentation is rapidly growing and has nearly doubled in size.  The students directly involved in this work not only used the instrumentation, but were also its builders.  An example of one function of the constructed magneto-optical system involved a measurement called magnetic circular dichroism.  This type of dichroism is induced by a magnetic field and is essentially a measure of the difference in a sample's absorbance for two specific polarization states of the incident light.  The data from this measurement provides information about a particular quantum variable in the sample under study.  These measurements were performed in organic crystals doped with magnetic impurities by Prof. Furis's group at University of Vermont, in collaboration with PI McGill at NHMFL.  The data helped to elucidate how organized magnetic states in these materials emerge from the fundamental magnetic interactions of the doped magnetic ions.  This research furthers progress in understanding new types of organic semiconductors and what benefits they may provide over conventional, inorganic semiconductors.  Another example of a different function the instrumentation performs is pump-probe spectroscopy, which is a type of stroboscopic measurement that reveals (or probes) how a system responds to a stimulus (a pump), which in this case was an intense and very brief pulse of light.  Prof. Scholes's group at Princeton University, in collaboration with PI McGill, has used this capability to help deepen understanding of how photosynthesis occurs in certain biological systems, in particular a group of algaes.  The light-harvesting mechanisms in these cells are very efficient, and any understanding gained may serve to guide designs for synthetic solar cells.  Specifically, Prof. Scholes's group studied energy transfer along chromophore complexes harvested from the algaes.  The mechanisms of this energy transfer process from the antenna complex to the reaction center are not fully understood, and Prof. Scholes's group proposed that performing these experiments in high magnetic fields might be one of only a very few ways to discern between competing viewpoints as to how this energy transfer occurs.  The idea to use high magnetic fields did yield significant new insights and a manuscript detailing the results has been submitted for publication.  The instrumentation created through this funding will remain available for User research at the NHMFL.  The system is already oversubscribed by Users desiring to use it and the NHMFL is planning to hire an additional support scientist with a specialty in magneto-optics as a part of its renewal budget beginning in 2018.  The instrumentation is extremely flexible and will provide a versatile platform for optically-based research in the Split-Florida Helix.
