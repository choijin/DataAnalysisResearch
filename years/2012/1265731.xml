<AbstractNarration>An international team consisting of Teresa Head-Gordon and Martin Head-Gordon (University of California, Berkeley), Paul Nerenberg (Claremont McKenna College), David Case (Rutgers University), Jay Ponder (Washington University), Mark Tuckerman (New York University) with their UK collaborators: Lorna Smith and Neil Chue Hong (University of Edinburgh), Chris-Kriton Skylaris and Jonathan W. Essex (University of Southampton), Ilian Todorov (Daresbury Laboratory), Mario Antonioletti (EPCC) are are supported through the SI2-CHE program to develop and deploy robust and sustainable software for advanced potential energy surfaces.  The greater accuracy introduced by improvements in the new generation of potential energy surfaces opens up several challenges in their manifestation as algorithms and software on current or emergent hardware platforms that in turn limits their wide adoption by the computational chemistry community. The research team is overcoming these obstacles via multiple but integrated directions: (1) to optimally implement advanced potential energy surfaces across multi-core and GPU enabled systems, (2) to develop a hierarchy of advanced polarizable models that alter the tradeoff between accuracy and computational speed,(3) to create new multiple time stepping methods; (4) to write a Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM ) application programing interface (API) that fully supports mutual polarization, (5) to adopt software best practices to ensure growth of a self-sustaining community and (6) to provide exemplar calculations with the new software in several emerging application areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular simulation and quantum chemistry software is an integral part of chemistry and chemical biology, and has been broadly adopted by academic researchers and industry scientists. Next generation scientific breakthroughs that utilize chemical software will be enabled by the deployment of state of the art theoretical models and algorithms that are translated into a sustainable software framework rapidly implemented on emergent high performance computing platforms. Potential energy surfaces describe the interactions between atoms. Advanced and highly accurate potential energy surfaces encounter software-related obstacles that inhibit their application to grand challenge chemistry problems. This UK and US consortium, representing a broad cross section of the computational chemistry software community, is working to directly tackle these obstacles.   This US and UK collaboration between universities and High Performance Computing centers works to endure that chemical software investments made in advanced potential energy surface models has a long term payoff in community sustainability and the training of the next generation of scientists. Outreach and training workshops are organized around the emergence of the advanced potential energy software including an introductory molecular simulation software boot camp for undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US based investigators are supported by the CHE and ACI divisions within NSF; the UK based investigators are supported by the EPSRC.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PI Synergy, Outreach and Sustainability  We completed two years of our molecular simulation bootcamp. The first 5-day workshop introduced general scientific computing + basic MD techniques directed at undergraduates and first year grad students who are simulation novices.  In 2015 we introduced a 1-2-day advanced topics workshop in in Berkeley that was intended primarily for students with prior simulation experience to focus on the use of QM/MM with AMOEBA. A Telluride workshop, "Development and deployment of chemical software for advanced potential energy surfaces" attended by all US-UK PIs.  We organized a half-day session for SuperComputing15 "Producing high performance and sustainable software for molecular simulation". We organized  "Advanced Potential Energy Surfaces Symposium" (PHYS division) in August  2016. This symposium will consist of 9 half day sessions in which we propose to invite a broad cross section of the theoretical and computational chemistry community involved in advanced force field development and their applications, QM/MM and ab initio molecular dynamics, and software development. We organized a highly successful CECAM workshop, entitled "Beyond point charges: novel electrostatic developments in force fields", at CECAM HQ in Lausanne in 2016. Small sub-groups and full consortium met regularly in person, via ReadyTalk, and code is shared via a GitHub account (https://github.com/apes-soft), as well as an internal wiki to disseminate project information. Our joint work has been summarized in a J. Phys. Chem. B Feature article submitted in June 2016.   Code Improvements, Parallelization and GPU Efforts:  A new replicated data hybrid MPI/OpenMP approach that benefits the hierarchy of models iAMOEBA, 3-AMOEBA, Drude-AMOEBA, AMOEBA. This has resulted in more streamlined code for iAMOEBA and 3-AMOEBA and improved load-balancing, improved task parallelism, and better overlap of force calculations with MPI using non-blocking communications.  AMBER has implemented several versions of the isokinetic integrators, including a stochastic version recommended for polarizable force fields. Outer time steps can now be in the range of 30 to 100 fs, as found by other groups, and ongoing tests will tune the parameters in these models in an attempt to find "standard" parameters suitable for most biomolecular simulations.  We have implemented a variety of schemes (now posted on the apes-soft GitHub site) to facilitate running AMOEBA simulations on GPUs with the OpenMM drivers. TINKER 7.1 was released in the first half of 2015, and version 7.2 is targeted for release during spring 2016. Major improvements include complete reorganization and refactoring of the multiple code to increase modularity and efficiency, improved tools determining AMOEBA electrostatic parameter via fitting to QM derived potentials from multiple conformations and distinct molecular species, and incorporation of a perturbation expansion method for estimation of induced dipoles.   New Models and Methodologies   We used ForceBalance to reparameterize the AMOEBA water model.  As part of the appraisal of this newly developed water model, we have performed solvation free energy calculations for for a series of monovalent and divalent cations, as well as the series of halogens. AMOEBA has also been augmented with two new potential energy terms to describe bond-torsion and angle-torsion coupling, and new models for charge penetration. The resonance-avoiding multiple time stepping methods XI-RESPA, XM-RESPA, and XO-RESPA all work in TINKER for polarizable AMOEBA models. AMOEBA simulations can now be run with 3 time steps, 0.5 fs and 3.0 fs for bonded and short-range non-bonded interactions, and steps as large as 120 fs for long-range non-bonded interactions, so that AMOEBA simulations run 12 to 24 times more efficiently (depending on real-space cutoff).
