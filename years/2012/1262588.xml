<AbstractNarration>Indiana University is awarded a grant to develop computational methods to identify and classify mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the genomic sequences of eukaryotic and bacterial species. MGEs can jump within or between genomes, generating deleterious mutations as well as contributing to the innovation of novel biological functions in their hosts. This project will identify novel MGEs using model-based probabilistic approaches such as Hidden Markov Models to find novel MGEs and identify insertions in large-scale population genomics and metagenomic projects. The tools will be tested on eukaryotic and bacterial genomes as well as metagenomic datasets to identify potential MGEs. The project will produce software tools for MGE identification in genomic and metagenomic sequences, provide annotation of MGEs in emerging model organisms, and create a database of identified MGE sequences,&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Finding and understanding MGEs has applications to many fields of life sciences, such as environmental biology, ecology, food science, agriculture, and biotechnology. This project will provide key publicly-available software tools and data resources for MGE research. The research will be incorporated into graduate courses in bioinformatics and evolutionary genetics. The PIs will involve undergraduate students from North Carolina A&amp;T State University in summer research projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mobile Genetics Elements (MGEs), which replicate from one location to another within a genome or between genomes (transposition), are a major cause of large-scale genome reorganization. MGEs and their hosts have opposing interests (i.e., selection on MGEs favors elements with greater proliferative ability, whereas selection on the host favors less transposition), which define the co-evolution between both players and ultimately shape the architecture of host genomes. While generally deleterious, MGEs can ultimately contribute to the innovation of biological functions in eukaryotic genome evolution. For instances, many novel genes are derived from transposase genes (domesticated transposons) in different eukaryotic lineages. Therefore, it is thus of great interest to identify novel MGEs and to study their interactions with their host species, especially in the post-genome era, when more and more prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome sequences are becoming available.  Although computational tools exist for identifying MGEs in genomic sequences, it is commonly believed that many novel elements are waiting to be found. In this project, we developed novel algorithms and computational tools to identify mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in eukaryotic and bacterial genomic sequences; we also conducted evolutionary analyses of these identified elements to address important biological questions.  In addition, natural populations are extremely dynamic, with frequent transposition of MGEs within and among the genomes, an important yet overlooked aspects of the dynamic nature of eukaryotic and microbial communities. In this project, we developed novel algorithms to identify the insertions of MGE elements in eukaryotic and bacterial genomes based on shotgun sequences from population genomic sequencing projects, without the complete assembly of shotgun sequences.   The software tools developed in this project, including MGEScan (for identifying MGEs in eukarytic genomes), ISEScan (for identifying Insertion Sequence Elements in bacterial genomes), STRScan (for profiling short tandem repeats from shotgun sequenceins of prokarytoic genomes), DGRScan (for idenitifying diversity-generating retroelements from bacterial genomes) and GRASPER (for detecting insertion polymorphisms from population sequencing data), are all released as open-source software that can be used freely by academic and instrutrial users for studying MGEs.
