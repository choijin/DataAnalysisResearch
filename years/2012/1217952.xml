<AbstractNarration>Novel hardware technologies and application requirements have recently triggered a flurry of research and development into new data management systems.  These systems challenge the hegemony of ossified, legacy database systems which lack the agility to adapt to these new constraints.  But features pioneered by legacy systems (e.g., declarative query processing) are still desirable, and therefore, much work is being devoted to designing components that provide these features in new systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to support research and development of (query) optimizers in data management systems.  Optimizers, which translate declarative descriptions of data (queries) into executable plans, are inherently complex but nonetheless, there are no software engineering tools dedicated to their development.  Therefore this project aims to design and build DEVEL-OP: a dedicated DEVELopment Environment for OPtimizers consisting of the following suites of tools:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   1) Component Generators, which use declarative specifications of components to produce executable code.  Developers can use   generators to rapidly prototype alternative versions of components encompassing different optimization approaches,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   2) Profiling Tools, which help developers identify bugs or performance bottlenecks in generated components, and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   3) Component Benchmarks, which enable the evaluation of optimization approaches (as manifested in generated components) in terms of their effectiveness and robustness in contributing to optimization as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEVEL-OP provides a sandbox where optimizers can be quickly prototyped, refined and compared with minimal effort. Therefore, its impact will be in applying software engineering methodologies to the inherently difficult and complex development process for this key component of data management systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recent advances in underlying architectures of database management systems (DBMS) have motivated the redesign of key DBMS components such as the query optimizer (optimizer).  Optimizers are difficult to implement well as they are inherently complex, error-prone, and difficult to maintain.  Further, there exists no "benchmark" for objectively measuring the quality of an optimizer.  Rather, each DBMS production factory must go it alone and in isolation developing this critical component.  The work completed in this project made two significant contributions: 1)  software development tools, specicially targeting developers of query optimizers to assist them in creating, generating and modifying optimizer components, observing their behaviors and debugging, and 2) optimizer benchmarks to assess in a consistent and system-sensitive manner the quality of the generated benchmark.  Contribution #1 resulted in the design and implementation of the DEVEL-OP development environment for query optimizer developers and included a suite of tools designed to facilitate the profiling and rapid prototyping of optimizer components.  These tools allow one to specify optimizer components, automatically generate components from these specifications, and visualize and debug the generated components' behaviors,  Contribution #2 resulted in a toolkit for designing a benchmark for any optimizer which measured the quality of plans generated by an optimizer relative to the plans that the underlying system is capable of running, while requiring minimal work on the behalf of a developer of a given DB system to allow their DBMS to run the benchmark       Last Modified: 12/11/2017       Submitted by: Mitch Cherniack]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
