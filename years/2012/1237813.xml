<AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to conduct an international series of four face-to-face workshops&lt;br/&gt;to assess quantitatively the potential and status of four topics related to research on nanoelectronics&lt;br/&gt;devices and materials. The topics are: Emerging Research Memory Devices, Emerging Research&lt;br/&gt;Logic Devices, Emerging Research Architectures, and Emerging Research Materials critical for&lt;br/&gt;the realization of specific nanoelectronics devices. Participants and contributors to these&lt;br/&gt;workshops will include academic and industrial domain experts. The outputs of these workshops&lt;br/&gt;will guide and input preparation of the 2013 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors&lt;br/&gt;chapters on Emerging Research Devices and Emerging Research Materials. This grant will&lt;br/&gt;be used to pay partial travel expenses for some presenters, particularly academics, requesting&lt;br/&gt;travel assistance.&lt;br/&gt;The workshops series will focus on the relationship between the Semiconductor Industry as&lt;br/&gt;it endeavors to continue to advance semiconductor technology and the work of the National&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) research community. One purpose of these meetings is to evaluate&lt;br/&gt;the potential and status of each specific nanotechnology entry identified by the ITRS ERD/ERM&lt;br/&gt;Working Groups as having potential to enable a new paradigm for information processing. Another&lt;br/&gt;purpose is to identify research opportunities that, if addressed, will benefit the Semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;Industry and fall within the scope of the NNI research agenda. Presenters will be provided&lt;br/&gt;with a list of questions that are intended to stimulate discussions during the workshops.&lt;br/&gt;Each workshop will be documented by a report described below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;In bringing together leading academic and industrial scientists to discuss, debate and reach&lt;br/&gt;consensus on the potential performance and key scientific challenges related to several emerging&lt;br/&gt;research memory and logic device technologies, these workshops will provide an excellent forum&lt;br/&gt;for intellectual pursuit and discernment of important/limiting scientific issues related to&lt;br/&gt;approaches to information processing. The intellectual merit of these workshops is illustrated&lt;br/&gt;by way of example.&lt;br/&gt;In the first example, the physics of operation and extreme scaling projections are not well&lt;br/&gt;understood for ?select devices? required for use in nanoscale memory arrays. These select&lt;br/&gt;devices are needed to employ a new class of non-volatile memory cells, called resistive random&lt;br/&gt;access memory (ReRAM),that may replace NAND flash for technology generations beyond the 16nm&lt;br/&gt;technology node. Generally speaking, a memory cell in an array can be viewed as being composed&lt;br/&gt;of two fundamental components: a ?storage node?, which is usually characterized by the physics&lt;br/&gt;of operation of the particular memory device used, and a ?selector?. The selector is a device&lt;br/&gt;which allows a given memory cell in an array to be singularly addressed for read or write&lt;br/&gt;operation without addressing its nearest neighbor cells. It is a non-linear element, which&lt;br/&gt;can operate as a switch, such as a diode-type, or as a resistive-switch-type structure. The&lt;br/&gt;latter category includes novel concepts such as Mott switches, threshold switches, and mixed&lt;br/&gt;ionic electronic conduction switches. Understanding the dominant physics related to their&lt;br/&gt;non-linear I-V characteristics is essential to employing these select devices in a highly&lt;br/&gt;dense non-volatile ReRAM crossbar architecture. It should be noted that for several advanced&lt;br/&gt;concepts of ReRAM, the storage node in principle can be scaled down below 10 nm, and the memory&lt;br/&gt;density will be limited by a somewhat larger conventional three-terminal select device. Thus&lt;br/&gt;the select device represents a serious bottleneck for scaling a ReRAM memory cell to 16 nm&lt;br/&gt;and beyond. Application of these new non-volatile memory devices to a crossbar memory structure&lt;br/&gt;will enable a paradigm shift to a new storage class memory (SCM) off-chip memory architecture&lt;br/&gt;discussed below.&lt;br/&gt;Another example, related to logic, is a family of new nanoelectronic low subthreshold-swing&lt;br/&gt;devices: e.g., negative Cg devices. These devices offer the attractive possibility of performing&lt;br/&gt;high speed logic while dissipating much lower power compared to a conventional MOSFET. The&lt;br/&gt;circuit design and the academic research communities have a expressed a strong interest for&lt;br/&gt;the ERD Technical Working Group to explore the physics of operation of these devices and the&lt;br/&gt;circuit design space in which they can operate in order to better understand their potential&lt;br/&gt;performance. This information will provide important input to these communities regarding&lt;br/&gt;their accelerating development of low-power electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;By carefully assessing the potential performance and scientific/technological challenges for&lt;br/&gt;each new memory select device and of new low-power logic devices, as well as emerging architectures,&lt;br/&gt;these workshops will provide important documented inputs to the research community as they&lt;br/&gt;pursue their exploration of many emerging research devices.&lt;br/&gt;One venue being initiated to obtain broad dissemination of this information is the editing&lt;br/&gt;and publication of a comprehensive book on nanoelectronics entitled ?Emerging Nanoelectronic&lt;br/&gt;Devices?. A proposal is under review by a major publisher who has expressed considerable interest.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the educational value and planning impact of these workshops on the international&lt;br/&gt;research community are quite substantial. Several universities (e.g., Stanford, U. Minnesota,&lt;br/&gt;U. Tokyo,?) use the ITRS chapters on Emerging Research Devices and Emerging Research Materials&lt;br/&gt;resulting from these workshops as texts in their Nanoelectronics courses. Also several international&lt;br/&gt;research funding agencies (e.g., SRC, NSF, and NIST Nanoelectronics Research Initiative, the&lt;br/&gt;EU Framework Program 8, ?) use the material in these chapters as inputs to their decisions&lt;br/&gt;on research directions in their Nanoelectronics research programs.</AbstractNarration>

Another ERD/ERM workshop was held in July 2012 to assess SCM applications of emerging memory devices and architectures.  SCM is an emerging memory category that seeks to combine the benefits of solid-state memory (e.g., high performance and robustness) with the data retention capabilities and low cost of conventional hard-disk drive (HDD).

The availability of functional select devices also impacts the suitability of these memories for SCM applications.  An ERD/ERM Logic Device workshop was conducted in September 2012 to evaluate the maturity of different categories of emerging devices surveyed in the 2011 ERD chapter.  The scope of the assessment is expanded beyond digital electronics to include analog and reprogrammable applications of these devices. The workshop emphasized the importance of consistent benchmark of emerging devices from device to circuit levels. Another ERD/ERM workshop was held in December 2012 was dedicated to emerging architectures.  The objective was to develop a systematic taxonomy for emerging architectures and assess their potential in beyond-CMOS applications. Both the logic device workshop and emerging architecture workshop provide updated information and improved organization for the logic and architecture sections of 2013 ERD chapter.
