<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Deborah Gross from Carleton College and colleagues Steven Drew, Gretchen Hofmeister, David Alberg and Joseph Chihade will acquire an high pressure liquid chromatograph interfaced to a  mass spectrometer (HPLC/MS).  The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) characterizing the structure-function relationships of enzymes; (b) quantification of dopamine in rat brains; (c) mapping the interface between an enzyme and its RNA substrate; (e) synthesis and/or characterization of small to mid-size molecules; (f) complex organic compounds formed in secondary organic aerosols; and (g) forensic applications in determination of date-rape drugs and fingerprint measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An HPLC-MS combines the physical separation capability of liquid chromatography with the mass analysis ability of mass spectrometry. The liquid chromatograph with pressure separates a mixture into its molecular components. These components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into a parent ion and fragment ions and their mass/charge ratios are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows determination of the masses of the particles, their chemical composition and enables one to deduce the structure of the substances in a complex mixture. The instrumentation provided by this award will provide faculty and students the opportunity to pursue research projects at Carleton College and St. Olaf College using modern, state-of-the-art instrumentation. It will also be used in several laboratory courses to train significant numbers of students in the use of this important analytical technique.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The acquisition of the LTQ Velos Pro electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometer at Carleton College has enabled the education and training of a diverse group of undergraduate students with a sophisticated piece of research equipment.  Many undergraduate students have used the instrument through coursework at the introducotry and the advanced level in the Carleton College chemistry curriculum.  Also, a significant number of undergraduates have been introduced to the power of ESI mass spectrometry in a variety of disciplines through integration of this instrument into their research projects.  The presence of the LTQ Velos Pro instrument at Carleton College has enabled collaborations with other institutions, including Gustavus Adolphus College (St. Peter, MN), the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and MSP Corporation (Shoreview, MN).  Through these collaborations, students at Carleton College have been exposed to research opportunities and methodologies which are broader than those available at Carleton.  For example, the collaboration between Professor Deborah Gross (Carleton), Professor Chris Hogan (University of Minnesota) and staff at MSP Corporation involves instrument development, a critical component of analytical methodology that is rarely included in undergraduate curricula.  This project has also leveraged the presence of this instrument to obtain additional federal funding through the DOE SBIR program, to support students and faculty working on this project.  One of the most important components of involvement in a research project is the opportunity for undergraduates to present the outcomes of thir work to an audience of other scientists and engineers.  The results obtained with this instrument have been incorporated into many poster presentations, given by undergraduate students at local and national meetings, over the lifetime of this grant.  This type of presentation gives students the chance to present and discuss their work with others knowledgable in the field.  Exposure to sophisticated research-level instrumentation such as the LTQ Velos Pro at Carleton has influenced multiple undergraduates to go on to pursue advanced degrees which focus on or heavily depend on mass spectrometry techniques.  Regardless of whether they pursue mass spectrometry specifically, exposure to the techniques and instrumentation involved in ESI-MS experimenst provides students with access to a level of sophistication that helps them advance in the study of chemistry and chemistry-related fields.
