<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As future technological progress necessitates the design and control of nanoscale membranes, new methods for the creation of tailored materials with tunable morphology, processability, transport properties, and mechanical properties must be perfected.  Unfortunately, many designer systems require a tradeoff between incorporating the desired chemical constituents and obtaining the optimal chemical, transport, and mechanical properties.  To overcome this dilemma, the Epps group is developing interfacially-modified triblock copolymer systems, with a specific focus on network-forming materials, through the chemical manipulation of the internal (block-to-block) junctions using compositional tapers.  These interfacial manipulations (tapered junctions) will allow decoupling of the influence of chemical constituents and molecular weight from self-assembly and thermal transitions, providing greater versatility in designing these soft materials.  Such triblock copolymers are capable of self-assembling into co-continuous network structures, making them ideal candidates for nanoscale devices.  The combination of triblocks and tapered block copolymers can produce high-molecular-weight network systems with improved mechanical properties (e.g. entangled polymer chains), where tapering between the blocks allows for the controlled tuning of effective interaction parameters and nanoscale interfacial mixing.  Further, by developing greater control over interfacial interactions, the Epps group will generate new nanostructured materials for applications such as conducting membranes, separation membranes, and nanoscale templates.  This control will facilitate the development of universal protocols for the generation of stable, processable, and tunable networks for bulk membrane and thin-film nanoscale applications.  Such nanoscale networks utilizing tapered block copolymers may also be helpful for alternative energy, data storage, and biological applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As future technological progress necessitates the design and control of nanoscale membranes, new methods for the creation of tailored materials with tunable morphology, processability, transport properties, and mechanical properties must be perfected.  Unfortunately, many designer systems require a tradeoff between incorporating the desired chemical constituents and obtaining the optimal chemical, transport, and mechanical properties.  To overcome this dilemma, the Epps group is developing chemical synthesis methods to control the nanometer scale (1/1000th the width of a human hair) interfaces in membrane materials to permit the independent tuning of those chemical, transport, and mechanical properties.  By using specially modified complex polymers to enable the design, synthesis, and stabilization of nanoscale interfaces, novel materials for analytical separation membranes, ion-conduction membranes, and nanoscale templates may be developed for alternative energy, data storage, and biological applications.  Additionally, this interdisciplinary project will train students to address key scientific and engineering challenges in nanotechnology.  Students will explore aspects of chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science, placing them at the forefront of nanotechnology research.  Outreach activities directly related to the project include providing multidisciplinary summer research and mentorship opportunities in Epps' labs for American Chemical Society (ACS) Minority Scholars Program undergraduates and ACS Project SEED (economically-disadvantaged) high school students.  The PI has been active in activities involving underrepresented groups in science and will continue to do so throughout this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Using polymers in the generation of devices for energy and data storage applications unlocks several advantages over conventional small molecule or expensive lithography-based techniques current used for component fabrication.  These advantages include processing through low-cost and solution-based techniques, continuous versus batch fabrication, well-defined features and high-throughput manufacture, and improved safety and reliability.  The efforts in this proposal represent a transformative strategy for the design and investigation of nanostructured (1/1000th the width of a human hair) materials for a suite of materials applications.  The long-term and potentially global impact of this research is that improved nanoscale structure formation will reduce the cost and increase the safety of devices that are ideal for data storage (disk drive) and energy storage (battery) applications.  This effort will have substantial impacts on the design and realization of processes for nanoscale device fabrication by establishing well-defined and potentially universal links between molecular chemistry and materials processing/performance, and by introducing a holistic approach to materials discovery linking molecular design, synthesis, detailed characterization, and property evaluation.      Intellectual Merit:  We examined several nanostructured polymer systems with tunable nanoscale morphologies to study how the utility of controlled and well-defined small-scale structure, as generated through polymer synthesis, can enable more environmentally friendly processing of high-performance materials.  We employed a series of novel and scalable polymer synthesis strategies, as well as detailed characterization tools, to probe the assembly of the nanostructured polymers and linked the polymer behavior to macromolecular characteristics.  These materials helped us gain new insights into methods to improve control over nanoscale structure to dramatically enhance performance of systems for nanotemplating that are applicable to batteries, disk drives, actuators and other devices.  Key results were highlighted in multiple publications in the peer-reviewed literature, oral and poster presentations to the scientific and local community, and collaborative scientific activities with other academic research groups.     Broader Impact:  In addition to the design of new materials that can have a significant impact on the processability and performance of nanostructured polymers for applications ranging from batteries and impact-resistant materials to gaskets, seals, and adhesives, we engaged in a variety of educational and outreach activities that had a substantial and positive effect on the community.  We partnered with the American Chemical Society (ACS) through ACS?s Project SEED program to provide summer research opportunities in our laboratories for local high school students from groups underrepresented in science and engineering.  The majority of the students have chosen to continue their education at the college/university level.  This activity has catalyzed several similar outreach programs across the University campus with a goal of broadening the pipeline of students who are engaged in furthering their educational opportunities and experiences. Additionally, the principal investigator of this project designed and taught a new nanoscale materials course and revitalized an introduction to polymer course that reached approximately 300 students during this project.  These courses have provided relevant materials insights that have proven useful for students interested in pursuing both industrial and academic career opportunities.
