<AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will analyze and communicate important societal issues having to do with the disposal of nuclear waste. Unlike the vast majority of scholarly inquiries, which culminate in journal articles or a book, this inquiry will result in a feature length documentary about the scientific, political, and ethical issues adjacent to the problem of the socially responsible disposal of nuclear waste.  Though the reach of the film will extend beyond any particular site, the focal point of the study is the only fully-licensed, operating geological repository for nuclear waste in the world: the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant twenty-six miles east of Carlsbad, New Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will track the contentious history of current and planned clean-up operations involving the Pilot Plant. It will depict a disputed, sometimes successful and sometimes failed, trading zone for very different (often antagonistic) stakeholders from experts, to townspeople, politicians, miners, activists, industrial engineers, and futurists. Trading-zone studies, a methodological approach within the research area known as Science and Technology Studies (STS), interrogate subcultures confronting one  another and developing coordinated local action where global agreement is often absent. In this trading-zone study, the investigator is ethically, visually, and methodologically committed to depicting that collision as all sides struggle to shape an contested  nuclear future. The use of film as a medium for presenting the results of the trading-zone study is innovative and potentially transformative; it could open a way for STS to investigate in a visual way the making of science and technology policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will reach a broad audience by partnering with outreach organizations, Film Sprout and Working Films, to bring the film to its core audience: policy makers, environmentalists, along with groups and citizens traditionally not positioned to participate in science policy. Target locales and groups include science museums such as the Bradbury Science Museum (Los Alamos), the Atomic Testing Museum (Las Vegas), The Museum of Science and Industry (Albuquerque), nuclear facilities, towns surrounding them, and environmental groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Outcome: Socio-Technical Aspects of Nuclear Waste and its Long Term Storage  Website: containmentmovie.com  PI: Peter Galison   Directors: Peter Galison and Robb Moss November 2016  Can we contain some of the deadliest and most long-lasting substances ever produced? Left from the Cold War nuclear weapons manufacture are a hundred million gallons of highly radioactive sludge, thousands of acres of radioactive land, tens of thousands of disused hot buildings, some spreading groundwater contamination.  Stocked around 400 power reactors (worldwide) are spent fuel assemblies, growing by 12,000 tons per year, each one radioactive enough (if unprotected) to kill a carload of people driving by it at full tilt.  Not a single country has a well worked-out long-term plan for long-lived materials (plutonium has a half-life of 24,000 years).  Leave it where it is &ndash; in rotting barrels and shallow ditches?  Rocket it into the sun with the risk of a failed launch?  Dump it into the seas against international treaties?  Bury it (probably our best shot) hoping it won?t leak and that future societies can be warned for 10,000 years? "Containment" uses observational alongside graphic novel and 3D-animation, winding between an uneasy, practical present and an imaginative far future. Intellectual Merit The film gains its force of inquiry (intellectual merit) as a complement to written research in two ways.  First, it allows one to visualize processes and scales hard to imagine from words alone, moving among proposed massive stone monuments and imaginative scenarios of the far future; the interior of million-gallon nuclear waste tanks; or the abandoned towns within Fukushima Prefecture.  It shows us, viserally, how the scales of space and time move from the small and near to the large and global.  Second, the film captures the mix of affect and argument, ethics and policy that engage ordinary people near waste sites as well as scientists, politicians and regulators. All must be heard to advance our national dialogue about nuclear waste siting.  In sum: the film makes immediate these vital issues too easily lost in abstraction.  Observing the Present   The film engages three critical contemporary radioactive sites where containment has become the central issue &ndash; each explores a different aspect of the almost impossible task of isolating radioactive waste from the environment for millennia.  First, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico is the world?s only licensed, deep underground nuclear dump. The site of furious protest and enthusiastic welcome, WIPP sits in a vast, 250-million-year-old salt deposit authorized to receive transuranic nuclear weapons waste.  We filmed extensively in the site: above ground and 2,100 feet underground.  Our second site is the nuclear weapons plant on the Savannah River (which produced much of the WIPP waste) and the surrounding communities.  Our third location, Japan?s Fukushima Prefecture, was never supposed to be a vast waste site.  But now, like many scenes of accidents and weapons testing, it has become one, having lost nuclear containment.  Imagining the Far Future  The U.S. federal government demanded, as a condition for opening the WIPP site, that plans be filed for a gigantic warning monument to prevent inadvertent intrusion.  When the WIPP closes, its buildings will be bulldozed and the monuments constructed.  But how could we know anything about the world four hundred generations from now?  Back in 1989, the Department of Energy hired futurologists, physicists, linguists, astronomers, science fiction writers, even searchers for extra-terrestrial intelligence, to create "scenarios" in which our descendants heedlessly break into the six million cubic feet of waste.  To guide us through these ten-thousand year futures, we filmed DOE scenarios authors, interweaving a graphic narrative that explores these weird, funny, unnerving (sometimes prescient) images of the future.  This combination of current reality, ethics, and the DOE?s commissioned science-fiction futures are our raw materials.  "Containment" explores the idea that over millennia, nothing stays put.   Broader Impact   Distribution is reaching five audiences.  1. "Containment" played at some 40 or so film festivals including major international forums like Zurich and Full Frame as well as specific environmental and scientific events (e.g. Margaret Mead Film Festival, NYC).  2.
