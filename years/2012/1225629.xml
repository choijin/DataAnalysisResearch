<AbstractNarration>The project funds extended research visits of U.S-based graduate students to selected Asian research groups working in speech and language processing. These students are selected from those attending the annual meeting of Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), which will be held in Jeju, Korea, July 8-14, 2012. The selected students will work on a research project with researchers in the hosting group they are visiting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide opportunities for students to be exposed to different culture and new research paradigm in other countries, broaden their horizon and help generate new research ideas, and help make them more competitive in the global market and develop into the scientists that are needed globally in the future. The extended visit also helps build bridges between the Asian hosts and the student's home research group in the U.S.  This will facilitate long term collaboration between U.S. and other countries, and advance science and technology in the whole world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported extended visits of students to research labs overseas conducting research in human language technology. The students combined a conference trip (such as ACL, Interspeech) together with the visit to research labs in other countries. The visit lasted for about 8 weeks. Students worked on a project in collaboration with researchers in the host labs.   During this project period, several students visited research labs in other countries, for example, Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan, Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) in Singapore, University of Sheffield in UK, Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen in Germany. They worked on different research problems, such as summarization, machine translation, emotion recognition.
