<AbstractNarration>The effort in this project will be focused on the mathematical analysis and control of partial differential equation (PDE) models which describe certain elastic dynamics which are seen in the natural and man-made world. The elastic evolutionary PDE models under present consideration might also be subjected to influences external to the system; e.g., elastic bodies subjected to damping forces across some boundary interface. In consequence, the governing PDE models we will analyze could conceivably constitute a coupling of PDE dynamics which are quite different in character; e.g., a von Karman dynamical plate PDE coupled to a thermal process would give rise to a coupled PDE system which evinces phenomenological traits of both hyperbolic and parabolic PDE, yet could not be said to be either strictly hyperbolic or parabolic. For such evolution equations, linear and nonlinear, we intend to address the following problems: (1) Exact controllability and general reachability properties of those coupled PDE models which describe the interaction between an elastic structure and a surrounding fluid medium.  In line with the physical application, the movements of the elastic body are to be controlled by the indirect means of fluid boundary control. (2) Uniform stability properties of structural acoustic systems. In this situation, acoustic waves, interior to a chamber geometry, are coupled to elastic equations which model the flexural vibrations on a portion of the chamber wall; the elastic component here will manifest some quantifiable measure of damping, from weak viscous to super-strong Kelvin-Voight damping.  For these systems, and under appropriate geometrical assumptions, we intend to investigate the possibility that the elastic damping is propagated throughout the entire composite system, to the extent that each component--ostensibly undamped wave as well as structurally damped elastic wall component--decays at some discernible rate. (3) Results concerning the asymptotic behavior of solutions, or flows, of certain nonlinear evolutionary plate PDE systems. In particular, we shall concentrate on those systems which are "non-gradient"; that is, there is no available Lyapunov function on the associated finite energy space which can employed to track the long time behavior of the given, possibly non-dissipative, PDE. It is hoped that our work in this connection will culminate in the stabilization of such nonlinear processes to a global compact attractor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe that the results of this project could give benefit much beyond their intrinsic worth as contributions to the discipline of mathematics. For example, in our aforesaid and intended structural acoustics uniform decay investigation, we anticipate that the stability results will depend critically upon the particular chamber geometry which is in play. As a consequence, we believe our research efforts could give a precise characterization of those structural acoustic geometries which will give rise, in long time, to relatively quiescent interior acoustic fields. Such geometrical situations could then conceivably obviate, or at least lessen, the need for the active engineering control of acoustic noise. Moreover, our intended project work in analyzing the long time behavior of nonlinear evolutionary plate dynamics could have immediate Control Engineering implications: Should we find, for a given nonlinear PDE system, that the corresponding flows converge to a global compact attractor of finite fractal dimension, then conceivably the system could be actively controlled numerically by means of a constructed finite-dimensional feedback. In addition, the research generated by this project will serve as the basis from which we will develop and implement a research program for undergraduates interested in numerical PDEs, and in mathematics generally.  In particular, the PIs will run the University of Nebraska-Lincoln "Research Experience for Undergraduates" site in Summer 2013. Within the context of a canonical one dimensional setting, and through the partial agency of a commercial computer algebra software package, we will teach, to our undergraduate participants, aspects of the nonlinear theory developed in the course of our project work. Moreover we will actively involve them in research projects concerning the numerical approximation of the solutions, or flows, which correspond to those one dimensional nonlinear processes which fall under the umbrella of our project work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Within the Project term, the Principal Investigators (PI's) have undertaken  research in the mathematical analysis and control theory of certain  application-motivated systems of linear and nonlinear partial differential  equations (PDE's). In particular, the PI's, during the course of the  Project, considered the following time dependent classes of PDE's and PDE  systems: (i) PDE's which mathematically model mechanical plates or elastic  structures as they undergo deformation in the course of time; (ii) PDE  systems which constitute couplings of distinct PDE dynamics, with at least  one of the constitutive PDE components describing elastic or mechanical  plate dynamics.     To be more precise, during the course of the Project, the PI's conducted  mathematical analyses of the PDE or PDE systems in (i) or (ii) above, each  of these classes being well-known for their describing certain physical  phenomena as they occur in nature. In the course of this analytical work,  the PI's overarching intent was to glean precise qualitative information by  which truly useful insights could be provided for the physical phenomena  which are modeled by the PDE's or PDE systems in (i) or (ii). In particular,  for a given PDE or PDE system in (i) or (ii), the PI's analytical results  could conceivably be the basis upon which approximating numerical  algorithms are generated for the physical phenomenon, so as to ultimately  provide reliable computer simulations of the given phenomenological process  as it occurs, or a basis upon which informed predictions can be made.     For example, the PI's in the Project considered the analysis of a PDE system  which described certain interactions of fluid flows and structural elastic  bodies. In the course of mathematically resolving the dynamics of the  modeling fluid-structure PDE system, the PI's discovered that their main  tools of (ostensibly abstract) mathematical analysis will actually allow for  the practical scientific computation of relevant fluid and structure  quantities, by way of the so-called finite element method (FEM). The FEM is  a numerical approximating technique which has been long used in civil  engineering and computational fluid dynamics.     Having established requisite analytical results for the PDE's and PDE  systems in (i) or (ii), the PI's subsequently conducted studies of  mathematical control theory for certain important representative PDE's and  PDE systems from these classes. By mathematical control  theory, at least in the context of the Project, the PI's  are referring to their analytical attempt to directly and positively  influence a given PDE dynamical system by means of strategically-placed  input or control functions. Typically, the particular PDE system  under consideration will mathematically model some given physical  phenomenon, the dynamics of which the engineer or scientist would wish to  control or at least influence in some beneficent manner. With this  consideration in mind, the PI's focused, during the term of the Project, on  devising PDE control scenarios that have an applicable or implementable  physical realization, and can provide some guiding insight to the engineer.     For example, during the course of the Project, the PI's considered the  dynamics of a certain von Karman PDE model that mathematically models  elastic plates in a hypersonic airflow, the vibrations of which evolve in an  unpredictable, nonlinear fashion. In the absence of any inserted control  within this von Karman PDE model, there is no expectation that the  corresponding solutions should tend to any quiescent, or stable, state in  large time. Indeed, the uncontrolled PDE does not even exhibit any  dissipation of energy as time evolves. By means of invoking certain boundary  controls, of a feedback form, the PI's demonstrated that the controlled  solutions of the nonlinear PDE model will be driven, asymptotically in time,  to a readily quantifiable set of finite energy states. In this work, the  PI's emphasized that their stabilizing boundary feedback control law should  be implemented by means of the complicated, but physically relevant, free  boundary conditions. In fact, inserted boundary control via the free boundary  operators of second and third order, has the immediate physical interpretation  of engineered bending moments and shear forces.
