<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1206150            PI: Ayres, Neil   ORG: University of Cincinnati&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Synthesis of heparin mimicking polymers containing N-alkyl urea peptoids and their evaluation in anticoagulation assays&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  Current approaches to synthetic analogues of pharmaceutically relevant, sugar-containing biopolymers focus on global scale properties such as charge and hydrophilicity, rather than attempting to understand how the complex interplay of charge, functionality, and stereochemistry might be harnessed to prepare a superior alternative.  Heparin is a linear polysaccharide possessing variable patterns of substitution including N-sulfate, O-sulfate, and N-acetyl groups.  This results in heparin ranking among the most structurally complex GAGs.  However, heparin is sourced from mammals and possesses inherent safety concerns.  Therefore, replacing heparin with a synthetic analogue would be highly beneficial.  The objective of this proposal is to use N-alkyl-N,N'-linked oligomers, which we have termed "N-alkyl urea peptoids," as a point of synthetic diversity for the synthesis of defined glycosaminoglycan mimetics.  The central hypothesis under study is that combining N-alkyl urea peptoids with sugar-functionalized polymers will lead to glycosaminoglycan mimetics with a high degree of synthetic versatility, enabling the rapid probing of rational structure-activity relationship studies directed at heparin replacement.  The research hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) Use N-alkyl urea peptoid/polymer conjugates to synthesize glycosaminoglycan mimetics.  (2) Use N-alkyl urea peptoid oligomers to synthesize polyurea/urethanes with heparin mimetic segments.  (3) Perform simple representative assays to gauge the performance of the synthetic glycosaminoglycan mimetics.  This project will establish a new platform for researchers to use in studying controlled sequence polymers, protein-binding synthetic macromolecules, and sugar-functionalized polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  The work contained in this proposal represents a new strategy in preparing synthetic GAG mimics and has the potential to enable progress in scientific areas including biomaterials, biomimetic chemistry, and polymer-biomolecule interactions.  This research will deliver focused, rationally designed post-graduate projects and undergraduate student learning modules.  Beyond the expected scientific results, the PI has planned activities to promote integration of students transferring into the University of Cincinnati from community colleges and other institutions.  Transfer students can have lower retention rates, longer time-to-graduation, and lower final GPAs than their "traditional" student counterparts.  One of the factors influencing the integration of transfer students is the opportunity to perform research with a professor.  The PI will target transfer students for undergraduate research opportunities in his lab.  The undergraduate researcher will be given student learning modules developed from individual experiments contained within the Research Plan, resulting in a significant contribution to the successful outcome of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We designed polymers inspired by heparin that contained glucose, mannose, lactose, and glucoseamine sugars. The polymer structures when using the mannose monomer are provided in Figure 1.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Anticoagulant Assay.</em> Anticoagulant activities are evidenced by prolonged blood clotting time using assays such as activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT) assays. The anticoagulant activities of our synthesized polymers were investigated by measuring the aPTT in murine plasma spiked with the sulfated polymers. The nonsulfated, hydroxylated polymers exhibited no anticoagulant activities as measured by this assay. The sulfated polymers induced a significantly prolonged aPTT (Figure 2) in and above the typical clinical therapeutic range for unfractionated heparin. The clotting times increased as the concentration of the sulfated polymers increased. The sulfated glucose and mannose tetramer polymers, G-T-09 and M-T-09, showed the lowest anticoagulant activity, attributed to the free anomeric group of G-T-09 and the furanose ring of M-T-09. The glucosamine containing polymer, GA-D-12, afforded a lower anticoagulant activity than M-D-11, L-D-11, or G-D-11, which while initially surprising, is consistent with previously reported results. To further show the blood-compatibility of our polymers we performed TT and PT assays. Similar to aPTT, the nonsulfated, hydroxylated polymers exhibited no anticoagulant activities in the PT assay at all concentrations. Unlike the aPTT assay, this assay did not prove to be discriminative beyond a binary &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; result with respect to blood compatibility based on the control measurement. Similarly, the TT assay did not prove to be discriminative between the polymers beyond the binary result with respect to blood compatibility based on the control measurement.</p> <p>We also tested the blood-compatibility of the polymers with varying diisocyanates using aPTT assay. The absolute values of the averaged aPTTs for the sulfated polymers with mannose sugars are shown in Figure 3; similar results were seen when lactose was used. As the concentration of the sulfated polymer increases, increased clotting time (aPTT) is observed. HMDI and IPDI based polymers gave better anticoagulant properties than HDI and TDI based polymers in terms of aPTT times. We also tested the polymers against TT and PT assays. The results for the TT assay were again binary in nature. While the deprotected polymers exhibited no anticoagulant activities, there was no discrimination among the sulfated polymers as they all afforded TTs of &gt;75s at concentrations of 5.0 mg/mL and above. Similar results were also obtained from the PT assay.</p> <p><em>Anti-FXa and Anti-FIIa activity.</em> The primary mechanism of action for anticoagulation using heparin is the binding of antithrombin III (ATIII) with two hemostatic serine proteases: factors Xa and IIa (thrombin). Chromogenic anti-Xa and anti-IIa assays were used to determine the effect of our&nbsp;polymers on the activity of these enzymes. The anti-Xa assay is the most common version of this assay used in clinical practice. Only polymers L-D-11 and M-D-11 exhibited any anti-Xa activity in this assay (Figure 4). Both polymers had activity consistent with 0.1 units/mL of heparin (data not shown), which is less activity than needed for therapeutic treatment with UFH; however, it is unclear at this stage if this activity would be sufficient for using these polymers as blood-contacting biomaterials. To test if the sulfated polymers inhibit thrombin activity via an ATIII-dependent mechanism, we repeated the anti-IIa assay in ATIII deficient plasma and removed exogenous ATIII from the reaction mixture. This assay was run with the three polymers with anti-IIa activity that fell into the therapeutic range. Heparin, as expected, had no effect on thrombin activity in the absence of ATIII; however, the sulfated polymers <em>did</em> exhibit a dose dependent inhibition of thrombin activity in the absence of ATIII. The relative activity of these three polymers in this assay was M-D-11 &gt; L-D-11 &gt; G-D-11; hence, the sulfated polymers may inhibit IIa activity by both ATIII-dependent and ATIII independent mechanisms.</p> <p><em>Oligomer synthesis and coupling to &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; polymers</em>. An isopropylidene protected glucose methacrylate monomer was copolymerized under reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization control with an azido-containing comonomer. The comonomer ratio was determined to be 15:1. This copolymer was coupled to sugar-functionalized <em>N</em>-alkyl-<em>N</em>,<em>N</em>-linked urea oligomers using copper catalyzed alkyne/azide cycloaddition reactions. The isopropylidene protecting groups on the polymer and <em>N</em>-alkyl-<em>N</em>,<em>N</em>-linked urea oligomers were removed using acid hydrolysis to give the final polysaccharide mimetic. However, while this part of the project was interesting in terms of synthetic methodology and served as an excellent training platform for students in organic chemistry, we chose to not pursue this further. This decision was driven by small yields obtained and challenging purification procedures in the synthetic routes.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2016<br>      Modified by: Neil&nbsp;Ayres</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1206150/1206150_10206635_1479233363369_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1206150/1206150_10206635_1479233363369_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1206150/1206150_10206635_1479233363369_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Heparin-inspired polymers containing mannose sugars</div> <div class="imageCredit">Neil Ayres</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Neil&nbsp;Ayres</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1206150/1206150_10206635_1479233448970_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1206150/1206150_10206635_1479233448970_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1206150/1206150_10206635_1479233448970_Slide2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Blood clotting time results for heparin-inspired polymers with different pendant sugars</div> <div class="imageCredit">Neil Ayres</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Neil&nbsp;Ayres</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1206150/1206150_10206635_1479233539037_Slide3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1206150/1206150_10206635_1479233539037_Slide3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1206150/1206150_10206635_1479233539037_Slide3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Blood clotting time results for heparin-inspired polymers with different polymer backbones</div> <div class="imageCredit">Neil Ayres</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Neil&nbsp;Ayres</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1206150/1206150_10206635_1479233666248_Slide4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1206150/1206150_10206635_1479233666248_Slide4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1206150/1206150_10206635_1479233666248_Slide4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Results from anti-FIIa assay showing a heparin-like response on thrombin from polymers with lactose and glucose sugars</div> <div class="imageCredit">Neil Ayres</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Neil&nbsp;Ayres</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
