<AbstractNarration>This award supports the creation of an REU Site in computational astrophysics at the University of California-Santa Cruz (UCSC). Students will principally be recruited from Hartnell, Cabrillo, Monterrey Peninsula and De Anza Community Colleges, where the main selection criteria will be outstanding academic accomplishments and promise of future achievement. The selected interns will work closely with mentors at UCSC and will take part in an intensive eight-week introduction to astrophysical research methods and tools with an emphasis on cosmological simulations. The overall goal of the program is not to solely train astrophysicists but to utilize astrophysical simulations as an exciting medium for imparting a broad array of scientific skills to the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site will also increase the retention and graduation rates for students enrolled in two-year colleges through inquiry-based learning of concepts related to astronomy and planetary sciences, using state-of-art astrophysical simulations as a common pillar. Through a comprehensive program of research instruction, mentoring, workshops, and support programs at UCSC, students will develop additional skills to advance their educations and careers. The REU Site will also develop a Family Astronomy Night lecture series at the partnering diversity-serving institutions, with the dual aims of communicating astronomy to a wide audience, and ensuring that parents of REU students can support their child's academic success.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Sponsored by the National Science Foundation as an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) site, we  engaged in an ambitious education and public outreach program  in collaboration with educators at community colleges. The principal goal of the program is to increase the retention and graduation rates for students enrolled in our partnering diversity-serving institutions through inquiry-based learning of concepts related to astronomy and planetary sciences using state-of-art astrophysical simulations as a common pillar. Too often, effective advising and constructive encouragement for students to pursue an academic major and to transfer to a four-year college are lacking. Key components of the program included intensive research instruction through summer internships, academic counseling and mentoring, and workshops that integrate family members. The design of the program, we believe, should effectively identify potential transfer students who are at the same time promising researchers at the beginning of their careers and also members of groups who are traditionally under-represented in the university. Students from disadvantaged groups are underrepresented in both computer science and physics/astrophysics, and women comprise only about a quarter of all students in our programs presently.  With support from the NSF over the last three years, 20 undergraduates have participated in the Lamat REU program at UCSC. Lamat has had tremendous impact on their lives and on diversity in the field:      &bull;    14 students who were supported while at community colleges all transferred to a four-year college after the program, including 6 who came to UC Santa Cruz.      &bull;    We also provided extensive follow-up research opportunities to the Lamat students with funds from Julie Packard. These include the 6 who transferred to UC Santa Cruz from community college in the last two years, and 6 others students already at UC Santa Cruz from prior years of Lamat support. Such opportunities are crucial for students to build a strong research portfolio before they apply to graduate school.      &bull;    6 of the students who were supported Lamat over the last three years are currently enrolled or will join astronomy and physics PhD programs at Columbia, Princeton, Harvard, Wisconsin, and UC Santa Cruz.      &bull;    2 of these  students received highly competitive NSF Predoctoral Fellowships. They represent 20% of all Hispanics in astronomy PhD programs with NSF Fellowships that year.      &bull;    In great measure to the Lamat program, the number of Hispanic undergraduates in physics at UC Santa Cruz has increased from 15 to 25, which increased their representation from 7% to 13.5%.
