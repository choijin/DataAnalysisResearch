<AbstractNarration>This EAGER project addresses a long-standing goal of evolutionary genetic studies - the identification and characterization of genes under natural selection. Such studies can lead to a better understanding of the evolutionary forces and constraints on phenotypic change and potential responses to environmental challenges. Next generation sequencing and genome wide genotyping technology have spawned a revolution in evolutionary studies. The genetic basis of morphological, behavioral and physiological traits can potentially be uncovered and their evolutionary dynamics studied in natural populations. However, a limitation with research on non-model species is that the function of genes under natural selection cannot easily be explored in the wild because experimental manipulations on individuals may be limited. In this study, the investigators propose a novel approach for understanding function of genes under selection that involves study of cell cultures established from tissues that express the genes under selection. The researchers will demonstrate this approach in cells derived from multiple tissues of gray and black wolves, where a single substitution in a gene confers coat color phenotypes. This gene also has roles in cellular immunity, antibacterial response to infection, and even an involvement in reproductive and aggressive behavior. The investigators plan to develop protocols for cell culture, transcriptome collection, and network analysis that can be generally applied to other animal species. Different variants of genes can be studied in these cell lines and their effect on cell and organism function assessed through a gene expression network analysis. The results of this approach will be predictions of function that can be further tested by study of natural populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide opportunities for a postdoctoral researcher and graduate students at UCLA to learn new molecular and bioinformatic approaches to study gene function. Additionally, this project provides an example for conveying evolution information to the public using the wolf-dog system. The project will also establish web-based access to findings aimed at researchers and collaborators as well as the public and students who have interest in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The ultimate aim of the funded project was to integrate cell culture and genomic methods to assess the functional effects of a 3 base pair deletion in the CBD103 gene (K locus) in gray wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>), as this mutation is thought to impact gray wolf fitness and survival. We successfully established both wolf fibroblast and keratinocyte cell lines, which to our knowledge is the first time this has been performed. The cell lines represent wolves without the CBD103 mutation (denoted k<sup>Y</sup>k<sup>Y</sup>) and wolves carrying the mutation (K<sup>B</sup>k<sup>Y</sup>). We used these cells to compare genome-wide gene expression differences between differing CBD103 genotypes and found that CBD103 genotype does not appear to result in differential gene expression in wolf fibroblasts or whole blood. However, we found that CBD103 is much more highly expressed in wolf keratinocytes and epithelial tissues (tongue, trachea, and esophagus). We hypothesized that CBD103 plays a role in immunity and is up-regulated in keratinocytes in response to bacteria and viruses. We therefore challenged keratinocytes with antigens to elicit immune responses to bacterial and viral exposure, and found that CBD103 expression in keratinocytes is not up-regulated in response to bacterial or viral challenge. Our results suggest that CBD103 is constitutively expressed in wolf keratinocytes independent of CBD103 genotype or exposure to bacterial or viral antigens. The wolf cell lines established for the funded project have been cryopreserved and are available for continued and future research on wolves, and the protocols are publicly available and may be used for establishing cell cultures of other wolf and canid species. Further, we used one of the wildtype k<sup>Y</sup>k<sup>Y</sup> wolf keratinocyte cell cultures to establish an immortalized wolf cell line, which is also available to researchers. We are currently utilizing CRISPR technology on this immortalized cell line to construct wolf cells carrying one (K<sup>B</sup>k<sup>Y</sup>) or two (K<sup>B</sup>K<sup>B</sup>) copies of the CBD103 mutation for further functional analyses.
