<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a mask aligner for micro/nano-fabrication.  The instrument will support ongoing and future micro/nano-scale fabrication-based research and education by multiple research groups in engineering, physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and food science at Arkansas State University-Jonesboro (ASU-J).  The instrument will be used to support research focused on energy harvesting devices, sensors and actuators, induced electromagnetic fields onto photonic matter, and detection/manipulation of cells and molecular biology.  Research in renewable energy with micro/nano-fabrication will use this system to allow the study of energy harvesting/efficient devices ? concentrated photovoltaic, thermoelectric, and photonic displays and crystals ? for enhanced in energy conversion efficiency and cost-effectiveness.  Research will also use this equipment to study the effects of micro-patterned structures on the cell and molecular biology.  Additionally, the requested mask aligner will be used frequently for nano-imprinting lithography in more in-depth nano-scaled atomic applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrument will expand and enhance research projects and opportunities within the Center for Efficient and Sustainable Use of Resources (CESUR) at ASU-J and provide multi-disciplinary research experiences for faculty and graduate and undergraduate students in engineering, physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and food science programs.  Instruction will be impacted via the development of new activities in courses that make use of the instrument.   Students enrolled in the newly developed Master of Science in Engineering (MSEng) program on ASU-J campus, will utilize this equipment frequently for both R&amp;D and instructional purposes for micro/nano-scaled device development.  Enhanced research opportunities will also increase the University?s effort to recruit and retain students and faculty from traditionally underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
