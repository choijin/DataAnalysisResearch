<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the subject of algebraic dynamics.  Orbits of points under iterates of maps are among the most important objects in dynamics.  In the study of algebraic dynamics, the map is typically a polynomial or rational map in one or more variables.  One natural question is what kinds of algebraic relations the forward orbits of points can satisfy.  When the orbits are infinite (corresponding to so-called "wandering points"), one natural question corresponds to the well-known Mordell-Lang conjecture for abelian varieties.  When the orbits are finite (corresponding to "preperiodic points'), a natural question is an analog of the Manin-Mumford-Bogomolov conjecture for abelian varieties.  The primary purpose of this project is to advance knowledge about these two questions, via a combination of techniques from p-adic analysis, geometry, and diophantine approximation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the interaction between algebraic maps and algebraic equations. An algebraic map is a function such as f(x) = 2x+3.  Applying the map repeatedly to a single number gives what is called the orbit of that number under f.  For example, if f(x) = 2x+3 and we start with the number 1, then the orbit is 1, 5, 13, 29, 61, and so on.  One can also form orbits out of pairs, triplets, and n-tuples of numbers by allowing f to be an algebraic map in more than one variable.  An algebraic equation is simply a more general version of the familiar quadratic polynomials one encounters in beginning algebra, except that it may have more variables and have higher degree terms.  These orbits exhibit many interesting properties.  On the one hand they have so little structure that they may be good engines for the generation of random numbers; on the other, one might hope that their algebraic and arithmetic properties may give rise to new analogs the theories of fractals and chaos, which in many cases arose from the consideration of geometric and analytical properties of orbits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the interplay between dynamics and number theory. Number theory is one of the oldest areas in mathematics, dating back to the Greeks and Egyptians, whereas dynamics is a newer field, with an emphasis on chaos and randomness, but there are many problems on the interface between the two fields.  For example, a better understanding of the number theoretic dynamics of simple polynomial maps would lead to better random number generators and perhaps to better computer security codes (ones that are more efficient and less vulnerable to attack) as well.  There were two general sets of problems that the PI investigated.  One was algebraic structural questions that might be thought of as dynamical analogs of classical results in algebraic number theory, the other had to do with iterations of maps on finite sets.  Perhaps surprisingly, the techniques used for both were similar.  I will begin by describing the results on iterations of maps on finite sets, because the problem itself is easier to describe and has more potential applications in the near future.  Take a prime number p, a polynomial f, and an integer m.  If we start with m, then take f(m), then take f(f(m)) and so on we get a sequence of integers.  If look at these integers under division-by-p with remainder, we get a finite sequence. Let us start with an example: f(x) = x^2 +1, p = 7, and m = 1.  Then f(m) = 2, f(f(m)) = 5, and f(f(f(m))) = 26, is 7 times 3 plus 5 so gives 5 under division-by-5 with remainder.  So our sequence is 1, 2, 5 and then the sequence stops as 5 repeats over and over again.  Random number generators work in almost exactly this way, only using primes that are much larger than 5, and polynomials that are simpler than x^2 + 1.  Typically, linear polynomials are used (polynomials of the form ax + b); these polynomials are simpler to work with, but are believed to be less random.  One of the problems we studied involved some natural measures of how randomness for integers coming from taking m, f(m), f(f(m)), ... We were able to show that for certain measures of randomness and certain polynomials, the sequences are indeed random.  The problem here is fairly elementary, but many classical techniques from algebraic number theory arise, including the famed Hasse-Weil bounds for diophantine equations in a finite setting, and the theory of Galois groups, which were first used to study the insolubility of the quintic 200 years ago.   The other set of problems, those having to do with dynamical analogs of classical results in algebraic number theory, uses many of the same techniques, in some cases combining them with ideas from dynamics that arise in the study of the famed Mandelbrot set.  Substantial progress was made on these problems, but many challenges remain.  We hope that the progress continues into the future, as many of these problems will likely require years of study before a full resolution is achieve.     The broader impact of the project had various facets.  Three graduate students completed their PhDs with partial support from the grant, including one woman.  The results obtained from the project were disseminated through talks and publications.  Recently, the PI learned that one of the conjectures formulated during the course of the project has been modified in a way that is accessible to undergraduates, and has now become the subject of undergraduate research at at least one university.
