<AbstractNarration>Oxygenated hydrocarbons are ubiquitous in the atmosphere with levels ranging from low ppt (acetaldehyde) to low ppb (methanol). They react rapidly with hydroxyl radicals to produce ozone, carbon monoxide, and a variety of other secondary products, and they also contribute to particle formation in the atmosphere.  Over the last decade, attempts have been made to inventory sources and analyze atmospheric budgets. Although estimates have improved, significant discrepancies remain. In particular, the role of the oceans as a source or sink for oxygenated hydrocarbons is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in global models. Budget estimates are limited by the very small database of ocean mixed layer measurements and a limited understanding of processes controlling levels in seawater. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, faculty and undergraduate students at Chapman University will continue their earlier NSF-sponsored efforts to measure the photochemical and biological production and destruction rates of 4 atmospherically-relevant oxygenated hydrocarbons (acetone, acetaldehyde, methanol and ethanol) in coastal waters. These studies will provide process level data that will better constrain the role of the oceans in cycling these species into or out of the troposphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project will have significant broader impacts on the research experience of undergraduate students at Chapman University, a private, liberal arts-based university with 4,500 undergraduate students located in a diverse community in Southern California with a strong commitment to undergraduate research in environmental chemistry.   The PIs currently supervise the research projects of 5 undergraduates, and anticipate working with 4-6 students in summer research on this project. Students will present their research at national meetings. In addition to providing significant research opportunities to a large group of undergraduate students, findings and methods from this study will be incorporated into undergraduate courses taught by the PIs in Atmospheric, Instrumental and Physical Chemistry, expanding project impacts to a larger audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Oxygenated hydrocarbons are ubiquitous in the atmosphere with levels ranging from low ppt to low ppb.  As a sink of OH and a source for HOx and ozone, they have a direct impact on the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. Over the last decade, a number of attempts have been made to inventory sources and analyze atmospheric budgets.  Although estimates have improved, significant discrepancies remain. In particular, the role of the oceans as a source or sink for oxygenated hydrocarbons is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in global models.  Budget estimates are limited by the very small database of ocean mixed layer measurements and a limited understanding of processes controlling levels in seawater.  We proposed to build on ongoing work in our laboratory to measure the photochemical and biological production and destruction rates of some atmospherically relevant oxygenated hydrocarbons in coastal waters. These studies would provide process level data that will better constrain the role of the oceans in cycling these species into or out of the troposphere.  Over the last four years, we optimized our purge and trap GC/MS system to measure ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetone in seawater.  We then measured the chemical and biological degradation rates of acetaldehyde and ethanol at a number of local sites.  The primary site was the Santa Ana River mouth, a site where we had previously measured acetone degradation rates, and a site that is constantly monitored by local agencies for water quality. Rates were measured at this site for 4-6 month periods and were measured as a function of aerobic bacteria levels, salinity, temperature, pH, redox potential, and dissolved oxygen content.       At the Santa Ana River mouth chemical degradation of acetone, acetaldehyde, and ethanol was negligible relative to biological degradation and in all cases biological degradation appears to follow first order kinetics.  Acetaldehyde biological degradation rate constants range from 0.0003 min-1 to 0.0054 min-1 with an average of 0.0020 min-1. This corresponds to an average turnover of ~8 hours. Acetone degradation rates measured at this site previously over a similar seasonal period ranged from a low of 0.0002 min-1 to a high of 0.0037 min-1 with an average of 0.002 min-1. Biological turnover was similar to acetaldehyde at ~8 hours.  Ethanol degradation rate constants at the Santa Ana River mouth ranged from 0.00043 min-1 to 0.021 min-1 with an average of 0.0038.  This corresponds to an average turnover time of 4.4 hrs.  Ethanol is converted biologically to acetaldehyde with an effective branching ratio of 0.14.  Bacteria also consumed the acetaldehyde produced. For all species degradation rate constants were correlated with bacteria levels and increased in the wet rainy season.  For acetaldehyde comparison with estimated photochemical production rates suggests that the oceans are a source of acetaldehyde to the atmosphere at this site.     Eleven undergraduate chemistry/biochemistry majors worked on this project.  Four students have gone onto Ph.D. programs, one has gone on to an MSc program, and one is currently in Dental School.  One other student is currently applying for medical school and one is still a junior at Chapman.  The other three students joined the work force in various capacities immediately on graduation.  Most students who contributed to this work have presented their work at regional or national conferences.  This provided invaluable interaction with their peers and the broader scientific community. To date this project has supported ten research presentations with undergraduate students as co-authors.  A manuscript dealing with acetaldehyde degradation at the Santa Ana River mouth has been published in Marine Chemistry and a second manuscript on ethanol measurements is in preparation.  Undergraduate students coauthored both manuscripts.  Two undergraduate chemistry faculty members have worked on this project over the last few years.
