<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is jointly funded by the Information Integration and Informatics Program in the Information and Intelligent Systems Division of the Computer and Information Sciences Directorate, the Marine Geology and Geophysics Program in the Ocean Sciences Division of the Geosciences Directorate, the Arctic Natural Sciences Program in the Arctic Sciences Division and the Antarctic Glaciology Program in the Antarctic Sciences Division in the Office of Polar Programs, and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The critical first step in the analysis of paleoclimate records like ice or sediment cores is the construction of an age model, which relates the depth in a core to the calendar age of the material at that point. The reasoning involved in age-model construction is complex, subtle, and scientifically demanding because the processes that control the rate of material accumulation over time, and that affect the core between formation and sampling, are unknown. Geoscientists approach this problem by treating the core like a crime scene and asking the question: "What physical and chemical processes could have produced this situation, and what does that say about the timeline?" However, the sheer number of possibilities, coupled with the volume and complexity of the climatology data that is currently available and is continually collected, severely limit the scope of these investigations. The goal of this project is to remove this roadblock. This research will lead to an integrated software tool called CScibox, that uses automated reasoning techniques to help scientists analyze ice and sediment cores. It employs a cyberinfrastructure that provides powerful, intuitive tools on a scientist's desktop while taking full advantage of modern data- and computation-intensive computing and networking infrastructure -- including workflow-based computation, parallel execution, distributed systems, cluster machines and the cloud. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CScibox will not only improve the ability of individual geoscientists analyze single cores; it has the potential to transform the field of paleoclimatology by facilitating rapid, reproducible analysis and synthesis of the information in the diverse collections of raw data available in data archives to foster understanding and improved scientific decision making. This will have broad impacts for society by allowing scientists to develop deeper insights into the roles of various factors in the complex relationships that give rise to geological records of the earth's climate that are used in today's models of environmental change. This project also has a broad educational impact. Students involved in the development and implementation of CScibox will develop skills in interdisciplinary research and will learn how to apply computational methodology in a challenging scientific context that has not yet significantly benefitted from developments in information technology. CScibox is designed to be easy to install and use; see the project web site (http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/cscience.html) for source code, documentation, and examples of its use. Future steps include extending the work to other paleoclimate data, working with geoscientists to make the user interface as intuitive as possible, and holding demos and workshops at geosciences conferences to educate that community about what the tool can do and how to use it.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The critical first step in the analysis of paleoclimate records like ice or sediment cores is the construction of an age model, which relates the depth in a core to the calendar age of the material at that point.  The reasoning involved in age-model construction is complex, subtle, and scientifically demanding because the processes that control the rate of material accumulation over time, and that affect the core between formation and sampling, are unknown.  The goal of the CScience project was to develop an integrated software tool that helps geoscientists build age models more effectively.  This tool, which is called CScibox, employs artificial intelligence techniques to capture the knowledge of expert paleoscientists and help its users explore the complex hypotheses and large, heterogeneous digital datasets that are involved in age-model construction.  Perhaps the most important outcome of this project is the software, which is open-source, freely available on GitHub, and in daily use by practicing geoscientists.  Another deeply important outcome is the training that has been provided by this project to junior researchers: four postdocs, five Ph.D. students, one M.S. student, nine undergraduates, and a high-school student have made meaningful contributions in the past six years.  With our project as a springboard, many of these people took next steps along the research career path: at Microsoft Research, MIT, the University of Colorado, and the Santa Fe Institute, among others.  Many others, including most of our undergrad alumni, took positions in the computing industry (e.g., Google, Apple).  Members of this vertically integrated research group presented several dozen talks about this work at conferences and other institutions, and published close to a dozen papers about it in proceedings and journals, plus three Ph.D. dissertations.  Every student who worked on the project for more than a few months is an author on at least one of these products.  This project allowed us to establish substantive collaborations with universities and other institutions around the world, including Queens University (Belfast), the University of Copenhagen, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and NOAA's World Data Center for Paleoclimatology.  A number of these collaborations led to co-authored papers and talks.    The deep interdisciplinary conversations that were fostered by this project also created a wholly new scientific research direction: the use of information theory in paleoscience.  The attached image shows the Shannon entropy rate of data in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide core that captures the past temperature history at this site. High values of that rate indicate that all of the information at each time point is new: i.e., wholly unrelated to the past.  Low values, in contrast, mean that the information at those time points is completely predictable.  The large bump between 5000-7000 years ago was, we conjectured, a consequence of noise that was injected into the data by an older laboratory instrument?something that was not easily visible in the raw data.  These calculations also revealed interesting scientific knowledge: e.g., evidence of geothermal heating deep in the core.  We have already produced four publications about this new research thread, along with dozens of oral presentations, and we have written four NSF proposals to support our further exploration.  One of these (an EAGER) was recently funded to carry out some targeted resampling work that confirmed our hypothesis about the cause of the bump in the image.  Here, too, students ranging from sophomores to postdocs played key roles that are reflected in their authorship on talks and journal papers.
