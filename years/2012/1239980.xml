<AbstractNarration>The evolutionary history of land plants over the last 500 million years is characterized by periodic bursts of diversification following major climatic shifts, specific geologic events, or the evolution of specific characters. Speciation is then so rapid that the relationships among descendants are hard to identify, and large sets of data are needed to resolve the family tree. The moss lineage Hypnanae underwent an explosive radiation following its origin 165 mya. Today, it comprises about 5,000 species, but their grouping into evolutionary units is obscure. Inferences from extensive sets of genes sampled using a gene enrichment strategy combined with gene expression data will provide a robust framework to further our understanding of this diverse, and ecologically important lineage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study focuses on untangling the relationships among species that arose from an explosive diversification, on identifying the geologic or climatic shifts that triggered these events, and on understanding the significance of morphological innovations allowing adaptations to diverse habitats. The target group of mosses is more diverse than conifers, dominates some communities, and plays critical ecological roles throughout the world. Resolving the patterns and processes underlying the rise of a diverse lineage offers an opportunity to understand how these organisms may respond to rapid global change.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Since their origin approximately 500 million years ago, land plant diversity has relatively gradually increased to about 300,000 species. On a fine geological time scale, however, bursts of diversification occurred following major climatic shifts, specific geologic events, or the evolution of specific innovations. The subsequent process of speciation can be so rapid that signatures of relationships among descendants are hard to identify, and large sets of data are needed to resolve the family tree of the resulting extant species. Mosses are more diverse than other major lineages of land plants, with the exception of flowering plants, and can dominate some plant communities, thereby playing critical ecological roles throughout the world. The architecture of the moss body is rather simple and inferring relationships based on morphological traits is challenged by extensive convergent evolution and rapid evolutionary transformations. The &ldquo;Hypnanae&rdquo; compose, with about 5000 species, the most diverse major lineage of mosses. However, their grouping into evolutionary units has been obscured by rapid bursts of speciation. The evolution of this group is characterized by an explosive radiation shortly after its origin some 165 million years ago, and multiple shifts in habitats, followed by the loss of typically complex traits. Today, the Hypnanae comprise about 5,000 species distributed across all major ecosystems where they often regulate local nutrient flow. Although highly diverse and of ecological significance, their grouping into evolutionary units has been a recalcitrant problem in evolutionary biology. This study, led by a team of researchers from the University of Connecticut, the Chicago Botanic Garden, and Duke University focused on resolving the evolutionary history of mosses, identifying the closest living relatives of the hyperdiverse Hypnanae and untangling the relationships among species complexes that arose from an explosive diversification. The team sampled all protein coding genes from the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes and over 800 protein coding nuclear genes for about 400 species of mosses, compiling the largest dataset for any lineage of land plant to date. Furthermore, the project generated thousands of additional nuclear gene sequenced that were expressed in close to a hundred species. These genomic data revealed novel signatures of whole genome duplications that occurred throughout the evolution of mosses, and thereby strengthened the view that the mosses, although of ancient origin, undergo processes of diversification similar to those observed in flowering plants. The team advanced knowledge of the evolution of mosses by reconstructing the relationships based on an extensive set of genetic markers from all cellular genomes. In particular, it proposed novel relationships among orders of mosses, identified the closest relative of the Hypnanae, and reconstructed the first robust evolutionary history for this diverse and cosmopolitan group of mosses. The outcomes of this project continue to be presented at international scientific conferences, and published in peer reviewed professional journals. The extensive set of novel data (i.e., &plusmn; 2.5 million sequences) are deposited in public databases and the vouchers of all sampled species deposited in public herbaria. We also developed a new modular bioinformatics pipeline for processing a relatively new type of genomic data, and assembling genetic loci that are ready for alignment. The project provided critical professional development opportunities for several postdoctoral researchers, and research experiences for undergraduates, which were familiarized with scientific inquiry and modern analytical tools. All trainees developed their skills in scientific communication through scientific publication and presentations to the public.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/01/2018<br>      Modified by: A.
