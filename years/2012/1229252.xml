<AbstractNarration>1229252&lt;br/&gt;Bronk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant support acquisition of a laser-based flow cytometer at the College of William and Mary, Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS).  Partial  technician salary support over a two year period will also be supported.  The flow cytometer will support a range of marine ecosystem research that will be advanced by the ability to quickly separate abiogneic and biogenic particles and sort individual microbes and even viruses based on characteristics of size, shape and pigment composition as interrogated via laser diffraction and fluorescence from appropriately stained cells.  The instrument to be purchased, a BD Influx, will support novel studies of nutrient cycling by marine phytoplankton and heterotrophs by enabling separation of individual microorganisms that can then be cultured and their rates of nutrient cycling measured with stable isotopic labeling techniques.   Measurement of species level phytoplankton nitrogen assimilation rates are now possible using combinations of flow cytometry, molecular probes, 15N labeling and mass spectrometry.  Other research avenues that will make use of the flow cytometer include marine microbe specific studies of trace metal and nutrient cycling, studies of hydrothermal vent associated benthic invertebrate feeding rates and efficiency, and molecular studies of harmful algal blooms, marine parasites and wastewater effluent borne human pathogens.   The cytometer will support regional research use by professors and students from institutions throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia and further afield including faculty at Princeton and the University of Georgia.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
