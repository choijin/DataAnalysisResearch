<AbstractNarration>This award is support travel to the Alpine Summer School, which brings together leading experts working in the areas related to climate, aerosols, and the cryosphere to give both fundamental and advanced lectures to graduate students and researchers at the beginning of their careers as a means of educating the next generation of researchers. In addition, round table discussions and brainstorming sessions will be conducted between all participants to develop a vision of future research as well as cross-cutting collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The cryospheric regions are extremely sensitive to climate change. Dramatic visual changes are observed across the landscape in various snow and ice environments, providing direct evidence for climate related changes. Over the past decades a significant decline has been observed in a variety of snow/ice scenarios across cold regions. Sea ice in the Arctic is shrinking in all seasons, most dramatically in summer, many mountain glaciers, in particular those in North America and the high mountain ranges of the Himalaya-Karakorum are getting smaller and snow cover is retreating earlier in the season. Reductions in snow cover and in mountain glaciers have occurred despite increased snowfall in many cases, implicating increased air temperatures or other local processes acting on snow and ice dynamics. To a large extent, greenhouse gases are believed to be responsible for global air temperature increase, but they are clearly only one of the many factors that account for the observed changes. Another key component impacting cyospheric regions is soot particles that are emitted from a wide range of human activities including fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning, although it is still unclear to what extent these particles are important. With this in my mind a workshop was held bringing together a broad range of scientists and students from around the World to discuss the key issues related to aerosols, climate and the cryosphere. The workshop featured lectures and interactive discussions with World leading experts, and developed collaborative research ties between students from the US, Europe, and Asia.
