<AbstractNarration>1236653&lt;br/&gt;Pennell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite rapid advances in nanotechnologies over the past decade, our current understanding of nanomaterial fate and transport in the environment remains limited.  Recent studies have demonstrated that new approaches are needed to accurately predict the transport and retention of nanomaterials in soils and aquifers.  In addition, nanomaterial mobility is known to depend upon surface coating properties and the presence of stabilizing agents, such as surfactants and organic matter.  Although most commercially-available nanomaterials are produced with surface coatings, very little information is available regarding their longevity and impact on nanomaterial fate over time.  To address these gaps in our current understanding of nanomaterials, the project combines laboratory experiments with mathematical modeling to quantify and predict the effects of surface coating aging on the fate and transport of several representative engineered nanomaterials (iron and manganese oxides) in sands and natural soils.  The research is structured around three tasks; (1) determination of nanoparticle deposition and release rates as a function of surface coating properties using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), (2) measurement of nanoparticle transport and attachment in soil columns and aquifer cells, and (3) development and validation of mathematical models to predict the effects of surface coating properties and aging on nanoparticle mobility and persistence in soils and aquifer materials.  Novel aspects of the research include the assessment of nanoparticle deposition rates, utilization of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and light transmission (LT) analysis to visualize nanoparticle mobility, and the integration of experimental and mathematical modeling to assess nanomaterial fate in the environment.  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in three areas critical to the pursuit of environmentally sound and sustainable nanotechnologies; (1) development of methods to convert nanoparticle deposition measurements into attachment rate parameters that can be used to predict transport behavior, (b) measurement of the effects of surface coating aging on nanoparticle stability, aggregation, and mobility, and (c) development and validation of numerical simulators capable of predicting the environmental fate of nanomaterials as a function of changes in surface coating integrity.  The unique coupling of experimental studies with mathematical modeling allows for careful evaluation of methods that can be used to rapidly estimate nanoparticle attachment parameters for a range of surface and solution conditions, and will culminate in the development of numerical models that are able to predict the effects of surface coating integrity and composition on nanomaterial fate and transport.  We anticipate that the experimental parameters and mathematical models developed in this work can be utilized to predict the fate and transport of other nanomaterials in subsurface systems, and will serve as an important component for nanomaterial life cycle analysis.  In addition, the knowledge gained in these studies will improve our understanding of filtration technologies used to treat drinking and waste waters containing nanoparticles.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: An important component of the project is the incorporation of education initiatives into the research and instructional activities of the investigators, with the goal of extending the impact of acquired knowledge beyond the traditional framework of journal publications and conference presentations.  This goal will be achieved through the following activities: (a) inclusion of undergraduate students in coupled experimental and mathematical modeling research, (b) development of interactive, multi-media instructional tools, and (c) recruitment of female and under-represented minority students.  The instructional materials, consisting of model-based tutorials, videos prepared by undergraduate and graduate students, and illustrative case studies and modeling tools, will be incorporated into freshmen and sophomore-level courses and released on a web site so that a broader audience of students can explore processes that govern the fate and transport of pristine and aged nanomaterials in terrestrial environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The transport of engineered nanomaterials in soils and groundwater has received considerable attention in recent years as regulating agencies have worked to develop management strategies to address the potential for soil and water contamination originating from the growing nanotechnology industry.  Although prior studies have shown that the stability and transport of nanoparticle is highly sensitive to the surface coating properties, solution chemistry, and soil grain size, nearly all of this work involved freshly-prepared nanomaterials.  Over their life cycle, engineered nanomaterials may be subjected to various transformation processes, including photodegradation, passivation by natural organic matter, biodegradation, and oxidation.  These processes are likely to modify or "age" nanomaterials, resulting in changes to nanoparticle surface coatings and properties, which in turn may alter their fate and transport in natural and engineered systems.  To investigate the role of surface coating aging on nanoparticle fate, a combination of experimental and mathematical modeling studies was undertaken to: (1) Characterize the aging of nanoparticle surface coatings, (2) Measure the transport and retention aged and fresh nanoparticles in soils, and (3) Develop and validate numerical models that are capable of simulating the transport behavior of aged nanoparticles.  Superparamagnetic nanoparticles (nMag), prepared with three different surfactant coatings, were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light and monitored for stability and deposition behavior.  For these nMag with oleic acid bilayer coatings were evaluated extensively with regard to physical behavior upon chemical aging.  The extent of nMag aging increased with the duration of exposure to UV light and in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, but the rate of aging, and thus aggregation, was reduced by addition of phosphate (Figure 1). Exposure of citrate-coated silver nanoparticles (nAg) to UV light resulted in up to a 5-fold increase in mean diameter, a 10 to 15 mV increase in zeta potential (i.e., less negative), and up to a 25-fold increase in silver ion (Ag+) release (Figure 2).  The addition of a tert-butyl alcohol, a reactive oxygen species scavenger, reduced the aggregation and dissolution of UV-aged nAg by up to 50%, indicating that free radical species played an important role in nAg aging under these conditions.  In column transport experiments, UV-aged nMag was more strongly retained than fresh nMag, consistent with the less negative zeta potential of the nanoparticles.  Similar transport studies conducted with aged and fresh nAg demonstrated that exposure to UV light significantly increased nanoparticle retention in quartz sands (i.e., reduced transport), but resulted in much greater nAg dissolution and release of Ag+.  Additional experiments were conducted to assess the fate and transport of nAg applied to ceramic water filters (CWF), which are used in developing countries to treat household water.  Leaching studies demonstrated that silver release from the filters occurs primarily as the ionic form (Ag+) regardless of silver application method, and that Ag+ release is highly responsive to changes in pH, ionic strength or cation species. For example, an increase in ionic strength from 10 to 50 mM resulted in a nearly 10-fold increase in Ag+ concentrations (Figure 3).  A one-dimensional nanoparticle transport model that incorporates a first-order, maximum retention capacity term, and filter ripening was used to simulate the transport and retention of fresh and UV-aged nMag in quartz sands (Figure 4).  A multi-dimensional form of the model was also used to simulate nAg transport, deposition, and Ag+ release in a heterogeneous aquifer cell.  In order to account for aggregation of aged nanoparticles during transport, a one-dimensional hybrid Eulerian-Lagragian nanoparticle transport model was developed and used to simulate carboxylmethyl cellulose (CMC)-modified nanoscale zero-...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
