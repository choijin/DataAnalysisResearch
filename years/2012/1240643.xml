<AbstractNarration>The extratropical cyclones cyclones associated with midlatitude weather systems are typically accompanied by extensive cloud cover, but the extent to which the clouds have an effect on cyclone development is not well known. This project investigates the impact of cloud radiative and latent heating on the development of extratropical cyclones, as well as the amount of energy and moisture they transport poleward.  The work uses newly developed datasets in which cloud radiative and latent heating are derived from satellite observations, in combination with meteorological reanalysis products which capture cyclone characteristics including winds, temperature, and humidity.  Feature tracking algorithms are used to follow individual cyclones and determine the impact of cloud heating on all stages of the cyclone lifecycle. Previous studies have addressed cloud heating impacts on extratropical cyclones, but with somewhat mixed results, in part due to the lack of available cases on which to base conclusions.  The new datasets thus offer the promise of more definitive conclusions, due to the larger number of cases that can be examined, along with improvements in the quality of the cloud heating fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work broader impacts in two ways: first, it will support a graduate student, thereby providing for the next generation of scientists in this research area.  Second, the work will be beneficial for evaluating and improving weather and climate models.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this investigation was to exploit several new global datasets to learn what causes extreme midlatitude cyclonic storms and what role they plan in the atmospheric circulation and climate. The new datasets provide the capability to identify, track and classify all individual storms for the past few decades and to quantify the associated atmospheric heating produced by cloud processes, namely precipitation and cloud changes of radiation (absorbed sunlight, emitted thermal radiation). For the first time we can follow the appearance and evolution of storms in both hemispheres and over land and water and determine the associated clouds properties and precipitation. This also allows for the determination of energy exchanges that can be mapped onto the structure of each storm to diagnose whether these processes explain the occurrence of more severe weather systems. Our results are based on an unprecedentedly large collection of storms, more than a million over more than a decade. We find that the strongest storms are also the largest and longest-lived systems and that they dominate the atmospheric energy processes, even though they are less numerous than weak or moderate strength storms.
