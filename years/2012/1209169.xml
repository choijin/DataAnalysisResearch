<AbstractNarration>The University of Cincinnati ADVANCE program integrates programming and policy change in an effort to broaden participation and improve the climate for STEM women faculty.  This is accomplished through bottom-up initiatives, top-down leadership reform initiatives and advocacy and accountability initiatives. These initiatives will be implemented through a range of strategies that includes, but is not limited to professional development workshops for STEM women faculty at all career stages, learning communities for informal and formal mentoring and mini-grants to support research, professional development, and collaborative activities.  Also, an Accountability and Advocacy Council (AAC), comprised of various institutional stakeholders, coordinates and ensures the integration of these various top-down and bottom up strategies with the goal of producing actionable and sustainable change.  The social science research that forms much of the framework of this effort is centered on discourse analysis as it relates to online communications to STEM scientists.  Through traditional means of dissemination, the work of the University of Cincinnati has the potential to influence not only other ADVANCE programs, but all of higher education.  This project is expected to also seminally contribute to the body of knowledge related to of research on the underrepresentation of women in the STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Broadening participation (BP) for institutional change requires a continuous dialogue between desired outcomes, strategic initiatives and impact, and evaluation activities. A multi-method approach that utilizes quantitative and qualitative information, such as institutional data, network analysis, and surveys, can identify the specific challenges to equity in participation and advancement for underrepresented groups in STEM. These challenges can then be addressed through targeted interventions. Subsequent evaluation of those interventions can leverage new data to examine changes in perceived fit, climate, retention, and advancement, allowing the dialogue to continue. Then, as participants and context evolve over time, new efforts should reflect changes from baseline as well as the data-driven strategies for continuing BP efforts.</p> <p>Analysis ofinstitutional data at the University of Cincinnati (UC) suggested that retention and advancement<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>not recruitment or hiring, are substantial barriers to BP. Specifically, a greater percentage of women than men hired as tenure-track assistant professors left within six years of their appointment (see Attachment 1). And, while rates of promotion to associate professor within 8 years were comparable for both genders, 28% of women, compared to 15% of men, moved from tenured faculty positions to other positions at UC in the same timeframe.&nbsp;</p> <p>A turnover study, which surveyed nearly 500 faculty who left UC in the past 25 years, showed that women's attrition was primarily due to departmental politics and supervision, a perceived lack of fit or challenging climate, and a lack of collaborators. In addition, separate values and climate surveys showed that women and URM in STEM perceived a mismatch between their own professional values and what is expressed in promotion and tenure policies and procedures. &nbsp;</p> <p><em>&nbsp;</em>A subsequent social network analysis, which&nbsp;examined intradepartmental social and research connections found gender differences in network structure across departments, with some exhibiting more clustering effects than others. However, in general, women were less frequently chosen than their male counterparts to engage in research collaborations (see Attachment 2 for an example). These results reinforced our analysis of institutional data. If faculty are outside of core departmental research networks, they will likely not feel as though they are good fit in a research-oriented department.&nbsp;</p> <p>These data, however, do not fully explain what happens at hire, after hire, and in the early years of tenure-track appointments to impact professional outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examining publication history, grantsmanship, and graduate committee work in men and women from hire to promotion to associate professor revealed that women and men who start as assistant professors have equivalent publication records in their first year. Moreover, even though women are more likely to leave before getting tenure, their research productivity does not differ from male colleagues. Women take longer to be promoted to full professor, but they outperform men in research productivity at the time of promotion. Women receive fewer but, on average, larger extramural grants. Finally, women are overrepresented as members of graduate committees but underrepresented as chairs of these committees.&nbsp;</p> <p>Taken together, these analyses suggested three foci to better retain and advance women: women's professional networks, proactive career plans, and faculty and departmental values. Helping women intentionally develop professionally-oriented networks, with department heads facilitating such interactions, improved attrition and departmental climate. Affinity organizations for Black and Latino faculty, and Women in Medicine and Science, were initiated and supported. Learning communities for junior and mid-career faculty, writing circles, and manuscript writing retreats were also used to integrate networking with specific areas of concern revealed by surveys.&nbsp;</p> <p>We developed Career Development Plan (CDP) tools, which are downloadable from our website, to help faculty chart career paths that reflected both their own personal values and goals and<em>&nbsp;</em>the policies and expectations of their department. The CDPs were coupled with workshops for women to help them define, develop, and promote their academic identities. Department heads, mentors, and upper administrators embraced the CDPs as ways to help faculty succeed. With administrators' public support of the CDPs and subsequent adoption of the tool across STEM units, faculty members had explicit assurances that their plans met departmental and university expectations.&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, guided reflective dialogues in individual departments regarding the perceived match between their RPT policies, procedures, and practices and the values of their faculty were conducted. Several departments altered their reappointment, promotion, and tenure guidelines and workload documents as a result. &nbsp;</p> <p>Empirical evidence demonstrates the collective, longer-term impact of this iterative, multi-method approach to BP developed and implemented at UC. From 2012-2018, the percentage of women in STEM rose from 23.1% to 25.0%, with the most noticeable gains at the level of full professor (13.6% to 18.1%).&nbsp;Recent survey results also demonstrate that women and men report similar levels of satisfaction with collaboration, and that women and men in STEM express similar levels of satisfaction with fit, research collaborators, workload expectations, and having RPT guidelines that align with their professional aims (see Attachments 3a and 3b). &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/06/2019<br>      Modified by: Valerie&nbsp;G&nbsp;Hardcastle</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1209169/1209169_10214119_1549486063706_Attachment1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1209169/1209169_10214119_1549486063706_Attachment1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Attachment 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1209169/1209169_10214119_1549486063706_Attachment1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Attachment 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Time to Promotion for Female Assistant Professors at the University of Cincinnati</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Cincinnati</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Valerie&nbsp;G&nbsp;Hardcastle</div> <div class="imageTitle">Attachment 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1209169/1209169_10214119_1549486188820_Attachment2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1209169/1209169_10214119_1549486188820_Attachment2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Attachment 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1209169/1209169_10214119_1549486188820_Attachment2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Attachment 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Social Network Analysis Sample Results</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Cincinnati</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Valerie&nbsp;G&nbsp;Hardcastle</div> <div class="imageTitle">Attachment 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1209169/1209169_10214119_1549486529105_Attachment3_Page_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1209169/1209169_10214119_1549486529105_Attachment3_Page_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Attachment 3a"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1209169/1209169_10214119_1549486529105_Attachment3_Page_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Attachment 3a"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Climate Survey Results: Satisfaction with Research Collaboration</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Cincinnati</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Valerie&nbsp;G&nbsp;Hardcastle</div> <div class="imageTitle">Attachment 3a</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1209169/1209169_10214119_1549486645729_Attachment3_Page_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1209169/1209169_10214119_1549486645729_Attachment3_Page_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Attachment 3b"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1209169/1209169_10214119_1549486645729_Attachment3_Page_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Attachment 3b"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Climate Survey Results: Satisfaction with Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure Requirements</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Cincinnati</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Valerie&nbsp;G&nbsp;Hardcastle</div> <div class="imageTitle">Attachment 3b</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
