<AbstractNarration>In this project, Dr. Garaud and her collaborators will expand their modeling to include analysis of transport layered convection, with the goal of solving long-standing problems, such as understanding why Saturn radiates more energy than predicted by models, and why Uranus and Neptune give off much less than expected.  They will also test whether incorporating helium gradients can improve the thermal evolution models of Saturn and Jupiter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has broader impacts in that it will train students in interdisciplinary scientific research, and produce results that are applicable in fields outside of astronomy, including applied mathematics and global oceanic mixing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research funded by this award looked into a fundamental process called "convection", which drives turbulence and ultimately causes the transport of heat and chemical species in giants planets, stars, and many objects in the universe (including the Earth's atmosphere and oceans, as well).  Convection requires a sufficiently large temperature difference between the center of the planet/star and its surface to proceed, and can be inhibited by a "bottom heavy" distribution of chemical elements.
