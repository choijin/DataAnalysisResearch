<AbstractNarration>Public Abstract: "Objective Operational Learning and Applications"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andrew Lim and J. George Shanthikumar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is to study a general approach called "Objective Operational Learning" for estimating an objective function and optimizing a stochastic system. The essential feature of this approach is that it is a hybrid between classical model-based approaches to stochastic optimization and purely non-parametric data driven methods that require minimal assumptions. Its advantage is that it allows the decision maker to incorporate structural knowledge of the system (which may only be partially correct) into the initial model, but to become increasingly data-driven and less dependent on these initial assumptions as the data set increases in size. The goal of the research is to show how objective operational learning can be applied to problems of interest in operations research and management science, and to establish theoretical properties such as small sample performance and asymptotic convergence of this approach.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will lead to the development of new data driven methods for optimizing stochastic systems that perform well when the size of the data set is small but with attractive large sample properties, and insight into how these methods can be used through a number of case studies involving applied problems of interest to industry. Applications of interest include (but are not restricted to) staff and patient scheduling applications in healthcare and service systems, pricing and revenue management problems, and inventory control. Outcomes of research will be disseminated through journal and conference publications and research presentations, undergraduate research opportunities, and advanced undergraduate and graduate level courses and seminars.</AbstractNarration>

More generally, model based decision making has wide applicability in many applications including healthcare, finance, inventory and supply chain management. The efficiency of this approach, however, is ofen hampered by models being incorrect due to calibration and/or modeling errors. The goal of this proposal was to develop methods for accounting for these modeling errors in enviromments where we are also learning about the system being managed over time from data. If successful, the results will lead to more efficient decision making methodologies.  A summary of the outcomes of the project over the lifetime of the award incliude:  * development of new performance-based regularization methods for handling estimation uncertainty in portfolio optimization and risk management;  * development of new insights into the nature of worst-case (robust) optimization, its relationship to in-sample mean-variance optimization, and an analysis of its out-of-sample performance.   * development of new data-driven calibration methods for robust optimization and the notion of robust cross-validation  * development of new methods of approximating the dynamics of learning and the application of these ideas to solving dynamic optimization problems.  * development of methods for dealing with liquidity costs in dynamic portfolio choice problems, and an asymptotic analysis of these methods that led to new insights about the nature of trading when there are liquidity costs.  The primary broader impact of this research was in education and the training of PhD students and postdocs. Two PhD students and one postdoc were funded by the project.  The primary intellectual merit of this project is the development of new methods of accounting for model error in decision making that arise from estimation uncertainty and erroneous assumptions. It has led to new insights about the way in which robust optimization achieves robustness which has led in turn to new data-driven calibration methods for robust models. In addition, new insights into the dynamcs of learning from data has led to new methods for apprioximately solving certain high-dimensional dynamic optimization problems with learning.
