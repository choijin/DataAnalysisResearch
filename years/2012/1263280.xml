<AbstractNarration>This award supports a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rutgers.   Undergraduate students will spend ten weeks doing forefront research in astronomy, high-energy/nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics.  The students will also engage in a program of professional development activities that educate them about the conduct of research and the prospects for careers in physics and astronomy, and that give them the tools for applying to, gaining admission to, and succeeding in graduate school as the first step towards those careers.  In a mixture of formal and informal settings, the students will benefit from interacting with each other, with Rutgers undergraduate physics and astronomy majors, with assigned graduate student "near-peer mentors", and with a diverse peer group from outside Rutgers working in completely different scientific fields. The faculty mentors involved in this project(including five APS Fellows and four NSF CAREER award winners) are an enthusiastic, collegial, intellectually diverse, and award-winning set of scientist-educators with exciting research programs and excellent records of working with undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported the establishment of a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, which offered summer research projects in astronomy, particle physics, and condensed matter physics to a total of 23 students from across the U.S. and its territories from 2013 through 2015. (Three more students were supported as 2013-15 REU participants by a different NSF award, and funds remaining at the end of the original grant period were applied to the continuation of the REU program in 2016.) Participants were selected on the basis of transcripts, personal statements, and recommendation letters from a pool of 806 applicants; residential and social activities were coordinated with the multi-disciplinary Research in Science and Engineering (RiSE) summer program at Rutgers. As an indication of the REU program's <strong>intellectual merit</strong>, 25 of the 26 participating students presented the results of their research at professional conferences (e.g., sponsored by the American Astronomical Society or the American Physical Society) after the end of the summer, while seven students (co-)authored a total of nine papers on their research that were ultimately published in refereed journals. Subjects of these papers included the radius of the proton, the mass of nickel that is produced when a star explodes as a supernova, and the interaction of lithium atoms with ferrous fluoride surfaces, which is relevant to the performance of certain types of batteries. The <strong>broader impacts</strong> of the award were chiefly related to the research training and professional development of the participating students. Each REU student was supported not only by a faculty research mentor, but also by a designated graduate student "near-peer mentor." All-day field trips to the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History, the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, and Brookhaven National Laboratory supplemented a program of weekly workshops and discussions (on topics ranging from the responsible conduct of research to careers in and beyond physics and astronomy), along with demonstration-driven sessions to help prepare students for the physics GRE subject exam. As of April 2018, 23 of the 26 REU students are enrolled in (or have been admitted to) graduate school in physics, astronomy, or a related field.
