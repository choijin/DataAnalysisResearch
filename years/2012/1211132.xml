<AbstractNarration>The need for improved understanding and development of more reliable means to identify and provide advance warning of tornado formation are key motivations behind the joint NSF-NOAA sponsored VORTEX2 (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes) project.  Field operations during VORTEX2 encompassed multi-platform field activities providing a wealth of radar and in-situ thermodynamic data within severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and their supporting environments.  Following on a successful two-year multi-investigator data collection campaign, this research effort will focus on advanced physical understanding in three separate yet interrelated topical areas:  (1) Specification of mechanisms contributing to the genesis, intensification and evolution of tornadoes; (2) more comprehensive description of near-surface winds in tornadoes and their relationship to built-structure damage; and (3) improved climatological description of tornado characteristics utilizing a growing suite of close-up, high-resolution observations gathered via specially-tailored mobile platforms.  In the course of these studies, researchers will seek to increase robustness of prior indications of typical tornado behavior, including what may be a preferred scale and intensity for tornadoes, a suggested negative correlation between vortex core size and intensity, and an apparent lack of correlation between the strength of tornadic vortices vis-Ã -vis overlying in-cloud circulation within parent mesocyclones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this effort will include improved ability to detect, warn for and forecast tornadic events and thereby achieve decreased false alarm rates, as well as provide information that will aid structural engineers and emergency response communities.  Collaborations will extend to multiple universities, and thereby support career development (including degree committee memberships) for multiple students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How, when, and why do tornadoes form?  Why some are some tornadoes violent and long lasting while others are weak and short lived? How can we forecast tornadoes better? What triggers tornadogenesis?      How strong are tornadoes near the ground, at house height?   How do tornado winds cause damage? How big, strong, long lasting, are the average and worst tornadoes? What is the variety of different tornado types, how many spin the opposite way, how many have multiple vortices or other complex internal structures.   The VORTEX2 field project collected unprecedented data in several tornadic storms.  The follow-up ROTATE field projects collected data in several intense tornadoes.  In total, DOW radars have mapped 200 separate tornadoes.  Analysis of these collected data, supported by this grant, is enabling scientists to address the above questions, and many others related to tornadoes, the storms that cause them, and the damage that results.  This grant supported the analysis of how structures related to triggering tornadogenesis (discovered by previous NSF grants supporting the same investigators) may or may not play a role in later rapid intensification.  This grant revealed for the first time ever, that tornado winds can be most intense, most damaging, very close to the ground, just 15 feet above the surface.  This grant revealed the great variety of tornado structures, including single and multiple-vortex, cyclone and anti-cyclonic (clockwise and anti-clockwise), large and small, multi-ringed and single ringed, and others.  This grant revealed, through a study of 73 individual tornadoes, that tornadoes have a typical size, about 300 yards across, and a typical intensity, about 135 mph, a typical path length, and other parameters.  The average Enhanced Fujita (EF) damage-based wind rating of tornadoes underestimates their intensity by 1.5 to 2 full units.
