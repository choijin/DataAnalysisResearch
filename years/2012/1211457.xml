<AbstractNarration>This is part of a collaborative project to search for low-frequency narrowly beamed, highly circular polarized radio emission from "hot Jupiter" extrasolar planets, as part of the HJUDE project.  This emission is predicted to be bright enough to be detected by the newly commissioned LWA1 (Long Wavelength Array) radio telescope, and thus the detections (or upper limits) will be used to test planetary magnetospheric physics models.  As part of the project, the PIs will train undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher in instrumentation, computational expertise and data reduction and analysis techniques.  They will also make the software spectrometer available to other scientists in the community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Hot Jupiter Detection Experiment with the Long Wavelength Array (HJUDE) uses the LWA1 radio telescope in New Mexico to undertake a comprehensive survey searching for low frequency radio emission from extrasolar planets, with particular focus on so-called æhot JupitersÆ. Observations consisted of carefully scheduled observing sessions optimized to search for a "pulse" from a hot Jupiter. The associated large data rates required on-site processing enabled through the development of a software-based spectrometer implemented on existing computational hardware at the LWA1 site.  The role of Virginia Tech in this project was to develop and support this spectrometer.  This was completed with specifications considerably  exceeding requirements, and the new spectrometer capability is now the  preferred mode for most observations conducted at the observatory, as it provides essentially the same information in a more compact form and  eliminates a tedious post-processing step.  This development has  demonstrated the efficacy of software-based spectrometry on commonplace  commercially-available computers (in contrast to the use of programmable  devices such as FPGAs) at bandwidths and resolutions suitable for  modern radio astronomy.   HJUDE is a "collaborative research" project in which California Institute of Technology (PI: Hallinan) is the lead institution and University of New Mexico (PI: Taylor) is a partner. Please refer to the report of the lead institution for a project-level summary.       Last Modified: 11/04/2014       Submitted by: Steven W Ellingson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
