<AbstractNarration>There exists a wide-spread notion that political polarization today is considerably larger than it was a generation ago. Many observers are concerned that this leads to increased gridlock in a given political system, which could threaten the functioning of government and thus, ultimately, the economic welfare of a nation and the stability of its democracy. Understanding which political and economic causes drive polarization, as well as what the effect of polarization on voters and parties is, therefore represent central questions for our society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, precisly identifying the notion of increased polarization in scientific terms is conceptually challenging because measuring candidates' positions  and comparing them over time is difficult. Since the pertinent policy issues in two different campaigns are usually very different, directly comparing the difference between the candidates' platforms is not a feasible approach to the measurement problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead, the PIs provide a fundamentally new method for estimating changes in platform divergence over time, using data from opinion polls on the ideal positions of voters regarding different issues, as well as on their preferred candidate. Based on a spatial model of policy preferences, this project shows how changes in candidate positions affect voter behavior, and how changes in voter behavior provide information about candidate positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will also analyze the question of "voter polarization". The existing literature is somewhat vague about what exactly constitutes polarization and how to measure it. Based on their model, the PIs provide a new measure of this concept and are able to disentangle the two effects that might be responsible for increased polarization: voter "radicalization" (i.e., a change in the distribution of voter ideal points) and "sorting" (an effect arising from more policy divergence between politicians).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This method can also be used to identify the different ideological types of swing voters and their demographic composition. Moreover, one can identify which ideological and demographic voter types are underrepresented in the electorate because of abstention, and thus, the effect of changes in participation rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique feature of the U.S. political system are the primaries in which voters select the candidates of their respective parties. The second part of this project will analyze a dynamic model of policy divergence and polarization, based on the interaction between candidates and policy-motivated primary voters who select them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    There is a wide-spread notion that the difference between Republicans and Democrats today is considerably larger than it was a generation ago. Many observers are concerned that this political polarization leads to increased gridlock in our political system that threatens the functioning of government and thus, ultimately, the economic welfare of our nation and the stability of its democracy. Understanding which political and economic causes drive polarization, and what is the effect of polarization on voters and parties are, are therefore central questions for our society.  However, making the notion of increased polarization precise in a scientific way is conceptually challenging because measuring candidates? positions and comparing them over time is difficult: For example, how do we decide whether or not the policy distance between Ford and Carter in 1976 was larger or smaller than that between McCain and Obama in 2008? Since the pertinent policy issues in two different campaigns are usually very different, directly comparing the difference between the candidates? platforms is not a feasible approach to the measurement problem.   Our research has provided a fundamentally new method for estimating changes in platform divergence over time, using data from opinion polls on the ideal positions of voters in different issues, as well as on their preferred candidate ("Policy divergence and voter polarization in a structural model of elections", 2014 Journal of Law and Economics). Based on a spatial model of policy preferences, we show how changes in candidate positions affect voter behavior, and how changes in voter behavior provide us with information about candidate positions. We also measure voter polarization and are able to disentangle the two effects that can be responsible for increased polar ization: Voter "radicalization" (i.e., a change in the distribution of voter ideal points) and "sorting" (an effect arising from more policy divergence between politicians).   Our method can also be used to identify the different ideological types of swing voters and their demographic composition &ndash; information that is of the highest importance for political campaigns that aim to attract swing voters ("Core Supporters and Party Switchers in U.S. Presidential Elections", working paper).   We are ultimately interested in the causes and effects of polarization in a competitive electoral system. In "Social ideology and taxes in a differentiated candidates framework" (American Economic Review, 2014), we analyze how candidates compete for different swing voter types &mdash; voters who are indifferent between candidates, and therefore must strictly prefer the economic platform of the candidate whose cultural position they dislike. Among social conservatives, swing voters are economically liberal (i.e., prefer substantial government spending), while among social liberals, swing voters are economically conservative.        Candidates focus their equilibrium economic policies to appeal to a weighted average of these swing voters. We show that more intense cultural preferences among social conservatives imply that both candidates adjust their economic platforms by increasing their respective proposed spending. Similarly, cultural polarization of candidates affects their equilibrium economic platforms. A radicalization of the Republican candidate leads to decreased spending by both the Democratic and the Republican candidate, and a radicalization of the Democratic candidate has the opposite effect.   In "Political Competition in Legislative Elections" (working paper), we analyze the role of the electoral system for policy divergence and polarization. A unique feature of the U.S. political system are the primaries in which policy-motivated voters select the candidates of their respective parties. We show that, in legislative elections, this system generates important externalities that drive polarization. Understanding the reasons for polarization will help us predict whether to expect ever-increasing polarization, or whether there are ultimately balancing forces inherent in the political system, and may also guide institutional design by showing how changes to the primary system can reduce polarization.
