<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will investigate the effectiveness of several different interventions designed to retain disabled veterans in engineering degree programs.  A comparative study that looks at a range of characteristics related to retention in engineering will be done, and the results analyzed using the theoretical frameworks of social cognitive career theory and self-efficacy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arise from the project's ability to inform other efforts aimed at engaging disabled veterans in career retraining, or all veterans in obtaining STEM degrees as well as the potential impact on the STEM workforce.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Experiential Learning for Veterans in Assistive Technology and Engineering (ELeVATE) program is a three-phase program designed to re-integrate veterans to college.  ELeVATE is housed in the Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL) within the University of PittsburghÆs Department of Rehabilitation Science and Technology in the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. While there are no prerequisites in terms of background or interest, ELeVATE applicants must possess some military experience.      In Phase I, participants complete a ten-week paid research experience, complete a team project, acquire 21st century skills in workshops, and prepare to begin classes at a college of their choice.  ELeVATE participants work closely with vocational coordinators to ensure that the adequate/appropriate supports are in place for participantÆs academic success.  During this phase, ELeVATE students are offered housing and other family-support assistance.     As the participants transition into Phase II, and with our support, they continue to refine their academic interests and apply for a formal program of study at the University of Pittsburgh or another institution of their choice.  The final phase of the program sees participants enrolling in a two or four-year degree institution.  ELeVATE students are encouraged to remain connected to their cohorts through study and support groups, social media, and by serving as mentors to future ELeVATE participants.     Since 2013, a total of 18 students have enrolled in the ELeVATE program. Of those 18 students, 17 students (94.4%) graduated from the program.  Twelve students (66.7%) either pursued, or are currently enrolled in, a two or four-year program of study, including such institutions as the University of Pittsburgh, Bethany College, and Prince GeorgeÆs Community College. Four of the twelve students pursuing degrees (33.3%) are enrolled in STEM-related programs of study, including Information Science and Mechanical Engineering.  In addition, one program graduate re-enlisted in the military; one graduate is currently completing a STEM-related internship as a Cyber Network Defense Analyst; and one student was called back to active duty and was unable to complete the ELeVATE program.     ELeVATE challenges individuals to go beyond what they may have considered to be their academic and personal limits, and the curriculum is geared toward providing a realistic expectation of the rigors associated with post-secondary STEM-related programs of study.  For instance, in addition to completing a research project, ELeVATE participants must develop a poster and elevator pitch.  In addition, 14 of the 18 participants completed technical manuscripts &ndash; all within the context of the program.     The 2013 &ndash; 2015 ELeVATE cohorts gained valuable academic, research, and time management skills while helping advance research outcomes across thirteen projects in the various HERL labs.  Over time, ELeVATE participants demonstrated increased self-efficacy (via General Self-Efficacy instrument scores) to succeed in STEM and increased engagement in campus life (via National Survey of Student Engagement scores). However, ELeVATEÆs impact went beyond helping veterans achieve their academic and personal goals.  ELeVATE graduates helped to establish the first Student Veterans of America (SVA) chapter at the University of Pittsburgh (PI Dr. Rory Cooper serves as a SVA chapter advisor), and an ELeVATE student was elected as one of the chapterÆs first presidents.      ELeVATE was the catalyst for another HERL program, Advancing Inclusive Manufacturing (AIM), which is a comprehensive vocational training program for service members and veterans with disabilities, with the overarching goal of striving for accessibility in STEM environments.  ELeVATE also led to the development of a new proposal (currently in review) to support student Veterans who have already transitioned to STEM degree programs, but w...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
