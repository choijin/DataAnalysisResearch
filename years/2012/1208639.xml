<AbstractNarration>Effective robotic assistance of infants with or at risk of developing Cerebral Palsy (CP) has the potential to reduce the significant functional limitations as well as the potential deficits in cognitive development.  This project focuses on the development and testing of a sequence of robotic assistants that promote early crawling, creeping, and walking, along with a model of infant-robot interaction that encourages the continued practice of movement patterns that will ultimately lead to unassisted locomotion.  Typically developing infants initially learn to crawl through the generation of spontaneous limb and trunk movements.  Early in the process, these spontaneous movements transport the infant across the floor.  The rewarding locomotory experience drives the infant to refine the movements to intentional and exploratory skills.  Ultimately, the infant intentionally engages these skills to solve larger problems, such as obtaining an interesting toy or exploring the environment.  Infants with conditions such as CP lack the muscle strength, postural control, and motor coordination necessary for these early exploratory limb and trunk movements to result in locomotion.  Without this positive feedback, the development of the neural pathways for productive limb use is diminished, which results in delayed or lack of development of crawling and walking.  These limitations in mobility negatively affect other domains of development such as perception and cognition, with effects being visible even into adulthood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The robotic assistants to be developed in this project will aid the infant in developing locomotory skills by selectively supporting a portion of his/her weight and providing artificial, rewarding locomotory experiences.  The PI's approach to infant-robot interaction is to first instrument the infant with a set of sensors, allowing for reconstruction of the trunk and limb positions in real time.  A semi-supervised clustering process will then identify a menu of canonical spatio-temporal limb and trunk movement patterns given observations of behavior that is exhibited by children who are either typically developing or at risk of developing CP.  The robot will respond to the recognition of a canonical movement by assisting in the corresponding postural support and transport of the child.  The PI's hypothesis is that this positive feedback will encourage the continued practice of the canonical movements, as well as their use in solving larger problems.  The infant-robot interaction model will selectively reward specific canonical movements as different levels of capabilities are exhibited.  As the child becomes proficient at using a simple movement to trigger robotic assistance, the robot will reduce (and ultimately eliminate) its response to that particular canonical movement.  Other canonical movements that encode related, but more complex and/or coordinated limb movements, will continue to be available.  As the limb movements are mastered the vertical support will be reduced to encourage the infant to bear more of his/her own weight.  The hypothesis is that this early intervention approach will help to guide the child along a progressive developmental trajectory that will end with locomotory skills and muscle strength that require little or no assistance.  EEG-based neuroimaging will be used to monitor the progression of the infant's development.  The hypothesis is that the degree of proficiency of certain skills will be identifiable using the EEG index related to motor output.  This information will be used to guide the semi-supervised clustering process, as well as the decision process for selectively rewarding certain canonical movements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Equipping children with CP at an early age with locomotory skills will not only bring them more in line with typically developing children, but will also reduce their reliance on long-term care while increasing their success in self-help, in education, and in the workplace.  The techniques will be applicable to a range of other childhood disorders (including Down Syndrome), to retraining patients following stroke, and to the creation of tunable gestural interfaces for intelligent prostheses.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Cerebral Palsy (CP) is caused by damage to the nervous system before, at, or around the time of birth that impedes the flow of signals between the brain and the muscles. Approximately three children of every 1,000 have CP. Although the damage does not increase in time, it reduces or delays the ability of the infant to perform the exploratory movements that are critical to learning motor skills, including crawling. Furthermore, crawling plays a key role in the development of cognitive skills because the child must begin to represent and reason about objects, spaces and people that are out of reach, or even out of sight. Delays in crawling can affect the development of skills involving autonomy, problem solving, and social interaction (Anderson et al, 2014; Hadders-Algra &amp; Groothuis, 1999). The goal of the co-robot intervention that we developed for this project is to address delays in motor skill acquisition and cognitive development. In turn, this work could lead to reductions in long-term health care requirements and could increase overall well-being.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The key outcomes of this project include:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>- Assistive Co-Robot. We developed a co-robot, called the Self-Initiated Prone Progression Crawler (SIPPC), that assists infants in moving across the floor. An infant lies on the robot in a crawling-like position (belly down). When the infant pushes against the ground, the robot responds by carrying her body in the direction that she is pushing. One key advantage of this assistance is that the infant does not have to support her own weight in order to crawl and can push herself with very little effort.</p> <p>- Gesture-based response of the robot. While on the robot, the infant wears a motion capture suit. This allows us to analyze the trunk and limb movements made by the infant as she interacts with the robot. Furthermore, the robot recognizes crawling-like gestures made by the infant. Under some experimental conditions, when the infant makes a movement, for example, that looks like she is using her hands to pull herself forward, the robot responds by moving her body forward.</p> <p>- Infant-Robot Interaction Results. Our results show that A) infants as young as 6 months of age are capable of engaging in reward-based movement learning (e.g., grasping a toy is rewarding) and in using the assistive robot to explore their environment and obtain objects; B) a strong coupling exists between the emergence of reaching skill and successful use of the SIPPC robot for locomotion; C) for infants who are at risk for Cerebral Palsy, the combination of error-based learning (e.g., observing how much closer a toy is after a movement) and reward-based learning may be superior to reward-based alone (Kolobe and Fagg, 2017); and D) although infants who are typically developing can independently use the SIPPC as early as 6.5 months of age, some of the infants with or at risk for CP tend to do so only at 10 &ndash; 12 months, as long as the robot is responsive to the gestures made by the infant.</p> <p>- Brain Imaging Results. We are collecting Electroencephalography (EEG) data from the infants on a weekly basis. Our results show that infants exhibit a peak in EEG power in the mu rhythm frequency band (a reduction in magnitude of this peak is associated in adults with movement planning and imagination; Pfurtscheller and Neuper, 1997). We also show that this peak frequency shifts with maturation toward frequencies that are observed in adults. This and other markers for planning and attention are being used to assess changes in brain function with development of the infants.</p> <p>- Robot design. The robotic system that we designed and implemented for this NRI project allowed us to explore a wide range of ideas in robot structure and in the interaction between the robot and the infant. The results from our study are allowing us to draft the requirements for the next robot design. In particular, the next robot will be more compact, allowing for easier transportation and use, will have improved data collection capabilities and will include automatically adaptive rules for interaction between the infant and the robot.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/08/2018<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;H&nbsp;Fagg</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1208639/1208639_10210500_1528478642121_IMG_4315-crop--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1208639/1208639_10210500_1528478642121_IMG_4315-crop--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Infant Using the SIPPC Crawling Assistant"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1208639/1208639_10210500_1528478642121_IMG_4315-crop--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Infant Using the SIPPC Crawling Assistant"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Self-Initiated Prone Progression Crawler (SIPPC) assistive robot supports the weight of the infant.
