<AbstractNarration>The intersection of particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology is an exciting and data-driven field, where a combination of imaginative basic theory and observations has revolutionized our understanding of the Universe. The PI's research focuses on several areas where the potential for new fundamental discoveries is particularly high: Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) and their sources, new phenomena in particle physics, Galactic and cosmic magnetic fields, and dark matter and its interactions. The highest energy particles in Nature can now be studied in much greater detail and with higher statistics than ever before at the Pierre Auger Observatory. Previous work has shown that Auger data on UHECR atmospheric showers cannot be explained without profound changes to particle physics at an order of magnitude higher energy than the Large Hadron Collider. Observations suggest that a new - chiral - phase of matter may be created. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the uniqueness of this possibility and its ramifications for theoretical particle physics will be explored. In order to unravel the seeming contradictions in present interpretations of the data, the PI and her group will use a combination of astrophysics analyses to constrain the sources and possible composition of UHECRs and UHE particle physics phenomenology. Other topics of research include identifying possible sources of UHECRs and modeling the Galactic magnetic field, as well as fundamental topics in particle theory, astrophysical constraints on dark matter interactions, plus non-standard supersymmetry signatures and other phenomenology for the Large Hadron Collider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts include public lectures about the PI's research and about the New York Schools Cosmic Particle Telescope (NYSCPT) project; mentoring high school students, teacher and student participants of NYSCPT, women (and men) graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral researchers, junior faculty; and founding participant of the NYU "WINS" program to foster undergraduate women's participation in science and the Collegiate Honors Seminar program, and President of the NYU Women's Faculty Caucus.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research supported under this grant addressed several important aspects of high energy astro-particle physics including the nature of Dark Matter, the origin of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) and the extreme high-energy behavior of hadronic interactions.   (Hadrons are particles composed of quarks such as the proton and neutron.)  Among the most important results have been:     My student Jeff Allen and I showed that the particle cascades produced by UHECRs hitting the Earth?s atmosphere and measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory, disagree at more than "3-sigma" (formally, 99.7% confidence level) with current models of  hadron interactions.   These models are tuned to agree with LHC data, but must be extrapolated by more than a factor of 10 in center-of-mass energy to go from the LHC to UHECR air showers.    Although earlier studies showed hints of a discrepancy between observations and predictions (the "muon excess"), it could be explained by shifting the energy of the primary UHECR within systematic uncertainties.   The breakthrough in our approach was that we developed a way to study the internal consistency of the air showers, greatly reducing the sensitivity to the absolute energy scale.  The discrepancy between predictions of LHC-tuned models and Auger observations shows that some aspect of particle physics relevant to UHECR air showers is not understood, perhaps due to the extrapolation to energies above the LHC and some new physics being missing.  This result was published in Physical Review Letters as a Pierre Auger Collaboration publication.    I showed that there may be a stable neutral hadron made of 6 quarks, provisionally called the S, which would have eluded detection.  I proposed two searches of existing data to discover or constrain the S, using data from the Babar and Belle experiments on Upsilon decay and using the LHC.  Three teams of experimentalists (Babar, Belle and CMS) are working on my proposed searches. If a new stable particle does exist, that would revolutionize our perspective on Particle Physics.   A stable S would be an excellent Dark Matter candidate. Much of my effort was devoted to exploring the astrophysics and cosmology of S Dark Matter (SDM).  To first approximation, SDM behaves like conventional Cold Dark Matter (CDM), but it goes farther by providing a remarkably good accounting of many outstanding puzzles in astrophysics.  Moreover if Dark Matter consists of S particles, the baryon to dark matter ratio can be naturally explained, and it provides a novel explanation for the up-to-now very puzzling asymmetry between baryons and anti-baryons.  This work is currently being written up.     With M. Sutherland of OSU, I studied the impact of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) on the UHECR arrival direction distribution, in the first high-statistics simulation including a realistic model including random magnetic field and going to low enough rigidity (energy divided by charge, E/Z) to be applicable to measurements such as the TA and Auger "hot spots" and the Auger dipole.  Our results show that it will be essential to take into account Galactic deflections in order to interpret UHECR data.   The signal from sources in certain directions can be magnified by a factor up to 30, and in other directions not reach Earth at all.   The location of observed hot spots can be "off" from the true source direction by more than 90 degrees.   This underlines the critical importance in future UHECR studies of event-by-event composition information, as will be available with the AugerPrime upgrade.  That will allow identification of the subset of low-Z events, whose deflections are smallest and can be more reliably modeled.   This subset of UHECRs can then be used for identifying the sources of UHECRs without being faked-out by pollution from highly-deflected, high-Z events.        With M. Unger (KIT) we explored the impact of present uncertainties in the GMF model on UHECR deflections.      With grad student M. S. Mahdawi we re-examined limits on moderately interacting (micro-barn) GeV-mass dark matter and showed that the window in this region (originally identified by GRF and grad student Gabrijela Zahrijas in 2007) and studied by several other groups subsequently) could be closed by a more accurate analysis.  We introduced the method of Importance Sampling to make the necessary trajectory simulations feasible.      With M. Unger and L. Anchordoqui, I developed a model of UHECR production and photodisintegration in the neighborhood of the source, which gives the first successful description of the spectrum and composition of extragalactic cosmic rays without requiring an ad-hoc and fine-tuned additional component.  The constraints on source environment in this model will help in the effort to identify the origins of UHECRs.       With grad student C. Lage, we performed a constrained simulation of the Bullet Cluster merger.  This gave the first accurate information on masses and relative velocity, and showed the Bullet Cluster is not a cosmological anomaly as had been erroneously claimed.
