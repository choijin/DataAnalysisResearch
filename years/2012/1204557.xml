<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award, under the Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship program, supported the PI's research (supervised and often in collaboration with David Jerison at the host institution, MIT) into several problems in the Calculus of Variations and related issues in mathematical analysis and the study of partial differential equations.  The problems in the Calculus of Variations studied under the award include several instances where the goal is to determine the optimal shape with respect to minimizing a certain measure of "energy", subject to certain constraints -- this includes the classical isoperimetric problem (where the goal is find shapes of minimal perimeter given a fixed volume constraint; the PI together with A. Figalli studied a variant of this problem inside slightly non-convex cones), and a mathematical model of liquid drops and crystals sitting on a table and under the influence of gravity (where the energy involved consists of the sum of three effects: the surface tension of the drop, the interaction between the drop and the table, and the influence of gravity).  In the context of the PI's work, the study of these mathematical questions often involves the tools of a subject known as geometric measure theory, where the main issue is to study generalized notions of length, area, and volume, in non-smooth settings.  A major component of the supported work is a result obtained in collaboration with David Jerison concerning the identification of spaces of functions for which the Hessian matrix (that is, the matrix of second partial derivatives) has a well-defined determinant (in a suitable generalized sense).  The understanding of mathematical properties of this determinant, which is made difficult by the high degree of nonlinearity involved, has close connections to several issues in geometry and nonlinear models of the behavior of elastic solids.  The research supported under this award has resulted in the publication of several articles in peer-reviewed journals, and the PI has given a number of seminar talks disseminating the research.  The PI also supported the integration of research into teaching activities during the award, designing a short "Introduction to Proofs" course addressed to an undergraduate audience at the host institution -- several motivating examples throughout this course involved the geometric concepts (notably, some of the basic definitions of geometric measure theory such as fractal dimension) related to the research problems studied under the award.
