<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs Professor John Sheridan from Rutgers Universvity Newark and colleagues Frank Jordan, Elena Galoppini, Frieder Jaekle and Darren Hansen will aquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) development of functional conjugated macrocycles and polymers for optoelectronic applications and synthesis of chiral Lewis pairs for small molecule activation; (b) investigation of stimuli-responsive metal-containing polymers; (c) synthesis of functional molecules for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), host-guest complexes, and biosensors; (d) development of sustainable polymers from renewable resources; (e) investigation of thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes as well as synthesis of labeled coenzymes, substrate analogues and inhibitors; and (f) mechanistic studies on quinolone quorum sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. Many research projects associated with this application will have a direct impact on society, as they aim to develop polymers fo optoelectronics, metal containing polymers, materials for solar cells, and investigations of enzyme inhibitors and bio-sensing. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at Rutgers University Newark.</AbstractNarration>
