<AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop compact multifunctional radio frequency and mmwave devices based on nano-film slow wave elements. The approach is to carry out a systematic material and device study include investigating and modeling of low loss slow wave transmission line elements; exploring fundamental science and characterizing tunability of nano-scale patterned Permalloy and Barium Strontium Titanate thin films; designing inductance and capacitance tunable slow wave elements; and demonstrating highly efficient, compact, multifunctional RF devices and components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research includes new architectures of tunable slow wave elements enabled by nano patterned thin films; design and unique process development of 3 dimensional smart slow wave elements on multi-layer flexible polymer substrate; broadband characterization of nano scale patterned Permalloy and Barium Strontium Titanate; and multi-band RF Passive components include a Branch-line coupler, a bandpass filter and a phased array antenna. All the device concepts presented here are unique and the envisioned tunable slow wave elements and their RF device applications will provide a major breakthrough in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal include the integrated education and research in various ways, such as a new course, recruiting underrepresented and minority engineers at the University of South Carolina, outreach activities and a web based e-museum entitled Smart RF Electronics to inspire young generations interest in engineering. The technical and societal impacts will occur in diverse areas of science and engineering such as telecommunications, medical imaging, and even wireless environmental monitoring.</AbstractNarration>
