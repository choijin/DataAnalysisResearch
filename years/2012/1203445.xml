<AbstractNarration>The University of Arizona's Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research (LTRR) maintains the largest and most diverse collection of tree-ring research (dendrochronology) specimens in the world. For 75 years, the LTRR has essentially served as a "wood herbarium", containing approximately 2,000,000 research specimens and associated materials. Nearly half of the collection currently resides in extremely high-risk storage, lacking even basic heating or air conditioning controls. This project will secure the long-term safety, organization and accessibility of the collection through re-housing to current archival standards and via the purchase of high-density compact shelving. The shelving will be installed in a renovated archive building, providing greatly improved access to a wealth of materials for research, education and outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tree rings are natural chronometers and recorders of change in the environment with which biological life is inescapably linked. The LTRR collection is an irreplaceable source of physical, biological and historical insights on climate change, water resources, fire ecology, and human-environment interactions that are often otherwise unobtainable. Physically condensing and organizing the LTRR collection will allot space for public activities, including exhibits and hosting school field trips. Public interaction with, education of and exposure to scientific collections is facilitated in the form of tours and the creation of no-cost travelling exhibits.</AbstractNarration>
