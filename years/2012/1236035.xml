<AbstractNarration>1236035&lt;br/&gt;Singh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this research is to investigate the physics of particle adsorption and the spontaneous dispersion of particles that occurs when particles come in contact with a fluid-fluid interface. The dispersion of small particles, e.g., flour, pollen, etc., can occur so quickly that it appears explosive, especially on the surface of mobile liquids like water. This interfacial-force-driven dispersion of particles is important because it causes particles sprinkled over a small area to almost instantaneously disperse into a monolayer over an area that is several orders-of-magnitudes larger. While the Weber and Bond numbers, and the contact angle are the important dimensionless parameters that govern the motion of particles normal to the interface, it is not completely understood what parameters govern the lateral motions of the particles. Our main objectives are: (i) use experiments and direct numerical simulations to determine the dependence on important parameters of the speed at which particles disperse, and to quantify the enhancement resulting from dispersion in the rate of spreading on liquid surfaces of small particles including microbes and viruses. (ii) Model the fluid dynamics of the two-dimensional pollination process in hydrophilous plants. (iii) Model the mechanism that causes the breakup and spreading of agglomerates on liquid surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The focus of the past studies has been on understanding the mechanisms by which particles already trapped on fluid-liquid interfaces interact. The proposed study will, for the first time, consider the role of the sudden dispersion, which will improve our understanding of biological processes occurring over the surface of water, developing improved estimates for the rate at which small particles, including microbes and viruses, spread on interfaces, and improving the modeling of processes in the pharmaceutical and food industries that involve breakup and spreading of powders on liquid surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. This research will be fully integrated with education and outreach, involving graduate and undergraduate students, particularly women and under-represented minorities, with synergistic activities in our courses at the university, and in workshops in NJIT, and BBG educational programs for inner-city pre-college students to encourage then to explore careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will further our capability to understand and model the role of particles adsorbed at air-liquid and liquid-liquid interfaces which play an important role in many physical and biological processes, e.g., pollination of hydrophilous plants, the spread of microbes and germs on liquid surfaces, and formation of monolayers at fluid-fluid interfaces. This project has the potential to make a significant contribution to the understanding of the physics underlying the mechanisms that have evolved in plants that possess abiotic two-dimensional pollination systems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We have shown that powders consisting of small particles when sprinkled upon a liquid surface almost instantaneously spread out over an area that can be several orders of magnitudes larger. This happens because a newly-adsorbed particle gives rise to a flow that causes particles already trapped on the interface to move away. Our PIV measurements and simulations show that the adsorption of a spherical particle at a fluid-liquid interface causes an axisymmetric streaming flow about the vertical line passing through the particle center. The fluid directly below the particle rises upward, and near the surface, it moves away from the particle. The flow, which develops within a fraction of second after the adsorption of the particle, persists for several seconds. The flow strength, and the volume over which the flow extends, decrease with decreasing particle size. The streaming flow induced by the adsorption of two or more particles is a combination of the flows which they induce individually. The flow not only causes particles sprinkled together onto a liquid surface to disperse, but also causes a hydrodynamic stress which is extensional in the direction tangential to the interface and compressive in the normal direction.</p> <p>These streaming flow induced stresses cause the breakup of particle agglomerates when they are adsorbed on a liquid surface. This breakup and spreading of particle clumps (agglomerates) on liquid surfaces is important in various processes in the pharmaceutical and food industries such as wet granulation and food processing. The induced flow also influences the nature, e.g., structure and porosity, of the monolayer clusters that are formed.

In both cases partially dispersed pollen masses combined with others under the action of lateral capillary forces to form pollen rafts. Surface tension (which gives rise to capillary forces) therefore plays a crucial role in the pollination process. It keeps pollen masses attached to the bubbles to be carried to the water surface when they are released below the surface, partially disperses them as they come in contact with the water surface, keeps them afloat on the surface, gives rise to lateral capillary forces that cause dispersed pollen masses to cluster together to form pollen rafts, and propels pollen rafts toward the depression in the water surface created by a nearby stigma. The formation of pollen rafts increases the probability of pollination since the attractive capillary force on a pollen raft toward a stigma located at the water surface is much larger than on a single pollen grain or pollen mass.
