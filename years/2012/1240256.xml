<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant will create a partnership between engineering faculty and engineering education researchers to explore development of self-efficacy in electrical engineering students from a broad range of under-represented groups and first generation college students.   The researchers plan to develop a conceptual framework that will let them explore the effect of collaborative learning on self-efficacy then design internal policies for course design and development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises from the potential of the project to broadly inform practice that can lead to improved retention of under-represented and first generation students.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by building the capacity of the nation's citizenry for addressing societal challenges through engineering.</AbstractNarration>

A natural question is to find out if PBL is the way to go to educate the next generation of engineers? With the support of NSF RIGEE program, an interdisciplinary study was conducted at California State University Los Angeles to investigate the relationship between the pedagogical components in Collaborative Project-based Learning (CPBL) model and the self-efficacy, motivation, and other learning indicators of students in minority groups in Engineering, which shed some light on the above intriguing question.

In particular, Hispanic students reported larger growth of self-efficacy through CPBL compared to their non-minority peers. Our research findings further revealed a qualitative difference in studentsÆ learning outcomes as a result of adopting the redesigned CPBL model. Student participation has increased significantly and the performance of term projects has improved.  Many student teams went beyond the basic requirements to apply more advanced and realistic design criteria, indicating a deeper and more active learning approach was employed.  Clearly, with Participatory Design approach and situated learning framework, the redesigned course helped to sustain the student motivation and promote deep learning.
