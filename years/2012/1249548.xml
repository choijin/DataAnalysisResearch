<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed project is to investigate some of the p-adic aspects of the Langlands program.  The Langlands program studies the interrelations between several subjects, including the representation theory of reductive groups (both over local fields and over the adeles of a global field), automorphic forms, global Galois representations, and L-functions.  Each of these subjects has a p-adic aspect:  one may consider p-adic or adelic groups acting on topological p-adic vector spaces, p-adic automorphic forms (or their close cousins, cohomology classes with p-adic coefficients on arithmetic quotients of symmetric spaces), p-adic representations of Galois groups and their deformation theory, and p-adic L-functions.  The proposed investigation will encompass all these.   Some of the particular results expected to follow from this investigation are: new results regarding the structure of p-adically completed cohomology on arithmetic quotients of symmetric spaces, and new results relating special values of L-functions attached to modular forms to the arithmetic properties of the associated Galois representations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is the branch of mathematics that studies phenomena related to properties of whole numbers.  A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole number solutions of some equation of interest. The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions.  The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures(or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form.  (Number theorists refer to Langlands conjectured relationship between L-functions and automorphic forms as a "reciprocity law".)  Langlands developed an array of powerful representation theoretic methods to study his conjectures.  These are methods that exploit the many symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyze their mathematical properties; these methods have been incorporated into a body of mathematics known as "the Langlands program".  A more recent approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods.  These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study the Taylor series coefficients of the automorphic forms and L-functions.   Recently, the representation theoretic methods and p-adic methods have begun to be unified into a so-called "p-adic Langlands program". The proposer aims to develop new results and methods in the  p-adic Langlands program, and to use them to establish new results about L-functions, and to develop tools for establishing new reciprocity laws.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to investigate several problems in number theory related to what is called ``reciprocity''.   Reciprocity is a broad theme in contemporary number theory: it provides an unexpected, powerful, and only partially established relationship between number theoretic problems (such as counting solutions to Diophantine equations modulo primes) and objects of a more geometric or analytic nature, called automorphic representations.    Automorphic representations can be desribed in various ways, including via the methods of topology, involving invariants of spaces known as homology and cohomology.  Two key parts of the project involved studying cohomology of certain spaces of interest in number theory, related to certain cases of reciprocity.  In the first part (joint with Toby Gee) we proved vanishing results for cohomology of certain geometric objects called Shimura varieties.  The arguments used a novel combination of ideas from geometry and techniques of reciprocity.  In the second part (joint with Frank Calegari) we proved a stability result for certain homology groups: this result shows that certain homology groups (the so-called completed homology groups attached to GL_n) are independent of the parameter n, when it is sufficiently large.    The third major part of the project (joint with David Helm) involved the construction of a local Langlands correspondence in families. The local Langlands correspondence is a part of the machinery reciporicty; our result describes how this correspondence behaves when the objects on either side of the reciprocity relationship are varied through different congruence classes modulo the powers of a prime.  All three parts of the project have led to publications in high-quality peer-reviewed journals.                      Last Modified: 06/02/2015       Submitted by: Matthew Emerton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
