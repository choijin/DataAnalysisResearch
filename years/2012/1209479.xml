<AbstractNarration>This action funds Michelle Anne Maier of Oregon Health and Science University to conduct a research project, entitled "Assessing zooplankton grazing on chytrid fungi in Lake Inba, Japan," during the summer of 2012 at Toho University in Funabashi, Chiba, Japan.  The host scientist is Dr. Maiko Kagami.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to confirm the role of the mycoloop pathway in the aquatic food web by evaluating grazing of zooplankton on chytrid zoospores in the laboratory and in the field using microscopy and molecular techniques. This work promises to elucidate the role chytrid parasites play in efficiently transferring nutrients from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
