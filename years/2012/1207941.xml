<AbstractNarration>The rodent vibrissal-trigeminal system is one of the most important models in neuroscience for the study of sensorimotor integration. To date, however, research has focused exclusively on direct tactile sensation. Recent results from the Hartmann and Gopal laboratories have demonstrated that rat vibrissae have a robust and repeatable mechanical response to airflow. In addition, neurons in the vibrissal-trigeminal system are known to respond to air puffs. These results suggest that the rat may use its vibrissae to detect air currents and determine wind direction. The Northwestern-Elmhurst team will perform mechanical, behavioral, and computational studies to characterize the role of vibrissae in wind-following behaviors, and the vibrissal-related neural response to air currents. These will constitute some of the first investigations of the underlying mechanisms that permit terrestrial mammals to sense and follow the wind. The team will specifically identify the morphological features of vibrissae and their orientation on the mystacial pad that enable flow sensing behaviors. They will investigate the broad hypothesis that differential mechanical deformations of the vibrissae across the mystacial pad can encode a variety of flow parameters. Finally, behavioral experiments will be performed to determine the extent to which the rat uses its vibrissae to sense airflow, and to quantify the movement strategies used during anemotaxis in the behaving animal.  The partnership between Northwestern and Elmhurst will provide significant research opportunities for undergraduates; in addition, videos will be developed to teach the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics and biological sensing that underlie this research. The proposed work has potentially large implications for olfactory localization and the structure of the olfactory system, and is likely to lead to the development of novel flow-sensing technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching goal of this research was to better understand how animals sense the flow of air and water. This research is important for several reasons: it can help us engineer better devices for flow sensing and chemical tracking, it teaches us more about how the brains of mammals process sensory information, and it can help us characterize general principles that govern the physics of fluids (air and water).</p> <p>Any hunter or wildlife photographer knows that animals constantly monitor the wind for scents of predator, prey, water, food, and mates. Why are animals so much better at tracking the wind than humans? We investigated the possibility that animals use their whiskers to help sense the direction of airflow, specifically focusing on the rat whisker system. The intellectual merit of this work is captured in four important results.</p> <p>First, understanding how animals sense fluid flow will help us engineer devices that can imitate this sensing in both air and water. We did a behavioral experiment to show that the whiskers play an important role in how rats sense the direction of airflow, and then we constructed artificial whiskers that can also sense airflow. <strong>Image 1</strong> shows a top-down view of an arena with five fans, with a hole in front of each fan. On each trial, only one fan was on, weakly blowing air, and the other four fans were off. Rats had to run towards the airflow and go down the corresponding hole to receive a reward. When we cut off the rat&rsquo;s whiskers (whiskers are like hair, so this procedure does not hurt the animal), the rat&rsquo;s ability to find the correct fan dropped significantly. Both graduate and undergraduate students then constructed prototypes of artificial whiskers that can also sense airflow. These type of devices could be used in many applications, including constructing novel arrays of anemometers, tracking fluid wakes, and navigating in murky underwater environments. Undergraduate students specifically constructed prototype robots that used artificial whiskers to mimic the behavior of an animal that tracks upwind.</p> <p>Second, understanding how animals sense airflow may help explain the origin of their exceptional ability to localize odors, leading to improved engineering tools for chemical detection and tracking. Our work has helped show that the sense of smell is probably not working in isolation, but is likely to be coupled with a tactile sense (whiskers) that can provide information about the location of the odor. We developed instrumentation to visualize airflow (<strong>Image 2</strong>), and also performed mechanical experiments on whiskers that showed that both the bending and the vibrations of the whiskers can provide information about airspeed and direction. These results can not only help engineers, but also neuroscientists who study olfaction (smell) and somatosensation (touch).</p> <p>Third, the field of neuroscience uses the rodent whisker system as a common model to study the sense of touch. Scientists can do experiments in rats that tell us about how touch is integrated with movement and how this integration is disrupted after a stroke or with aging. However, in order to understand how sensory and motor information is coordinated in the brain, we need to know what information the brain evolved to use. Our work showed that the brains of rats and mice process information not only about direct touch to the whiskers, but also about airflow. <strong>Image 3 </strong>shows responses of neurons in the rat&rsquo;s brain to airflow, indicating that they are highly sensitive to different features of the flow profile.</p> <p>Fourth, the computational work involved in this project is helping us develop a stability diagram for various modes of cantilever (e.g., whisker) vibrations in the presence of an imposed flow. For example, given the input parameters of the problem, this diagram determines whether a cantilever will achieve a regular vibrational mode or achieve a steady non-oscillatory deformed configuration, among various possibilities. Thus, this diagram provides a unified way to predict the motion of cantilevers of any type. It could be applied to whiskers at different scales (e.g., seals, rats) in different fluid media (water or air), to tree branches, and even to &ldquo;bladeless wind-turbines.&rdquo;</p> <p>Finally, our work on this project had significant broader impacts. Over the course of the grant, we provided research experiences for 7 undergraduates at Northwestern and 14 undergraduates at Elmhurst College, a Primarily Undergraduate Institution.
