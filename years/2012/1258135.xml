<AbstractNarration>The overarching long-term goal of this multidisciplinary project is to investigate how plant cells deliver different polysaccharides, enzymes and structural proteins into their developing cell walls. Plant cell walls are dynamic structures that play a pivotal role in growth and development, the maintenance of cell integrity and protection against pathogens. They are composed primarily of structural carbohydrates that can be broken down into sugars, providing energy directly as food/feed, or indirectly as biofuels. Thus, an improved understanding of how cell walls are assembled can lead to an increased food supply and renewable sources of fuels. Although the structure and synthesis of plant cell walls is generally understood, remarkably little is known about the transport mechanisms of polysaccharides and the cell wall biosynthesis machinery. This transport is mediated through a complex network of subcellular compartments called the endomembrane system. This project aims at identifying endomembrane trafficking pathways regulating the transport and deposition of cell wall components.  The project uses cell permeable small molecules that inhibit cell wall deposition. With the aid of these compounds, the targeted endomembrane pathways will be characterized and new components involved in these pathways will be identified. Multidisciplinary approaches including genetics, cell biology and biochemistry will add to our understanding of the processes that regulate wall deposition.  A number of student-scientists, including undergraduate students from underrepresented and financially disadvantaged ethnic groups will receive multidisciplinary research training in the project, thus enhancing the ethnic and cultural diversity of the scientific community. Selected chemical probes from the project will be used as live imaging teaching tools in an undergraduate laboratory course. Hands-on laboratory experience for regional life sciences educators will be provided, transferring excitement and state of the art knowledge across the educational system. Data generated through this project will be available through Chemmine (http://bioweb.ucr.edu/ChemMineV2/) and MASCP Gator (http://gator.masc-proteomics.org/); materials such as seed stocks and constructs will be available through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (http://abrc.osu.edu/).</AbstractNarration>

Although the structure and synthesis of plant cell walls is generally understood, remarkably little is known about the transport and assembly of cell wall components, mediated through a network of subcellular compartments called the endomembrane system.  Given the complexity of cell wall synthesis and assembly, we used multidisciplinary approaches to dissect cellular mechanisms contributing to the buildup of a new cell wall.  Research from this award led to the development of methodologies for the characterization of  cellular pathways that are involved in cell wall build up,  leading to 12 publications including research papers, book chapters and reviews.  Within the framework of this award we identified and characterized  two novel small molecules that affect cell wall deposition specifically either during cell division, Endosidin 7,  or during cell elongation, CESTRIN.  The identification of the novel CESA Trafficking Inhibitor CESTRIN, allowed us to probe the interaction of cellulose synthases with microtubules.  CESTRIN reduces cellulose content and alters plant anisotropic growth. This novel probe allowed the dissection of distinct behavior of the cellulose synthase interacting proteins as they dissociate from the complex under chemical application. Further, accumulation of cellulose synthases in endosomal compartments under CESTRIN treatment revealed a trafficking route of the cellulose synthases. The properties of CESTRIN compared with known cellulose inhibitors open up unique avenues to study and understand the mechanism under which plasma membrane associated cellulose synthase complexes are maintained and interact with microtubules and understand their trafficking routes.
