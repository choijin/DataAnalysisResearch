<AbstractNarration>In this award from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Peter Qin, from the University of Southern California, will investigate intrinsic dynamics in the nano- to microsecond regime of a large ribozyme using site-directed spin labeling. By monitoring nitroxide spin labels covalently attached to specific RNA sites with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, information on RNA dynamics will be obtained at various equilibrium states of wild type and mutant ribozymes. The studies aim to: (i) reveal sequence and structure elements that dictate intrinsic RNA dynamics, and (ii) correlate intrinsic dynamics to RNA folding and catalysis. The goal of the project is to advance fundamental understanding of the structure-dynamics-function relationship in RNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed work stems from advancing experimental methods for probing biological systems, enhancing research infrastructure and resources, and providing knowledge that benefits the broader scientific community. The proposed work will contribute to student training at all levels, with emphasis on using a multidisciplinary approach and on promoting participation of members from under-represented groups (e.g. minority undergraduates from local primarily undergraduate institutions) in research. Examples from the Dr. Qin's research are incorporated into courses and education programs to propel the growth of the Chemistry Department and the University.</AbstractNarration>
