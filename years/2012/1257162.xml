<AbstractNarration>Why do some species live in large groups while others interact only to reproduce?  This project investigates neural sources of variation in mammalian social behavior, including pathways that support motivation to interact with others and social tolerance. Most of what is known about the neurobiology of social attachments comes from research on mothering and monogamy, while little is known about non-reproductive relationships. The goal of this project is to examine where and how the hormone oxytocin acts in the brain to influence social behavior between peers.  This is approached with behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular genetic studies of meadow voles. Meadow voles display environmentally induced variation in social behavior, acting aggressive and territorial in summer months, but living in social groups in winter.  These experiments will investigate how seasonal changes in neurochemistry, particularly in oxytocin circuitry, underlie changing anxiety, social tolerance, and social attachments. This fills a gap in our understanding of social relationships by adding the study of non-reproductive peer relationships, and contributes important basic information on how oxytocin contributes to both prosocial and antisocial behaviors in different brain regions. These findings will have implications for understanding sociality across social species, particularly in mammals.  These studies will be conducted at a women's college, providing training opportunities for undergraduate women, many from under-represented groups.  Students will serve in leadership roles and participate in all aspects of this research including presentation and publication of work. Anatomical and genomic data from these studies will be contributed to online repositories (Data Dryad and GenBank), and custom software will be made available through the lab website</AbstractNarration>

This plasticity in behavior within a single species allows for comparisons of molecular pathways that may underlie these behaviors across day lengths and social behavior phenotypes.     We established connections between seasonal changes in social and anxiety behavior.  Voles housed in long day lengths exhibited greater behavioral anxiety, increased free corticosterone, and altered CRF1 and CRF2 receptor distributions that correlated with decreased social huddling.  Furthermore, exposure to a mild stressor impaired the formation of new social partnerships.  Together these findings suggest that reduced anxiety and lowered stress axis activity play an important role in permitting social behavior and group-living in this species, and potentially others.     A second series of studies focused on region-specific effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin on the selective preferences for familiar social partners that meadow voles display.  Oxytocin enhances the preference for a familiar partner when infused into general brain circulation, but eliminates that preference in at least two regions that we identified: the lateral septum and central nucleus of the amygdala. Oxytocin is often touted for its prosocial effects, and these findings are some of the first to focus on social behavior effects of oxytocin outside of the nucleus accumbens and reward regions.

I helped revise our Neuroscience major to increase course-based research opportunities, and created a new course to support this transition.  I also assisted with curriculum development and I provided visiting lectures at a local high school on an ongoing basis.
