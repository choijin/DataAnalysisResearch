<AbstractNarration>The proposed research project is focused on the study of random matrices and random walks evolving in random media. Much of the existing theory of random matrices deals with normal matrices, which are stable under perturbations; many of the existing tools&lt;br/&gt;implicitly use either this stability, or some strong independence assumptions, even in deriving rough results. A major goal of the  present proposal is to build on previous work of the PI and collaborators and develop techniques that work even in a context where both structural assumptions (normality or independence) fail. While the proposal discusses and addresses some very specific questions, it is part of a larger attempt to develop new techniques that would be  applicable to a wide range of RMT questions. The second topic to be studied concerns random walks and branching processes in random environments. Though the theory of random walks is well developed, many gaps in understanding remain when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a random medium. In spite of rapid progress that was achieved  in the last few years by several researchers, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. The proposed project will built on previous work, by the PI and other researchers, with the goal of resolving some of these outstanding questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matrices are the cornerstone of linear algebra, and are fundamental building blocks in operator theory. Random matrix theory (RMT) is concerned with the study of properties of random matrices, typically in the limit where the dimension of the matrix is large.&lt;br/&gt;Motivations and applications for this study come from several areas of mathematics (probability theory, number theory, representation theory), the physical sciences (especially, mathematical physics), statistics, and engineering (specifically, communication and information theories). In recent years, RMT has emerged as a major research area within mathematics, combining techniques from probability theory, operator algebras, complex analysis, and combinatorics.  Several major (and fundamental) open questions have recently been resolved, especially concerning the universality of limit laws regarding the spectrum of large random matrices. The proposed research will seek to significantly expand the theory toward a class of matrices whose spectrum is not stable under (small) perturbations. While the focus of the research is theoretical, an impact on applications is expected, e.g. in evaluating the stability  of complex systems, in computations related to quantum information theory, and in statistics. The second main focus of the study, random walks, are arguably the stochastic processes most studied by mathematicians, having the widest range of applications in fields as diverse as the physical sciences, engineering, and the social sciences. Though the theory of random walks is by now well developed, this is not at all the case when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a random medium, thus obtaining a random walk in random environment (RWRE). Such  RWRE's can be used to model many problems of motion in random media in the physical and engineering sciences, and are mathematically appealing because on the one hand the model is very simply stated, while on the other hand established tools for studying processes in random media are not applicable in the study of RWRE. The goal of the current proposal is to develop new basic probabilistic techniques that will allow to make provable predictions concerning the behavior of RWRE. It is expected that such techniques will be useful in the study of other processes, and link naturally to the study of trapping models and  reinforced random walks. While not explicitly targeted in this proposal, trapping models have recently been used to study the environmental impact of nuclear waste, and RWRE's can naturally be used in this context to model the spread of contamination in a real environment, once the required mathematical background and tools are in place.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit.  Probability theory is primarily a subfield of mathematics, but has significant overlap with various more applied disciplines.  This project studies questions arising in a number of areas of probability theory, including branching random walks, Gaussian free fields, random matrices, interacting particle systems, and queueing networks.  The first four of these areas have strong connections to mathematical physics, and the last area has strong connections to electrical and industrial engineering, and computer science.  (Prof. Zeitouni was principal investigator until November, 2013; some activities reflect his projects and/or joint work with the current principal investigator.)  Branching random walks incorporate two mechanisms, branching (where individuals have offspring) and random walks (where individuals move about in space).  The maximum at a given time corresponds in applications to, for example, the age of the oldest individual or the greatest energy among all particles present.   In this project, precise results were obtained on the convergence of the distribution of the maxima of branching random walk as time increases.  Partial results for this type of problem go back to a famous 1937 paper on the KPP differential equation; significant breakthroughs have been made over the past decade.  Gaussian fields are random processes on a lattice, with a Gaussian (or normal) distribution at each site and a prescribed correlation between sites.  Branching random walks were employed in this project to obtain precise results for the maxima of the 2-dimensional Gaussian free field and to show convergence to the associated traveling wave as the size of the lattice increases.  These are considered important results and relate to ongoing study in areas of mathematical physics such as quantum gravity.    Random matrices has been one of the areas of greatest interest in probability theory over the past decade.   However, few results exist for non-normal matrices, whose behavior is less regular and more complicated than that of normal matrices.  The work here on their spectral measure attracted substantial attention. It employs concentration techniques that were developed earlier by Zeitouni and co-authors.   Interacting particle systems is an area in probability theory that models, for example, the interaction of cells, the spread of disease, and the spread of opinions throughout a population.  The majority vote process is one of the oldest and most important interacting particle systems, and is also believed to have significant connections with the extensively studied Ising model from statistical mechanics.  The understanding of the equilibria is fundamental to the study of such processes.  However, since the late 1970s, essentially no progress on the nature of equilibria (or any other problem) has been made except in one dimension.   The results here on infinite trees, although not a breakthrough for this problem, are the first significant advance in this direction.  Queueing networks model lines of customers waiting to be served, jobs waiting to be performed (such as incoming phone calls waiting to be connected or semiconductor wafers waiting to be stamped), and digital information waiting to be transmitted.  They are an essential tool within various engineering fields and computer science, and are highly utilized in certain industries.  It is important to know when a queueing network is stable, i.e., that the system can process customers quickly enough so that the queue (or line) sizes do not grow.    Typically, there is more than one queue of customers and it is important to find efficient rules for determining the allocation of service.  Switched queueing networks allow the comparative amount of work devoted to individual queues to vary based on their comparative sizes.  Relatively little is known about the stability of these networks.  Sharp results on stability have been obtained here for the ProportionalSwitch policy, and both positive and negative results have been shown for the MaxWeight policy.  Results for both policies have been of considerable interest to the queueing community since there is presently a debate on the proper choice of policy in concrete applications.   There are a substantial number of advocates for the MaxWeight policy, which these results show is, however, less flexible than the ProportionalSwitch policy.    Broader impacts.  The principal investigator has regularly presented his research at conferences that receive specific funding for suporting researchers with recent Ph.D.'s and advanced graduate students.  Through such conferences and the principal investigator's published articles, such junior researchers are exposed to his work.  The principal investigator currently has two Ph.D. graduate students and one student recently graduated.  The principal investigator periodically gives general lectures to undergraduate and graduate students in his department, and to highly selected high school students in the UMTYMP extension program of the mathematics department.
