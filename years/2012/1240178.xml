<AbstractNarration>Igbo is a language spoken by twenty million people, mostly in southern Nigeria.  This EAGER project makes use of a corpus of spoken Igbo, which will cover all of the dialects of the language.  The corpus is to be used for explorations in which statistical machine learning (ML) programs are created to learn an "inter-Igbo'' consisting cognate sets (Igbo words pronounced differently in different locations but having the same meaning) that enable the corpus to be treated as if it were spoken as a single language, even though the dialects are, at extreme ends of the Igbo homeland, mutually unintelligible.  Another aspect of our work is the extension of the existing corpus to fill in gaps in dialect coverage where there currently are recordings from locations that have no near geographical neighbors.  The need for this stems from the fact that the closer a dialect's neighbors the more similar they are, and the easier for programs to locate words which differ systematically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achieving goals of this exploratory project is of considerable interest for computational linguistics.  As opposed to language change over time, there is little computational work on language change over geography, and finding the appropriate ML models for the latter aspect of language variation is a considerable challenge.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This EAGER grant had two basic parts.  The first, and most important insofar as this is where the bulk of the effort was concentrated, was that of corpus creation.  The corpus creation effort consisted of three parts.  First, during the one-year EAGER grant period over one million words were added to the Igbo Corpus through the following research activities in eastern Nigeria. Field Recordings: An average of 24 hours of field recordings were made every month during an eight-month period between July 2012 and June 2013. These recordings were made by Igbo Project staff at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Nigeria, supervised by both Dr. Ike Achebe at Brown (via skype, email, and telephone) and research staff in Nigeria. Dr Achebe made site visits to Nigeria to verify and collate field results. Transcription of audio recordings was accomplished by linguists in Nigeria familiar with the Composite Synchronic Alphabet of Igbo Dialects (CSAID) developed by the project.  Website: A fully-functional Igbo project website is now available through the EAGER grant: http://igbo.movert.co.ke/. Web interfaces for dictionary definition and dictionary search such as the Document Upload Interface.  Igbo dictionary: The goals of the EAGER grant have been greatly advanced through the development of the first-ever Dictionary of Igbo Cognates, This effort has been implemented both as an important linguistic activity in its own right and also to provide testing data for the broader computational research experiments of Prof. Charniak and his CS students at Brown  A second, and smaller effort was to use the existing corpus for some initial computational projects.  In particular Eugene Charniak and Ike Achebe jointly taught a graduate computer science research seminar which had as its goal programs to automatically identify cognates based upon the corpus data.  The basic was to leverage information about (a) word spelling, (b) area where used, and (c) use in continuous text to suggest cognates.  This information was combined using distant-dependent Chinese-restaurant processes.   An initial program suggested about twenty cognates of which about 3 were clear mistakes (mostly artifacts of the data entry protocol), but the rest were plausible enough that Dr. Achebe could not rule them out on the basis of his knowledge of the dialects in question.
