<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1236596 &lt;br/&gt;Zuo, Yi  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the Environmental Health and Safety of Nanotechnology program supports work by Professor Yi Zuo to study the interaction mechanism between nanomaterials and pulmonary surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is a detergent-like phospholipid-protein mixture that covers the entire internal surface of the respiratory tract. It plays an important role in surface tension reduction and host defense. Inhaled nanomaterials must first interact with this surfactant film before contacting lung cells and translocating to other organs. Therefore, interactions between nanomaterials and pulmonary surfactant represent the initial bio-nano interaction in the lungs. However, the interaction mechanism is still largely unknown. The research goal of this proposal is to study biophysicochemical interactions between natural pulmonary surfactants and engineered nanomaterials, thus characterizing the potential adverse health effect of inhaled nanomaterials on the respiratory system. This work is important to the general public because it will provide new data that complement the current nanotoxicological knowledge obtained from cell culture and animal-models, thus advancing current understanding of nanosafety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:For the first time, the project team will systematically study biophysical and biochemical interactions between different nanomaterials (including carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoplatelets, and metal oxide nanoparticles) and pulmonary surfactants. This research will provide a novel insight into the interaction potential between surfactant phospholipids/proteins and carbon-based nanomaterials with unique aspect ratios/shapes. In addition, the project team will develop a novel in vitro model that mimics bio-nano interactions in the lungs, for studying the environmental, health and safety (EHS) impacts of airborne nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The interaction mechanism between nanomaterials and pulmonary surfactants has a translational value for nanomedicine-based pulmonary drug delivery and for pathophysiological study of respiratory diseases related to air pollution and particulate matters. Given the unique location of the University of Hawaii, the proposed work will promote participation of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and students from other underrepresented groups. The PI will develop new undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula with interdisciplinary components, and help enhance the infrastructure for research and education. With local and international collaborations, the PI will disseminate the research to increase public awareness of nanotechnology and its potential EHS impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With the rapid development of nanotechnology and a widespread proliferation of nano-enabled consumer products, there is an increasing concern of the potential adverse environmental, health, and safety (EHS) impacts of nanomaterials (NMs), which feature a size less than 100 nm in at least one dimension. Because NMs are lightweight and easily airborne, particle inhalation has become a real and serious risk for humans exposed to industrial NMs or consumer products that contain engineered NMs. Due to their small size, inhaled NMs can reach the deep lung region at which the NMs must first interact with the pulmonary surfactant (PS) film of the lungs (see Image 1). The PS film is a multilayered lipid-protein complex that covers the entire air-water interface of the lungs. It plays an important role in host defense and maintaining the large surface area of the lungs by reducing surface tensions. Interactions with the PS film determine the subsequent clearance, retention, and translocation of the inhaled NMs, and hence their potential toxicity. Therefore, studying interactions between NMs and PS is expected to not only significantly enhance current understanding of the EHS impacts of nanotechnology, but also help provide a useful metric for regulating and overseeing commercial applications of nanotechnology towards a safer and sustainable development.</p> <p class="Yi-Thesis-Heading-2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit:</span><strong> </strong>The goal of this research is to systematically study biophysicochemical interactions between natural PS and engineered NMs, thus characterizing the potential adverse health effect of inhaled NMs on the respiratory system. The natural PS we used for this study was bovine PS extracted from calf's lungs, which is similar to human PS in both chemical compositions and biophysical properties. We have successfully achieved our research goal by completing two innovative objectives in parallel.</p> <p>First, we have developed a novel experimental methodology to simulate the nano-bio interactions at the air-water interface of the lungs. As shown in Image 2, all existing experimental methods failed to simulate nano-bio interactions in the lungs, thus introducing significant artifacts and inaccuracy. To overcome shortcomings of the existing methods, we have developed a novel instrument called the constrained drop surfactometer (CDS, see Image 3 for schematic). We showed that the CDS is capable of mimicking the biophysics of nano-bio interactions in the lungs. Using the CDS, we have determined the no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNM) at which the airborne CNM start damaging the normal physiological function of PS (see Image 4). The NOAEL of CNM determined by the CDS is found to be comparable to those defined by the international occupational exposure limits (OELs). Therefore, the CDS has the potential to become a transformative tool for quantifying the toxicity of airborne NMs for the study of occupational safety.</p> <p class="Yi-Thesis-Heading-2">Second, we have developed the first combined experimental and computational model for studying interactions between PS and NMs of various physicochemical properties. We have developed the first comprehensive molecular dynamics (MD) model to simulate natural PS, and validated this computational model with experimental methods (see Image 5). With this combined experimental and computational method, we have showed how hydrophobicity and surface charge of NMs differentially regulate the translocation and interaction with the PS film. For the first time, we provided the molecular evidence for the so-called PS biomolecular corona on NMs (see Image 6).

Moreover, the biophysicochemical mechanism of NM-PS interaction revealed by this project has a clear translational value for nanomedicine-based pulmonary drug delivery and for pathophysiological study of respiratory diseases related to air pollution and particulate matters. Most importantly, this project has made a significant impact on technology transfer. To date, the technique developed in this project, i.e., the constrained drop surfactometer (CDS), has become a transformative tool to probe toxicity of nano-enabled produces.
