<AbstractNarration>CBET-1250171&lt;br/&gt;PI: Peyman Givi, Univ. of Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for developments of (1) a robust computational method for petascale simulation&lt;br/&gt;of turbulent combustion, (2) a scalable data management system for such simulations and (3) a systematic&lt;br/&gt;visual analysis of the generated data. The computational method will be based on the filtered density function&lt;br/&gt;(FDF) methodology for large eddy simulation (LES) of complex turbulent flames. The simulation will&lt;br/&gt;be based on a new algorithm, termed ?irregularly portioned Lagrangian Monte Carlo-Finite Difference?&lt;br/&gt;(IPLMCFD) which facilitate FDF simulations on massively parallel, up to petascale platforms. Data management&lt;br/&gt;will be provided by addressing research challenges in management of annotations, management&lt;br/&gt;of workflows and data archiving. Effective data visualization and analysis will be conducted through a&lt;br/&gt;machine learning ?feature-extraction? approach. This work crosses the disciplines of engineering and computer&lt;br/&gt;science and expands the state-of-the-art in high fidelity predictions of turbulent reacting flows. At the&lt;br/&gt;conclusion of the work, an open source LES code will be provided for use by the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will have a significant impact in combustion, both in gas-turbine&lt;br/&gt;industry and in government. It is firmly believed that LES will constitute the primary means of predictions&lt;br/&gt;for future design and manufacturing of combustion systems. Having it coupled with robust and versatile data&lt;br/&gt;management and visualization capabilities will be useful for both basic and applied research purposes. Some&lt;br/&gt;of the other broader impacts are through involvement of undergraduate students in research and attracting&lt;br/&gt;them to graduate school, K-12 outreach, involvement of high school students in research, and recruitment&lt;br/&gt;of students from minority and under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project brought together experts in turbulent combustion simulation, data management, and data visualization to address the scale challenges of modern combustion flow simulations. Towards this the team considered (a) the modeling point of view (i.e., how to make the existing models scale better), (b) the systems point of view (i.e., how to make the computation more efficient), and (c) the human point of view (i.e., how to make the results more understandable). This project has had a significant impact on the training of the next generation of engineers and computer scientists. It has involved eight graduate students (including three members of underrepresented groups) and five undergraduate students (including two members of underrepresented groups). In particular, one of the students' work was published at the Tapia conference. This work was instrumental in helping the minority student secure two research fellowships, one from the Computing Research Association and one from the Tapia conference. We have demonstrated results from this project in multiple K-12 open houses and outreach events (5-10 per year). This project has created abstractions and hybrid algorithms to address scalability challenges in the visualization of high-density, petascale engineering tensor fields. This research impacts turbulent combustion design and simulation, both in gas-turbine industry and in research. The resulting models and simulations pave the way to efficient energy consumption and pollution control. Some of the technical contributions of this project are: Development of a new computational methodology for turbulent combustion simulation, termed irregularly portioned Lagrangian Monte Carlo/finite difference" (IPLMCFD), that can scale to thousands of processors. Investigating the use of general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) for parallel database processing in conjunction with multicore central processing units (CPUs). Dynamic load balancing via graph partitioning and repartitioning techniques that consider the heterogeneity of the underlying hardware (including the network infrastructure). Design of scalable visual abstractions and algorithms for identifying, tracking, and mining regions of interest in turbulent combustion tensor data. These abstractions and algorithms have been implemented in a visual prototype tool Development of a prototype virtual reality visualization of turbulent combustion data using UIC's Electronic Visualization Lab cutting-edge CAVE2 immersive environment.
