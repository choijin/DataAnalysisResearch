<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to the ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2012) and associated workshops. The conference is being held in Copenhagen, Denmark.  ICFP is the premier conference on all topics related to functional and higher-order programming.  Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.  Broader impacts include building the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce.</AbstractNarration>
