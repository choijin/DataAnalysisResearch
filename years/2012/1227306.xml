<AbstractNarration>Concern for others may play a significant role in decision making. This research examines cross-national differences in the role that concern for others plays in vaccination decisions using surveys and psychological experiments. The research also examines the influence of this concern on predicted cross-national influenza vaccination rates through mathematical modeling. This interdisciplinary research integrates concepts, tools, and objectives from economics, psychology, mathematics, and epidemiology. The research involves an age-structured mathematical model of infectious-disease transmission. The model uses game theory to incorporate age-dependent vaccination decisions and statistical methods to estimate the probability that individuals will choose to vaccinate against influenza, based on responses to survey items on concern for others and perceptions of infection risk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on the USA, Japan, France, and China, this research assesses how contact patterns and influenza vaccination decision making vary across cultures and how they can inform nation-specific strategies to promote vaccination. The interface of biological systems, indivduals' decision making, and social and cultural influences illuminates the dynamic interplay between an infectious disease and social decision making. The research is likely to discover novel ways to increase vaccination coverage against influenza, as well as other diseases, by understanding pro-social tendencies.</AbstractNarration>

Previous research has focused on how self-interested concerns motivate vaccination, and it is not clear whether pro-social motives influence flu vaccination. The current research tested whether describing victims of flu-related illnesses can activate pro-social motives, and in turn, promote flu vaccination intentions.  In an experimental study, we described potential flu victims who would suffer from other peopleÆs lack of vaccination to Internet participants, and measured sympathy, general pro-sociality, and flu vaccination intentions. The study included two identifiable victim conditions (one with an old victim and one with a young victim), an unidentified victim condition, and a no message condition.    We found that any of the three messages increased flu vaccination intentions. The messages had their effect on vaccination intentions by increasing pro-social motives. Identifiable victims also tended to increase vaccination intentions among people who had not vaccinated in the past. In addition, describing identifiable victims in the message increased sympathy, which in turn increased pro-social motives.  These findings provide direct experimental evidence on the role of pro-social motives in flu vaccination, by showing that people can and will be prompted to vaccinate for the sake of benefiting others.
