<AbstractNarration>Masmoudi&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1211806&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This project is concerned with the study of problems coming from fluid mechanics, gas dynamics, and plasma physics.  The principal investigator with his collaborators P. Germain and J. Shatah develops the method of space-time resonances, which combines the standard notion of resonances with the study of the spatial localization of solutions.  One application of the method is the global existence and scattering for water waves and for capillary waves.  He studies asymptotic problems in fluid mechanics, especially those giving rise to boundary layers: zero viscosity limit and compressible-incompressible limit in the presence of a free boundary, and the hydrodynamic limit of the Boltzmann equation in a bounded domain.  Understanding the properties of the boundary layer is important in many applications.  He investigates the homogenization of elliptic operators in the presence of oscillating boundary data.  He also studies global existence of weak solutions for some non-Newtonian fluids (viscoelastic) and especially polymeric liquids.  These systems require a coupling between a fluid equation and the Fokker-Planck equation for the polymers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator studies the behavior of complicated systems with different boundary conditions and in different limiting cases.  These studies provide an improved understanding of the real physical phenomena taking place and of the domain of validity of each simplifying model.  This is important for engineers and physicists who look for the simplest model that captures the phenomena, to implement numerically or to apply in real life.  For instance, water waves problems are important to understand tsunamis and rogue waves.  Moreover, the study of viscoelastic fluids and especially polymeric liquids (egg white, blood, or dough for example) is important in many industrial applications such as food processing and is of great interest in many branches of applied physics, chemistry, and biology.  This project includes the training of graduate students in mathematics and physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many fundamental problems in  Fluid Mechanics and Plasma Physics were solved. These problems are related to long time dynamics of fluid equations   such as  the incompressible  Euler  and the incompressible Navier-Stokes systems  and  kinetic equations such as   the Vlasov-Poisson system.                  With  Pierre Germain and Jalal Shatah, we developed a new method   to understand  the  long time dynamic of dispersive equations.   The space-time resonance method consists in identifying resonances   in the system  which are usually the cause of  instabilities.         With Jacob Bedrossian,  we proved the inviscid damping for the 2D Euler   equation.  This result explains the transition between stabilty of simple   flows and their instability,  namely their transition to turbulence.      With Jacob Bedrossian and  Vlad Vicol,  we extended this  result to the   Navier-Stokes system by studying  the effect of the viscosity.      With Jacob Bedrossian and  Pierre Germain,  we extended this  result to the   3D  Navier-Stokes system by studying  the lift up effect and the   formation of streaks  which are  three dimensional effects.      With Rousset, we studied the inviscid limit of the free boundary   Navier-Stokes.  In a previous result also  with Rousset we proved  the convergence of solutions to the      Navier-Stokes system with Navier boundary condition (in a fixed domain) towards a solution to the Euler system when the viscosity goes to zero. The novelty of these  works  is that we are able to prove uniform bounds   in conormal Sobolev spaces without constructing a boundary layer.          With David Gerard-Varet,  we proved  local well-posedness  in Gevrey spaces for the  Prandtl system.  The main novelty here is that  the result holds  without analiticity assumption and without  monotonicity.   Also with  Tak Kwong  Wong,  we proved gave a  new proof of well-posedness   in Sobolev spaces when the profile is increasing.      With Hans Knupfer, we studied the  well-posedness and lubrication approximation of the Darcy law which describes  the spreading of a drop on a surface.         With  Diogo Ars&eacute;nio   and  Slim Ibrahim, we gave a rigorous derivation of   the magnetohydrodynamic system from  the Navier-Stokes-Maxwell system   when the  speed of light goes to infinity.      With Juhi Jang, we proved the local well-posedness of the       compressible Euler equations with physical vacuum in three dimensions.   The result is based on the  use of   Lagrangian coordinates and  the study of  a degenerate acoustic system. Similar results where  obtained by Coutand and Schkoller.             With David Gerard-Varet, we were able to characterize the homogenized   boundary data   in the homogenization of oscillating Dirichlet  bounary conditions. These was an important open problem introduced in the 80s.                     All these results have important applications  from physical point of view  and help improve our understanding of the behavior of solutions to  these   systems.
