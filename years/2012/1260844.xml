<AbstractNarration>Elevated cognition, related to the dramatic increase in brain volume, is a hallmark of the primates. Cognition is directly related to the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex and the connectivity network underlying information processing in the brain. Increased cortical folding (gyrification) allows for more neurons to be contained within the volume of the braincase and the arrangement of folds and ridges across the cerebral cortex is an indication of the underlying neural network connecting regions. This dissertation project by Elizabeth Atkinson (Washington University), under the supervision of Dr. James Cheverud, uses a pedigreed baboon population to assess the genetic basis and structure of cortical folding in primates. It then further investigates the genomic regions identified in baboons to determine the role of natural selection in altering the DNA sequence of genes across the primate family tree. Questions addressed include: Is the organizational structure of the cerebral cortex modular? Are brain regions that develop together in utero or work together throughout an organism's life also inherited together? How susceptible to developmental noise is the cerebral cortex? What chromosomal regions and genes affect variation in brain function and cortical traits? Is there evidence that genes affecting cortical traits have been selectively altered at an evolutionary scale? Overall, this project addresses critical questions in human and primate brain evolution, including the genetic architecture of brain morphology, differing cognitive strategies across the primate clade, and the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for their formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to addressing issues of the genetics of brain morphology and cognition in primates, this project also will involve mentoring undergraduates and local high school students from ethnicities and socioeconomic groups typically underrepresented in the sciences, teaching evolutionary concepts at inner-city St. Louis schools, furthering the efforts of a graduate student-run program for science outreach, and disseminating the notable findings from this project to other scientists at meetings and conferences. Participating in this project will further the scientific career and curriculum vitae of an underprivileged St. Louis high school student, mentored closely over the course of the summer of 2013, who otherwise would have few opportunities to engage in scientific research at this early point in their academic development.</AbstractNarration>

Cognitive capacity, the processing power and speed of the brain, is directly related to the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex and the connectivity network underlying information processing in the brain. Increased cortical folding (gyrification) allows for more neurons to be contained within the volume of the braincase and the arrangement of folds and ridges across the cerebral cortex is an indication of the underlying neural network connecting regions. The goal of this project was to develop a better understanding of the genetic processes that influence the evolution and development of sulci and gyri in primates. Characterizing gyrificationÆs genetic basis allows for future finer examination of the source of the evolutionary changes in primate brain structure and, ultimately, function. Gyrification is a significant and relatively unexplored brain trait that bears major consequences across the fields of evolutionary biology, anthropology, genetics, and neuroscience.           Our sample population of nearly 1,000 pedigreed baboons afforded us very high statistical power, allowing us to confidently conclude that there is a significant, moderate degree of genes control over variation in brain features. Using Mantel testing and two clustering methods (k-means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering), we found similar modularity motifs between phenotype and genotype, and within three theoretical matrices spanning other biological domains (development, anatomical brain lobe location, and connectivity). These results independently validate the genetic control over brain traits, provide theoretical support for tension-based model of sulcal development over competing models, and indicate the high degree of morphological integration between phenotypic and genetic variation. The partitioning of variation directly influences the ease of future evolutionary change and this well-integrated arrangement would allow for rapid and effectual selective cortical alteration.           In examining the directional asymmetry of the two brain hemispheres, we found that the endocasts are systematically asymmetric and that there is a genetic component to this asymmetry; baboons are genetically predisposed to have asymmetrical brains. Tests of fluctuating asymmetry showed that traits are differentially susceptible to developmental noise, with sulci appearing earlier on in ontogeny being more canalized and ones appearing on later embryonic days having much more variable phenotypes. Looking at cross-hemisphere trait correlations, we determined that developmental pathways for sulci do not span the midline of the brain, but instead are restricted within each of the two hemispheres. We additionally find an intriguing neuroanatomical suggestion of handedness in the baboon from examining population-wide trends in frontal petalia direction, corroborating prior behavioral evidence.           QTL statistical genetic mapping analyses were conducted to connect phenotypic variation to specific portions of the baboon genome, pinpointing a handful of chromosome segments that affect gyrification. The QTL peaks of highest interest contain compelling candidate genes that have already been implicated in influencing brain development and function. The distribution of peaks elucidates a complex pattern of genetic control over brain traits, with indications of both pleiotropy and polygeny. Fine-mapping is currently underway, which will allow us to validate positional candidate genes and independently associate specific SNPs with variation in brain features.              All in all, this project answered fundamental questions about the genetic architecture of brain cortical gyrification, a trait that has important implications for the evolution of neural networks in both human and non-human primates. It provides a framework of the genetic basis of ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
