<AbstractNarration>A team from Michigan State University, in partnership with six science, art-science, and art museum venues around the country and with the assistance of researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology, is implementing an EAGER project to conduct ongoing experiments on the chemical precursors to life as exhibit experiences for visitors to these venues.  The experiments, to be run over the course of several months as the exhibit travels around the country, expand on the 1950s' work of Stanley Miller and Harold Urey, which continues to stimulate new investigations and publications, including experiments being conducted on the International Space Station.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The experiments/exhibits share key features across the three different kinds of venues, allowing the team to study and compare the impacts on the various publics of engaging them in real-time science experiments.  Two major goals are (1) to explore new ways to attract public interest in science by performing in public settings previously untried experiments on the chemical precursors to life, and (2) to investigate how the context of different kinds of venues and their visitor characteristics affect how visitors interpret the experience and what they learn.  The team is also exploring how various data visualization representations can be designed to foster public interest and understanding.  The intent is to develop an approach that has potential applications to other STEM content domains and expanding the reach to broader public audiences.</AbstractNarration>

GOAL 2) To explore more specifically whether presenting science in an art venues attracts people who would otherwise not seek out informal science education experiences.   GOAL 3) To explore the problems associated with data transformation as a means to communicate experimental results to both scientific and non-scientific (especially artistic) audiences.  MEANS: Achieving our goals required us to create an experimental device capable of performing a wide range of novel experiments that could function as a scientific apparatus in a science museum and also as an art piece when exhibited in an art venue. Our solution was to re-create a famous 1953 experiment by Stanley Miller by transforming it into a "sculpture and performance piece" and running novel experiments with it. Part of this "performance" involved training staff or volunteers at each venue to take daily samples and do simple experiments that would enlighten visitors as to the scientific processes taking place both inside the apparatus and between the apparatus and the scientist. Data from these sampling procedures, as well as the samples themselves, were to be sent regularly (daily or weekly) to the project investigators for transformation into visual images of high aesthetic value to communicate with non-scientific audiences such as artists.

The aestheticization and sensualization of the apparatus was also an important component of the success. In response to the question, "What attracted you to the exhibit", many visitors to the exhibit responded with comments such as, "the sparks"; " the electrical strikes: awesome!"; "the sound"; "the glass"; "interesting visually"; "looked very cool".  Overall, 49% of those surveyed reported that they would like to see more exhibits featuring "live" experimentation. Moreover, 26% of those surveyed were repeat visitors to the exhibit. Clearly the idea that an exhibit can change or yield new and different results from one time to another is sufficient attraction for many visitors to revisit a venue.  GOAL 2 OUTCOMES: Our second goal was to determine whether presenting science in art venues attracts people who would otherwise not seek out an informal science experience. We also achieved this goal. The populations visiting the arts venues were very different from those visiting the science venues. People visiting arts venues are far more likely to be artists (38% of visitors) than are those people who visit science venues (4% artists) and the people visiting arts venues are far more likely to frequent such venues (an average of 5 visits per year) than they are to visit a science center (an average of less than one visit per year). Arts venues are therefore excellent locations for doing informal science outreach to ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
