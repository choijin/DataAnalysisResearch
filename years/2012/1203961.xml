<AbstractNarration>This project will continue earlier studies by the principal investigator on the existence and compactness of solutions to a fully nonlinear version of the Yamabe problem. Such equations have been studied extensively. The project will have a special focus on compactness issues related to the aforementioned problem. The clarification of these issues is needed for further progress to be made on it. The research should lead to a better understanding of nonlinear elliptic, but not necessarily uniformly elliptic, partial differential equations, as well as of nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations.  The principal investigator will also study elliptic systems that arise in the modeling of composite materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial differential equations arise naturally in physics, engineering, geometry, and many other fields, and they form the basis for modeling many phenomena in the physical world. The particular class of "fully nonlinear elliptic" equations is especially important from this perspective. For instance, such equations turn up in the study of composite materials. This project will contribute to a basic understanding of fully nonlinear elliptic equations, thereby providing scientists and engineers with sharpened insight into various physical processes and ultimately enhancing the quality of, say, consumer products manufactured from composites. As part of the project,  the principal investigator will train Ph.D. students, many of whom are expected to continue their careers as educators. They, in turn, will convey to even younger generations both their mathematical knowledge and the long-term value of mathematical research not only to science and engineering but also, in the end, to society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Partial differential equations arise naturally in physics, engineering,  geometry, and many other fields, and they form the basis for modeling  many phenomena in the physical world.  The particular class of "nonlinear elliptic equations'' is especially important from this perspective.  For instance, such equations turn up in the study of composite materials.  They also turn up in the study of conformal geometry.     Our completed research work under the support of this project contributes  to a basic understanding of  nonlinear elliptic equations, thereby providing scientists and engineers with sharpened insight into various physical processes and ultimately enhancing the quality of, say, consumer products manufactured from composites.     In our work on conformally invariant fully nonlinear elliptic equations, we have  developed methods and techniques of depth and of wide applicability.  For instance, after establishing  general Liouville type theorems for solutions on the  entire Euclidean space and axisymmetry results for solutions on a punctured Euclidean space, we have introduced a method in establishing gradient estimates of solutions of conformally invariant  equations, either elliptic or degenerate elliptic, through a blow-up novel technique and an application  of the above mentioned Liouville type theorems.  The above mentioned result on axisymmetry of solutions to conformally invariant nonlinear equations on punctured spaces has also played a crucial role in our recent work  on Harnack inequalities and Bocher-type theorems for conformally invariant fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations and on compactness of solutions for a fully nonlinear Yamabe problem under a lower Ricci curvature bound.  We have also obtained fine analysis of blow up solutions of conformally invariant elliptic equation in Euclidean domains.  Our work in partial differential equations from composite material has led to deeper understanding in the study of systems of elasticity.  In our work on partial differential equations  from composite material, we have obtained optimal estimates of the strain tensors when fibers in fiber enforced materials become very close.     I have given  topics course on partial differential equations  to help graduate students and postdocs in their research. I co-organize the Nonlinear Analysis Seminar at Rutgers, and co-organize a Joint Princeton-Rutgers Seminar on Geometric PDEs.  I believe that the  seminars have helped students and postdocs  to find  research problems and to be exposed to mathematics of importance.   I have worked closely with graduate students so that students can be trained effectively.          Last Modified: 07/19/2016       Submitted by: Yanyan Li]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
