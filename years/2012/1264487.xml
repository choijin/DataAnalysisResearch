<AbstractNarration>PI: Lau, Kenneth K.S.&lt;br/&gt;Institutions: Drexel University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1264487&lt;br/&gt;Title: Synthesis and Processing of Electroactive Polymers in Nanostructured Energy Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy storage is a key component in the energy conservation equation, especially when considering&lt;br/&gt;sustainable energies like solar and wind, which are more variable and intermittent in nature depending on&lt;br/&gt;the time of day, season of the year, and geographical location. Similarly, the ability to store energy and&lt;br/&gt;use it when demanded will provide a more seamless operation of electric vehicles whether during&lt;br/&gt;acceleration/deceleration or in cruise mode. Among different energy storage technologies, supercapacitors&lt;br/&gt;or electrochemical capacitors are emerging as an attractive option for delivering much higher power (rate&lt;br/&gt;of energy transfer) than alternative options like the lithium ion battery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supercapacitors that store charge through electrochemical double layers possess higher power density but&lt;br/&gt;lack sufficient energy density. By incorporating electroactive polymers, which undergo relatively fast&lt;br/&gt;redox reactions, further pseudocapacitance can be added to enhance energy density. However, as the&lt;br/&gt;supercapacitor electrodes are typically highly porous nanostructures, there remains significant synthesis&lt;br/&gt;and processing challenges in adding the electroactive polymers onto the surfaces of pores inside these&lt;br/&gt;nanostructures without sacrificing surface area or pore access. The PI plans an oxidative&lt;br/&gt;chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) approach that will address many of the challenges by enabling the&lt;br/&gt;conformal, uniform growth of thin films of electroactive polymers inside porous nanostructured materials.&lt;br/&gt;The central hypothesis is that the liquid-free, vapor-to-solid polymerization reactions will lead to surface&lt;br/&gt;confined polymer growth and ultrathin films that do not significantly alter the underlying pore structure&lt;br/&gt;while adding appreciable pseudocapacitance. This work will involve (1) synthesis of&lt;br/&gt;electroactive polymer thin films in porous nanostructures, (2) understanding the effect of processing on&lt;br/&gt;polymer structure and properties, and (3) assembly and electrochemical analysis of pseudocapacitors that&lt;br/&gt;make use of oCVD to incorporate the electroactive polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is expected to deliver enhanced supercapacitors with significantly&lt;br/&gt;higher specific capacitance, energy density, power density and cycle stability, making them viable for use&lt;br/&gt;in electric and hybrid vehicles as well as in the development of greener energy systems that include solar&lt;br/&gt;cells and fuel cells. Fundamentally, the work is expected to provide an effective synthesis and&lt;br/&gt;processing methodology for conformally coating porous nanostructures that will have broader utility in&lt;br/&gt;other nanoscale devices, including electronics, sensors, solar cells, fuel cells, transistors and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Integrated with the research is an education program, which aims to train graduate and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students as well as to engage high school students in polymers for energy. Minority and underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;students will be actively recruited to participate in the project. In addition, outreach will be&lt;br/&gt;made to schools in Philadelphia and inner city Camden, NJ to promote STEM involvement and learning&lt;br/&gt;early on.</AbstractNarration>
