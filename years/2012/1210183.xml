<AbstractNarration>This action funds James Sidney Fishelson of Utah State University to conduct a research project, entitled "Evaluating the potential for self-driving, electrified bus systems," during the summer of 2012 at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea. The host scientist is Dr. Suh In-Soo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to examine the potential benefits of automated bus rapid transit (ABRT), showing how it could offer superior service at lower costs over existing transit systems and private vehicles. Most basically, this research models and quantifies the performance of different levels and types of automation of the buses on a BRT line, ranging from automated docking at the bus stations to full-network control of a driverless system. Additionally, it models the effects of including induction power transfer (IPT); ABRT generally assumes that buses will be powered electrically via IPT, whereby power is wirelessly "beamed" from pads in the road to the vehicle itself, which has a small, on-board battery for electricity storage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
