<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the CAREER research and education program of Prof. Jill Millstone at the University of Pittsburgh. Prof. Millstone and her students will develop surface-chemistry driven methods for preparing a broad range of transition and noble metal nanoparticle alloys. These alloys exhibit unique optical, magnetic, and catalytic behaviors that make them attractive for technologies ranging from near-infrared (NIR) imaging to heterogeneous catalysis. Prof. Millstone and her students will investigate the impact of particle-ligand interactions, intermolecular ligand forces, and solvent-ligand chemistry to tune both the atomic composition and atom distribution throughout the nanoparticle. The role of ligand species will be tracked by combining standard nanoparticle analysis techniques such as electron microscopy with classic molecular characterization approaches such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), where NMR allows one to simultaneously acquire detailed information about both nanoparticle surface and ligand environments. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of the proposed study will introduce a synthetic framework that bridges molecular and bulk descriptions of alloy formation and provides a straightforward, sustainable route to a previously inaccessible class of homogeneous-alloy nanostructures. These well-defined architectures then provide promising platforms for applications ranging from fossil fuel conversion to cancer detection. The CAREER educational plans of Prof. Millstone focus on the development of a Wikipedia-style website devoted to nanochemistry. This website will act as a "living" resource for a broad community of students and faculty who are interested in learning, teaching, or performing nanomaterial synthesis but who have limited access to the expertise necessary to begin their involvement productively.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Alloyed materials are important at all length scales. Our work aimed to understand how to create nanoscale analogs of these historically critical materials, and specifically how to overcome key, size-dependent chemical challenges. Overall, the scientific objectives of the proposed work have been met, and produced results in three key areas: understanding the formation and manipulation nanoscale alloys, how nanoparticle ligand chemistry can be used to mediate that formation, and finally how nanoparticle surface chemistry can tune the optoelectronic and chemical reactivity properties of the particles once formed.  Specific key results are:  1)    Demonstrated that molecular complexes forming prior to nanoparticle formation have a significant impact on final particle architecture. These results indicate that if one can control these "pre-nucleation" complexes, one may be able to direct specific atoms to selected regions within a forming particle - an important step to the holy grail of nanoparticle synthesis: atom-level control of nanoparticle architectures.  2)    Demonstrated that small changes in nanoparticle surface chemistry can dramatically change their luminescence behavior, indicating that this rich chemistry can be used as a sensitive and highly versatile tool in controlling the electronic properties of small nanoparticles.  3)    Established quantitative analytical protocols to study small molecule chemistry of nanoparticle surfaces with implications for controlling particle formation, application in biological systems, and life cycle outcomes.  4)    Demonstrated efficient energy transfer from particle to pendant ligands. This transfer process indicates that the new optoelectronic features observed during the course of this work, can be used in energy transfer applications such as light-driven catalysis and solar energy harvesting.  This project has led to 21 peer-reviewed publications in high visibility journals, with more manuscripts submitted or in preparation.
