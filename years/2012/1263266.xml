<AbstractNarration>This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.  The Robotics and Intelligent Systems REU site provides high-quality robotics summer undergraduate research experiences, robust student-development programming, and provides gateways to graduate studies and career opportunities in robotics.  Robotics technology is crucial to the national interest, both in terms of economic success and national security.  Robotics is making critical contributions to advanced manufacturing, logistics, services, transportation, homeland security, defense, medicine, healthcare, space exploration, environmental monitoring, and agriculture.  These developments place robotics at the forefront of the nation's interests.  Further, robotics plays a vital role in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education due to its multi-disciplinary nature, enveloping many different fields from computer science to psychology, as well as its unique ability to combine science and engineering with creative thinking in a hands-on, research-oriented environment.  The sciences that comprise robotics provide a unique opportunity to immerse students in interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Robotics and Intelligent Systems REU site immerses a highly motivated and diverse cohort of students in a guided research process that enables them to experience the thrill of discovery and to adopt the role of scientist as one which is authentically theirs.  The site inspires REU students to pursue careers in robotics and related fields and equip them with the skills and new knowledge to seize industry and graduate school opportunities.  It extends access to high-quality robotics summer undergraduate research experiences that challenge students by the interdisciplinary nature of robotics, and the complexity of the research.  All student projects are designed to fit into larger efforts with real impact in critical societal challenges such as quality of life, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, climate science, etc.  Research results will be shared widely through poster sessions, public presentations, and web based resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site web site (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~summerscholar) provides additional information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CMU RISS REU Site Provided Transformative Experiences  The RISS REU experience was built by dedicated faculty, staff, students, RISS alumni, and others with a vision and mission to help foster the next generation of robotics talent. The NSF REU Site funding enabled a group of diverse scholars to work with leading scientists in the field.  RISS aimed to:  Equip scholars with essential skills and knowledge to successfully pursue graduate school and careers in robotics Provide professional development workshops, coaching, and platforms (peer-reviewed journal, poster session, and research showcase with technical talks) to practice communicating scientific results to multiple audiences Build an understanding of scientific research methods through a mentored research experience that engages multiple members of the RI community and is enhanced by a research philosophy seminar. Help scholars build professional and personal connections with a network of leading roboticists through activities in the lab, classroom, and the Pittsburgh community.   RISS core research areas have included:  Intelligence: core AI technologies, motion planning, control theory, planning under uncertainty, POMDPS, game theory, data mining, and machine learning Perception: computer vision, stereo processing, understanding ladar and 3D sensing, state-estimation, and pattern recognition Action: work mechanisms, actuators, their design and control      Participating CMU Robotics Institute research centers included:  Field Robotics Center Center for Integrated Manufacturing Decision Systems  Center for the Foundation for Robotics Vision and Autonomous Systems Center Medical Robotics Technology Center      RISS professional development prepared scholars for the next stages of their academic and professional career. The professional development aimed to equip scholars with the essential skills needed to conduct research and actively participate in scientific scholarship. The professional development component was informed by student and career development research and created in concert with leading roboticists with domain knowledge and student affairs? professionals, who have deep expertise in competency-based models and broadening participation programs. The professional development offerings were reviewed annually to assess impact and efficacy on student learning outcomes. Data was collected via mentor and alumni interviews and scholar pre-and post-learning assessments to create intentional programming that prepares scholars for graduate school and STEM careers.     The RISS professional development component comprised six distinct areas:  Exposure to the field of robotics, Graduate school application counseling, Communicating scientific results,  Research philosophy and methods,  Networking and community building, and Educational outreach and broader impact.      Over 35 members of the RI community help to facilitate and deliver the RISS professional development curriculum.
