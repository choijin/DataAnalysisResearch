<AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;In land plants, many cellular and developmental processes necessitate the perception of mechanical stimuli such as touch, gravity, or osmotic pressure. One way in which mechanoperception is accomplished is through the activation of mechanosensitive channels, which allow ions to pass across a membrane in response to membrane stretch. This project aims to use the model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the role played by established mechanosensitive channels during the process of fertilization and to determine how their activity is regulated. In addition, new plant mechanosensitive channels will be identified for future functional and comparative studies. This research will reveal the molecular mechanisms by which plants sense and respond to mechanical stimuli, provide insight into the evolution of mechanosensitive channels, and establish principles of mechanobiology that apply to other systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;An inquiry-based laboratory class in ion channel physiology and two uniquely designed summer undergraduate research/outreach experiences will be developed, giving undergraduates an authentic research experience while contributing to the research goals of this project. Other activities will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups and enhance scientific understanding through the established outreach efforts surrounding the St. Louis Science Center's new ozone garden and Earth Day celebration. A running theme through all these activities is training in effective science communication. In addition, this research will benefit society by addressing the mechanisms by which plant growth, development, fertility, health, and response to stress. The research will have implications to address food security issues.</AbstractNarration>
