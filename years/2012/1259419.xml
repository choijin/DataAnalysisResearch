<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential technologies enabled by advanced fiber materials are countless, ranging from better body armor to artificial neurons to instantaneously drying raincoats. Electro-optical and electro-mechanical responses of the filamentous materials offer flexible and wearable displays and hold the promise for an entirely new class of artificial muscles and/or strain sensors. The goal of this project is to incorporate two important functionalities into fibers: electro-optics and electro-mechanical couplings. This will be achieved by three different approaches. (i) Incorporate liquid crystals and functional nanoparticles in electrospun polymer fibers in coaxial and tri-axial configurations; (ii) Draw stable free-standing fluid fibers from low molecular weight bent-core liquid crystals and study their mechanical and optical properties; (iii) Study both electrospun and self assembling liquid crystal polymer fibers in their pure form, with functional nanoparticles and in UV-induced cross-linked elastomer forms.  Students will learn about coaxial and double coaxial electrospinning techniques, optical wave-guiding, nanoparticle preparations, and polymerization processes. They will acquire various characterization methods, such as polarizing optical microscopy, Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy and high-speed camera photography.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Our body is soft, stretchable and curved, but the present electronics are rigid, heavy and breakable. Making electronics flexible, stretchable, lightweight, rugged and wearable is an emerging and transformative direction for research. In this three years project 24 US students will work either in Suwon, South Korea or Magdeburg, Germany to combine liquid crystals and polymers to make responsive smart fibers. During their work abroad the students will learn cutting edge new technologies involving sophisticated experimental techniques probing fiber properties, such as stability, strength, flexibility, optical and mechanical sensitivity to electric fields. The students will also learn how to collaborate at international scientific level, will appreciate the culture of foreign countries, and will represent the greatest features of the American culture abroad.  This way we will educate global scientists, who will be able to compete in the international science market.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Liquid crystals are known for their electro-optical response used in most of today?s flat panel displays. In those displays, liquid crystals are bounded by flat surfaces.   The main objective of the IRES "Responsive Fibers" Summer Research Projects and follow up activities was to study responsiveness of liquid crystals in non-conventional (not in flat films) geometries. In all these geometries the liquid crystal interfaces are curved, either in filament forms (cylindrical geometry) or with spherical boundaries.  The filament forms can either be achieved by electrospinning and jet blowing, where the cylindrical liquid crystal is surrounded by polymer sheets, or they can be drawn mechanically using a special bent-core liquid crystal phase in which the material spontaneously self-assembles to filament form and remains stable even without protective polymer sheets.  Liquid crystals with spherical boundaries can be formed either by blowing bubbles from smectic liquid crystals, in form of drops placed on a flat surface, and at an aqueous interface, when a large number of lipids are added to the water or other hydrophilic liquid, such as glycerol.  Between Summer 2013 and 2017, 20 US students (among them 10 females and 3 underrepresented minorities) participated in the projects. They have learned how to prepare liquid crystals with curved surfaces and characterize their static and dynamic properties. Some of the students continued their projects even after their return from their internships, completed more experiments, analyzed the data and prepared the first drafts of the paper (so far 4 papers have published and 2 are in progress). Our students have interacted with foreign students and professors in South Korea, Luxembourg, Germany, and Hungary and made lifelong connections. They have learned about interesting cultures, new ways of thinking and communicating.  The majority of our students came from Kent State (11) and Cornell (5) others came from the University of Buffalo, University of Chicago, University of Arizona and Xavier University.
