<AbstractNarration>The proposed research provides innovative methodology for the statistical inference for functional data with a focus on functional regressions and functional time series. The investigators will thereby extend the range of functional data analysis beyond the currently available models. This is relevant because the proposed models arise in a natural way in a number of applications such as engineering, geophysics, economics and finance. A characteristic common to many functional data applications is the presence of dependence. The theory of functional data, however, is as of today mainly focused on independent processes with notable exceptions being given by the functional autoregressive and linear processes. This proposal represents a comprehensive research plan for developing new estimation and model selection methods for different classes of functional linear and (novel) functional time series models.  It contains the following parts: (1) develop practical algorithms for partitioning a sequence of functional data into subsequences of homogeneous curves, (2) develop methods for parameter estimation for general functional autoregressive processes of known orders, (3) develop automatic methods for selecting the order of a functional autoregressive process, (4) apply model selection techniques to select best fitting models in the fully functional linear model setting, (5) construct estimation and model selection methods for the novel functional autoregressive model with exogenous covariates, and (6) develop online monitoring procedure for both functional linear and autoregressive models. This will require the development of sophisticated new statistical methodology, requiring the refinement and extension of the theory of (vector-valued) Hilbert space-valued observations. The research will also include a significant innovative computational component. To aid the dissemination of results, the investigators plan to make the relevant software freely available via the Internet. Completion of the proposal will give statisticians and practitioners new tools for analyzing different forms of functional data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in this proposal is interdisciplinary in nature, with applications in diverse fields such as engineering (floodplain management), geophysics (magnetic field readings of magnetometers), finance and economics (tick-by-tick transaction data). The research is therefore of immediate interest for practitioners and will further connect statistics and fields of science with a significant statistical component. It will also advance mathematical and computational statistics. The proposed research will produce doctoral students, among them female and minority students, theoretically and practically versed in both statistics and an area of application. The training and involvement of undergraduate students in this research is also included through regular coursework, independent study and projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Modern application of statistics or other data oriented disciplines often involve observations that are conveniently viewed as curves or functional data.  Examples include daily rainfall over a year (floodplain management) and weekly infant weight for the first three months after birth (health monitoring).  In recent years, technological advances have increased the quality and quantity of such functional data available to researchers and practitioners.  In this proposal a comprehensive research plan was executed to develop and investigate innovative methodology for the statistical inference of functional data.  The resulting work thereby extends the range of functional data analysis beyond the currently available models.  This is particularly important because the models and methods developed by this proposal arise in a natural way in a wide range of applications such as engineering, geophysics, economics and finance.  In addition, the completed research also includes a significant innovative computational component.    The completed work is expected to have the following impacts.  First, it will substantially advance our knowledge and understanding of the applicability of various functional data methods in practice, as well as foster more creative and original techniques and strategies to further the general methodological development in the field of functional data analysis.  Second, as the proposal is interdisciplinary in nature, with applications in diverse fields such as engineering (floodplain management), geophysics (magnetic field readings of magnetometers), finance and economics (tick-by-tick transaction data), the completed research is therefore of immediate interest for practitioners and will further connect statistics and fields of science with a signicant statistical component.  Also, it will advance mathematical and computational statistics.  Lastly, it provides ample training opportunities for doctoral students, theoretically and practically versed in both statistics and an area of application.
