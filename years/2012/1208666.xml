<AbstractNarration>Our understanding of the tree of life, a tree that summarizes the evolutionary relationships of living organisms, has grown rapidly in recent years. However, interpreting and analyzing large evolutionary trees has proven difficult. This project will create visual workflow software, "Arbor", to help scientists and the general public understand the growing tree of life. Arbor will be easy to use:  anyone will be able to carry out analyses by creating a specific workflow of their methods. Users will be able to easily obtain data over the internet and share their Arbor workflows with others, promoting collaborative efforts. Finally, Arbor will be easily expandable and able to grow as new methods are invented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arbor will enable "tree-thinking" to permeate scientific research, while also providing extensive educational outreach to classrooms and museums. Students and the general public benefit tremendously from a better understanding of the relationships among all species. Likewise, the visual workflows and user interfaces we develop will be freely available to the programming community, stimulating additional software development. Finally, enabling the scientific community to analyze the dynamic tree of life will enable new research across a tremendous range of fields, including medicine, public health, agriculture, ecology, and genetics.</AbstractNarration>

Each analysis is recorded as a workflow and can be reproduced by other researchers or included in publication so that others can follow the same set of analyses for their own data.  Once built, we used Arbor to understand the co-evolution of hummingbirds and Heliconia, a genus of plants with strong association with hummingbird pollinators.   We found that the position of the flower and the shape of the inflorescence strongly correlated with the specific pollinator, not with ancestry (phylogenetic signal) or with location.  We also used arbor to investigate the biogeography of Calochortus, a genus of bulbous monocots native to California and Mexico.  We found that some widespread species have variation in floral color that is correlated to their geographic location, forming a gradient that reflects shifts in pollinators across the landscape.  The ability to visualize a phylogeny and a map simultaneously, and to query trait evolution across the phylogeny using novel workflows comprised of various software packages &ndash; all part of ARBOR - made these analyses possible. We also developed ArborEd, a teaching tool for tree thinking and comparative phylogenetics.  We continue to work with two teachers, one in NY and one in CA, to implement ArborEd for classroom use.          Last Modified: 10/25/2017       Submitted by: Chelsea D Specht]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
