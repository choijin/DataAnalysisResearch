<AbstractNarration>Fostering Outstanding Cohorts in Undergraduate Science II (FOCUS II) provides a two-tier program for biology, biochemistry, chemistry, mathematics, and physics majors to promote retention at the freshman and sophomore levels and to provide targeted support for juniors and seniors.  Students participate in cohort scheduling and a mentor network including graduate students, faculty, and professionals in their field and can apply for travel support to attend professional conferences. A "Careers in Science" seminar course is offered to provide career preparation, advice on coursework, professional career skills, and academic success skills to participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this program includes utilizing proven strategies in cohort building to focus on student retention in STEM majors while also employing new approaches to increase student success. This effort provides undergraduate students with financial support, as both an incentive to do well in their coursework, but also as a means to reduce the necessity for outside jobs during the most intensive portion of their undergraduate program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impact, this program provides training to a diverse population of low-income students.   Students who participate will be well prepared to enter STEM fields or graduate programs with a strong mentor network to assist them. The program team works with an external evaluator to measure student outcomes and provide both formative and summative assessment of program activities, which will be disseminated to the science education community through conferences and publications.</AbstractNarration>

These scholarships targeted undergraduate students majoring in science or mathematics who had high financial need. Two scholarship levels were provided, with members of the sophomore cohort receiving $1,000 for one year and junior/senior cohort members receiving scholarships of $7,000 per year for up to two years. All FOCUS scholarship recepients participated in cohort-building activities including social gatherings and a careers in science monthly seminar, and received mentoring from STEM faculty members. A total of 64 individual students received scholarship support during this project, of which 61 have graduated with a STEM degree and 3 are currently continuing a STEM degree program. The FOCUS II program successfully recruited diverse cohort participants. Of those who have completed their degree by the time the project period ended, 46% are members of underrepresented groups and 52% are female. The FOCUS II project supported students to assist them in achieving timely graduation in their STEM degree. As well, this project supported a diverse group of participants in degree attainment. The diversity of the FOCUS II cohort graduates exceeds the representative diversity of the UNT student enrollment in the science and mathematics programs. Overall, the FOCUS II Scholarships provided financial support to science and mathematics students who had high financial need and assisted this diverse group of students in obtaining their STEM degrees in a timely manner. This project has succeeded in the goal of increasing the diversity of STEM graduates who will become part of the STEM workforce.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/12/2019<br>      Modified by: Lee&nbsp;E&nbsp;Hughes</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
