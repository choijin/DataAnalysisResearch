<AbstractNarration>With NSF support, the Erbil Plain Archaeological Survey (EPAS) will investigate the landscape of the core of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (ca. 900-600 BC) in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.  Evidence suggests that Assyrian kings deliberately transformed the landscape through forced migration of conquered peoples, the agricultural colonization of arable lands, and the modification of natural hydrology through dams and canals.  EPAS will evaluate this hypothesis in the heart of the Assyrian empire by means of a 3-year archaeological survey of 3,200 km2.  Despite its archaeological importance, the Assyrian heartland has never been surveyed systematically.  The initial phase will employ satellite imagery to identify archaeological sites and landscape features (e.g., canals, subterranean karez water systems, trackways).  Subsequently, these places will be visited, mapped, and surface artifacts collected.  At the same time, the project will visit canals, trackways, and carved reliefs to confirm their identifications and map them.  The project will describe the Neo-Assyrian landscape as well as earlier and subsequent patterns.&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the geographical consequences of forced migration and the power of early empires to redesign their environments, and will produce a model of an early imperial landscape.  It will test a new satellite remote sensing methodology that has yet to receive rigorous ground truthing.  Because of the fortuitous juxtaposition of new digital survey techniques, the history of research, and new political stability and desire for collaboration by Iraqis, this project has the potential to reconstruct ancient settlement and land use on a scale comparable to the great surveys of Sumer, Oaxaca, and the Valley of Mexico, but undertaken with spatial technologies unavailable to this earlier generation of projects.&lt;br/&gt;EPAS will train American and other Western graduate students in field survey, remote sensing, and spatial analysis.  It will introduce these concepts to Iraqi archaeology students, who have been particularly disadvantaged in technical and methodological training.  Field data from EPAS be a part of thesis research, conference presentation, and publication for all of these students.  EPAS will form collaborations with Iraqi museums, universities, and antiquities directorates; these institutions and their personnel are now emerging from decades of international isolation, and in some cases persecution by the former Baathist government.  The resulting inventory of sites and landscape features will be provided to Antiquities organizations at the local and national level, for incorporation into the national cultural heritage database.  Iraq, and especially the Erbil region, is developing rapidly, and such a database is critical if the nation's cultural heritage will be taken into consideration in planning decisions.  Finally, the trauma of forced migration at the hands of the state is an experience in the living memory of nearly every adult Kurd in Iraq.  By documenting the spatial impact of forced migration, ancient and modern, this project will promote the awareness of its geographic and social consequences.</AbstractNarration>

Such places are rarely settled voluntarily, and it is most likely that the sites in marginal agricultural locations were the relocated villages of deportees.&nbsp; Furthermore, the landscape was crisscrossed by dozens of monumental canals, and a huge dam was also found.&nbsp; These water features would have altered the natural drainage dramatically and must have boosted Assyrian agricultural production to support its cities and dense planned countryside.&nbsp; The settlement pattern was more complicated that expected, however, probably because while the Assyrians were the most powerful political dynasty to rule the area, they were not the first people; their planning did not entirely erase the preexisting towns and villages of the Bronze Age before them.&nbsp; The project did conclude, however, that our hypothesis was supported: the power of the Assyrian state, the world?s first unambiguous empire, was brought to bear on an extensive remodeling of the imperial core.</p> <p>During its research, EPAS developed several new methods in field archaeology.&nbsp; Our survey identified archaeological sites from declassified US intelligence <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/jasonur/u2-aerial-photography-middle-east" target="_blank">aerial (U2)</a> and satellite (<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/jasonur/pages/corona-photography-1" target="_blank">CORONA</a> and HEXAGON) programs, dating as early as the 1950s.&nbsp; We navigated to these places using GPS-equipped tablets and smart devices and recorded our findings to cloud-based services.&nbsp; These new technologies allowed the foreign teams to share data with our Kurdish Iraqi colleagues in real time.&nbsp; EPAS also developed site recording methods using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones).&nbsp; Since 2016, we have collected almost 120,000 drone photographs of over 300 archaeological sites.&nbsp; These photos enable fast and accurate maps to be made, and the project produced <a href="https://sketchfab.com/epas" target="_blank">three-dimensional models of sites</a> for both analysis and outreach to interested persons in the US, the Kurdistan Region, and globally.</p> <p>At the conclusion of this NSF-supported phase of the project, we are now faced with new questions moving forward: how did this planned imperial core dissolve?&nbsp; Did it correspond to the collapse of the empire itself, or did the subsequent rulers of northern Mesopotamia (the Babylonians, Persians, and Seleucid Greeks) maintain what the Assyrians had built?&nbsp; At what point did the massive canals of the Assyrians get replaced by the small village-based systems (known locally as qanats or karez)?&nbsp; Did the deported populations return to their ancestral homelands or continue to live in the former Assyria?</p> <p>On account of the EPAS training component, these and other questions can now be answered by archaeologists from the Kurdistan Region itself.&nbsp;
