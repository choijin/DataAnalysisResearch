<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to shed light on past change efforts in engineering education in order to facilitate continuing improvement in the programs that educate the future engineering workforce.  The project will study the development of prospective change agents by bringing together graduate students and successful leaders and change agents, then collect, analyze, and publish interviews.  The analysis will be used to inform how innovations in teaching and learning can be better integrated into existing engineering curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project is that it both sheds light on how change happens in engineering program, and engages future leaders in collecting and understanding how change has occurred in the past.  The stories of the change agents will be made available through efforts at wide dissemination.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by enhancing research infrastructure and data access to broaden research capabilities. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A number of studies have focused on better understanding ongoing efforts to improve engineering education. The Engineering Education Pioneers project had two main aims: (1) to build on these prior studies by collecting and examining first-hand accounts of the careers of early leaders or "pioneers" in engineering education and (2) to support the development of new generations of leading scholars and innovators in engineering education. We interviewed 47 engineering education pioneers about their careers and analyzed the interviews to better understand their contributions, influences, challenges, and successes. We also produced a publicly available library of pioneer career profiles on the web. Overall project outcomes include a greater understanding of the engineering education community and a practical lens for understanding and supporting careers in the field of engineering education.  A key feature of a project was the way in which we directly involved a group of about forty engineering education graduate students and early-career faculty (referred to as "emerging pioneers") in carrying out the research work. We led these emerging pioneers through the process of preparing for and doing interviewing, profile authoring, and interview analysis. We carefully designed the emerging pioneers? project involvement to promote their development as engineering education scholars and their integration into the communities of engineering education through their direct contact with pioneers.  Intellectual merit  Analysis of the pioneer interviews yielded a wide range of insights about the challenges of doing engineering education work, the corresponding strategies pioneers employed in response, and the ways in which pioneers felt they contributed to the discipline. Many pioneers described how engineering education work was not seen as legitimate or valuable, especially relative to traditional technical engineering work. This often complicated career advancement, especially for pioneers in faculty positions where engineering education work was not counted toward promotion and tenure. Strategies for success that the pioneers recounted included seeking and building communities (often outside of their local departments and institutions) of like-minded researchers and teachers and seeking funding to support their engineering education work, such as National Science Foundation grants. Many pioneers characterized their contributions in terms of community. These pioneers tried to support next generations of engineering education scholars and connect them to each other and to nascent communities in engineering education.  The intentional way in which we furthered the professional development of the forty emerging pioneers involved in this project led us to identify a set of generalized principles that can guide the design of similar educational experiences for doctoral students. We have successfully applied these principles in multiple doctoral education settings outside of the discipline of engineering education.  Broader Impact  A major outcome of the project is a publicly available website, where we have published career profiles for all 47 of the participating pioneers: http://bit.ly/engredupioneers. These profiles include biographical information and first-person accounts of each pioneer?s career pathway, excerpted from their interviews.  The impact of the published career profiles has already expanded beyond the anticipated scope of the project, as illustrated by a graduate course created and implemented at Arizona State University Polytechnic Campus, in which doctoral students read and reflect on the pioneers? narratives to provide insights into how these stories impact them as emerging and developing scholars. In the first instantiation of this course (Spring 2017), instructors observed an impact on career choice; a recognition of knowledge, skills and attributes necessary for success; and a greater appreciation and understanding of engineering education research. We are aware of at least one other course (at the Ohio State University) that similarly engages engineering education graduate students with the pioneer profiles.  The project has also had a personal impact on the participants. At the completion of the project, the pioneers and their interviewers were asked what impact the project had on them.

In summary, the Pioneers project appears to be increasing the understanding of the evolution of the field of engineering education, as well as providing insights for navigating related career pathways. These outcomes have the potential to support not only established members of the engineering education community, but also new and future scholars.
