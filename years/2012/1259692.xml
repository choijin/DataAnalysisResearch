<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to foster a community of scholars and to develop 21st century STEM thinking among a cohort of high-potential, high-need undergraduate students by capitalizing on their common passion for a career in animal biology. Building on strong institutional support in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, this project identifies and recruits academically-talented yet economically disadvantaged rising sophomores for 16 scholarships of up to $10,000 annually for three years. The intellectual merit of the project comes from advancing the knowledge and the understanding of the multidisciplinary nature of animal biology and agricultural science among highly motivated undergraduate students.  These students are developing skill sets based on scientific reasoning, collaboration, and creative problem solving. The plan is to create cohorts of students well-equipped to use STEM skills in the global workplace and in their everyday lives. The project builds on lessons learned from previous NSF S-STEM efforts and leverages institutional commitment and demonstrated departmental excellence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts derive from the new and innovative courses added to the curriculum as a function of this project. Not only will the scholars be allowed to participate, but also other students will as well. Further, publications highlighting the efforts of the undergraduates and the project as a whole are planned. Presentations are planned for the community of agricultural educators, which is an audience that isn't often reached by such projects. By capitalizing on proven pedagogical methods, this program builds the STEM workforce and creates a comprehensive support system to empower economically disadvantaged students and guides them to graduation and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
