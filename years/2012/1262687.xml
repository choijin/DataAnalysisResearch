<AbstractNarration>This research project will examine relationships between outbreaks of spruce bark beetles and wildfire activity in coniferous forests of the Rocky Mountains.   Coincident with warmer temperatures, since the early 1990s synchronous outbreaks of native bark beetles have been occurring throughout coniferous forests of western North America from Alaska to the U.S. Southwest.  Extensive tree mortality caused by bark beetle outbreaks is triggering major changes in forest landscapes and their associated ecosystem services.  This collaborative research project will address the following questions about interactions between wildfire and spruce beetle outbreaks under varying climate and their consequences for ecosystem services:  (1) How does climatic variation affect the initiation and spread of spruce beetle outbreaks across complex landscapes?  (2) How does prior disturbance by windstorm, logging, and fire affect the subsequent occurrence and severity of spruce beetle outbreak?  (3) In the context of a recently warmed climate, how do spruce beetle outbreaks affect forest structure and composition?  (4) How do spruce beetle outbreaks affect fuels and potential wildfire activity under varying climatic conditions?  (5) How will climate change and the climate-sensitive disturbances of wildfire and spruce beetle activity affect future ecosystem services in the subalpine zone of the southern Rocky Mountains under varying scenarios of adaptive forest management?  The first four questions will be addressed through empirical research, including extensive tree-ring reconstructions of past disturbances, re-measurement of permanent forest plots, field measurements of effects of spruce beetle outbreaks on fuels, fire behavior modeling, and spatiotemporal analyses of the spread of recent spruce beetle outbreaks. The fifth question will be examined through simulation modeling of future forest conditions and their consequences for key selected ecosystem services, including biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and resilience to environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to understanding of fire-beetle interactions under varying climate conditions and their consequences for ecosystem services.  The project will provide new information and insights about climate impacts on bark beetle outbreaks, feedbacks to and from wildfire and other disturbances, and sustaining ecosystem services.  The project will provide current science information in support of forest management and decision making needs through evaluation of different adaptive management strategies to maintain biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and ecosystem resilience in the face of climate change.  The project will develop pre-collegiate and collegiate-level curriculum material on wildfire and bark beetle interactions.  It will create field and laboratory educational and training experiences for graduate and undergraduate students as well as an early-career postdoctoral researcher.  To further enhance public education on fire-beetle topics, the project will produce a documentary video as well as a website of frequently asked questions about bark beetles and wildfire in the face of climate change.</AbstractNarration>
