<AbstractNarration>The diversity of data and data types in the geosciences and their dispersal among various academic institutions and federal agencies, all of which have their own data formats and associated search and discovery criteria have prevented maximum effective utilization of this tremendous wealth of information.  To ameliorate this situation, a new NSF initiative, called EarthCube, which is jointly funded by the Directorate of Geosciences and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure, was initiated in 2011 to create an interoperable and integrated data and knowledge management for the geo- and environmental sciences.  An integral part of the process is geoscience and cyberinfrastructure community engagement, at all levels, to ensure that EarthCube's final design and implementation serves all end user needs.  Crucial to the success of EarthCube is its ability to serve the future needs of geoscientists and its ability to scale to new developments in computer science and technology.  To enable input from early career geo-and cyber scientists, a workshop, focused on the expected career trajectory of early career scientists likely to be end users and infrastructure developers, has been funded to examine their needs and to project into the future how these early career professionals envision how EarthCube will impact their science and career trajectories.  The workshop is being held at the Carnegie Institution of Washington.  It is being hosted by a diverse team of convenors and is focused on collecting input from this crucial early career demographic.  The two-day workshop will involve participants from 41 different disciplines within the geo and cyber sciences from around the US.  Broader impacts of the work include providing key stakeholder input into the design of a major NSF activity focused on building infrastructure for science and engaging early career scientists in the process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Sixty-eight early career geoscientists and cyber/computer scientists gathered with five instructors and eight additional featured speakers (for a total of 80 participants) at the Carnegie Institution for Science on October 16-17, 2012 to construct a shared vision for success with respect to the cyberinfrastructure needed to support the next generation of earth science research.  The participants were mostly assistant professors, but post docs, doctoral students, and a few others engaged in a highly interactive process of mapping their own career aspirations and considering how a robust cyber infrastructure might enable them to tackle high impact research questions and deliver education in new ways.   All of the individuals invited to the workshop were selected based on their being seen as emerging leaders in their respective domains, which included the following domains at the NSF:  AGS, BIO, CISE, EAR, HER, ENG, HER, OCE, OCI, OPP, and SBE.  Motivating the workshop was the new NSF initiative entitled "EarthCube," which is a ten-year initiative designed to create a knowledge management system and infrastructure that integrates all geosciences data in an open, transparent and inclusive manner.  The overarching motivation was to understand how the research and educational trajectories of next generation leaders in the geosciences, computer sciences, and other relevant fields would map onto the future direction and potential for EarthCube.  In particular, four goals for the workshop were identified:  Map EarthCube onto Career Trajectories Contribute to EarthCube Vision Inform EarthCube Governance Enable Networking and Professional Development      Science Issues and Challenges:   Important science drivers and challenges:  Participants were all motivated by "grand challenge" geoscience questions concerning global climate change, weather prediction, and other such challenges. This was a highly diverse set of participants, spanning the following geoscience domains (each with distinctive science drivers/challenges):     Atmospheric and geospatial sciences (anthropogenic aerosols, climate modeling, earth system science, land use, paleoclimate modeling, space science) Earth Science (biochemistry, carbon cycling, climate change, climate modeling, earth system modeling, earthquakes, geochemistry,  geochronology, geodynamics, geoinformatics, geology, geomorphology, geophysics, hydrology, igneous processes, metamorphic petrology, mountain environments, rivers, seismology, tectonics, water cycle) Ocean science (biogeochemical cycling, chemical oceanography, climate change, coastal fluid dynamics, fluid mechanics,  geochemistry, magmatic systems, microbiology, ocean acidification, petrology, physical oceanography, remote sensing) Polar science (Antarctic ecology, carbon cycle, climate change, geochemistry, glaciers, ice, ice-ocean interface, meteorology, permafrost, sea ice)  Additional participants were from cyber or computer science, social science, and other domains including:    Computer science (cognition, machine learning, software) Cyberinfrastructure (algorithms, big data, bioinformatics, climate informatics, cyber data management, data mining, GIS, hydroinformatics, lexical representation, semantics, spatial/temporal data, special databases) Education (disability, disasters, geology, soil and water) Engineering (environmental nanotechnology, low temp geochemistry) Social science (governance, stakeholder visualization, trust)      Current challenges to high-impact, interdisciplinary science:  Institutional barriers to interdisciplinary science, particularly the tenure process in universities. Resources and credit for sharing data, tools, models, and software Connecting interdisciplinary research with interdisciplinary education Not being limited to "brute force" accumulation of interdisciplinary data, particularly where the "ZÆ axis for geochronology is needed.
