<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this workshop is to bring together leading scientists from around the world working at the forefront of 2D material systems, to discuss the future and impact of non-graphene 2D atomic layers and devices that can have both scientific and technological implications and applications in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The workshop intends to provide an open forum for experts in the field to address important aspects of a variety of 2D material systems and devices that could be complimentary to graphene. Example of materials include boron nitride, di-chalcogenides, tertiary compounds of carbo-nitrides, and complex oxides that can be exfoliated and isolated as stable single atomic layers. Studies on the synthesis, chemical modification, device fabrication and testing and theoretical explorations have been proposed on these stable 2D materials and the field is about to see an explosion of activities in the near future. The workshop is timely in addressing many of these issues and highlighting the impact this field can have in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts are two-folds. First, this new and emerging technical area and the ensuing interdisciplinary activities will be in perfect synergy with the already well-established graphene science and will impact different fields of science, chemistry and engineering in the next decade. Second, efforts in this area will also positively impact learning in science and engineering disciplines. Graduate students and post-docs will be undertaking important research assignments and the workshop will set broad directions for future research and learning in this area.</AbstractNarration>

This is pre-empted by the vast body of work based on graphene. The story of "2D layered materials beyond graphene" has similarities and differences with the story of graphene.

The discussions at the workshop considered avenues and directions for the development of 2D atomic layer based structures as building blocks for the next generation of devices and nano-architectures. It is imperative that the right amount of resources be made available and invested to bring innovative ideas in order to make the field competitive and fruitful for future technologies.
