<AbstractNarration>The North Star STEM Alliance, Minnesota?s Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, proposes to advance to a mid-level alliance with the goal of doubling the number of graduates from 272 to 544 by May, 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Bridge to the Baccalaureate program strengthens and enriches relationships with community colleges, creating smooth transitions for students before, during, and after transferring into baccalaureate programs. The North Star STEM Alliance, extending the successes of its initial five-year partnership, implements best practices in engaging and retaining URMs studying STEM on 15 Minnesota campuses. Undergraduate research, a featured best practice in retention, will engage more than 375 students, contributing to discovery and innovation across the spectrum of STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By May, 2017, the more than 3,200 URM STEM graduates influenced and supported by the North Star STEM Alliance will enter the work force or graduate school, diversifying the academy, corporations, and professional organizations. Many of the Alliance alumni remain in Minnesota, contributing to a stronger Minnesota economy and the nation?s competitiveness in the global economy.</AbstractNarration>

I came to campus with many apprehensions and I am thankful that the North Star STEM Alliance has given me a sense of belonging and provided me with great opportunities along the way. --University of Minnesota Twin Cities student  The North Star STEM Alliance is Minnesota's Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP), one of more than forty across the nation.

This accomplishment is based on aligning goals across our Alliance and implementing best practices:  1) undergraduate research, 2) cohorts and community building, 3) faculty and peer mentoring, 4) academic support, and 5) professional and career development.  1)       Research experiences during undergraduate years give students opportunities to learn what science is truly about --discovering the unknown.  They learn alongside faculty and graduate students and travel to national scientific conferences to present research results.  This best practice is regarded as the most influential retention program for minority undergraduate students. A total of 378 students participated in undergraduate research during the Mid-level Alliance.   2)       Helping students associate with other students from cultural minorities majoring in STEM reduces the isolation they feel in classrooms and laboratories in predominately white institutions.  They feel more comfortable and accepted among students of their own culture.  The Alliance helps cohorts and communities form in departments, colleges, and across partner institutions.  3)       Mentoring, like coaching, provides one-on-one career guidance and professional development by one who is more advanced in the STEM career.  This mentoring may come from a student farther along in coursework, a faculty member, or STEM professional in government or industry.  In 2016-17, 186 faculty, staff and graduate students across partner institutions mentored Alliance students.  Peer mentoring is a strong component on most partner programs.  4)       Academic support consists of one-on-one tutoring, group study, locating study partners, supplemental instruction, connecting students to campus study resources, and workshops on academic and research skills.  5)       Professional and career development gives students experience in presenting oneself professionally, networking effectively, interviewing, and setting career goals.  Students also become accustomed to their new professional STEM communities through opportunities to meet STEM professionals and attend national conferences.
