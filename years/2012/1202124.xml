<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The 2012 Mitochondria and Chloroplasts GRC &amp; GRS will be held July 29-August 3, 2012, and July 28-July 29, 2012, respectively at Bryant University in Smithfield, Rhode Island.  Mitochondria and chloroplasts house numerous metabolic processes that are essential to organismal growth, development, and adaptation.  The Gordon Research Conference on Mitochondria &amp; Chloroplasts is the most highly regarded meeting covering these topics due to the excellent reputation and interactive nature of Gordon Conferences, its focus on both DNA-containing organelles, the quality of the speakers, and the broad perspective that is achieved by bringing together investigators using diverse approaches and organisms to attack problems of shared interest.  The conference will provide a unique forum for scientists working on plant, animal, and fungal systems to identify common mechanisms and shared properties of these organelles. The integrated focus on chloroplasts and mitochondria is quite unique to this conference.  It will convene investigators who specialize in physiology, genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, proteomics, and structural biology, thereby fostering a cross-disciplinary perspective, the sharing of technological expertise, and the establishment of new collaborative efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The conference program will include approximately 20 graduate students and postdoctoral speakers.  Over half of the participants in 2010 were graduate students or postdoctoral students.  Overall, approximately 50 attendees will attend the seminar and approximately 150 at the conference.  In 2010, 30% of the participants at the GRC on Mitochondria and Chloroplasts were women.  Particular attention has been made to increase participation of underrepresented groups and the conference organizers intend to provide special consideration for qualified applicants who are members of underrepresented groups.  Faculty at predominantly undergraduate institutions will also be given special consideration.</AbstractNarration>
