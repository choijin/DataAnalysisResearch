<AbstractNarration>Current magnetic recording technology is fast approaching its theoretical limit of 1 terabit per square inch (1 Tb/in^2), and unless new technology is developed that can deliver areal densities of up to 10Tb/in^2, the annual increases in hard-disk drive capacity will taper rapidly. Several candidate technologies are currently being developed that will extend the areal densities up to 4Tb/in^2, but only two that can possibly extend it all the way to 10Tb/in^2, namely energy assisted recording on bit-patterned media and two-dimensional magnetic recording. Bit-patterned media requires extreme nano-lithography and imprinting techniques, which are prohibitively expensive, and very tight specifications on the planarization of the disk surface. Two-dimensional magnetic recording, on the other hand, uses conventional heads and media, but requires the development of new two-dimensional signal processing and coding techniques suitable for the magnetic recording channel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program aims at providing an in-depth understanding of two-dimensional shingled magnetic recording through: 1) development of realistic channel models at the magnetic grain level; 2) development of techniques to analyze the statistical properties of such models; 3) development of two-dimensional intersymbol interference channel detectors with limited per-symbol complexity; 4) development of a novel and transformative approach to the design of capacity-approaching codes based on fundamental algebraic properties of cyclic codes; and 5) determination of the maximum areal recording density that can be achieved in practice. This research program will help answer the fundamental question of whether it is possible to approach the ultimate theoretical limit of one user bit per magnetic grain using shingled writing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader goal of this research program is to help determine the feasibility of hard-disk drives with areal densities of up to 10Tb/in^2 using shingled writing. Its successful completion would establish two-dimensional magnetic recording as the technology of choice for the next generation of magnetic storage devices and potentially shape future research in this field. The significance of achieving such a high recording density is that one could store up to ten times as much data on a drive of  the same size as current ones, thus fostering a multi-billion dollar economic impact on the storage industry. In addition, the methods devised for detection and coding for channels with two-dimensional intersymbol interference have a wider application to new two-dimensional transmission and storage systems as they become available, for instance multi-aperture free-space optical communication systems  and holographic data storage systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research is in the area of magnetic recording for data storage (i.e, the design of computer hard-disk drives).  Disk drives are a multi-billion dollar a year industry, but the industry is facing difficulties in developing new higher-density disk drives to handle ever-increasing demand.  As the data density goes up, the bits written on the media get packed even closer together.  This causes increased noise in the signal read from the disk due to the bits interfering with each other.  Furthermore, as bits get closer and closer in size to the individual grains of the magnetic material, the irregularities in the medium produce even more noise.  Hence, making systems that reliably write and read data on disk drives at high density is a challenging problem in communications engineering, quite unlike any other area of communication theory (e.g., wireless or wire-line communications). Our goal is to design detectors and error-correcting codes (ECC) for disk drives that are designed with the peculiarities of the magnetic recording channel (MRC) in mind.  The codes in today's disk drives are typically "generic" ECCs designed for simple theoretical channels like the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, channels much simpler than the MRC. Designing codes specifically for the MRC is a promising approach to squeeze every last bit of performance out of the magnetic media. First we need to accurately model and simulate how the recording channel behaves.  This in itself is a very difficult problem.  Our previous research in this area produced a computer model, the so-called "Voronoi model", that accurately models the MRC; however, this program takes about 90 minutes on one of our university's most powerful computers just to simulate writing a couple of blocks of data.  This is impractical for the repeated simulations we need to do code design.  Much of our time was spent developing simpler models that still capture most of the odd behavior of the full MRC.  We succeeded in making a new "two-dimensional jitter model" which replicates fairly well the odd behavior of the MRC, but takes only a few seconds to simulate each block instead of 90 minutes. Given our new, faster model, we were able to make lists of the most common patterns of bits in error that one sees on the MRC.  We then create codes designed to specifically resist these common error patterns.  Our methods included modifying existing types of error-correcting codes, the one-dimensional and two-dimensional cyclic codes, to incorporate knowledge of the error patterns.  The results for these cyclic codes so far have not been encouraging, but we have developed another approach based on the newer polar codes, which is much more promising. We also have worked on detection systems for the MRC.  The detector is the system that goes in-between the head (the part that directly reads the signal off the disk) and the error-correcting decoder.  The state of the art approach to detection involves what is called "noise-predictive" detectors, ones which attempt to predict the noise part of the readback signal and subtract it off leaving the desired signal.  These detectors assume that the noise has certain statistical properties, namely that the noise is of a type called "Gauss-Markov".  Unfortunately, recent research by others gives indications that the Gauss-Markov assumption is not really valid for magnetic recording, especially at higher densities, and that the noise is instead what is called "regressive noise".  Our research has developed, and we have recently published, a promising new detector algorithm that is designed specifically for this regressive noise.
