<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks continued funding for the Marine Geological Sample Laboratory (MGSL) at the Univ. of Rhode Island. This relatively small facility loaned nearly 3,000 samples during the previous funding cycle. Institutional support includes cold storage facilities, support for graduate student involvement, and support for the senior person in charge of the facility. The work plan includes continued description and logging of core, and accessioning of a new collection of analyzed glass separates from oceanic basalts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>NSF funding to the Marine Geological Samples Laboratory (MGSL) provided support for the curation and distribution of seafloor geological samples collected by researchers at the Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island.

During the funding period 31 sediment cores, 323 rock dredges, and 324 remotely operated vehicle-collected samples were added to the MGSL collection.
