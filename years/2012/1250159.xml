<AbstractNarration>This award will defray costs associated with hosting the 31st Annual Technical Conference of the National Association of Black Geologists and Geophysicists (NABGG) in Washington DC (September 5-8, 2012). An important goal of NABGG is to encourage students of color to pursue baccalaureate and advanced (MS and PhD) degrees in STEM fields in order to help provide a competent and diverse workforce in these economically critical areas for the 21st Century and the conference will provide an opportunity for mentoring underrepresented students in the Earth and environmental sciences. The planned conference will have wide-ranging technical programs, career success workshops for students, and interactive exhibits with appeal to professionals, students, and science educators in the Washington DC are. The theme of the conference will be Focus on Environmental Change, emphasizing innovations in geosciences that facilitate the understanding environmental change. Faculty from the University of Arkansas and University of California Museum of Paleontology will facilitate student participation at the conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided participant support for a total of 108 students to present results of research and engage in professional development activities at the Annual Technical Conference of the National Association of Black Geoscientists in Washington, DC in 2012 and in Houston, TX in 2013.  This annual conference highlights research of students in Geoscience disciplines and provides opportunities for professional development, career counseling, and one-on-one, face-to-face mentoring with working professionals in geoscience careers. Students gain experience developing oral and poster presentations for a professional audience and receive considerable, significant feedback from the NABG professional membership.  Students have opportunities to speak directly with Human Resources professionals recruiting for internship and permanent employment in global energy industry careers, environmental industry careers, and public sector geoscience careers.  Professional members of NABG represent all stages of career development in both the private and public sector workforce: recent permanent hires, mid-career professionals, advanced career professionals, and entrepreneurs with established geoscience-related businesses.  These professionals serve as exceptional role models and mentors for students from all academic levels, undergraduate through MS and PhD.  Students gain valuable experience networking with these professionals; a number of students each year are extended offers for summer internships and permanent employment.  The NABG recognizes the Annual Technical Conference as an ideal setting to conduct talent searches and NSF support for student participation is a critical aspect of development for the 21st Century geoscience workforce.  The Annual Technical Conference of NABG is also an important opportunity to engage the academic community involved in direct education and training of students to interact with geoscience professionals to better understand the technical skills and knowledge base required for successful employment in the 21st Century geoscience workforce. Academic participants meet with geoscience professionals to discuss curricula and opportunities for collaborative engagement in providing state-of-the-art educational opportunities for students. Specific objectives or the project were 1) to support participation in the NABG Annual Technical Conference for college and university students from groups under-represented in STEM disciplines related to geosciences, 2) to promote research accomplishments of students from underrepresented groups in geoscience disciplines, 3) to provide minority students in geosciences opportunities to be mentored by minority professionals from the national geosciences workforce, 4) to assist in establishment of a nationwide network of individuals from private and public sector institutions to promote career opportunities in the national geosciences workforce among underserved populations, 5) to develop long-term strategic initiatives to improve representation and inclusion of underrepresented persons in the geoscience workforce, 6) to provide professional development opportunities for students desiring careers in the national geosciences workforce, 7) to assist private and public sector geoscience institutions in recognizing the available talent pool of students from underserved populations desiring careers in the national geoscience workforce.  Since 2009, NSF participant support for the NABG Annual Technical Conference has provided opportunity for approximately 250 students of color across all academic levels (undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral) to network with minority professionals working in the national geoscience workforce. This conference has evolved to become a premier venue for students and professionals of color to engage in thoughtful discourse and meaningful mentoring regarding professional development, career counseling, and fellowship.
