<AbstractNarration>Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;An award is made to the University of California at Los Angeles to develop a high speed fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) system in order to sort highly infectious and potentially dangerous samples in a biosafety cabinet within a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) facility to enable for the first time high purity sorting of live BSL3 subcellular organisms. The sorter employs a tightly focused pulsed laser beam to generate an explosive vapor bubble and transient, local, small volume fluid perturbation near target objects to deflect their  trajectories in a microchannel into collection or waste outlets. It aims to achieve &gt;90% high purity sort at 100,000 cells/s on a fully enclosed, disposable, microfluidic chip inside a biosafety cabinet to ensure the highest level of biosafety. It requires only one hour to purify 108 cells or subcellular organelles from a population of 109 cells. This project also aims to develop a novel, label free sorter utilizing dielectrophoresis mechanism to pre-purify samples containing various unwanted subcellular organelles and debris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact&lt;br/&gt;A BSL 3 compatible high throughput FACS platform will provide paradigm-shifting impacts in studying infectious disease. It will have broad applications from fundamental biological research to clinical applications. Results and expertise developed during the course of this project will also be incorporated into PIs? teaching activities at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Minority graduate and undergraduate students will participate in these projects through independent research courses. Students involved in this project will be exposed to an excellent multidisciplinary training environment in UCLA Engineering School and Medical School.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The major goal of this project is to develop a high-speed fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) system able to sort infectious and potentially dangerous samples in a biosafety cabinet within a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) facility. The research projects supported by this grant focused on the development of critical enabling components required to achieve this goal. Throughout the funding period, we have achieved several milestone accomplishments.&nbsp;First, we have demonstrated the first microfluidic FACS, called 3D-PLACS, capable of performing fluorescence based sorting at a throughput of 23,000 cells/sec with &gt;90% purity in a single fully enclosed microfluidic channel, the fastest single-channel microFACS demonstrated so far. Sorting highly infectious samples in a fully enclosed environment without generating aerosol droplets is critical for sorting in BSL3 facility.&nbsp;Second, sheath flows are commonly used for focusing cells into a single flow stream in conventional FACS to ensure every cell flowing through the detection zone at the same location and at the same speed. This is critically important for fair comparison of fluorescence signals detected from different cells in a population. However, sheath flows introduce several side effects that become severe issues for sorting small sized cells such as bacteria, which are harder to focus them into a single stream compared to mammalian cells. Fluorescence signals from bacteria are weak due to their much smaller volume. Without focusing bacteria tightly into a narrow stream, capturing weak fluorescence signals from them with high N.A. lens for high sensitivity detection is difficult. Another major side effect of sheath flows is the significant sample dilution issue. The tighter the focusing is required, the severe the dilution issue is. To maintain the same sorting throughput, high-pressure flows will be needed, which compromises cell viability. &nbsp;Our second major milestone accomplishment is the demonstration of a novel sheathless cell focusing method. It is realized by a novel mechanism called tunnel DEP (TDEP) that enables tunable, three-dimensional, single-stream, cell size- and type-independent, flow-speed independent focusing function in high-speed microfluidic flows. TDEP can achieve submicron precision focusing of mammalian cells flowing at a speed of 11 cm/sec, which is 3 orders of magnitude faster than prior DEP works in high conductivity media. TDEP can also be extended to achieve tight bacteria focusing through proper engineering of electrodes. With TDEP, the side effects of sheath flows are significantly reduced.&nbsp;Furthermore, both 3D-PLACS and TDEP technologies have been patented by UC Regents and licensed to an industry partner through UCLA for further development and commercialization for broader impacts.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/09/2017<br>      Modified by: Pei-Yu&nbsp;Chiou</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1256178/1256178_10236473_1494353268798_3DPLACS--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1256178/1256178_10236473_1494353268798_3DPLACS--rgov-800width.jpg" title="3D Pulse Laser Activated Cell Sorter"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1256178/1256178_10236473_1494353268798_3DPLACS--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="3D Pulse Laser Activated Cell Sorter"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The schematic illustrates the working principle of 3D PLACS.
