<AbstractNarration>Exotic nuclei are short-lived, barely stable systems rich with neutrons - Oxygen-24, Lithium-12, Beryllium-13.  Studies of such nuclei are a key component to the international long-range plan for nuclear physics.  These nuclei provide us with new information about the structure of the nucleus.   The US commitment to this work can be seen in the construction of the future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to support the work of the MoNA collaboration, a group comprised of research scientists, faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates.  We study the structure of exotic nuclei with a unique experimental system designed specifically for this kind of work, the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA), the new Large-area Multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA), and the Sweeper charged-fragment detector system, using the rare isotope beams at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and the future beams at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams.  We work to better understand unbound states in light but neutron-rich nuclei.   Through both knock-out dynamics and Coulomb dissociation, nuclear structure questions, especially how nuclear structure changes as a function of nuclear stability, are addressed.   Our experimental campaign informs the astrophysics community, since our work helps determine the gamma-neutron rates in stellar processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project centers on nuclear structure, to better understand how neutrons and protons interact within an atomÃ†s nucleus.  Of special interest are short-lived, very neutron-rich nuclei.  These "exotic nuclei" give us an opportunity to really test our theories.     The Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) Collaboration is a group of faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates representing colleges and Universities from coast to coast.  The MoNA Collaboration, in concert with faculty and students at Gettysburg College had three goals over the past three years specific to this NSF funding. The first goal centers on an experimental campaign that took place in the summer of 2011 to study 24O and 23O, and in so doing, commission the Large-area multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA) at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), a premier physics facility on the campus of Michigan State University.   The second is computational in nature and could be done in the summers on campus at Gettysburg College.  The third goal was an experimental campaign in 2012 to selectively populate and study excited states in 11Li at the NSCL.        During the three year period we also used this funding to push the physics of nuclei ever forward.  We did new work during this grant period that was not even fully realized during the grant proposal preparation.  For example, during the duration of this funding a revisiting of data originally taken to study the 10He ground state has yielded new results. Through a more detailed analysis of the data, we investigated possible evidence for direct cluster removal and search for a resonance in 12He, and we published a paper on those results along with three other papers for the physics community.  Eight undergraduate students have, since the start of this funding, participated in this work.  Their levels of participation vary widely, from one student who worked for only a few weeks in the spring semester of 2013 to a student who will work two summers full time and also part time during the academic year.   All did data analysis, and six participated in experimental campaigns at the NSCL.          Last Modified: 01/05/2016       Submitted by: Sharon L Stephenson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
