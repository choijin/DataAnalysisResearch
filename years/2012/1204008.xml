<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2012 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. These fellowships support a research and training plan at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Rodrigo Trevino is "Teichmuller dynamics in infinite genus." The host institution for the fellowship is Cornell University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. John Smillie.</AbstractNarration>
