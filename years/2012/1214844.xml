<AbstractNarration>It is intuitively clear that, in many situations, agents (in the sense of game theory) do not make a best response because determining what the best response should be would require a great deal of effort.  This does not make agents irrational; chess players are not being irrational when they fail to play optimally.  Indeed, their response could be viewed as perfectly rational, given their computational limitations.  Standard solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium do not explicitly take computation into account. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of considering computational issues in game theory has been recognized since at least the work of Simon.  The PIs have developed a general framework for taking computation into account. A player is viewed as choosing a Turing machine (TM). With each TM M and input is associated a complexity. The complexity can represent the running time of or space used by M on that input; it can also be used to capture the complexity of M itself (e.g., the number of states) or to model the cost of searching for a new strategy to replace one that the player already has.   The approach captures important intuitions, and can deal with a number of well-known problematic examples.  Moreover, there are deep connections between this approach and cryptographic protocol security.   Thus, thinking in terms of computational games can lead to new insights and new approaches in security.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to investigate the implications of adding computational cost to game theory more broadly.  This is expected to involve issues of language, awareness, and cryptography.  Topics to be addressed include the following: &lt;br/&gt;- The extent to which this approach can capture important notions of secure computation and suggest new notions will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;- In the model, it is implicitly assumed that agents "understand" the costs associated with each TM and "understand" what the best response is.  Thus, if the complexity is taken to be running time, agents know (or at least have subjective beliefs about) the running time of each TM.  But where are these beliefs coming from?  Clearly they, too, must be computed.  Thus, the model will be extended so that it takes into account the cost of computing beliefs and best responses.  Doing this will force consideration of issues of language in a serious way.  &lt;br/&gt;- The earlier model considered only normal-form games.  In extensive-form games, computation becomes an explicit part of the game.  Intuitively, as the agent does computation, his understanding of the game improves, and he may become aware of more options.  Thus, there should be deep connections between computation in extensive-form games and awareness, a topic that has attracted a great deal of recent attention in game theory and computer science; these will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;- To further understand the role of language, the interplay between the choice of language, computational cost, and rationality will be considered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress in this area could have broad impact on theoretical models in game theory and computer science, and on applications of game theory both to the social sciences and to more practical work in security and networks, where game-theoretic models are becoming more and more prevalent.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we explored two main themes.  The first was trying to explain apparently irrational behavior on the basis of computational constraints.  Chess players are not being irrational when they fail to play optimally. Indeed, their response can be viewed as perfectly rational, given their computational limitations. Standard solution concepts in game theory such as Nash equilibrium do not explicitly take computation into account.  We were interested in alternatives that did take computation into account.  The second theme was the role of language in games (and how that might interact with computational issues).  Significant progress was made on both of these themes.   With regard to taking computation into account, we did the following:  - We defined a notion of "computational game" and what it means for a computational game to represent an underlying game.  We then defined analogues of Nash equilibrium and sequential equilibrium (two standardsolutions concepts in game theory) for computational games. This allows us to capture and formalize intuitions in cryptography, as well as simplifiying the analysis of some cryptographic protocols which can be viewed as embodying a computational game.  - We showed how to efficiently find an (approximate) Nash equilibrium in repeated games assuming that players are computationally bounded (and making standard cryptographic hardness assumptions).  This was surprising, given that earlier results showed that it was computationally intractable to find an approximate equilibrium.  The difference betweenthe results is that we assume that the players in the game are computatinoally bounded, whereas the earlier result did not.  - We examined sequential equilibrium in the context of a different type of computational game, where agents are charged for computation. In such games, an agent can rationally choose to forget, so issues of imperfect recall arise.  With regard to issues of language, we did the following:  - We developed a "language-based" framework for studying games where an agent's utility is not only a function of the actions performed by all the players, but may also depend on the beliefs of other agents, their beliefs about beliefs of other agents etc, and more generally, the "situation" (or current state of affairs), described by a maximal satisfiable set of formulas in some underlying language. Language-based games generalize earlier notions such as psychological games and reference-dependent games; in addition, they allow us to expand the scope of the earlier notions to dealing with players that are boundedly rational.  In particular, it is shown how the framework can be used for dealing with players with "coarse beliefs" (beliefs that only take on a small number of probability values).   This framework can help explain a number of paradoxes in decision theory and game theory.  - A major impossibility result in game theory is the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem, which says that the only voting scheme involving more than 3 candidates that is strategy-proof (i.e., cannot be "gamed" -- players are best off voting according to their true preferences) is dictatorial: a single voter decides the outcome.  We showed that this result could be overcome if players have coarse beliefs  (which in this case means that players can talk only about ranges of probabilities, rather than precise probabilities).  - We investigated the connection between the two major mathematical frameworks for modeling interactive beliefs: type spaces and possible-worlds-style probability frames. While translating the former into the latter is straightforward, the reverse translation is shown to rely implicitly on a background logical language. Once this ``language parameter'' is made explicit, it reveals a close relationship between universal type spaces and canonical models: namely, that they are essentially the same construct.  This work was published in major conference and leading journals, and was the subject of numerous invited talks and tutorials.
