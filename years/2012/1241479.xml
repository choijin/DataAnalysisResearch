<AbstractNarration>Aerosols impact the radiative balance of the earth directly by scattering and absorbing sunlight and semi-directly by altering the vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere and modifying cloud properties.  The magnitudes of these effects are highly uncertain thereby limiting our understanding of and ability to predict earth's climate. Absorption of sunlight by black carbon (BC) aerosols is thought to be the largest positive radiative forcing after carbon dioxide and biomass burning accounts for greater than half of BC in the atmosphere. A key parameter in describing aerosol radiative properties is the single scattering albedo (SSA), which is difficult to reliably quantify from space, thus, making in-situ measurements essential. A suite of instruments will be deployed to the Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula, Montana for a 4-week investigation (entitled FLAME-IV (the 4th Fire Lab At Missoula Experiment)) of biomass-burning emissions from globally important fuel types. Emissions will be characterized with a photoacoustic absorption spectrometer (PAS), a cavity attenuated phase shift spectrometer (CAPS), a thermal denuder, and the aerosol scattering to extinction ratio (ASTER) instrument. Aerosol absorption, enhanced absorption caused by semi-volatile coatings, brown carbon, the SSA of the bulk aerosol and the SSA of single particles will be quantified. The single-particle SSA distribution for biomass burning emissions will provide new information regarding the size, character, and mixing state of particles responsible for absorption. These detailed optical properties will inform satellite retrievals and climate models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project data will be archived in easily accessible formats and available publicly for use by modelers and others. Result will facilitate informed public policy decisions regarding the climatic implications of biomass burning emissions. The project will support 2 full-time graduate students and provide opportunities for undergraduate research. This study will foster collaboration among the Atmospheric Science Department at the University of Wyoming (an EPSCOR University), the Fire Sciences Lab, and other groups participating in Flame IV. Results will be reported at national conferences and in the peer-reviewed literature. Results will also be incorporated into courses offered in the principal investigator's department, presentations to community groups, and workshops for both high school students and K-12 teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             The goal of this project was to improve understanding of the optical properties of particulate emissions from biomass burning.  This is a critical issue because biomass burning in one of the largest sources of absorbing aerosol globally and absorbing aerosols, especially black carbon, are thought to be the second or third most important contributor to positive radiative forcing, which warms the Earth.   To achieve the project goal, we deployed a suite of state of the art optical instrumentation to the Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula, Montana to make measurements of particulate emissions from the burning of a wide array of globally relevant biomass fuels.  The instruments, which included a multi-wavelength photoacoustic absorption spectrometer and a multi-wavelength cavity ringdown spectrometer, have distinct advantages over more commonly used instruments.  The most important of these advantages is that these instruments do not use filters, which cause optical artifacts.              Extensive high-quality data was collected during the field deployment and the optical properties of particulate emissions from a wide range of fuels were derived from analysis of this data.  Several significant findings resulted from the project.  Firstly, we found that the single scattering albedo (SSA), a ratio which indicates how much light an aerosol particle absorbs versus scatters, can be parameterized with high accuracy by using the ratio of elemental carbon (EC) to organic carbon (OC).  This is significant because emission factors of EC and OC are available for fuels from many regions of the world.  This parameterization allows modelers to know what SSA to expect if they know the amount of EC and OC emitted by a fire. Secondly, we showed that absorption by brown carbon, which only absorbs shorter wavelengths of light, is very significant in biomass burning emissions.  We demonstrated that the fraction of particulate absorption that is attributed to brown carbon depends significantly on the methodology used to calculate it.  We found that several commonly used methodologies generate significantly different results for the fraction of the total particulate absorption caused by brown carbon.  This is important because particulate brown carbon does not appear to be chemically stable in the atmosphere while particulate black carbon is.  This leads to the third significant finding, which is that particulate brown carbon is bleached during photooxidation.  This was determined by injecting smoke particles from the fires into a Teflon chamber and then oxidizing these particles and the gases associated with them either by turning on black lights or adding ozone. It was found that ozone had relatively little effect on the particulate brown carbon while exposure to the black lights, under a range of different conditions, led to rapid removal of the particulate brown carbon.  This significant finding increases our knowledge of how, and how quickly, particulate brown carbon is removed from the atmosphere, which has a significant impact on the radiative forcing of biomass burning particulate emissions. Finally, a significant source of absorbing particulates globally is Indonesian peat and this project was one of the first to make accurate measurements of the SSA of Indonesian Peat particulate emissions.
