<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the 8th annual Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics and for a formative assessment of the effectiveness of the conferences in meeting their goals. The next conferences will take place on January 18-20, 2013, simultaneously at Caltech, Colorado School of Mines, Cornell University, the University of Central Florida, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conferences have two overarching goals: 1) To give undergraduate women the resources, motivation, and confidence to apply to graduate school and to successfully complete a Ph.D. in physics or a related discipline; and 2) To increase awareness by undergraduate women in physics of the wide range of career opportunities available to them. Regional conferences are held simultaneously to maximize student attendance by minimizing travel, to increase the excitement of the participants in a joint national venture, and to allow the interactive simulcast of a keynote address. The conference goals are achieved by providing a series of inspiring talks by female physicists, panel discussions on graduate school and physics careers, student presentation sessions, and ample opportunity for networking and informal mentoring. The success of these goals will be measured by surveys given to students before and after the conferences, as well as by longitudinal studies following the students' post-graduation paths and comparing them with female student cohorts who did not attend the conferences.</AbstractNarration>

The pre/post-questionnaire data did not reveal a significant increase in the participantsÃ† stated level of confidence for succeeding both in graduate school and a career in physics. However, the participants believed the conferences had a positive influence in this area.  Several expressed an appreciation for learning about "imposter syndrome" and strategies for countering self-doubt. A few participants noted that they learned that a career in physics was not for them.     6. The specific aspects of the conference structure that emerged as being highly valued included: panels, speakers, networking opportunities, Science Caf&eacute;s, and poster sessions. Aspects of the conference that generated some negative/mixed reactions included: the promotion of one particular graduate school, the level of emphasis on womenÃ†s issues, male participants, an emphasis on one area of physics, and stereotypical understandings of gender (White, heterosexual, binary).     7. Although no particular aspect of the conference set-up was highly emphasized in the survey responses/group discussions, comments indicated that the participants were satisfied with the food and accommodations. They did, however, express some dissatisfaction with a few of the logistical aspects (transportation, technical difficulties, reimbursements).
