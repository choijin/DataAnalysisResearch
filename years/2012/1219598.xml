<AbstractNarration>Computational techniques are revolutionizing the way in which research is conducted in science and engineering. However, even in domains that seem closely liked, such as biology, medicine, and drug discovery, computing science research advances are not broadly disseminated and do not become widely known. This conference would bring together computational scientists and domain experts to explore current results and to foster collaborations. A set of outstanding researchers from around the world have agreed to structure this new effort. The three day meeting meeting, in Las Vegas Nevada, would have participation by students through travel grants. This building of the next generation of computing science in different application areas is one of the key outcomes of this meeting. In addition, the selected papers will be made available online. In addition, some of the papers will be published through BioMed Central, which has reduced the costs for this meeting. Bringing together academic and industry researchers to consider the latest advances in computational methods will promote the rapid transfer of results from research to products and technologies.</AbstractNarration>
