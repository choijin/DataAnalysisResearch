<AbstractNarration>SES-1024539&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jennifer L. Glass&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Iowa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-1024431&lt;br/&gt;PI: Robin W. Simon&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Wake Forest University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this research are twofold: (1) to document cross-national variation in the effect of parenthood on well-being in post-industrial developed economies, and (2) to determine whether cross-national variation in the effect of parenthood on wellbeing can be explained by variation in the quality and quantity of welfare state support for parenthood. This research will use the 2005 World Values Surveys from a sample of 21 OCED countries to determine the impact of parenthood on several key indicators of adult well-being, including life satisfaction, general happiness, mastery, fatalism, and self-rated health. The investigators hypothesize that those countries with greater public support for parenting will show less negative effects of parenthood on adult well-being than other countries with less support. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;By investigating the role of public policies and institutional supports for parenting on parents? psychological well-being, this research can help identify those practices that minimize the child penalty on adult well-being, and most strongly affect the lived experience of parents.</AbstractNarration>
