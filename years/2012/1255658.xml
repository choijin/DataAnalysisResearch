<AbstractNarration>Through this NSF CAREER award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms B Program (CSDM-B), Professor Amber T. Krummel from Colorado State University will identify the means by which a small pore-forming toxin, surfactin, will interact with model lipid membranes using two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy.  Surfactin is known to have antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor activity, but surfactin has also been implicated in cell-signaling activities during biofilm formation.  This project will identify the differences in the mode of action by surfactin during these different activities.  The structural sensitivity offered by 2D IR spectroscopy will be utilized to quantify the molecular details of the surfactin-lipid interaction during the surfactin insertion and lipid membrane disruption processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pore-forming toxins are proteins that are synthesized by many organisms, including the human immune system.  These proteins insert into cell membranes in order to allow small molecules to move into cells, cause cell leakage, or to disrupt the integrity of cells such that cell death occurs.  In this work, advanced optical spectroscopy techniques will be used to monitor the protein-lipid interaction with structural sensitivity.  The results from these investigations will lead to a new understanding of how a small pore-forming toxin, surfactin, self-assembles and interacts with lipids in order to drive cell signaling processes and the disruption of lipid membranes.  During the course of this project, undergraduate researchers and graduate student researchers will be trained in advanced optical spectroscopy techniques, chemical modeling, and data analysis.  The approaches used to train the student researchers involved with this project will also be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum for Chemistry Majors at Colorado State University.  Thus, this project will generate new insights into an important chemical system and it will generate new approaches to training the next generation of Chemistry majors at Colorado State University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The project titled, "NSF CAREER: Elucidating Surfactin Modus Operandi with 2D IR Spectroscopy," spanned 2013-2019 and had major efforts to develop new microfluidic tools and approaches to 2D IR spectroscopy in order to monitor self-assembly processes of surfactin--a small lipopeptide produced by bacillus subtilis.  In addition, to expanding spectroscopic approaches to investigate complex chemical systems, a portion of this project was focused on improving the mathematics and programming skills of undergraduate chemistry majors at Colorado State University.    The project concluded with major successes in developing new microfluidic technologies to foster interfacing microfluidic tools with 2D IR spectroscopy to produce the first high throughput 2D IR spectroscopy platform for investigating chemical dynamics.  The PI's research group is home to one of the broadest device platforms for mid-infrared spectroscopy and imaging which is a direct result of the support from this project.  Major advancements were also made in uncovering new aspects of hydrogen bond dynamics in model dipeptides and in developing a firm understanding of how differences in self-assembled structures yield changes in vibrational energy transport through self-assembled structures.  These results have been disseminated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed publications, seminars, and poster presentations given by students, post doctoral researchers, and the PI.    The supported project also yielded major successes in developing new approaches to providing undergraduate chemistry majors at Colorado State University with strong foundations in mathematics and programming.  During the course of this project the PI collaborated with a colleague in the Mathematics Department at CSU to develop a two semester mathematics course sequence titled, "Applied Mathematics for Chemists I and II."  The course sequence was designed to teach mathematics in the context of solving chemical problems.  There are two critical aspects of the course design:   1. All mathematics were taught in the context of solving problems rooted in foundational aspects of physical chemistry, and 2. The development of programming skills formed a major component of the course sequence.  Programming skills were taught in Math Lab sessions held during each week of the course.  Thus, the mathematics and programming concepts were taught in parallel and in context of solving chemical problems rooted in topics ranging from kinetics, thermodynamics, statistics, and quantum mechanics.  The course sequence developed during this project is now a crucial piece of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at CSU.  The undergraduate chemistry majors at CSU take this mathematics sequence during their first or second year at CSU.  Thus, they are well prepared for upper division physical chemistry courses in our curriculum.  In general, we are able to spend much less time in our physical chemistry courses devoted to teaching mathematics concepts and instead we are able to focus more attention to teaching physical chemistry topics important for molecular sciences.   The completion of this NSF CAREER project has yielded important advances in nonlinear optical spectroscopy, the development of microfluidic tools to interface with mid-infrared spectrometers and microscopes, and an approach to improving mathematics and programming skills in our undergraduate chemistry majors which has been accepted broadly across our campus.  Each of these advancements will continue to be used in the PI's lab and it is expected that they will be adopted by investigators in other subdisciplines of the molecular sciences.
