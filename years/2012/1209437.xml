<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to study mathematical problems arising in kinetic models centered at the Boltzmann theory. He plans to investigate boundary effects in regularity and hydrodynamic limit problems via recently developed mathematical tools. The PI also proposes to continue his study of stable and unstable galaxy models in astronomy. The PI continues to work on stability of so-called BGK waves in the Vlasov theory. The PI plans to investigate stability of `contact line' problems in fluids using new frameworks. It is expected that new mathematical tools will be developed in these research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kinetic theory and models play an ever increasingly important role in our understanding of various problems in science, engineering and even social science (e.g. swarming). This proposal is set to investigate mathematical problems arising in the study of stable galaxy configurations, dynamics of solar winds,  plasma stability control of wall-plasma interaction in fusion, contact line dynamics for thin-film in material sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many fundamental physical phenomena are described by the solutions to partial differential equations, and mathematical understand of these solutions is crucial in our understanding of the physical world around us. Funded by NSF grant # 1209437, the PI has made significant progresses in his study of several of such important partial differential equations.  The dynamics of a dilute gas is described by the Boltzmann equation. The PI has made new contributions in the understanding of interaction between gas particles and surrounding wall.  In his study of a neutron beam, the PI has discovered a geometric correction in the dynamics of neutrons near a non-flat boundary. This surprising new discovery was overlooked in the existing theory, which has led to wrong prediction. Such a new geometric correction is not only necessary for validity of the existing theory, but it also opens new research lines for the future.  A plasma is a collection of fast moving, charged particles. More than 95 percent of the matters in the universe are plasmas, and plasma study is important in the nuclear  fusion study for future clean energy source. In his study of two-fluid theory for a plasma, the PI continues to explore dispersive effects to construct its smooth dynamics. In a stark contrast to the neutral fluid, there are no shock waves for the ion and electron fluids in two-fluid models.  The dynamics of a fluid near a rigid wall is though to be described by the boundary layer theory from a physical standpoint. However, this has yet been confirmed by rigorous mathematical proofs. The PI establishes the validity of the famous Prandtl boundary layer theory for a steady fluid over a moving boundary.       Last Modified: 08/02/2016       Submitted by: Yan Guo]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
