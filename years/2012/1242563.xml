<AbstractNarration>This long-term research project examines the potential impacts of climate change on migratory birds breeding in northern hardwood forests of the northeastern US. The goals are to determine whether observed behavioral and demographic adjustments are adequate to compensate for climate-induced changes in bird habitat quality. By documenting climate differences over time and space and through long-term food supplementation experiments, the researchers will examine key choices that birds make in response to climatic variation. These choices have important effects on the number of offspring an individual produces as well as on individual survival. The project is being conducted in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In today's rapidly changing world, forests and the birds that inhabit them face a multitude of environmental challenges. Because migratory birds are keen indicators of changing climate, biodiversity, and the health of public lands, results from this study will inform policy and decision makers as well as conservation efforts. Data from this study will be made available to researchers around the world, and results will be featured in the popular press, on public television, and presented in diverse public venues. The project includes strong training components for undergraduate and graduate students as well as for primary and secondary school teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our National Science Foundation project, <em>Behavioral and demographic responses of migratory birds to climate change</em>, was funded from 2007 &ndash; 2017 by the Long-term Research in Environmental Biology program. This work continued and extended a multi-decade study of black-throated blue warblers (<em>Setophaga caerulescens</em>; hereafter BTBW), a temperate &ndash; tropical migratory songbird, on its breeding grounds at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. The research has produced 48 publications to date and resulted in major findings about the behavioral and demographic responses of migratory birds to environmental variation on their breeding grounds. Spring temperature variability among years affected BTBW fecundity primarily through the timing of canopy leaf expansion. BTBW parental investment strategies were shaped by clutch initiation date, food availability, and habitat quality. High food availability was associated with higher within-pair paternity (WPP) and probability of fledging a second brood, particularly in warm springs, but lower extra-pair paternity (EPP). Although our results suggest that BTBW populations may benefit from a warming climate and longer breeding seasons, populations thus far have remained remarkably stable for nearly 50 years at Hubbard Brook. This stability is due to strong site fidelity and density-dependent fecundity as well as alternating years of high nest predation or low food availability with years characterized by early springs and low rodent abundance. Flexibility in the timing of breeding enables BTBWs to maintain a phenological match with their environment. Spring leaf phenology explained &gt;60% of the long-term variation in first clutch initiation dates, whereas food abundance explained only 7%. Clutch initiation dates were not related to the date of maximum food availability, which was highly variable from year to year.
