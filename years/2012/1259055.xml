<AbstractNarration>A fundamental question facing oceanographers is how the ocean carbon cycle will respond to future climate change and how this response will feed back on atmospheric CO2 levels, ocean acidification and climate. The response of the ocean carbon cycle to climate change will involve interactions between physical, biological and chemical processes. Yet for the most of the world ocean we do not understand well the links between these processes often because of a lack of observations. As a result, the magnitude or even direction of change expected for the ocean carbon cycle in the future is unclear. Furthermore, the lack of observations prevents us from validating carbon cycle models used to predict future changes in atmospheric and oceanic CO2 levels.  The Ocean Carbon and Climate Change report (OCCC, 2004) specifically identified the North Pacific Ocean as a high priority region for focusing studies of the processes controlling ocean-atmosphere carbon fluxes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a research team at the University of Washington will take a novel approach to increase the observational data on the spatial and temporal variations of the surface ocean pCO2, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and 13C isotopic composition of CO2.  They will use a new analytical technique, Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS), that allows for continuous measurement of the del13C and concentration of both dissolved CO2 gas and DIC.  A container ship will be employed to make monthly underway measurements of pCO2, DIC and del13C along with O2/Ar, O2, pH, nitrate, chlorophyll and particles at 5-10 km resolution along a North Pacific transect from Hong Kong to Long Beach, California, in particular in the Transition Zone separating the subtropical and subarctic regimes where oceanic CO2 uptake rates are 5-20x higher than the global average.  They will use the underway measurements of pCO2, DIC, del13C and O2/Ar to close the surface CO2 budget in the North Pacific and quantify the impact of sea surface temperature changes, organic carbon export and physical transport of DIC on the air-sea CO2 flux over an annual cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  The proposed application of multiple analytical methods to continuously measure air-sea CO2 flux, biological productivity, DIC and 13C using a container ship sampling platform is innovative and potentially will result in data that could significantly benefit the broader ocean communities involved in carbon cycle modeling and remote sensing. The project is expected to significantly help improve predictions of future climate change. Research results will be incorporated into both undergraduate and graduate course curricula, and there will be active graduate and undergraduate student participation.  Project results will be incorporated into existing outreach talks using faculty and graduate students in the School of Oceanography coordinated through the Program on Climate Change at the University of Washington.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ocean plays an important role in moderating current and future changes to the earthÃ†s climate by adsorbing or taking up carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere.  The result of which reduces the rate at which CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere and the consequential warming of our planet.   There are regions in the western portion of North Pacific Ocean where the ocean uptake of CO2 is particularly pronounced.  A primary goal of our research was to find out what processes caused this enhanced rate of CO2 uptake. There are two likely processes, photosynthesis by plankton and ocean circulation, which result in ocean uptake of CO2.  We used measurements of certain chemicals in seawater that can identify or fingerprint photosynthesis and be used to determine the rate at which it is occurring in the ocean.  These chemical species included dissolve gases like CO2, oxygen (O2) and the rarer isotopic component of these gases (13CO2 and 18O2, 17O2).  We obtained seawater samples on which to measure these chemicals through a collaboration with a container ship company (Orient Overseas Container Line) who allowed us to collect surface seawater samples on their ships as they transited between Hong Kong and Long Beach, CA.   The results of our measurements indicated that the photosynthesis rate increased westward across the North Pacific by almost two-fold.  However, a surprising result was that this increased photosynthesis rate did not result in an increased rate of CO2 uptake.  The reason was that the depth of the surface mixed layer also increased westward by an even greater factor of three-fold which enhanced the bacterial respiration rate more than the photosynthesis rate.  We found that the reason for the enhanced CO2 uptake rate in the western North Pacific was a result mainly of circulation. The most plausible scenario is that the Kuroshio Current, a strong Gulf Stream like current in the North Pacific Ocean, carries warm CO2 depleted surface water northward and then cools and carries high CO2 water eastward which causes a net removal of CO2 from the surface layer of the western North Pacific Ocean.  This removal of CO2 from the surface ocean enhances the uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere in this region.  The importance of this research is that both marine photosynthesis and ocean circulation will likely change in the future as the earth and ocean warm.  Thus global warming will likely impact the rate at which the ocean removes CO2 from the atmosphere.  What we donÃ†t yet know is whether this Ã¦feedbackÃ† will increase or decrease the rate of ocean uptake of atmospheric CO2 and thus accelerate or slow the rate of global warming.
