<AbstractNarration>"Developmental skills linked to math and science achievement: An interdisciplinary data-intensive approach to identification and improvement through experimental intervention" is a 5-year project of the Research and Evaluation on Education in Science and Engineering (REESE) program to better understand and devise (and test) interventions to address deficits in foundational skills that the investigators hypothesize may help to close racial/SES and international gaps in math and science. The hypotheses suggest that deficits in certain early skills underlie a significant proportion of racial/SES math and science gaps, and the large proportion (about one-half) of U.S. students with significant skill gaps underlies a significant part of mediocre international math/science scores. This work builds on prior NSF-supported research. Goals of the proposed research are to: (1) expand longitudinal data sets used to identify and characterize the developmental skills linked to later math/science, (2) strengthen the statistical methodology used to link early developmental skills to later achievement and incorporate analysis at the math/science subscale level, (3) introduce a new statistical methodology - latent profile analysis - to cluster children using their multiple skill distributions into groups with similar profiles and utilize growth models to predict their achievement trajectories as skills change, (4) formalize and shorten the process involved in the design, development and experimental testing of interventions, (5) develop strategies for combining interventions and using multiple interventions for a cohort of children from preschool to early grades that would eliminate achievement gaps, and (6) formulate a comprehensive national strategy and priorities for addressing the skill deficits linked to math/science achievement gaps.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Education research is inherently multi-disciplinary, highly fragmented and characterized by silos of ?disciplinary? research in need of broader integration. School performance has been linked to factors that include genetic characteristics (including gene and gene X environment interactions), characteristics of the brain, a large set of family and community related characteristics, nutrition, sleep and exercise, attitudes, beliefs and physical and mental health characteristics of the student as well as attentive time on tasks, and school, teacher and curriculum characteristics. Research inevitably tries to deal with this complexity in smaller pieces (silos) with researchers from different disciplines focusing on particular silos that fit their disciplinary background. Research funding streams tend to be organized mainly by silos, as well as associated disciplinary journals resulting in a potentially rich literature within silos. A major goal of this project was to develop theories that integrate these various silo pieces into a more coherent picture as well as identifying ways of making research focusing on improving child outcomes more effective and efficient.  This project had three aims (1) improved understanding of how five early domain general cognitive skills (executive function, visuo-spatial, early comprehension-general knowledge, socio-emotional, and psycho-social interventions like growth mindset that impact motivation) are related to long term math, science and reading achievement through analysis of existing large scale longitudinal and/or RCT data sets, (2) strengthening the statistical methodology that can lead to better understanding of these complex skills, and, (3) improving the design, targeting, analysis and funding of early interventions to increase their effectiveness and efficiency, especially for children at risk. To address these aims, we conducted four main activities: 1) we designed and pilot tested a summer skills enrichment program for at-risk children that incorporated interventions linked to executive function, visuospatial, early comprehension, growth mindset, and curiosity skills; 2) we conducted further analysis of the Colorado Core Knowledge intervention that targeted K-3rd grade children?s general knowledge and found statistically significant results for an urban school across four subjects (effect size = 0.8 to 1.0 SD) and small to moderate effects for four subjects for females (effect size = 0.2 to 0.4 SD) from all income groups, but no impact for males; 3) build a strong, interdisciplinary theory and research group comprised of discipline-based researchers in education, psychology, neuroscience, and econometrics working alongside educational practitioners and clinicians; and 4) continued publication and dissemination of methodological, statistical and empirical research on early domain general developmental/cognitive skills, which includes over three dozen empirical articles.  Surprisingly, our research is spawning a new paradigm that may help explain why more progress in not occurring in improving math and science achievement, and in closing achievement gaps for disadvantaged students and under-representation in STEM occupations. Our work suggests that a path to closing achievement gaps in through out-of-school (summer and after-school) programs implemented from pre-k to 3rd grade can substantially narrow, if not close achievement gaps. Deficits in domain general skills may underlie all of these issues, and strong evidence from RCT interventions that improve domain general skills suggests that these improvement transfer to academic achievement.
