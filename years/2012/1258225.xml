<AbstractNarration>Sexual reproduction is the primary mode of reproduction for the majority of Earth's macroscopic life, yet, our ability to predict how environmental stress influences patterns of sexual reproduction is surprisingly limited.  As on-going global change is predicted to have large-scale effects on species distributions and on stress responses of organisms, understanding the mechanisms linking environmental stress to sexual reproduction will be critical to making informed predictions about the biology of future environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the investigators will study the physiological mechanisms linking environmental stress and sexual reproduction in one of Earth's most ancient, widespread, and successful group of plants, the mosses. Field studies will be performed primarily at geothermal fields in Lassen Volcanic National Park, CA and molecular, physiological, and biochemical methods will be used to bridge our understanding of how environmental stress, as well as interactions with other organisms, impacts reproductive success. The investigators will test a series of hypotheses aimed at developing an understanding of the mechanisms that both enable and constrain sexual reproduction in stressful environments and how abiotic and biotic factors interact to impact these mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include, 1) determining how environmental stress impacts sexual reproduction in one of Earth's most widespread plant species; 2) determining the different physiological mechanisms that male and female plants use to cope with environmental stress and ensure sexual reproduction; and 3) developing an understanding of how patterns of sexual reproduction are influenced by interactions with microbial partners.  An increased understanding of how environmental stress impacts sexual reproduction will be key to making informed predictions about how Earth's biotic  systems will cope and respond to the increasing stress of our changing globe. Educational broader impacts include training exceptional undergraduate and graduate students, especially women and underrepresented groups, for careers in research and innovation, and development of new courses designed to fully engage undergraduates in critical thinking, statistical reasoning, and writing and communicating science.</AbstractNarration>
