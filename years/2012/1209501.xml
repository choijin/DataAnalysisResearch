<AbstractNarration>This action funds Kimberlee Marcellus of Drexel University to conduct a research project, entitled "Applying GIS to manage construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste distribution in urban environments," during the summer of 2012 at Nagoya University in Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi.  The host scientist is Dr. Hiroki Tanikawa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research is to advance a successful tracking system to provide a uniform methodology to disclose C&amp;D waste flows and synthesize new and existing data to develop a centralized approach with a geospatial component while answering the question: where do these waste flows occur the most and in what time frame are they expected to enter secondary markets?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are ample construction materials readily available in construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste flows that are sent to the landfill with great potential for recycle and reuse in the U.S.  These flows are not nationally regulated and difficult to evaluate due to a lack of a centralized tracking system, consistent reporting to disclose waste generated and sent to landfills, and knowledge of the exact location of these waste flows. The research conducted at Nagoya University focused on quantifying and locating C&amp;D waste material flows stocked in buildings, roads, and building foundations in an urban environment.  This was realized by creating a map to indicate buildings by location and by waste profile, thereby identifying "future" materials stocked in place.  This research extends a four dimensional Graphical Information System (4D-GIS) mapping technique developed by Tanikawa and Hashimoto (2009) to evaluate potential C&amp;D wastes in urban building stock over time to a local U.S. case study in Philadelphia, PA.   More specific information on buildings, foundations and roadways, waste profiles, as well as map files, was necessary to generate the map specific to Philadelphia, PA.  Data were researched to establish building waste flow profiles and were combined with the map files.  The map was built in ArcGis mapping software, indicating the buildings in two year steps from 2004 to 2012, tracking new and demolished buildings within the study boundary.  Therefore this map indicates the spatial relationship of the buildings, roads, and foundations overtime, quantifying stocked materials over time.   Preliminary results indicate the materials stocked in buildings, roadways, and foundations are consistent with the most common waste fractions of wood, plaster (drywall), metals, asphaltic substances, bricks, block and unsegregated concrete as defined by the US EPA for construction wastes in the US.  These results support the goals of the proposed work to advance a successful tracking system and apply it to a U.S. urban region.  This map and the data collected are part of a larger tracking system the researcher is currently developing and will be accessible for all interested parties to better understand construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste flows.  This transparency will allow for better practices in the future diverting C&amp;D waste flows from landfills and recycling or reusing C&amp;D waste fractions.  This can also influence critical decision makers to divert wastes from landfills and circulate back into local material markets or back to the original manufacturers.  Other benefits of the research experience include: successful completion of the proposed work by the student researcher and the opportunity to interact with Japanese students, professors, other international students, and other fellows in the program during her stay overseas in Nagoya, Japan.  This has empowered the student to create lasting relationships that will enable better opportunities for research and collaboration in the future, adding depth to her academic experience.  The skills acquired from creating maps using ArcGIS software will facilitate the student to advance her research and provide a better, more transparent view of construction waste management in the U.S. with the hopes of reducing C&amp;D waste sent to landfills every year.
