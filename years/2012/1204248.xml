<AbstractNarration>Ethane is one of the most abundant hydrocarbon gases in the atmosphere with emissions from production and use of fossil fuels, from biomass burning, and from a variety of geologic sources. All ethane sources also emit methane, the second most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. However, ethane does not share the biological source of methane, making it a useful proxy for specific methane sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will analyze of paleo-atmospheric ethane (C2H6), using a wet-extraction technique that has been used to measure ethane in Antarctic ice cores, using ice core samples from Summit, Greenland and producing the first northern hemisphere ethane record. The results will enable answers to questions about the importance of geological emissions of methane to the preindustrial atmosphere, and about the timing and magnitude of changes in biomass burning emissions during the late Holocene. In conjunction with measurements on Antarctic ice cores, the data from this project will help establish the north-south interhemispheric gradient of ethane in the preindustrial atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes support for a PhD student and undergraduate researchers in the Department of Earth System Science at the University of California, Irvine. The results will contribute to a PhD dissertation and senior theses of senior undergraduate students. This project will also create summer research opportunities for undergraduates from non- research active universities through the REU site program in Biogeochemistry and Climate Change. The PI and the co-PI will participate in on- and off-campus activities directed towards educating high-school science teachers about climate change and its impacts, including a presentation at the 2011 regional meeting of the National Science Teachers Association. The results of this work will be disseminated via peer-review publications and will contribute to policy-relevant activities such as the IPCC Climate Assessment. Data resulting from this project will be archived in a national data repository.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes   The ice core research laboratory at the University of California, Irvine has been a pioneer of ultra-trace level gas measurements in air extracted from polar ice cores. Ultra-trace gases occur at very low-abundances (1-1000 molecules per 1 trillion nitrogen molecules) in the atmosphere and are extremely difficult to measure in the small amount of air extracted from a typical ice core sample.

The primary objective of this project was to assess the feasibility of ethane (C2H6) measurements in ice core air, specifically in air extracted from Greenland ice cores.   Ethane is the most abundant non-methane hydrocarbon in the atmosphere and a pollutant. It is generally accepted that most of the ethane in the present day atmosphere is emitted during fossil fuel production and use, and atmospheric ethane had to be much lower during the preindustrial era.

Both the biomass burning and geologic sources of ethane emit a variety of trace gases into the atmosphere, including methane (CH4), but neither source is well quantified. Methane is the most abundant hydrocarbon in the atmosphere and the second most important greenhouse gas. Methane also has natural biogenic sources from microbial production in various anoxic environments. Because ethane does not have biogenic sources, it can be used as a tool to study changes in non-biogenic methane sources. This is easier to do in the absence of large fossil-fuel use related emissions, as is the case for the preindustrial atmosphere, as long as very low levels of ethane can be reliably measured in ice cores.   We designed and built a one-of-a-kind ice core air extraction system specifically for this purpose. The system implements a "wet extraction" approach, in which 200-300 gram ice core samples are melted under vacuum to liberate the entrapped air. Both the vacuum line and the extraction chamber are constructed from glass for achieving the cleanliness required for low-level hydrocarbon analysis. The system allowed us to analyze ethane in samples from two ice cores drilled at Summit, Greenland. We also analyzed ethane in contemporaneous ice cores from Antarctica to use measurements from both hemispheres to get a global view.

The results show that ethane levels in the preindustrial atmosphere averaged about 400 ppt and 100 ppt in the high latitudes of the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. Analysis with an atmospheric model shows that geologic ethane sources were 2.2 &ndash; 3.5 Tg (1012 grams) per year while biomass burning emissions were 1.2 &ndash; 2.5 Tg per year in the preindustrial atmosphere, rendering geologic outgassing the largest natural source of ethane. This is significant because it means geologic emissions are also an important natural methane source. It may be that geologic hydrocarbon emissions remained relatively constant over past few hundred years. However, with this study paving the way, future ice core measurements will yield ethane records that extend back into the last glacial period. During time periods of significant climatic change like the glacial/interglacial transitions, gas emissions from geologic sources are likely to vary in response to the changes in land ice sheet cover and sea level. Ice core ethane measurements will provide constraints on just how large such changes can be. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
