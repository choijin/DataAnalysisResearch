<AbstractNarration>The network properties underlying the circuit operations of the brain are still basically unknown.  There is no complex brain in which the overall activity patterns have been observed in real time.  This project will chart the major patterns of information flow in a small, complex brain, and analyze its functional network architecture.  Treating the network in a totally unbiased way, it will generate data from artificial stimulation of brain circuits aimed at surveying the paths of information flow, without regard to why the brain is doing anything or what the output is.  The task will be carried out in an unusual collaboration between experimental and computational neuroscientists and network theorists to chart information flow through the complex, but relatively small, brain of the fruit fly Drosophila and then to analyze the principles of network function that it reveals.  The rationale for focusing on the fruit fly brain is that it is small enough to be possible to monitor its activity completely, but also complex enough (150,000 nerve cells) to offer solutions to the major problems of complex brain networks.  In addition, the entire wiring pattern of its nerve cell connections is well under way and will soon be completed.  The goal of this project is to characterize the network from the perspective of its underlying function and architecture, which not may not be identical with its actual physical layout.  With the data in hand, a search will be conducted for the engineering the design principles embodied in the brain's networks.  From these findings, a general theory of information flow in the brain will be formulated, based on the first broad-based, whole network analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The project aims at mining biological systems for principles and strategies that can be applied to problems in computing and engineering.  At the same time, it tackles a major problem in neuroscience in a technically feasible fashion.  The challenge to understanding the overall strategy used by the brain is the fact that, in its operations, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  This feature, known as an "emergent" property, arises from the  timing and patterns of signaling activity of many thousands of nerve cells. If one had access to that data, and could correlate the activity with the pattern of nerve cell connections brain, it would be possible to formulate a theoretical basis for large-scale neuronal coding.  Understanding this process, in turn, holds substantial promise for applications in computing and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  &lt;br/&gt;Educational Impact:  In addition to providing the opportunity for training of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and  undergraduates, a knowledge of the fundamental strategies of information processing in the brain would allow us to design educational strategies that take maximum advantage of that understanding. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technological Impact:  The principles and theoretical formulation that will emerge from this project also have the potential for providing novel strategies for computer network design and traffic flow of signals, and for engineering strategies that involve networks and information flow.  The experiments outlined for this project constitute a new approach to the question of whether there are fundamental underlying principles of brain network operation which, if discerned, would have wide-ranging implications for applications such as the design and implementation of artificial networks constructed for computing, engineered devices, and communications. In addition, properties such as adaptability, versatility, and robustness are keenly sought in these areas, and efforts are aimed at being able to capture the ability of gene networks to carry them out.</AbstractNarration>

We have, in parallel, developed a novel high-resolution imaging method that allows for monitoring neural activity at a single cell resolution in freely walking flies. We have also developed the capability to perform voltage recording simultaneously from the whole fly brain.     Chiang:  A first draft of the Drosophila connectome at the mesoscopic scale, reconstructed from 12,995 projection neurons (Shih et al., 2015a).  Developed an in situ brain imaging technique (Lin et al., 2015). 3D imaging of 100 intact fly brains in each experiment allows integration of functional data to be accurately registered and associated with 3D images of single neurons.  Identified major pathways that regulate context-dependent CO2 avoidance responses (Lin et al., 2013b), age-dependent temperature preference behavior (Shih et al., 2015b), and retrieval of consolidated anesthesia-resistant memory (Yang et al., 2016). Systematically identified neurons in 3D image databases with an automated soma detection algorithm using a machine learning technique (He et al., 2017).  Developed an automatic segmentation algorithm, NeuroRetriever, to extract volume information of neurons from confocal image data.  Established a database, FlyDriver, a collection of ~10,000 Gal4 expression patterns in fly brains.  Using FHAST detection and brain dissection we have imaged 70,738 single neurons for FlyCircuit.  We found a retinotopic representation of polarized light from the eye to the central complex.

We investigated the use of multivariate statistical approaches. In a similar vein, we developed statistical tools for generative models of brain connectivity that can highlight critical factors that shape anatomical networks.  We carried out a study of information flow on the Drosophila brain connectome, tracking putative paths along which information spreads between sensors and effectors, as well as between all other pairs of Drosophila brain areas. Altogether, our results showed that the organization of brain networks molds the functional properties of individual areas and how they collectively integrate information.    Stevens lab &ndash; A gap in our knowledge is an understanding of how a system comprising noisy components reliably distinguishes, stores, and processes high dimensional information such as odors. Identifying coding and robustness mechanisms is crucial to understanding how the brain reliably represents and learns high dimensional information. In this project, we have two major goals. Using the numerically simple fruit fly, which has been extremely well characterized, as a model system, 1) We elucidate the mechanisms by which high dimensional information is encoded in the mushroom body, and  2) We show that this form of information encoding is robust to fluctuations or noise in synaptic transmission and in neuronal activity. Krioukov lab &ndash;  Drosophila brain network  Is latent geometry of the fruit-fly brain network the mechanism responsible for efficient routing of information between different parts of the brain, and for robustness of such routing with respect to network damage?     1) The fruit-fly brain network has the required structure to be embeddable; 2) We found such embedding using tools developed in the course of this project;  3) The embedding appears to be meaningful as neurons belonging to the same LPU tend to cluster in the latent space; 4) The overall navigability of the embedded network is high; 5) Navigability along biologically meaningful paths, e.g., between sensory and pre-motor LPUs is particularly high and robust; 6) The network contains a significant fraction of an ideal subnetwork required for optimal navigability; 7) A vast majority of paths in the network are downstream, i.e., congruent with respect to the gradient of latent distances; and 8) Network navigability is extremely robust with respect to network damage at both the neuron and LPU levels, thanks to an interplay between the enormous path diversity in the network and the downstreamness of most paths in it.     Overall these results strongly suggest that latent geometry and greedy routing that relies on it are an effective mechanism responsible for routing of information in the fruit-fly brain.
