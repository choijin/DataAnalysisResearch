<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The research objective is to engage pre-college students in fundamental and innovative education and research projects during the summer, using system engineering concepts in solving energy and power system problems. The approach will include lectures on engineering systems, problem solving, simulations and hands-on experiments. The priority will be to attract and nurture these curious students to participate in engineering research projects of national interest. An external review of activities will include industry experts and others. Furthermore, to ensure the goals of the program are met, a professional consultant in engineering educational assessment will provide the matric for tracking and evaluating the impact of the program in the students and their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Develop an innovative engineering system research model for evaluating performance and health of energy and power systems using research fundamental techniques and creativity. The products developed will form a basis for prototypes of needed tools for analysis of energy networks. The work will be done using a team based approach with faculty and graduate student mentors. Case studies to test innovation of the design and validate its robustness will be undertaken by the students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The education and research activity will attract underrepresented minority to participate in the STEM project area. Work done will be posted on the web for other outreach programs. To ensure the goals of the program are achieved, a tracking of the students' performance will be in place and the lessons learned and its impact on the role of youth in the competitive energy economy.</AbstractNarration>

The Intellectual Merits:  The program engages students in fundamental understanding of Electrical Engineering courses such as Networking, Electronics, Electro magnetics, Energy Systems and Artificial Intelligence and ability to do design  and simulation and built products such as micro controller which is needed in smart grid platform for energy management.  Broader Impact  The program has helped to increase the interest of under represented groups into STEM carrier. Many of the participants are enrolled in undergraduate and graduate schools pursing degrees in Electrical engineering and Computer Science.The program has helped us to improve the quality of students pursuing STEM career. Furthermore, several presentations have been made to show the approach and lessons learned to engage students curiosity, creativity and innovation.  The program has helped to improve the Howard University theme of integrating the pyramid approach of quality STEM educational research that involve Precollege, Research Experience for Undergraduate Students (REUs) , graduates students and faculty working together to build infrastructure and network of people to prepare  future engineers, scientists and work force for a competitive and diverse society. Further, the PCES program addresses  several important  research tasks  of high quality involving precollege and REU students  working together under the supervision of  graduate students and faculty mentors.
