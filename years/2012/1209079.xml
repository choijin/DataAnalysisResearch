<AbstractNarration>This action funds Joshua Raymond Williams of Texas A&amp;M University to conduct a research project, entitled "Impact of dam construction on South Korean estuary sediment transport," during the summer of 2012 at Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute in Ansan-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea.  The host scientist is Dr. Hee Jun Lee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to advance the knowledge of the sediment dynamics and stratigraphy of the Nakdong and Yeongsan estuaries.  Anthropogenic engineering in the last century has resulted in episodic river discharge through estuarine dams, significantly impacting the timing and flux of sedimentation within the coastal zones of Busan and Mokpo.  Through high resolution geophysical (CHIRP) and core data, the impact of alterations modifying the sediment trapping efficiency of the estuaries is being determined.  In order to effectively quantify the changes within the Nakdong and Yeongsan rivers drainage basins, a spatially referenced database is being constructed and includes timing and placement of the construction of major dams, available hydrographic data from gauging stations, historical and modern land usage maps and bathymetric charts, aerial photographs, and geologic and soil survey data.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
