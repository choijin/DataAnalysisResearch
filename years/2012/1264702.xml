<AbstractNarration>The PI lays out a number of outstanding issues in lipid-NP interactions that he proposes to address via molecular simulations using an original mesoscale simulation technique using ?ghost tweezers? as a method to explore the energy landscape of interfacial interactions of lipid membranes with nanoparticles. If successful, the project can provide important insights for as varied fields as biomedical imaging, drug delivery, lipid-mediated synthesis of nanoparticles, and biosensing with nanoparticle-lipid bilayers systems.</AbstractNarration>

Lipid bilayers constitute the foundation of cell membranes, which nanoparticles can adhere to and even penetrate through. Nanoparticles are employed as intracellular delivery vehicles for controlled release of genes and membrane-impermeable chemicals. This process involves internalization, or intake of drug-containing nanoparticles by cells associated with nanoparticle encapsulation by cell membrane and trans-membrane penetration. At the same time, an explosion in production of nanomaterials and their commercial applications is raising multiple health-related concerns regarding NP toxicity, which in many cases is related to irreversible adhesion of inhaled or digested nanoparticles to cell membranes leading to membrane rupture and cell apoptosis. The specifics of interactions of nanoparticles with lipid membranes are still poorly understood, and their effects are hardly predictable by using classical approaches of interfacial and colloid science, or by employing currently available simulation tools. A better understanding of interfacial interactions between nanoparticles and lipid membranes is necessary for developing new biomedical nanotechnologies as well as for evaluating health threads related to nanoparticle manufacturing. The fundamental goal of the project aims at elucidating the mechanisms of nanoparticle interactions with lipid membranes and  establishing structure-property relationships between the nanoparticle size and hydrophobicity and its ability to adhere and penetrate through lipid membranes by means of specially desinged original multiscale molecular simulations. Intellectual merit of thr project brings about the following nost important and far-reaching methodological, new physical insight, practical and outcomes.  Methodological outcomes:  Development of the ghost tweezers mesoscale simulation technique that mimics the lab experimentans with optical tweezers; the ghost tweezers method enables calculations of the forces and energies landscapes of interactions of nanoparticles with lipid membranes and and other complex interfacial systems.  Development of novel computational set-ups for investigating and quantifying the interactions of nanoparticles with lipid membranes that enables modeling of the equilibrium and dynamics of nanoparticle encapsulation, release, and translocation through lipid membranes. Establishment of the atomistic models and interaction potentials for lipid-silica systems accounting for inherent molecular level roughness of substrate surface that provides an adequate computational environment for computational modeling. Development of the thermodynamic theory of the heterogeneous nucleation of holes in nanoparticle-loaded membranes its implementation for quantifying the dynamics of nanoparticle-induced ruture of lipid membranes   New physical insight:  New methodological developments outlined above enable direct computational investigations of interfacial interactions of lipid membranes with nanoparticles and provide a better fundamental understanding of the physico-chemical mechanisms of nanoparticle adhesion and trans-membrane transport, including:  Elucidation of the mechanisms of the intake and release of hydrophobic nanoparticles by lipid membranes and quantifying the energy barriers for these interfacial transitions depending on the nanoparticle size. Elucidation of the mechanism of rupture of nanpparticle-loaded membranes due to heterogeneous nucleations of a hole at the NP-membrane boundary; quantifying the nucleation barriers, limits of membrane stability, and  dynamics of membrane rupture.  Discovery of the existence of a nanometer thick hydration  interlayer in supported lipid membranes. Elucidation of the mechanisms of nanoparticle adhesion to solid substrates grafted with polymer brushes depending on polymer brush conformation controlled by the solvent quality, grafting density, and nanoparticle-polymer affinity   Practical outcomes:  Established structure-property relationships between NP size and degree of hydrophobicity and its adhesion and penetration through lipid membranes and mesoscale simulation methods resulting from this project will help materials scientists guide their experiments and optimize the structure and chemical modification of NPs to provide desirable adhesion properties Developed original GT method for calculating the free energy landscapes for interaction of nanoparticles with soft interfaces implemented in the open source software pakcages DL-MESO and LAMMPS and made vailable for the use by the scientific community   Broder impact:  The results of this research will have a significant interdisciplinary impact, since it addresses currently unresolved topical problems that are common across different interfacial phenomena in physico-chemical, biological, medical, and physiological systems, and it focuses on developing original modeling tools that can be further adapted and modified for simulation and optimization of biomedical systems and biomedical technologies, such as intracellular drug delivery using nanoparticle carriers, and also for determining physico-chemical mechanisms and structural factors affecting nanoparticle toxicity.
