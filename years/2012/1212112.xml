<AbstractNarration>This interdisciplinary research project will investigate the sustainability of coastal communities that are especially vulnerable to natural resource losses and natural hazards.  The investigators will focus on the Lower Mississippi River Basin in Louisiana, which is one of the most vulnerable coasts in the continental United States and the world.  Over the years, this deltaic region has endured multiple threats and disasters, such as land loss, subsidence, sea-level rise, flooding, hurricanes, and oil spills.  The disappearance of land is a critical problem in the southern part of the region. During the past decade, significant population and economic growth has occurred in the northern part of the study area, whereas the southern part surrounding New Orleans has experienced population and economic decline.  A pressing question is whether southern coastal Louisiana reached a tipping point that makes it too costly to sustain.  If so, has the same type of economic and ecosystem functions gradually migrated to the neighboring region to the north?  The researchers will quantify and explain these changes using a coupled natural-human system approach, and they will evaluate the implications of those findings for future planning and mitigation. The four objectives the researchers will pursue are (1) to develop methods to assess the sustainability or resilience of a coastal system; (2) to develop a system-level model to capture and quantify the dynamic linkages among the major natural and human components; (3) to compare and contrast the resiliency between the northern and southern parts of coastal Louisiana so as to understand the resiliency control factors; and (4) to simulate future scenarios for planning and decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will assess the sustainability of the lower Mississippi River basin in Louisiana using a coupled natural-human system approach.  It will increase basic understanding about the key factors affecting the sustainability of a coastal system and how these key factors interact at a system level.  The comparison between the two systems in coastal Louisiana will provide new knowledge regarding how the two systems have been coupled in the past that enhances understanding of system interactions in the present and facilitates projections for the future.  The set of sustainability assessment and modeling tools and software developed in this project will be valuable educational as well as decision-making tools for students, other researchers, and decision makers.  The project will engage a wide audience, including K-12 students and teachers from underserved schools, local governmental officials, environmental groups, and the public. Project findings will inform policy makers and the public about how to increase the resilience of the region, and they will provide scenarios to better plan for the future.  The findings also will provide new insights regarding other deltaic regions around the world that are faced with similar types of threats and challenges.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.</AbstractNarration>

Some     of the key results and their implications are as follows.</p> <p>(1) We developed a Bayesian network     to explain how different factors are interconnected to affect population     changes. By doing so, we advanced resilience analysis by extending static     resilience assessment to dynamic linkage analysis. The Bayesian network shows that hazard threat and per capita damage are     the most influential variables on population change. However, people are     not likely to move if only given a certain level of hazard threat, but they     are more likely to leave if more damages are incurred from these disaster     events. The policy implication is that enhancing the ability to minimize     damages could be an effective strategy if changing hazard threat is not     impossible. The derived network can be used to generate scenarios on how     changes in different input variables propagate through the Network that     ultimately affect the probability of population change. These scenarios will     aid policy making regarding population growth and disaster recovery in the     region. In addition, we developed a system dynamic model to examine the     feedback relationships among all components. Simulation of population     change from 2010 to 2050 using the model shows that areas in the coastal     south continue to suffer population loss, whereas areas in the northern     part of the Delta will have steady population growth. In other words,     without mitigation and adaptation or any changes in the current condition,     the areas in the South will unlikely be sustainable as population decline     is expected to continue.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;(2) Hurricanes can act as both an     erosional and a depositional agent in a complex deltaic environment. For     our rapidly subsiding study region, long-term shoreline retreat was     accelerated during periods of frequent hurricanes due to storm surge     processes on the coast, which exacerbates the rate of land loss. Further     inland, overbank flooding caused by excessive hurricane rainfall can     deliver more sediments to the sediment-starved wetlands and result in     increased accretion rates, thereby contributing to land building. These     results have implications for the use of freshwater diversion as a strategy     for coastal restoration in southern Louisiana.</p> <p>(3) We now have the knowledge and     confidence about riverine sediment quantity, spatial and temporal distribution,     and land area that the available sediment could create. In the past,     engineering of the Mississippi River has focused on flood control and     navigation safety, negatively altering sediment transport, supply, and     distribution. Future river engineering practices must also consider     developing effective sediment management strategies and solutions for     mobilizing coarse sediments trapped in the upper reach of the Lower     Mississippi River downstream for coastal restoration and new land building.</p> <p>(4) Large river sediment diversions     could contribute sediments to maintain basin-wide elevation and improve     soil organic carbon sequestration capacity, implying that large sediment     diversion could build new land under rising sea-level and subsidence.</p> <p>(5) The finding that low-elevation     public infrastructure (roads and utilities) has greater effect on building     intensity suggests that infrastructure is critical to human adaptation to     changes in the natural environment.</p> <p>(6) Energy     is a dominant component of the Louisiana economy that has and will be     impacted by coastal erosion, subsidence, and potential climate change     issues. The vulnerability analysis of energy infrastructure underscores the     likelihood that the changes in the natural environment, if left unaddressed,     will expose critical energy infrastructure and likely disrupt the energy     systems to which they are connected. These disruptions will have important     implications for the regional, U.S., and global energy economies.</p> <p>(7) Communities with fewer socioeconomic resources and     government capacity face obstacles in implementing flood hazard mitigation     measures such as participation in the Community Rating Scores program,     making them even more vulnerable to higher insurance cost and damage.</p> <p>In addition to new knowledge gained and their policy     implications, the broader impacts of the project are: (1) The tools and     methods developed in this research are widely applicable to examine similar     issues in vulnerable coastal regions worldwide. Databases developed for the     study region such as elevation, subsidence rate, and land cover change     would be useful to future studies. (2) Involving at least five postdoctoral     researchers, 21 PhD students, 14 master students, and a number of     undergraduate students in the research has helped improve their research     skills and develop a deeper understanding of the complexity of     natural-human dynamics in analyzing coastal sustainability. (3) Our     workshop on Knowledge Sharing for Delta Resilience Community of Practice helps     improve bi-directional communication between stakeholders and researchers,     which is important for translating science into practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/10/2018<br>      Modified by: Nina&nbsp;S&nbsp;Lam</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1212112/1212112_10218360_1544492774274_Outcome-figure2-CNHFramework--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1212112/1212112_10218360_1544492774274_Outcome-figure2-CNHFramework--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The Mississippi River Delta coupled natural-human dynamics framework"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1212112/1212112_10218360_1544492774274_Outcome-figure2-CNHFramework--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The Mississippi River Delta coupled natural-human dynamics framework"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Mississippi River Delta coupled natural-human dynamics framework</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lam NSN. 2018.
