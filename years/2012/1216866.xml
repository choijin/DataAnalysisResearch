<AbstractNarration>Binary neutron star inspiral is the most certain source of gravitational waves detectable by Earth-based observatories like the US LIGO project, and simulations of such binaries should facilitate eventual detections. These simulations require initial conditions: solutions to the initial value problem of general relativity for the coupled gravity-matter system. The conformal thin sandwich method is an excellent approach for solving the initial value problem; however, although not an intrinsic assumption of the method, in practice the approach has assumed conformal flatness (as have other valuable approaches). Conformal flatness yields unphysical junk radiation. By numerically constructing helically symmetric solutions to the Einstein equations, the PI will extract initial data (or conformal thin sandwich trial data) which does not rely on conformal flatness, and therefore contains the correct initial gravitational wave content. The mixed PDEs arising from the helical reduction of the Einstein equations (or their approximation in the post-Minkowski formalism) will be solved with innovative techniques: sparse modal spectral-tau methods with new preconditioning strategies. In part, these strategies may rely on randomized algorithms for the interpolative decomposition. Spectral methods deliver superb accuracy for smooth problems(neutron star spacetimes are smooth almost everywhere), and sparsity affords a fast matrix-vector multiply when using a Krylov-subspace method to iteratively solve a linear system. Whereas the preconditioning of nodal (collocation) spectral methods is well studied, less is known about modal preconditioning. Our techniques have been successfully applied to models of the binary neutron star problem. Moreover, the problem's physical structure has already been explored with different, but limited, techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to combine two sets of techniques (each already developed) and further develop the first set (spectral-tau methods), in order to obtain new results for a leading problem in gravitational wave physics. The PI will develop these mathematical methods by applying them to the specific neutron star problem described above. This strategy of specificity is often used in the development of techniques, which then prove to be more general. Because the scientific problem is of great interest, much is known about it, and results therefore exist withwhich comparisons can be made. These comparisons facilitate the development of mathematical algorithms. Conversely, new mathematical methods deliver more and/or better solutions which enhances scientific understanding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In scientific and engineering modelling, computers are often used to solve partial differential equations, the mathematical foundation      for many physical phenomena, for example the propagation of waves. Such modelling can be done in relatively straightforward ways ("finite difference" or basic "finite element" methods), but a more  sophisticated class of techniques, "spectral methods," yield high accuracy for some problems. In our work we adopt a refined spectral method that features sparsity; in effect, the first step toward a solution is taken through the mathematical structure itself, without requiring significant computer computation. Our sparse spectral approach had earlier been shown effective for some ordinary differential equations, but not for the much more difficult challenge of partial differential equations.  It is often best to develop new mathematical/computational methods in the context of a specific physical problem. In our case the problem involves binary neutron stars. A binary pair of such stars emits gravitational waves and spirals inward, a process that is described by the partial differential equations of Einstein's general theory of relativity. The evolution in time of the inspiral can currently be computed well with highly developed computational infrastructure. What is missing is a realistic starting point, the initial configuration.  The partial differential equations that must be solved for the initial configuration have proved to be a stubborn challenge, and researchers have typically used a solution that is mathematically convenient, but far from appropriate physically. This starting point evolves into a correct solution, but it means that the evolution computation must be carried out for a longer time than would be necessary for a more physically correct starting solution.  We have endeavored to use sparse spectral methods to solve for a physically correct initial approximation. The magnitude of the challenge has required that the problem be broken into a sequence of ever more advanced projects. The first of these was the solution not of the Einstein equations, but of Newton's equations for the initial binary configuration. The main simplification in this model is that there are no waves. Solving this "simple" problem turned out, as anticipated, to reveal many important details and to set up much of the infrastructure for a more realistic model. Indeed, many unanticipated problems developed in the Newtonian model, in particular, those involving the stellar surface, that were not particularly "Einsteinian."  The outcome of this work is a highly precise set of computer programs that solves for initial neutron star structure. We have not solved the Einstein equations themselves, but rather an approximation ("post-Newtonian/post-Minkowskian") to Einstein's equations. This approximation should be more than adequate for an improved initial configuration. We have, therefore, partially achieved our goals for this work. Next steps include looking at the physics inherent in the initial solutions themselves, and collaborating with researchers who need initial configurations for their codes that evolve these initial configurations.
