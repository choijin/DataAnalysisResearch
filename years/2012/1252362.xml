<AbstractNarration>The School of Mathematics of the Georgia Institute of Technology will host the ``First International Conference on Dynamics of Differential Equations" in Atlanta during  March 16-20, 2013. See http://www.hale-conf.gatech.edu&lt;br/&gt;The conference is dedicated to the memory of Professor Jack K. Hale -- a world renowned leader and pioneer in many areas of dynamics of differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of the conference are to foster scientific exchanges, promote interdisciplinary studies, enhance international collaborations, and train graduate students and young researchers in various aspects of dynamics of differential equations. The scientific focus of the conference centers around dynamics of ordinary, partial, and functional differential equations, as well as related modeling and computational methods.  The conference includes four two-hour long tutorial sessions, two Hale memorial lectures, thirteen plenary lectures, and four parallel themed sessions with morethan one hundred invited and contributed presentations, and a poster  displays.  It is expected that between 150-200 people will take part in the conference, nearly half of them from the USA, and at least one-third graduate students or young researchers, which have been specifically targeted as participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will serve both as a training opportunity and as a moment to foster and strengthen stable international collaborations.  For example, associated to the conference, there are four 2-hour long tutorials aimed at graduate students and advanced undergraduates, and there will be large number of participants from the Americas, Europe, and Asia.  The emphasis of this conference will be on the mathematical side of dynamical systems, rather than the applications or experimental side of it. Although a substantial number of plenary and invited talks will be related to applications, the overall goal is for new mathematics to emerge as a result of the challenges presented by the applications themselves, rather than on their phenomenological aspects.  Graduate students and young researchers are expected to comprise at least one third of the 150-200 expected participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On March 16--20, 2013, the School of Mathematics of the Georgia Institute of Technology  hosted  the "First International Conference on Dynamics of Differential Equations," on the Georgia Tech campus.  The main goals of the conference were to foster scientific exchanges, promote interdisciplinary studies, enhance international collaborations, and train graduate students and young researchers in various aspects of dynamics of differential equations.   The scientific focus of the conference centered around dynamics of ordinary, partial, and functional differential equations, as well as related modeling and computational methods.  The conference included four two-hour long tutorial sessions on March 15, two Hale memorial lectures, thirteen plenary lectures, and four parallel themed sessions with more than one hundred invited and contributed presentations, and a poster display.  We single out three scientific highlights, which we believe display well the scientific and training aspects of the conference.  Hale Memorial Lectures.  These were delivered by Genevieve Raugel (University of Paris-Sud), on the topic of "Local and global stability, Kupka-Smale and Morse-Smale properties: from finite to infinite dimensional dynamical systems." Tutorials.  The day before the official conference start, there were four tutorials --each of two hours-- on "KAM theory", "Delay DEs", "Computational topology", and "Dynamics of PDEs". The tutorials were extremely well received by the more than 100 people in attendance. Poster Session.  Twenty five attendees (20 of them being graduate students or post-docs) presented a poster on their research.  Each poster was evaluated by 3 judges and the highest scoring poster was awarded a plaque and acknowledged during the closing ceremony.   In excess of 250 people attended the conference, more than 100 being graduate students, post-docs, and young researchers, who were specifically targeted as participants.  Attendees came from 23 different countries and 27 different states of the union, with more than half of the participants from the USA.
