<AbstractNarration>The "Transforming Undergraduate Education in Engineering-- Phase 1: &lt;br/&gt;Mobilizing the Community for Change" project run by the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) is initiating a process to identify the critical components of engineering curricula, pedagogy, and educational culture to support the education of engineers over the next several decades. The explosion of technology over the 20th century, epitomized by advancing from the first flight in 1903, to landing a man on the moon in 1969 has radically changed the world we live in. Engineers, scientists, mathematicians and technologists have been central to the development. Technology has transformed the typical engineering workplace and practice; where drafting boards were commonplace, now laptop computers have increased the precision and work volume of engineers. Pencil and paper calculation performed with a pocket calculator has given way to sophisticated computer simulations. Practicing engineers working today have little need for many of the facts and methodologies that were essential just a decade ago and now have skills and knowledge that was difficult to anticipate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately engineering education, if measured by the amount of sustained change over the past several decades, has not kept pace. In fact, some would say engineering education is not even in the race. If it is natural for education to follow a changing society then this project is perfectly timely. If education should lead society, then this project is even more critical. Content, pedagogy, and university culture has remained relatively static for 50 years and although there have been minor changes; the most common engineering classroom is still passive lecture. Content, although modernized in many ways, still clings to the time honored traditional prerequisite materials of science and highly sophisticated mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students have also changed. Today traditional students are so accustomed to technology that they have radically different ways to interact with the world and society. Students find more information via the Internet than the library. They stay in touch with each other more than previous generations even when distantly separated, or in the car. Use of technology feels natural and comfortable, unlike most engineering educators and practitioners who have had much of the technology thrust upon them and adapted. Because of these radically different behaviors, it seems obvious to expect that future students will have an equally radical view of what is important and makes sense. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is studying many questions. Is there value in dropping some time honored content? Are such areas all critically important to engineering practice today or were they critically important to the way engineering was performed in 1980? Is it critical for students to solve equations by hand with pencil, paper and a calculator or can they understand them even when a computer solves the equations? Is it possible to understand a square root without being able to compute it to six decimal points? Or can students grasp the big picture of problem formulation and solution while delegating the tedious work to technology? Are future students likely to understand material in radically different ways from existing engineering practitioners? How can these different ways of thinking be harnessed to create the ideal engineering graduate? If the engineering education culture feeds the strengths of students, can engineering be transformed into an exciting program of study that will draw students in rather than requiring massive recruitment and retention programs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is bringing together a key group of engineering education experts in designing a large-scale change effort to address important questions on the future of engineering education in the United States. American Society for Engineering Education staff are collecting and synthesizing ideas from the attendees in advance of the workshop, ensuring that face-to-face meeting time is optimized. The results of this initial planning process are being used to develop a full-scale plan for effecting change across all engineering disciplines in cooperation with a wide range of stakeholders from industry, education and government.</AbstractNarration>

In order to ensure that the engineering portion of STEM is producing students with the right skill sets to take on the challenges of the next century, the American Society for Engineering Education, with funding from the National Science Foundation, began a series of workshops to review what students are learning and how they learn it.  The workshops will involve different groups involved in engineering education, including employers, students, faculty, and more. The first workshop focused on employers and was held in May of 2013, convening approximately 50 people, most from private industry.  Prior to the meeting, the participants from industry and universities completed a survey on the most important engineering knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) for today and 10 years from now, and the perceived quality of preparation in these areas shown by todayÆs graduates. Responses depict a profession under pressure from several directions, with current training unable to meet certain existing industry needs and badly out of sync with the requirements expected in 2023. For instance, they show todayÆs students to be very weak in having an international and global perspective, something of less importance now but the single most important knowledge area in 10 yearsÆ time, in the opinion of respondents.  Likewise, studentsÆ weak foreign language skills, while a minor drawback now, could be a serious impediment in the future.  Participants from universities sought to determine which of the KSAs required by industry were really important and what could truly be embedded into the curriculum, as opposed to being another "add on."  Better communication skills, for example, cannot come at the expense of technical competence. The attendees from academia admitted to a need for more experiences across the engineering disciplines &ndash; a civil engineering student should be involved in projects involving chemical engineering, for example &ndash; which can be challenging to implement.

In addition, faculty should be rewarded for their ability and leadership in making curriculum changes that industry and academia agree on being necessary, which may be a departure from the current set of reward criteria.

The closing session captured important themes to carry forward and produced nine statements, including: "We canÆt just throw money at the problem;" both industry and academe have to be equally committed to a partnership; thereÆs a recognition that achieving solution directly relates to national competitiveness; and "WeÆre adding more and more, so we need to CUT something out &ndash; may need to reprogram some existing dollars and stop some existing activities."
