<AbstractNarration>Darwin's theory of evolution explained that millions of species are related, and dealt biologists and paleontologists the enormous challenge of discovering the branching pattern of the Tree of Life. Work on this great challenge is producing a map of species-relatedness through Earth history, and answering questions such as "what is the closest relative of a species?" and "what species make important products?" To do this scientists draw on all heritable features, including genotypes (e.g., DNA) and phenotypes (e.g., anatomy). Studying phenotypes, however, has remained complicated and slow, because it has not been revolutionized by computer science and engineering innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A team of biologists, computer scientists, and paleontologists will extend and adapt methods from computer vision, machine learning, crowd-sourcing and natural language processing to enable rapid and automated study of phenotypes for the Tree of Life on a vast scale. The three-year goal is to release large phenomic datasets built using new methods, and to provide the public and scientific community with tools for future work. Planned is the training of teachers and students (kindergarten - postdoctoral levels) and the engagement of "citizen scien-tists." Enormous phenomic datasets, many with images, will fill an important public interest in biodiversity and the fossil record.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to explore ways to accelerate the gathering and digitizing of information on microscopic algae called diatoms.  Diatoms make about half the oxygen we breathe, are the basis of the food web in the world's oceans, lakes and rivers, and are important indicators of environmental health. Diatoms make intricate glass shells which scientists use to identify them.  These shells form thick fossil deposits (diatomaceous earth) which geologists use to identify potential mineral bearing geological strata.  The shells themselves are mined for many industrial purposes.  Although scientists have studied diatoms for over 150 years, most ot the scientific literature on them remains on paper and is yet to be digitized.  Where it has been digitized, it is not standardized in anyway.  This project sought to automate several procedures, including standardization of species descriptions so that the literature could be better read and organized by computer through artificial intelligence approaches, or so that the public could participate in gathering and interpreting diatom information through crowd-sourcing.  We have developed a model lexicon to enable the translation of species descriptions of a widespread and common diatom genus (Cyclotella), in order to better understand the promise and problems with this approach.  We learned that while this is possible, the available software will likely need a great deal of expert "training" to be effective.  The most promising results came from the crowd-sourcing experiments where we learned that an untrained "crowd" could determine coding of diatom characters with moderate accuracy.  We learned that we can probably increase accuracy in this if the diatomist community develops standards for magnification and orientation.    A graduate student was trained at UT in this technology.  A publication on the genus Cyclotella is forthcoming, as is a report on the crowd-source experiment.  The student learned valuable bioinformatic skills that will prepare her for her desired career in industry.         Last Modified: 09/01/2016       Submitted by: Edward C Theriot]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
