<AbstractNarration>The research to be conducted in the Fayum area of northern Egypt is part of an ongoing, international collaborative paleontological project that involves American and Egyptian scientists. The Fayum area is world-famous for its vertebrate fossils, which range in age from about 37 to 29 million years of age, and for its unique capacity to document the evolution and adaptation of our early anthropoid primate ancestors during a critical phase in mammalian evolutionary history, the early Oligocene period of climatic cooling.  Included among the remarkable ~8 million-year-long interval preserved in the Fayum record are the most complete remains of Paleogene anthropoids, the oldest undoubted anthropoids from Africa, and the oldest known relatives of strepsirrhine primates such as lemurs and lorises. The information that has been revealed by such complete fossils has given scientists unparalleled insights into early anthropoid biology, ecology, and phylogeny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of three years of fieldwork, the team of American and Egyptian vertebrate paleontologists, paleobotanists, and geochemists will collect additional vertebrate and plant fossils, and sample for paleoclimatic data (stable isotopes) throughout the Fayum succession. These data will be employed to test various hypotheses relating to the evolution and biogeography of primates and non-primate mammals during the later Paleogene, as well as the evolutionary response of African plant and animal communities to local environmental changes deriving from a significant period of global climate change. The questions to be addressed are of broad paleoanthropological and paleontological significance, and include the core specific aims of 1) the illumination of early anthropoid evolutionary history in Africa and documentation of the mammalian communities and environments in which our early anthropoid ancestors lived; and 2) analysis of the responses of vertebrates and plants to the climatic alterations known to have occurred near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conduct of the research will support the continued development of an American-Egyptian scientific collaboration that will train several graduate students and early career scientists from the US and Egypt.  Student training will be integral to all phases of the research, and will maintain a strong tradition of incorporating students from underrepresented groups in science.  The specimens and databases to be obtained will be readily shared and accessed, enhancing research and educational infrastructure well into the future.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary goal of this project was to test hypotheses relating to the evolutionary origins of 1) the primate group that includes living monkeys, apes, and humans (Anthropoidea) and 2) the primate group that includes living lemurs, lorises, and bushbabies (Strepsirrhini), through recovery and analysis of fossils from sites in the Fayum area of Egypt that date from 37 to 29 million years in age. A secondary goal of the project was to employ high-resolution computed tomographic methods (also known as micro-CT scanning) to analyze the internal and external structure of fossils recovered from the Fayum area and share these specimens with the general public as digital models that can be easily downloaded or virtually examined through the digital data archive MorphoSource (www.morphosource.org). Our research on Fayum anthropoid fossils over the course of the last three years has provided new support for the hypothesis that the last common ancestor of all living anthropoids was present in Afro-Arabia toward the end of the middle Eocene time period, approximately 40 million years ago, and that over the next 15 million years, a series of anatomical changes, including important increases in body size and relative brain size, ultimately led to the appearance of the anthropoid group that includes Old World monkeys, apes, and humans (Catarrhini). Previous work by other researchers, as well as members of our research team, has already established that catarrhines continued to diversify -- primarily in Africa -- over the course of the next 25 million years. Our results also support the hypothesis that the South American monkeys (Platyrrhini) are derived from an African group, implying trans-Atlantic dispersal during the late Eocene, when the western coast of Africa was closer to the eastern coast of South America. Fossils from the Fayum area have also established the presence of ancient lemur- and loris-like primates in the Eocene of Africa, and these fossils lend new support to the hypothesis that the last common ancestor of lemurs and lorises was also present in Africa early in the Eocene epoch, and that the lemurs of Madagascar are derived from an ancient African stock. Our use of high-resolution computed tomography to document these fossils has allowed us to share these fossils virtually -- not only with students and professional paleontologists but also any interested members of the general public, providing an unprecedented level of access to fossil specimens that previously could only be viewed by graduate students and/or professional paleontologists in a small number of museum collections. Several young researchers were involved in this project at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, and the CT scan data that have been generated have already contributed to multiple Ph.D. dissertations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/23/2017<br>      Modified by: Erik&nbsp;R&nbsp;Seiffert</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
