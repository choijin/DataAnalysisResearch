<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This award supports experimental research on strongly correlated electron phenomena in novel rare earth and actinide (f-electron) intermetallic compounds. These phenomena, which include, for example, heavy fermion behavior, quantum criticality, non-Fermi liquid behavior, Kondo insulator behavior, unconventional superconductivity, and exotic forms of magnetic order and quadrupolar order, constitute a formidable challenge to current paradigms of condensed matter physics. The ground states of strongly correlated f-electron materials can be "tuned" by varying an external control parameter such as chemical composition x, pressure P, and magnetic field H, resulting in rich and complex temperature T vs. x, P, and H phase diagrams.  The objectives of this research program are to characterize the extraordinary electronic phases found in these materials, determine the conditions under which they are formed, identify underlying microscopic mechanisms, and test relevant theories.  This project will provide support for the education of a postdoctoral scholar and a graduate student who will gain expertise in a broad range of technical skills available in the laboratory, including the operation of state-of-the-art equipment for physical properties measurements at low temperatures.  The study of strongly correlated electron phenomena serves to train the next generation of condensed matter and materials physicists who will contribute to the government, industrial, and/or academic domains in their careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This award supports experimental research on strongly correlated electron phenomena in novel rare earth and actinide (f-electron) intermetallic compounds.  Strongly correlated electron phenomena include, for example, high temperature superconductivity, magnetism, and other exotic quantum phases that present a formidable challenge to the current understanding of solid matter.  By improving the basic understanding of correlated electron phenomena, the results obtained from this experimental research program have the potential to impact important problems relevant to applications.  For example, there is a myriad of applications of high temperature superconductivity, including low-loss electrical power lines, electrical generators and motors, sensitive magnetic field sensors, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetically levitated trains. This project will provide support for the education of a postdoctoral scholar and a graduate student who will gain expertise in a broad range of technical skills available in the laboratory.  The study of strongly correlated electron phenomena serves to train the next generation of condensed matter and materials physicists who will contribute to the government, industrial, and/or academic domains in their careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Basic research and technology:  Correlated d-electron transition metal- and f-electron lanthanide- and actinide-based quantum materials comprise a rich reservoir of new and novel properties of fundamental scientific interest and potential applications in current and future technologies.  These d- and f-electron quantum materials are found in the periodic table of the elements starting with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium and involve filling of the 3d, 4d and 5d electron shells, respectively, and with lanthanum and actinium and involve filling of the 4f and 5f electron shells, respectively.   In this project, the physical properties of correlated d- and f-electron quantum materials were measured in order to characterize the electronic interactions which produce striking phenomena of fundamental interest and relevance to technology. The approach involved the synthesis of materials (particularly single crystals) and measurement of their electrical, thermal, and magnetic properties as a function of temperature, composition and magnetic field.  The insights gained through this work will provide the scientific underpinnings that could lead to technological advances in a number of areas; e.g., thermoelectric cooling and electrical power generation, permanent magnets, magnetocaloric refrigeration, magnetic sensors, magnetic information storage, quantum computing, and superconductors with high superconducting critical temperatures, critical fields, and critical current densities.  For example, applications of superconductivity impact several important sectors, including basic science (e.g., superconducting magnets for research, particle accelerators), transportation (e.g., magnetic levitation of high speed trains), energy (e.g., generation, transmission, and storage of electrical energy), medical diagnostics (MRI magnets, SQUID magnetic sensors), and electronics.  This work will result in the training of a new cadre of scientists and technologists who will contribute to the development of new technological applications.  The investigations that were carried out yielded significant information concerning the phenomena of superconductivity (SC), antiferromagnetism (AFM), quantum criticality, and a so-called "hidden order" phase, whose identity has eluded researchers for more than three decades, in the correlated f-electron compound URu2Si2,  Examples of the studies that were performed included: (1) interrelationship between unconventional SC and AFM in the Pr1-xEux&shy;Pt4Ge12 system; (2) three-dimensional T-x-P (T = temperature; P = pressure) phase diagram for the URu2-xFexSi2 system in very high magnetic fields, revealing a unique relation between the applied magnetic field H and the temperature To below which the "hidden order" phase occurs; (3) P-dependence of the N&eacute;el temperature below which itinerant AFM occurs in the recently discovered compound TiAu; (4) relationship between unconventional SC, AFM, and quantum critical behavior in the Ce1-xSmxCoIn5 system.   Education, training and professional development:  The principal investigator and his group members were involved in community outreach activities, including laboratory tours for high school and undergraduate students, science demonstrations at local elementary schools, and popular lectures.  The study of correlated d- and f-electron quantum materials in this laboratory serves to train the next generation of condensed matter and materials physicists who will contribute to the academic, industrial, and/or government domains in their careers.  Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students gain expertise in a broad range of technical skills.  Undergraduate students, many of whom become interested in the laboratory through the principal investigator?s classes and the group?s outreach efforts, comprise a significant portion of the laboratory?s membership.  These undergraduates include student interns that work in the lab during the summer, UCSD students enrolled in independent study, and UCSD underrepresented minority students, such as McNair Scholars.  Most undergraduates who work in our laboratory go on to receive advanced degrees.   Society and the general public:  During the course of this project, our group was engaged in community outreach activities, including laboratory tours for high school and undergraduate students, science demonstrations at local elementary schools, and popular lectures given by the principal investigator and group members.  Certain aspects of the research performed under this grant were communicated to the general public through various websites, popular lectures, and outreach activities.    Collaborative research:  An important aspect of the field of correlated electron research is its inherent interdisciplinary nature, requiring the cooperation of experts performing complementary types of measurements.  This collaborative network forms the backbone of an international research community.  This laboratory has a proven history of developing and strengthening scientific collaborations on a national and worldwide scale with universities and national laboratories. Through these cooperative efforts, the laboratory?s materials synthesis and properties measurement capabilities were made available to the broader scientific community, both on- and off-campus.  Our group benefited from the specialized facilities, equipment, and instrumentation available through large research centers such as the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Florida State University, the University of Florida, and Los Alamos National Laboratory, and neutron or photon scattering facilities available in the US national laboratory system (e.g., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, National Institute for Standards and Technology). Measurements were also performed abroad at facilities in Canada, China, Europe, and Japan.          Last Modified: 07/28/2018       Submitted by: M. Brian Maple]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
