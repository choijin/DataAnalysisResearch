<AbstractNarration>The Virginia Tech Site of the I/UCRC for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC) seeks to further build its momentum from its initial phase of operation through a Phase II award.  Reconfigurable computing, promises to realize performance potential of underlying hardware system resources in a highly adaptive manner, maximizing performance while minimizing implementation challenges such as system size, weight, cost, and power. Areas of research thrust for the next phase of the Virginia Tech CHREC site include accelerator research, open-source tools, HPC-GPU and cross-compilation technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leadership in reconfigurable hardware and system platforms represents a critical area for national competitiveness of every growing cyber-enabled economy. Working with its Industrial Advisory Board, the Virginia Tech site of the CHREC center along with the center as a whole intends to serve as a catalyst that brings leading organizations together to define common goals, methods, and standards.  Research results are planned to be integrated into the university educational process with expanded programs at multiple levels in engineering. Activities are planned to be structured to attract a diverse set of students and faculty, including underrepresented students via several minority recruitment programs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The NSF I/UCRC CHREC center was created at an opportune time, and provided utility to the scientific, industrial, and government communities.  When it was created, there was little connectivity between government, industry, and academia in regards to the various aspects of reconfigurable computing.  This center served as a catalyst for joining groups of people in these diverse areas.  Over the life of the center, there have been many instances where members were enlightened to solutions to what they deemed unsolvable problems, and likewise, instances where certain problems thought to be solved were discovered not solved at all. The participating universities, namely Brigham Young University, George Washington University, The University of Florida, The University of Pittsburgh, and Virginia Tech,  were unified in providing (1) service as the world?s first and foremost multidisciplinary research center in reconfigurable high-performance computing as a basis for long-term partnership and collaboration amongst industry, academe, and government; (2) direct support for the research needs of industry partners in a cost-effective manner with pooled, leveraged resources and maximized synergy; (3) enhancement to the educational experience of a diverse set of high-quality graduate and undergraduate students; and (4) advancement in knowledge and technologies of this innovative field of study while ensuring research relevance with rapid and effective technology transfer. The center has matched many students with member employers, advanced the state of the art in reconfigurable computing, published broadly in diverse journals and conferences, provided many prototype solutions to its members. To the reconfigurable computing community, the center served as a focus of many leading researchers, and a powerhouse of graduating talented students in this domain.
