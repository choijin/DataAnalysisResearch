<AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to lay a theoretical foundation for all aspects of virtual full-duplex wireless networks and to build prototypes using readily available software-defined radios and evaluate the performance. Commercial and military radios of today are half-duplex and cannot transmit and receive simultaneously over the same frequency band due to overwhelming self-interference.  This project challenges the paradigm by proposing full-duplex and virtual full-duplex design of the physical, medium access control and network layers based on emerging technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One key technique, called rapid on-off-division duplex, allows all nodes to transmit and receive simultaneously by choosing an on-off mask and letting each node transmit through the on-slots and receive over the off-slots. Over a single frame, every node can simultaneously broadcast a message to all neighboring nodes and receive a message from every neighbor at the same time.  The transformative solution removes a major constraint on the transmission schedule and thereby increases the throughput and decreases network overhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit lies in transformative network architectures and designs that enable nodes to transmit and receive information at the same time, contrary to conventional wisdom of separating transmission and receptions in time and/or frequency. This challenging research will draw from and, in turn, add to, communication theory, signal processing, information theory, and network theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are radically new wireless standards with robust and significantly improved performance, involving undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge research, and integrating new research results into the curricula.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI and team completed this project titled "virtual full-duplex wireless networking."  Full-duplex networking here refers to the situation where multiple wireless terminals all transmit and receive at the same time over the same frequency band.  This is in contrast to the half-duplex paradigm adopted by most current communication systems.  In-band full-duplex networking is challenging because each terminal must be able to receive and decode information reliably in presence of extremely strong self interference due to its own transmissions.  Due to the limited spectrum available for wireless communications and networking and the increasing demand for capacity, there has been growing interest in full-duplex communications as a method to significantly enhance the performance. While the impact of full duplexing on a single link is relatively well understood, the impact of full duplexing on a network of wireless nodes is not well understood.  During the course of this project, the PI and team have studied various full-duplex techniques, including the virtual full-duplex technique invented by the PI and collaborators.  Information theoretic scaling laws have been obtained for wireless networks where many nodes transmit and/or receive at the same time over the same frequency band.  Progress has also been made in the understanding of the impact of duty cycle constraints on channel capacity.  New methods for compressed sensing have been proposed, contributing to the related discipline of signal processing.  The PI and team have also developed a testbed using software radio devices to validate the proposed transmission and detection methods. Some of the methods form the basis of a patent application.  The PI has co-edited the IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in Communications Special Issue on In-Band Full Duplex Wireless Communications and Networks.  Published in this special issue is a tutorial and survey paper titled "In-band full-duplex wireless: challenges and opportunities," of which the PI is a co-author.  While training for programming software radios, the PI and team participated in the DARPA Spectrum Challenge and finished as one of 15 finalists out of 90 teams nationally.
