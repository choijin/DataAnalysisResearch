<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to initiate geodetic measurements of plate motion in the Cascadia subduction zone. Three sites off the Oregon coast, one on the incoming plate to measure relative plate motion and two on the continental slope to measure motions related to fault motions and deformation will be monitored for horizontal displacement at the cm scale. These will be the first offshore monitors of upper-plate Cascadia motion and fault behavior. This work will lead to a better understanding of earthquake and tsunami risk in Cascadia. It implements a new autonomous approach to data collection. It places permanent benchmarks on the seafloor so that monitoring can continue into the indefinite future. Transponders will be recovered and reused and become part of instrument pool that can be used to extend these studies in the future</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Cascadia Subduction Zone lies along the coast of Northern California, Oregon and Washington.  The subduction zone is a significant geohazard being the source of great earthquakes and tsunami.    The Cascadia subduction zone is formed by an oceanic tectonic plate, the Juan de Fuca plate,   moving downward and beneath the overriding continental tectonic plate, the North American plate.  The interface surface along which the two plates interact or rub is called the megathrust fault.  As the Juan de Fuca moves downward, friction on the megathrust bends and contracts the overriding North American plate.   The rate of buildup or strain is at the level of a centimeter or so per year, but eventually this stored energy is released causing the earthquake and tsunami.  The last great event occurred in Jan. 1700 and was powerful enough that the tsunami waves were recorded in Japan.  Since that time the US Coast has become heavily populated.   Land-based GPS can measure the slow accumulation of strain buildup, but the coastal sites are too far from the submerged shelf of the North American plate to provide reliable estimates far offshore.  It is this offshore region where the tsunami generation may be greatest.  This project uses GPS measured at the sea surface on a small robotic platform, combined with acoustic ranging from the platform to sensors on the seafloor. This technique is called GPS-Acoustic and can measure the centimeter-level motion of the seafloor.  The goal is to better document how much the seafloor is displacing and aid assessment of the potential size of the future tsunami.  This project looked for how fast the outer toe of the deformation front on the Cascadia Subduction Zone is moving relative to the interior of the US Continent.  To seafloor GPS-Acoustic sites were established a sites at approximate 50 miles offshore Newport Oregon at (44.4N) and Grays Harbor, WA (46.7N).   The GPS-A data were collected using a remotely piloted wave- and solar-power sea-surface glider.   In 2016 and in 2017, the Wave Glider completed missions of over 30 days, traveling over 300 miles to visit each site.  While at each site the Wave Glider continuously swam in a small circle above each seafloor transponder array for about 3-5 days.  These data were used to measure the position of the two sites in 2016 and again in 2017.  It was found that each site is moving a couple of centimeters per year to the east.  This movement may be elastic and possibility released in a future megathrust earthquake and contribute to generation of a tsunami.   More visits to collect data and more sites are planned for future projects.          Last Modified: 07/27/2018       Submitted by: C. David Chadwell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
