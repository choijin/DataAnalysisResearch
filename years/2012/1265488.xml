<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Christopher Pigge of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa will investigate new approaches to construct aza-heterocyclic ring systems via manipulation of alkylidene dihydropyridines (anhydrobases) and related intermediates.  While anhydrobases are established compounds, their use as synthetic intermediates has not been extensively explored.  In this project both conventional bond forming methods as well as organotransition metal-catalyzed processes (e.g., palladium, rhodium, gold) will be developed in order to harness the synthetic potential of pyridine and related aza-heterocyclic anhydrobases.  Development of asymmetric metal-catalyzed transformations also will be undertaken.   &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This work could lead to more efficient methods for the general preparation of various nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring systems.  These types of compounds are ubiquitous in biologically active natural products and pharmaceuticals.  Moreover, aza-heterocyclic derivatives are also common building blocks of functional materials such as organic light emitting diodes and organic semiconductors.  Thus, successful execution of this project will impact numerous fields of important contemporary chemical research in areas ranging from organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry to materials research.  In addition, this project will provide excellent training of undergraduate and graduate students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Funds from the NSF supported research aimed at developing new synthetic methods for construction of nitrogen-based heterocyclic ring systems.  Nitrogen heterocycles are important components of numerous biologically active small molecules and functional organic materials.  Consequently, uncovering new and more efficient methods to prepare heterocyclic compounds from abundant and inexpensive precursors is an important objective in modern synthetic organic chemistry.  This project focused on  harnessing the concept of dearomatization as a synthetic tactic for manipulation of aza-aromatic ring systems, such as pyridines and imidazoles.  We demonstrated that substituted pyridines and imidazoles undergo smooth conversion to dearomatized alkylidene dihydropyridines and alkylidene dihydroimidazoles (imidazolines) under mild reaction conditions.  We then showed that these dearomatized intermediates were capable of participating in a range of bond forming reactions that included intramolecular aldol-like condensations, novel [3+2] cyclocondensations with aryl diazonium salts, and Pd(0) catalyzed Mizoroki-Heck reactions.  This last reaction manifold is especially versatile as elaboration of several distinct alkylidene dihydropyridine substrates afforded important isoindolinone, oxindole, and pyridoisoindolinone derivatives.  Asymmetric variants of these Heck cyclizations were also realized using chiral Pd(0) catalysts.  Specific target-directed synthetic applications of alkylidene dihydropyridines also were explored as a means to construct the core bis(piperidine) ring system found in several bioactive marine alkaloid natural products.  Broader Impacts  This research advanced the field of synthetic heterocyclic chemistry through identification and development of new reaction manifolds available to common aromatic ring systems.  This work enables concise and stereocontrolled construction of heterocyclic motifs with recognized importance in materials and biological chemistry and appeals to researchers in academia and industry.  This work additionally contributed to enhancing science infrastructure through human resources development.  Support for this project led directly to two Ph.D. dissertations and provided research opportunities for several undergraduate student participants.  To date, the project has generated five publications in print and 13 presentations at professional meetings and conferences.                Last Modified: 10/04/2017       Submitted by: F.
