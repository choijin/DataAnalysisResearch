<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for students to participate in the Eleventh Summer School on Exotic Beam Physics at Argonne National Laboratory, August 4-11, 2012. The school is designed for graduate students, senior undergraduate students who are actively involved in research, and postdocs (within 2 years of their degree). The school will consist of morning lectures and hands-on activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an opportunity to present their research. The aim of the summer school is to nurture future scientists so that the community will have sufficient manpower to effectively use Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In years to come, substantial progress in low-energy nuclear physics will have a broad impact on society, ranging from our understanding of the origin of the elements to the enhancement of national security. An important element in this progress will be to extend the study of nuclei into new domains of isospin. This will require new radioactive ion beam facilities, together with advanced multi-detector arrays and mass spectrometers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The study of unstable isotopes that have unusual ratios of protons to neutrons is one of the frontiers of science. Investigating nuclei away from the valley of stability is critical for understanding the synthesis of nuclei in stellar explosions and provides unique insights in the nature of the nuclear forces. The scientific progress is driven by the development of rare isotope beams in present and next generation radioactive ion beam facilities.  The physics of exotic nuclei is a very rich field, influencing our knowledge on subjects as diverse as many-body theory, halo nuclei, the inner structure of neutron stars, and the super heavy elements. Such research also drives numerous applications in materials science, medical diagnostics, and national security. The Exotic Beam Summer School Series, which was held for the eleventh time from August 5-10, 2012, is aimed at training and educating young researchers (undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral researcher) in these areas.

In addition to the above two program elements, the participants in the school also presented their own research to their peers and the lecturers. The interaction between the students and the experts present is an important component of the program.  In 2008, the United States Department of Energy approved the design and construction of the new National User Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University (http://fribusers.org/2_INFO/info.html). FRIB will provide intense beams of unstable nuclei for a wide variety of studies in nuclear structure, reactions, astrophysics, fundamental symmetries and applied sciences.
