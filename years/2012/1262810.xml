<AbstractNarration>This award funds the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Toledo.   The site will support ten students/year selected from across the US in the ten week summer research program. The department provides a great diversity of cutting-edge research opportunities (both experimental and theoretical) for undergraduate students in: Astrophysics; Atomic/Molecular/Optical Physics; Biological/Health/Medical Physics; and Condensed Matter/Materials Science Physics (with specialization in thin films and photovoltaics). Opportunities exist for some of the research projects to be conducted with their faculty mentors at national facilities (NREL, DCT, NTF, or similar). The research projects are chosen such that the student projects will lead to eventual publication in the appropriate professional research journals. REU students have coauthored over 50 refereed publications (16 in the past five years alone). The REU students are also encouraged to present their research at professional meetings.  The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             The NSF-REU program in Physics and Astronomy, directed by Dr. Richard Irving and Professor Thomas Kvale, gave enhanced research opportunities to 53 undergraduate students from 28 colleges and universities in 13 states from Summer 2013 through Summer 2018.  Funding for summer 2013 included this grant (PHY-1262810) and a No-Cost Extension of our previous grant (PHY-1004649).  Summers 2014 and 2015 were funded by this grant (PHY-1262810).  Summers 2016 and 2017 were funded by No-Cost Extensions of this grant (PHY-1262810). Student participants were chosen competitively out of 476 applications from students in 43 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.  We continued our collaboration with Itasca Community College for two positions each summer.  This collaboration has been very successful.  They have arrangements with Iron Range Engineering and Minnesota State University - Mankato, and in some cases the students identified themselves with those institutions.  In keeping with the spirit of the proposal, we involved students at other community colleges and/or small liberal arts schools to fill a significant number of positions each year.              Students were required to attend two seminar series during the ten week summer session.  One was a university-wide series (UGR2980) that concentrated on the safe and ethical conduct of research.  Speakers were from the Office of Research Administration, Office of Safety and Health, Honors College, Research Compliance, Writing Center, and other speakers.  The other seminar series was a "Bag Lunch" series that involved physics and astronomy faculty and/or other professionals discussing state-of-the-art research in their fields.  In their summer evaluations, the participants indicated their research skills increased significantly through their experience.              The students conducted meaningful research projects with faculty members in the areas of: atomic physics (both accelerator-based experimental and theoretical atomic structure), plasma physics through a collaboration with the Nevada Terawatt Facility, condensed matter physics, medical physics, and astrophysics.  The student experiences have been very encouraging.  The students were required to give a Mid-term talk, a Final Talk, and a written Research Abstract.  The benefits of these requirements are manifest in the students being co-authors of at least 12 refereed or submitted, archival journal articles and at least eleven presentations at conferences in 2013-2018.  Please see the Final Report for publications and presentations details.       Last Modified: 08/08/2018       Submitted by: Richard E Irving]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
