<AbstractNarration>Recent discoveries that demonstrate the wide spectrum of fault slip along subduction megathrust faults prompt important questions about the relationships between large earthquakes, small earthquakes, slow slip, and non-volcanic tremor.  In many areas, the deep portion of the fault that lies at the transition between the fast and slower slip mechanisms is out of view, sitting offshore, away from nearby monitoring.  However, an existing seismic and geodetic network along the Oaxacan segment of the Middle America subduction zone provides an excellent dataset for use to quantify earthquake occurrence and source parameters in an area that has experienced M &gt; 7 earthquakes, tremor, and slow slip events.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will address several hypotheses related to the spatial and temporal relationships between slow slip, tremor, and large earthquakes. These include determining 1) if a sharp transition in seismicity characteristics exists along the megathrust as events approach the downdip seismicity limit and the area of episodic tremor and slip, 2) if slow slip events produce stress loading in adjacent regions that lead to increased seismicity rates and changes in source characteristics of small earthquakes, and 3) if large earthquakes are associated with temporal changes in earthquake occurrence and source characteristics in adjacent regions due to stress changes. We will employ several seismological techniques, including the construction of a uniform event catalog, focal mechanism determination, rupture duration and stress drop calculations, and investigation of seismicity rates along specific fault patches, to address these hypotheses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goals of the project revolve around a better understanding of the deep roots of the earthquake-producing region of the Mexican subduction zone, with applicability to other global subduction zones. Thus the results of the study will produce societal benefits related to earthquake hazards, particularly in providing information needed for improving temporal variations in probabilistic seismic hazard. The outcome of this project will include data products disseminated to a wide international community through meeting presentations, publications, and archival in the relevant data repositories.  The project will train 4 US based graduate and undergraduate students as well as provide capacity-building seismological training for 2 Mexican students.  Another outcome of the project will be 2 educational lessons that will be disseminated through online educational activity portals.</AbstractNarration>

In any case, results from this study add to the growing collection of published accounts that indicate slow slip promote some form of seismic activity and may be a common pre-earthquake signature.  Additional studies are warranted to estimate the time-varying hazards associated with slow slip.   The efforts to develop improved ways of detecting earthquakes swarms have turned out to be quite helpful for discerning another kind of seismicity: earthquakes induced by enhanced oil and gas operations.  Analysis using earthquake template matching via high-performance computing to do cross-correlation of vast arrays of seismograms have revealed that human-induced earthquake sequences can be driven by the fluid injection associated with wastewater disposal or hydraulic fracturing.  This has revealed opportunities for new insights into how changing fluid pressures influence fault slip that is a key hypothesis for the origin of tremor, slow slip, and traditional earthquakes.  Research is showing that increasing fluid pressures lead to slip on optimally oriented pre-existing faults.  The sequences also show swarm-like behaviors that differ from traditional earthquakes in stable continental regions, such that the template matching form of earthquake detection could be used as a technique for realtime detection of human-induced seismicity.  The outcomes of this project have been broadly disseminated to a wide international community through meeting presentations, publications, and archival in the relevant data repositories.  The project has provided scientific training and mentorship to 4 graduate and undergraduate students as well as a postdoctoral researcher.  In addition, this project has contributed to several publications and presentations related to improving geoscience education and training.  Topics have included the development of an active-learning online course and the effect of immersion on online learning success.  This project has also had a direct impact on improving training methods for the IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) Internship program and USArray Data Processing and Analysis Short Course, which are some of the premiere research training experiences in the geosciences.
