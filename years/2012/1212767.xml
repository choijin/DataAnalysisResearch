<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program supports Professor Robert H. Grubbs of the California Institute of Technology for the development of a family of catalysts for the inter-conversion of olefins by the olefin metathesis reaction.  NSF support for this work began decades ago with the determination of the basic mechanism of the reaction.  Today these catalysts find themselves widely used in academic research and in significant commercial applications.  These advances include the discovery of new inorganic complexes that show improved activity or selectivity.  A number of limitations that remain: the present grant focuses on new catalyst systems, a better understanding of regiochemical and stereochemical issues and the observed low efficiency of the catalysts in the presence of ethylene. These complexes operate by a novel mechanism, and new families of ligands and complexes will be constructed for these catalytic transformations as the mechanism is better understood.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The ruthenium complexes that induce the metathesis of acyclic olefins can also be used for the ring opening polymerization (ROMP) of cyclic olefins.  Numerous well-defined polymers have been produced using these complexes as living initiators for the synthesis of block and highly functional polymers.  A special class of polymers that is of interest for theoretical reasons and may have interesting applications are polymers without ends-cyclic polymers.  A set of ruthenium complexes has been prepared that produce cyclic polymers from cyclic monomers.  To be able to test standing theories, polymers that are pure cyclics without linear contaminations are required.  A method has been developed that should result in pure cyclics with a range of molecular weights.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts and benefits to society, these catalyst systems are currently being used for an array of successful commercial applications.  New pharmaceuticals that require the closure of a large ring using these catalysts are being developed and are in clinical trials.  A bio-refinery is being constructed that utilizes the complexes for the conversion of seed oils into chemicals and fuels.  In the production of new materials, polymers that require the NSF catalysts in their production have been used in the automotive market for a number of years.  In addition, new polymer composite materials are being produced for the construction of large-scale mechanical devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organic compounds are needed for a wide array of applications from pharmaceuticals to new polymeric materials.  Organic products are prepared from other organic molecules through specific transformations.  Many of these processes involve a catalyst- usual a trace compound that directs the transformation of one compound into another.  the catalyst is not consumed in the process.  Over the past decades, organic chemistry and especially medicinial chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and plastic science has been transformed by the discovery of new catalysts.  For example, polyethylene is prepared using a catalyst.  Our group has been devoted to the discovery of catalysts for the formation of olefins, a special kind of organic molecule containing two bonds between carbons.  These types of molecules are involved in almost all important organic products.  The double bonds can be formed either with the two attached groups on the same side, cis, or on opposite sides, trans.  The catalyst we developed earlier gave mixtures of the two types of olefins.  During the last granting period we developed catalysts that would efficiently prepare cis double bonds from simple starting materials.  These catalysts were discovered by broad screeining and by theoretical calculaations.  These complexes are now licensed for the preparation of pheromones, a natural method for the control of inssect pests.  Earlier discovered metathesis catalysts are being used for the synthesis of molecules that were part of the first cure for Hepetitus C and they are now being used for the manufacture of polymer to insulate pipes for the recovery of oil from deep wells.
