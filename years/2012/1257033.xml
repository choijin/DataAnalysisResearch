<AbstractNarration>How biological communities respond to environmental change is determined both by the tolerances of individual species and by interactions among species, such as competition, predation, and mutualism. However, little progress has been made in understanding how biotic interactions influence species distributions or in incorporating their effects into models of species assemblages at regional to continental scales. This project will develop and test new methods that consider species interactions by accounting for patterns of species co-occurrence to predict how species and biological communities respond to changes in climate. Observed changes in the distributions of plants and mammals in eastern North America during the last 21,000 years will be combined with independent simulations of past climates to examine how the strength and direction of species interactions vary across broad regions and in response to changes in climate. These data and analyses will also be used to test whether ecological models that consider species co-occurrences have a better predictive ability than existing approaches that model species individually and to identify possible limits to our ability to predict how biological communities may respond to future changes in climate. Results will help address the grand challenge of understanding how changes in climate alter natural systems and their associated ecosystem services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond providing important insights into how species interactions influence the response of biological communities to changes in climate and our ability to predict these responses, this project will also provide cross-disciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students and early-career scientists in global change ecology, paleoecology, and statistical modeling. Minority and first-generation undergraduate students will be recruited through campus programs at Frostburg State University and the University of California-Merced. Public outreach to rural communities will be conducted through public lectures and engagements at open house events in an underserved region. In support of open, reproducible science, all publications, datasets, and computer code will be made publicly available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The primary goal of this research was to address several long-standing ecological questions regarding: (1) the importance of biotic interactions in determining species distributions at broad spatial scales, (2) how the influence of these interactions changes across space and as a function of climate change, and (3) whether "community-level" models (CLMs) that consider species co-occurrence patterns in addition to climate produce improved predictions of changes in the geographic distributions of species and species assemblages in response to changes in climate beyond those obtainable from existing single-species distribution models (SDMs).  To answer these questions, we used datasets of observed changes in biotic communities from fossil pollen assemblages spanning the past 21,000 years. We developed a variety of models that predict the distributions of species and the resulting patterns of community change across space and time. We showed that associations between species are not necessarily stable across space and time, but CLMs that include information from these associations in addition to climatic predictors generally outperformed SDMs that only included climate, especially when forecasted to highly novel climates (Figure 1). This suggests that the highly novel climates expected by the end of the 21st century will challenge ecological forecasts, but that by accounting for co-occurrence between species, predictions from CLMs may be more robust than those for single-species models (Figure 2).   In the course of completing this research, this project supported the training and research of six early career scientists, two of them women in a STEM field, one a Nepalese native, thus broadening the participation of underrepresented groups: David Lorenz (research scientist at UW), Diego Nieto-Lugilde (former postdoc at UMCES, now a faculty member at University of Cordoba), Kaitlin Maguire (former postdoc at UC Merced, now at the USGS), J. Eric Williams (graduate student at UC Merced), Kevin Burke (graduate student at UW-Madison), and Kavya Pradhan (former undergraduate from Randolph College, now a graduate student at UMCES). We also presented and discussed our results with the broader public through participation in public lecture series, open house events, radio shows, and visits with local schoolchildren in the regions around the collaborating institutions.  We promoted collaboration and advancement of global change research by making our data available to colleagues around the world in advance of their publication and putting data into open scientific databases such as Dryad and Neotoma. All data and code stemming from our publications are publicly available.              Last Modified: 06/28/2017       Submitted by: Jessica Blois]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
