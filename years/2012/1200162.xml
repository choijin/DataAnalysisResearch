<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to advance the design of algorithms for solving simulation-optimization (SO) problems on parallel computing platforms. SO problems are optimization problems where the objective function and constraints can only be observed through a stochastic simulation. Virtually all current algorithms for solving SO problems assume a single processor as the computing platform. However, the trend in computing devices is towards multi-processor computers, not just at the laptop/desktop level, but all the way up to cloud computing environments. This research will explore how to design algorithms for solving SO problems that exploit such environments, to attempt to return high-quality solutions at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to a new line of research - parallel SO - with ensuing improvements in the design and implementation of SO algorithms on parallel computing platforms, thus making this currently computing-intensive technology much more accessible and effective. SO already holds an important place in application fields, as evidenced by the variety of SO problems in an existing testbed &lt;www.simopt.org&gt;. The proposed research will provide further opportunities for major impact through reliable solution of important SO problems. This research is part of a continuing thrust to enhance the implementability of SO by creating methods, theory, and computational tools to facilitate the automatic solution of larger and more realistic SO problems.</AbstractNarration>

The website is meant only as a ``single stop" for available modern solvers; it will provide no guarantees on the functioning or the efficacy of the solvers. The following are signifcant results from the investigations that were undertaken. 1. For large scale finite SO context, we have been able to fully characterize the nature of Monte Carlo  sampling within optimally evolving SO algorithms. Recall that "optimally evolving" means ensuring that the  probability of selecting an incorrect solution decays to zero at the fastest possible rate with respect to the  Monte Carlo budget. Importantly, our characterization leads to a general heuristic of sampling that we call  SCORE. SCORE essentially asks to sample a system (or a policy) in inverse proportion to its optimality gap  after appropriate standardization, and guarantees optimality of budget allocation as the Monte Carlo budget  becomes large. SCORE can incoporate expected value constraints as well, yielding something close to a  general philosophy of sampling for large scale finite SO. 2. For integer nonconvex SO problems that involve stochastic constraints, we have devised an algorithm  called cg-RSPLINE which combines a search procedure that mimics Line Search along with a carefully  constructed procedure involving constraint relaxations. Broadly speaking, cg-RSPLINE solves a sequence  of constraint-relaxed sampled problems using a procedure that mimics Line Search for deterministic optimization.  The constraint relaxations become progressively less stringent. The resulting sequence of solutions converge  with probability one to a global solution assuming that the intial solution for the sampled problem is drawn from an  appropriate distribution. cg-RSPLINE has been extensively tested and is arguably the most efficient algorithm of its  kind.  3. The third (revised) objective of the project was the development of stochastic analogues of the Line Search and  Trust Region methods aimed at identifying critical points of a smooth function using only a zero-th order or a  first-order function oracle. Line Search and Trust Region methods are especially relevant because, over the last  few decades, they have become indispensable as techniques for numerical deterministic optimization. We have  designed ASGM and ASTRO --- "stochastic versions" of the Line Search and Trust Region methods, respectively,  that are provably convergent on stochastic optimization problems where the objective function is a mathematical  expectation that can only be estimated using observations from a large database or by executing a Monte Carlo  simulation. We have characterized the (sampling) complexity of both ASGM and ASTRO.
