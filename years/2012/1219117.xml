<AbstractNarration>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms are important tools throughout the physical and biological sciences, with applications ranging from simulating new materials to reconstructing phylogenetic trees. They explore a space of states of a physical system, or potential solutions to a problem, by making a series of small changes. One of our main challenges is knowing whether the algorithm has run long enough to reach equilibrium, i.e., if it has spread throughout the space enough to obtain good estimates of important quantities. Here, there is a major divide between theoreticians and practitioners. Physicists use non-rigorous techniques that are much more optimistic than what theorists know how to prove. On the other hand, they are often based on deep ideas about the physical properties of these systems and their asymptotic behavior, and are backed up by numerical experiments. The main theme of the research under this award is to answer the question: how can we bridge the divide between these two camps?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will focus on three areas where stronger bridges can be built. In two-dimensional spin systems, they will use power-law decay of correlations to prove polynomial mixing times at critical points, and to show that we can efficiently "remix from equilibrium" even below phase transitions where worst-case mixing times are exponential. They will give a rigorous understanding of the efficiency of cluster algorithms widely used in physics, which are believed to avoid or reduce the phenomenon of "critical slowing down" as we approach a phase transition. Finally, the PIs will go beyond traditional Markov chain analysis techniques on discrete state spaces, and prove new results on systems whose states are continuous, such as the hard-sphere model in the plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is cross-disciplinary between physics and computer science. MC algorithms also offer an excellent opportunity to involve undergraduates in the research process: they can implement algorithms used in physics and computer science, and gain a "hands-on" feeling for their performance in theory and practice. They can also produce educational applets to let other students, in turn, see these algorithms in action.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 1953, physicists at Los Alamos National Laboratory needed to better understand how systems of many particles behave.  It wasnÃ†t enough to pretend that these particles form an "ideal gas," meaning that they fly past each other without interacting. Instead, the physicists needed to study realistic particles that interact with attractive and repulsive forces.  When there are a small number of particles in a large space, they have plenty of room to flow around each other, and they form a liquid or gas; but when a large number of particles are packed densely together, they jam together and form a crystal.  This was also the early days of computing. Using the MANIAC computer, they ran a simulation where particles move around randomly, updating their positions according to their attraction and repulsion.  By running this simulation for a certain amount of time, they obtained estimates of the pressure in the system and its physical properties.  This kind of simulation, known as a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, has become a common tool throughout science, including in chemistry, molecular biology, and materials design.  But how do we know whether these simulations are accurate?  Computer scientists and mathematicians have developed techniques for determining when Markov Chain simulations have reached equilibrium, so that they sample fairly from all possible states of the system.  However, most of our existing techniques only work for simple systems where particles jump around on a grid.  Realistic physical systems, where particles can move continuously in two- or three-dimensional space, still pose a major mathematical challenge.  We have developed techniques that let us analyze these continuous systems.  In particular, we can prove mathematically that particles remain in a liquid or gaseous state up to a certain density.  Below this density, the Markov Chain quickly reaches equilibrium, and distant particles have very little effect on each other.  At this density, a "phase transition" occurs, analogous to when water freezes and the molecules lock each other into a rigid configuration.  Above this point, even distant particles are strongly correlated, and both the system and the algorithm take a long time to reach equilibrium.   The same phenomenon can occur in search and optimization problems in computer science.  When we are trying to solve a problem with many variables, where the problem makes conflicting demands on them, there can be a phase transition where the problem suddenly becomes impossible to solve: we can no longer satisfy all the demands at once.  We have located these transitions exactly in some classic search problems, where overlapping groups of variables are required to obey conflicting constraints.  Our work shows that physics and computer science have a lot to say to each other.  Both of them deal with how surprising global behaviors can emerge when many simple entities interact with each other&mdash;the point at which a liquid freezes into a solid, or where a complex problem becomes impossible to solve.
