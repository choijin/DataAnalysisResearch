<AbstractNarration>1232965&lt;br/&gt;Bonazza&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will provide partial travel support to American graduate students and young scientists who will participate in the 29th International Symposium on Shock Waves. The meeting will be held at the Memorial Union of the University of Wisconsin-Madison from Sunday, July to 14 to Friday, July 19, 2013. There will be ten plenary lectures by national and international invited speakers. A total of 313 contributed papers have been submitted and they will be distributed among six parallel oral sessions in each of four daily periods, and a poster session. Oral sessions will include: Medical/Biological Applications; Industrial Applications; Blast Waves; Chemically Reacting Flows; Detonation and Combustion; Facilities; Flow Visualization; Hypersonic Flow; Impact and Compaction/Condensed Matter Physics; Ignition; Magnetohydrodynamics/Plasmas; Multiphase Flow; Nozzle Flow; Numerical Methods; Propulsion; Shock Waves and Rarefied Flows; Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability; Shock/Boundary Layer Interaction; Shock Propagation, Reflection; Shock Vortex Interaction. Some of the oral sessions will be reserved for a "student competition" whose winner will receive an award for best paper. The funds for the awards will be provided by the International Shock Wave Institute.</AbstractNarration>

Up to six parallel sessions were run every day, in 21 different areas including: Blast waves, Chemically reactive flows, Detonation, Facilities, Flow visualization, Hypersonic flows, Ignition, Impact and compaction, Industrial applications, Medical and biological applications, Nozzle flows, Numerical methods, Plasmas and magnetohydrodynamics, Propulsion, Shock propagation and reflection, Shock-Boundary layer interactions, Shock-vortex interaction, Shocks in condensed matter, Shocks in multiphase fluids, Shocks in rarefied gases. Fourteen special sessions were dedicated to a student competition for the best oral presentation and one special poster session was dedicated to a student competition for best poster. The winners of the student competitions were: First Place, Student Oral Presentation Competition: Wouter Mostert, School of Mechanical and Mining Engineering, University of Queensland, for the paper "Characterisation of the Cylindrical Riemann Problem in Magnetohydrodynamics" Honorable Mention, Student Oral Presentation Competition: Shalan Hooseria, Flow Research Unit, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, for the paper "Three-dimensional Curved Shock Wave Interactions with Slender Bodies at Incidence" First Place, Student Poster Presentation Competition: Keisuke Ouchi, Muroran Institute of Technology, Japan, for the poster "Numerical and Experimental Investigations of Fluidic Thrust Vectoring with Oblique Shock Waves" Honorable Mention, Student Poster Presentation Competition: Minghu Wang, University of Science and Technology of China, for the poster "Experimental Study on Interaction of Planar ShockWave with Polygonal Helium Cylinder" The conference proceedings were distributed in digital form (USB memory sticks) to all participants. A printed version, with ISBN number, will be published by Springer&amp;Verlag in the next few months and will be available for purchase. Eighteen authors were invited to submit extended version of their papers for a special issue of Shock Waves that will be entirely dedicated to ISSW29.
