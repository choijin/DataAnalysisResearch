<AbstractNarration>NSF SBIR Phase I Proposal 1249014 - Request for Abstract&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project advances arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) capabilities for high bandwidth operation essential in technologies such as telecommunications, test and measurement, remote sensing, and others where higher bandwidths are demanded but cannot be achieved with current electronic devices.  This new innovation employs an optical fiber storage ring to interferometrically combine many low-bandwidth input waveforms to synthesize high-bandwidth output waveforms.  This technology exploits advances in stable fiber lasers and telecommunications components with hardware comprised of commercial off-the-shelf photonics and low-bandwidth electronics.  Prior efforts have successfully demonstrated the device concept and led to one patent pending.  This SBIR project addresses fundamental coherence issues through device-engineering that enables bandwidth extension above 25 GHz, and noise reduction in the photonic components, moving this innovative solution towards a viable commercial product. Metrics for success are combined bandwidth, time aperture, and signal fidelity.  This photonic method for wideband AWG offers the potential for high bandwidth (&gt;100 GHz), long waveform durations (&gt;10 microseconds), with high fidelity (40 dB SFDR).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project offers the potential for transformative advances in full utilization of the electromagnetic spectrum spanning microwave to terahertz frequencies.  In particular, this approach is ideally suited to bridge the technological gap that exists between waveform generation by well-developed continuous AM or PM modulation of individual coherent sources and by proposed methods of controlled synthesis of frequency arrays.  This technology provides a unique combination of high spectral resolution, long time aperture, and high bandwidth that has broad application in test and measurement devices, telecommunications, signal processing, and next-generation information technologies that exploit the full information capacity of optical fiber beyond the current capabilities.  Generation of agile, complex, wideband optical waveforms can enable new paradigms for free space optical communications, while also applicable to spread spectrum and low probability of intercept applications.  This project also aims to investigate fundamental noise issues inherent to repeated re-amplification of coherent optical signals, providing insights directly relevant to meeting the rapidly increasing needs of our modern information age.  Furthermore, the coherent optical storage ring technology developed in this project will benefit a number of other potential applications such as wideband spectrum analysis and ultra-high precision characterization of optical oscillators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During this Phase I projectÆs efforts, we investigated the capabilities and limitations of the coherent accumulation approach (Figure 1) to Optical Arbitrary Waveform Generation (OAWG)   using an optical fiber ring and implemented a number of fundamental advances in the basic approach and hardware design that overcome previous performance barriers.  All the technical tasks, based on the proposed effort, were achieved, and all project milestones were successfully accomplished. What is the impact on the development of the principal discipline(s) of the project?  Photonic approaches to traditionally electronic technologies have the potential to overcome current limitations in a wide range of applications. Our new approach to photonic AWG is an innovative addition that not only contributes directly to high bandwidth AWGs, but also the techniques and methods of optical phase stabilization, high dynamic range modulation, and control of accumulated noise, which can directly benefit related photonic technologies. Improved OAWG System Design and Implementation  The OAWG systemÆs optical storage ring was redesigned to reduce losses, minimize the number of optical elements, and package the entire optical ring within a single compact 2Æx2Æx2Æ box to provide increased stability. Future product engineering will combine both optics and control circuitry into a unified package for the end customer. Reduced Optical Scattering in the Optical Storage Ring  We found some basic issues in optical component technology that were previously unnecessary to address in general telecommunications when using optically incoherent digital signal transmission, but do become important when pursuing exceptionally high dynamic range for coherent applications. There unwanted scattering must be reduced beyond typical 40, 50 or 60 dB levels in available components. We found most of the engineering challenges were surmountable by adding a moderate amount of supportive engineering to temperature stabilize, frequency tune, piezo-electrically strain, or otherwise shift some of the more sensitive components for optimal operation, and a related monitoring detector and servo circuit can provide automatic adjustment. High Dynamic Range SSB-SC Modulation  The required dynamic range of the injected waveform modulator must be high, with a very low leakage off state below the downstream component backscattering. We implemented and refined a hybrid RF/optical design for a Single-sideband Suppressed Carrier (SSB-SC) input modulator, and tested it to see that it met all of our Phase I goals and in some cases even approached or exceeded our Phase II targets. We were able to achieve the following performance: a measured DC dynamic range of -72.5 dB, a measured AC dynamic range of -62 dB, and a total modulation bandwidth of &gt; 200 MHz. Methods to Control EDFA Dynamics  Gain dynamics of the intra-ring EDFA affect the waveform accumulation process and the fidelity of the high-bandwidth output waveforms. Any variations in gain due to the varying optical load on the EDFA as additional optical power is injected into the ring causes a change in the relative amplitude of input waveforms injected on different cycles, leading to distortions of the output waveform spectrum. As a result, we developed a detailed model for how the gain dynamics affect the output waveform, allowing us to quantify the resulting distortions. 25 GHz Arbitrary Optical Waveform Generation  To test the system performance, a 25 GHz photoreceiver converted optical waveforms to electronic signals that were then sent to a spectrum analyzer. We generated several types of waveforms with frequency spectra that provide clear and unambiguous measures of the system performance. The first of these waveforms was a repetitive high-bandwidth pulse sequence, corresponding to a simple RF spectral "comb" of tones. This is shown in Figure 2, where we find that the system achieved a spur-free dynamic range of 42 dB at 25 GHz, surpassi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
