<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1253893            PI:  Henderson, James  ORG: Syracuse University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Smart Material Advances and Advanced Research Training (SMAART) Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  The project provides support for four Hampton University workshop participants who will be integrated into the research of the research program under way in the Syracuse University Biomaterials Institute.  These students will be under the direct supervision of the PI and working together with experienced Syracuse graduate students.  They will learn to use image analysis techniques to investigate collective (emergent) cell behaviors on shape-changing substrates and to use live-cell fluorescence imaging techniques to investigate individual cellular behaviors on these substrates.  The participants will thus be introduced to next-generation of shape-memory polymer substrates, including micropatterned shape-memory substrates for the investigation of cell-polarity establishment, to modulus changing shape-memory substrates for investigation of the temporal aspects of cell response to substrate rigidity, and to expanding and contracting substrates for cell sheet engineering.  These hands on, cutting edge biomaterials laboratory experiences will be supplemented through seminar style discussions of the underlying cell biology and polymer science and an introduction to the multiple options available to students who wish to pursue STEM careers in industry, government, or academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  The scientific and technical broader impacts of the project will be contributions toward the development of materials based on shape memory polymers that can be used to direct the differentiation of stem and other precursor cells.  Clearly more important in this case are the educational and outreach broader impacts, namely, the opportunities provided for students from an HBCU to participate in research at the forefront of the tissue engineering field.  An effective collaboration has been established between the PI and Prof. Raymond Samuel of Hampton University that will ensure appropriate selection of workshop participants.  Workshop participants will also be able to benefit from activities of the recently funded Syracuse Biomaterials Institute REU Site.</AbstractNarration>
