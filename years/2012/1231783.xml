<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merits&lt;br/&gt;Terahertz (THz) sensing is emerging as a promising new technology with application to a wide number of compelling problems in material probing, medical imaging, and device design. This tremendous potential has prompted rapid advancements in THz sensor technology, but advanced processing approaches that exploit the unique capability of THz sensors are still not fully developed.   Perhaps the most promising application, three-dimensional (3D) THz imaging with simultaneous chemical characterization, has remained elusive due to challenges posed by the unique geometries of THz imaging configurations and the subsequent scattering of THz waves.  A core contribution of this research will be the development of advanced physics-based signal processing techniques for 3D imaging with concurrent spectroscopic material characterization. These techniques are based on predictions of electromagnetic scattering theory (for example, reflection from planar cracks and curved layers) to preferentially combine reflection measurements from multiple sensors, frequencies and polarizations.  This work will produce methods for advanced 3D focusing of Synthetic Aperture Imaging systems with the simultaneous detection of spectroscopic material features from THz reflection spectra. While this work will provide advances in specific THz sensing applications, the need to understand and exploit wave interactions with physics-based processing has wide applicability, and the integrated theoretical, modeling and measurement effort proposed will significantly advance knowledge in the field.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This research will support an integrated activity of research and education at Portland State University in collaboration with international academic and industry partners.  The potential societal benefits are truly impressive, potentially enabling the ability for rapid and robust 3D chemical mapping for future industry applications in non-destructive evaluation, medical imaging, and security screening. This research will specifically target two imaging applications: 1) rapid assessment of the shape and material composition of coated pharmaceutical tablets; and 2) detection of cracks in solar panels for enhanced production of ?green? energy.  In addition to these broader impacts of the work, undergraduate and graduate students will have the opportunity to engage in cutting-edge THz research and participate in the international collaboration. The PI will continue her activities of K-12 outreach and mentoring of women in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

In recent years THz sensing has emerged as a promising new technology which may be ideal for many non-invasive imaging applications such as bio-medical imaging, security screening and industrial quality control.  THz imaging systems operate in the far-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (1012 Hz) and offer several unique advantages for NDE applications: 1) many materials of interest have spectral fingerprints in the THz range; 2) THz waves can penetrate through many (nonpolar) obscuring layers; 3) THz radiation is non-ionizing, making it safe for personnel and patient imaging; and 4) wavelengths in the THz regime provide high-resolution 3D imaging capability.  Previous work by the authors and others demonstrated the ability to produce three-dimensional (3-D) THz tomographic images of objects using a data collected in a 2-D synthetic aperture configuration.

Specific NDE imaging applications that have been suggested by the authors include rapid assessment of the shape and material composition of coated pharmaceutical tablets, non-contact NDE of automobile paint and other thin film media, and the evaluation of contaminants embedded within textile rope materials.  This NSF funding supported two Ph.D. students, Gabe Kniffin and Scott Schecklman.  Each of them were able to present their THz research at international conferences during the funding period.  It also provided the opportunity for two undergraduate students, Thanh Le and Ha Tran, to work with the NEAR-Lab?s state-of-the-art THz equipment.  They plan to develop their THz work further during their graduate research starting in Fall 2017.   The NEAR-Lab also hosts regular visits from Portland area high schools and provides tours and demonstrations in the THz laboratory.
