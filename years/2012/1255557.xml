<AbstractNarration>Ultra-High Energy (UHE) cosmic neutrinos (above 10^18 electron-Volts) would be the most distant and energetic particles that can be observed on earth, and well motivated models put them within reach of currently funded experiments. The Intellectual Merit portion of this award is organized around two concepts: &lt;br/&gt;1. Achieving the Best Sensitivity for UHE Neutrino Observatories; and &lt;br/&gt;2. Cornering UHE Neutrinos and Exploiting their Astrophysics and Particle Physics Potential. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key elements of this award are based on two experiments representing the discovery and exploitation phases of the field: ANITA, an Antarctic, balloon-borne experiment with its third flight approved, and ARA, an in-ice array being deployed near the South Pole. ARA aims to exploit radio Cherenkov emissions (Askaryan effect). Connolly will expand the potential of searches for UHE neutrinos through a broad program that is carried out through simulations, instrumentation, data analysis, and optimization of event selection at every stage, including both hardware and software activities:&lt;br/&gt; 1. Simulation development focused on making simulations part of the data framework and using data to calibrate the simulations. &lt;br/&gt;2. Improved sensitivity of experiments due to novel new trigger designs optimized with her simulations. &lt;br/&gt;3. Developing instrumentation to improve sensitivities and characterizing system components for simulations and analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The award will also fund an outreach program that bridges the established middle school GRASP (Girls Reaching to Achieve in Sports and Physics) summer science camp with the undergraduate program in the department. The new program is called BRIDGES (Bringing together Research, Ideas and Data for Girls to Excel in Science). Many programs aim to keep middle school aged girls (grades 6-8) interested in math and science, and a few universities, including OSU, run summer science camps for girls targeting that precise age range. Few if any such programs follow up with a program aimed at maintaining their interest in science throughout their high school years and into college. The new BRIDGES program will pique the interest of female high school students in physics by introducing them to current research and giving them hands-on experiences and mentoring them during this important phase.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Neutrinos are unique messengers to the universe, particularly at the highest energies and cosmic distances.  In that regime, they are the only way for us to probe the most extreme astrophysics sources producing the highest energy particles in the universe.  At such high energies, neutrinos could also provide evidence for new physics undetectable by other means through their interactions detected by experiments on earth.  So far neutrinos at such extreme energies have not been discovered but the work under this award brought us closer to that goal.  Under this award, the PI and her group developed tools and techniques to advance the field of ultra-high energy experiments in Antarctica that use a radio technique to search for neutrinos in the ice.  The award enabled the PI's group to develop new tools to simulate new and existing experiments so that they might be built with the best sensitivity to neutrinos, develop new techniques to analyze data to improve our searches, and design and build detector components to improve our experiments.  We also developed new theoretical models for the radio emission that is produced by interactions, and collaborated with theorists to interpret our data.  The award led to or produced new results that, in the absence of a discovery, put constraints on the flux of neutrinos from astrophysics sources, and help us to know how deep we need to look in future experiments.   This work was performed by a diverse group of students and young researchers and has had a direct impact on their careers both inside and outside of academia.  This award also allowed the PI to initiate and run a completely new biannual workshop for high school women called ASPIRE at Ohio State that gives young women hands-on experience working with tools and equipment that are commonly used in physics so that they can become familiar at an early age with what physics research is like.  A series of projects were created for the participants under this award, most with a radio theme.  Each participant learns to program a microcontroller and takes the Arduino home with them so that they can carry on with new projects on their own.  Some ASPIRE participants have gone on to work on the PIs laboratory or to work in other areas of research.               Last Modified: 11/30/2018       Submitted by: Amy Connolly]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
