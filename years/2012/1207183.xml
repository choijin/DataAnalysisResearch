<AbstractNarration>This project aims to study  problems involving surfaces and three-manifolds, primarily from the perspective of group theory and geometry, but also drawing on ideas and techniques from complex analysis and dynamics.  This includes (1) an ongoing project with R.P. Kent on convex cocompactness in the mapping class group, various parts of which are also joint work with M. Bestvina, J. Brock, K. Bromberg, and S. Dowdall; (2) ongoing work with D. Margalit on dynamics of pseduo-Anosov homeomorphisms and their relation to three-manifolds, parts of which are also joint work with B. Farb; (3) various projects on length functions and geometric structures on surfaces which involves work with M. Duchin and K. Rafi, as well as work done by the PI's graduate students, A. Bankovic, S.-W. Fu, R. Maungchang, and C. Uyanik.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surfaces - two-dimensional spaces like the surface of a ball or a doughnut - have been studied for hundreds of years, and are fundamental and beautiful objects in mathematics. The study of surfaces is intrinsically interesting, but is also responsible for the creation of entire fields of mathematics, shaping the way people solve problems. Three-dimensional topology - the study of three-dimensional spaces like our physical universe - has been profoundly impacted by developments in the study of surfaces. This may not seem surprising since a surface is a two-dimensional space, and one might expect a three-dimensional space to enjoy some of the same properties.   While it is true that direct analogies in the situations have produced some interesting results, it is the use of surfaces as building blocks for understanding three-manifolds (the three-dimensional spaces) which has most significantly shaped the field.  One important aspect of this project is the strategy of "reversing the flow of information" by (1) applying new technology developed to study three-manifolds into the theory of surfaces, rather than vice-versa, and (2) exploring the subtle effects the geometry of three-manifolds imposes on the geometry of the surfaces used to construct them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Surfaces, like the surface of the earth (a sphere) or the surface of a doughnut (a torus) are basic objects which appear throughout mathematics.  Surfaces serve as motivating examples on which other results are based, and as fundamentally interesting and important objects in their own right.   Despite having been classified for nearly 150 years, research in the geometry of surfaces is ongoing, providing deeper understanding of these beautiful objects, and inspiring research into both new and existing fields. One of the important features of surfaces is that they can be used as ``building blocksÆÆ to construct other, higher dimensional spaces. For example, 3-dimensional spaces can often be ``slicedÆÆ into surfaces, and then described by the way the surfaces are reassembled.  This is something like the way a CT scan turns 2-dimensional images into a 3-dimensional picture of a part of the body.  The 3-dimensional spaces that can be described by this slicing procedure are encoded by symmetries of surfaces called homeomorphisms.  The research supported by this grant advanced the understanding of how the homeomorphisms used in the reconstruction specifically influence properties of the 3-dimensional spaces.  In addition, the flow of information was reversed, and important properties of the homeomorphisms---specifically the long-term evolution of their iteration---was fundamentally informed by properties of the 3-dimensional spaces.   Perhaps the most striking advances resulting from the support provided by this grant was the transfer of information to the neighboring area of  geometric group theory.  This field of pure mathematics analyzes the abstract notion of symmetry via geometric methods.  The PI and his collaborators developed a theory analogous to the slicing of 3-dimensional spaces suited to the so-called free-by-cyclic groups.  This ongoing work is providing a wealth of information in geometric group theory, and creating new analogies that shed light on the structure of these groups. The research conducted during this grant has been disseminated very broadly through lectures given by the PI and his collaborators around the country and all over the world. The PI is very active in training graduate students, and in instruction more broadly.  During the period of grant support, he supervised the completion of three PhDs in mathematics, has four additional students who he supervises, and served as mentor or co-mentor for five postdoctoral researchers.  Several of the PI's PhD students, collaborators, and postdoctoral researchers are women, and he continues to work with underrepresnted groups.
