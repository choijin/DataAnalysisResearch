<AbstractNarration>The decision support software developed through this project represents a new tool to aid decision makers in making informed, efficient decisions. The software tool builds on earlier research that explored interactions among technical systems, organizational processes, and physical and social conditions that affect information flow in managing risk and uncertainty. The design approach develops practical decision models using Bayesian networks and influence diagrams to assess uncertain conditions, based on systematic identification of interdependencies among the component technical, organizational, and knowledge systems that characterize urgent operating environments. It integrates technical skills in computer programming and simulation design, grasp of business dynamics and marketing, and understanding of context, policies, and constraints of emergency management. This decision support module identifies options available for action, given actual constraints and near-real time information from multiple sources, and calculates the probability of success of each option, based on the collective judgment of experienced emergency managers. This decision support tool addresses problems of scalability and simultaneity in information flow processes that have hindered inter-organizational decision making in large-scale, regional disasters. Modeling potential outcomes can systematically enable managers to compare a broader range of options. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successfully developed, this dynamic decision support tool may have a transformative effect on how communities manage risk. As the number, type, and severity of disasters increase in a global society that depends increasingly on large-scale systems in transportation, power generation, communication, and gas, water and wastewater distribution, the cost and consequences of failure in these socio-technical systems escalate exponentially. Managers may need improved tools to monitor these interdependent operating systems simultaneously, and adjust and adapt the balance between demand and resources available to manage sudden surges in demand from extreme events. This technology has the potential to benefit communities through helping local governments, nonprofit organizations, and small businesses increase their capacity to manage their continuing exposure to risk, but reduce losses by more informed, effective decision making.</AbstractNarration>

We defined four basic tasks to undertake within six months, October 1, 2012 - March 31, 2013: 1) develop a business plan for a start-up company suitable for review by third-party investors; 2) develop a SBIR proposal to support product development for the proposed start-up company; 3) engage students in market research necessary to extend the proposed prototype in a relevant policy domain, and 4) demonstrate our working options module to an invited audience of potential clientele, investors, and interested decision makers in a half-day workshop.     Major Activities:  We undertook four major types of activities: 1) intensive interviewing of emergency managers at local, state, and federal levels; 2) participation in local public safety fairs and regional meetings of emergency managers; 3) field observation and interviews with key emergency management officials following Superstorm Sandy; and 4) demonstrations of our Dynamic Decision Support System to key officials in interested agencies.      Specific Objectives:  Our objectives in conducting the interviews included: 1) determining specific needs of emergency managers in making decisions before, during, and after extreme events; 2) assessing the current state of information management systems used by the respective emergency service agencies; 3) identifying the 'added value' of our DDSS for emergency managers; and 4) determining where and when our DDSS could most easily and effectively be introduced into the large, complex, interactive emergency response system.     Significant Results:  The Center for Disaster Management received a Community Resilience Innovation award from FEMA in late May, 2013 to conduct a pilot project for building community resilience to disaster risk among public, private, and nonprofit organizations in Allegheny County, PA. Importantly, the award represents FEMAÆs recognition of the merit of the DDSS for communities seeking to improve decision making in risk environments, using a 'whole community' approach to risk reduction.     Products  Two academic papers were presented at international conferences, six invited presentations were made to interested policy makers in federal agencies, and 63 interviews were conducted with local, state, and federal managers with emergency management responsibilities.
