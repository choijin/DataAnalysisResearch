<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop physics-based modeling techniques to enable high-performance nanoplasmonic devices for optical information processing. The approach is to first develop physics-based models for plasmonic waveguides and devices. These models will then be used to develop efficient optimization techniques of multi-parameter nanoplasmonic devices which greatly reduce the required number of computationally expensive full-wave device simulations. In addition, modeling techniques for nanoplasmonic devices which calculate the effect of random manufacturing imperfections will be developed. These techniques will also be utilized to design robust nanoplasmonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed physics-based modeling techniques could lead to the development of both active and passive novel nanoplasmonic devices with optimal performance and minimum size for high-density optical information processing. The realization of such devices would tremendously expand the applicability of plasmonics, and would have profound implications for computing and communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will represent important breakthroughs in integrated optics, optical information processing, and renewable energy sources, which have broad impacts on modern technology and human life. As part of the proposed educational activities, a new course on modeling techniques for nanophotonic devices will be introduced. In addition, the simulation tools and course materials will be globally disseminated. Special focus will also be placed on local outreach and recruitment of minority students. Through outreach to three local high-schools with a strong science curriculum, students will be introduced to the field of nanophotonics to generate excitement for careers in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
