<AbstractNarration>Built upon a culture of inclusiveness, Choose Development is a three-year project through which the Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) aims to augment the diversity of undergraduate students that enter doctoral (PhD) programs in their pursuit of research careers in fields related to developmental biology.  This pioneering program emphasizes professional development and research training under long-term and continuing supervision by expert developmental biology research faculty.  Undergraduates with disabilities and those belonging to under-represented minority (URM) groups will be selected from a national applicant pool and matched to research laboratories with trained faculty mentors committed to enhancing their preparation to enter graduate programs.  Students will be recognized as an elite group of SDB Fellows who will spend two summers (and possibly an academic year as well) carrying out independent research in the mentor's laboratory.  The Society will ensure dissemination of their research accomplishments through the students' participation in SDB regional and/or national meetings, complemented by strong support and encouragement from members of this scientific community.  It is expected that most, if not all of these SDB Fellows will choose and be accepted into graduate programs on developmental biology or related areas.  This project will have important implications toward enhancing training strategies that aim to diversify the population of investigators in the discipline of developmental biology, as well as that of our future scientific workforce to coincide with the expected demographic changes in the United States.  SDB will also develop and implement resources to assist other scientific and disciplinary societies that plan to adopt similar approaches.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOMES:   IOS Broadening Participation: Choose Development! Award # 1239422; 04/01/13 to 03/31/16.     The goal of the NSF Choose Development! Award #1239422 to broaden the participation of underrepresented minority (URM) scientists in developmental biology increased the participation of URMs in developmental biology and incorporated diversity goals into the strategic plans of the Society for Developmental Biology (SDB).  We set four specific aims for a 5-year grant proposal that was curtailed to 3 years, and these were:      Aim 1: To increase the number of URM undergraduates and students with disabilities (SWD) entering graduate programs in developmental biology.  Aim 2:  To increase and retain the number of SDB members from the populations of URMs and persons with disabilities by at least 25% of current figures*. (*As of 2011 survey 0f 671 SDB respondents)  Aim 3: To increase URM members who participate in SDB activities (i.e., elected offices, committees, chairing annual and regional meetings).  Aim 4: To promote a better understanding of developmental biology and its contribution to society through active outreach activities.  The aims were not modified from those stated in the original application and the outcomes obtained for each aim are summarized below.     General Outcomes  Aim 1:  At the end of our 3-year grant and a no-cost extension 4th year, we report evidence that strongly support our original hypothesis tested in this project and that is, long-term advocacy (and mentoring) is successful.  The pioneering program Choose Development! established by the Society for Developmental Biology  (SDB) in 2013 (http://www.sdbonline.org/choose_development) is a summer research intensive program designed with a multi-level mentoring approach to be carried out over successive summers in the laboratories of established SDB members. We accepted a total of 19 URM undergraduate students as Fellows, 21 Mentors and  19 Lab Mentors representing the demographics shown below.          Choose Development! Program:   Demographics (2013-2016)           Fellows    Acad   Mentors    Lab   Mentors      Hispanic    14    3    5      African American    6    0    0      American Indian    1    0    0      With Disabilities    3    n/a    n/a      Female    8    16    10      Male    11    3    9      TOTAL    19    19    19          Note:  Two Academic Mentors had 2 different Fellows each.  Several Fellows self-declared more than one ethnicity/race or a disability.  Two Fellows experimented two different labs. Six Fellows had the opportunity of spending one week at the Embryology Course at the Marine Biology Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA.      Aim 2:  The SDB membership increased by 20% during the granting period (2012-2017) and the number of under-represented groups also increased as follows: Hispanic, 13%, African American 15%, American Indian 4%.  Interestingly, the percentage of members with disabilities decreased from 4% in 2012 survey to 1% in 2017.  The distribution of female and male members has been relatively even (49% for both sexes and 2% for undeclared) throughout recent years while the percentage of white members decreased by 14% during the granting period.      Aim 3:  The successful funding of this proposal was widely publicized to all SDB members through its website, announcements at SDB annual and regional meetings, as well as the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) and the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS).  Moreover, it provided an impetus to take action and increase URM members who participate in SDB committees and elected offices.  A new Inclusion and Outreach Committee (IOC) was formed with representation on the Board of Directors.  It will oversee the design and implementation of programs to support and provide equal opportunity to anyone interested in developmental biology to join and excel within the SDB community (http://www.sdbonline.org/ioc#mission).  Dr. Carmen Domingo from San Francisco State University was also elected the West Coast Representative on the Board (http://www.sdbonline.org/board_of_directors).     Aim 4:  SDB continues to pursue active participation in venues that facilitate the promotion to better understand developmental biology and its contribution to society by setting up educational booths in national scientific conferences (SACNAS, ABRCMS) and the USA Science and Engineering Festivals.      Significance  Our 4-year cumulative outcomes strongly support our original hypothesis tested in this project and that is, long-term advocacy (and mentoring) is successful.  The introduction of the Choose Development! Program to the SDB community raised awareness and appreciation for the benefits of good mentoring at all levels and of training a diverse population of future scientists.  An atmosphere of inclusiveness and welcoming in the laboratories and classrooms of students belonging to the different ethnic, socio-economic, cultural and academic backgrounds is essential to foster and train students that will comprise the future workforce demographics in this country.  In sum, we have met each of our 4 aims with activities that can spur on continued growth of the SDB demographics and participation of its members to develop and sustain these and new activities to help transform the "face" of scientific research in the USA.
