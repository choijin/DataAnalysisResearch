<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to characterize fluid chemistry at several sites across the Costa Rica subduction zone. Fluids will be analyzed for Si, B, Br, F, 18O, deuterium, 11B and 7Li. This information will be used to determine the temperatures of the fluid sources and constrain the low-grade metamorphic/diagenetic reactions that produce the fluids. These reactions may have implications for stick-slip behavior along the plate boundary fault. This work represents part of an effort to characterize the fluid flow and faulting behavior along an erosive subduction zone and is complementary to work currently being done on an accretionary subduction zone off of Japan. The work is critical to the completion of the objectives of IODP expeditions 334 and 344.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include a better understanding of fault with the potential to produce large earthquakes and, possibly, tsunamis. A graduate student will be taking part in an international collaboration, including travel to and work in a laboratory in Taiwan. The project also involves undergraduate students, including a senior thesis, incorporation of results into undergraduate classes, and presentation of results to a conference specifically designed to attract persons from under-represented groups to science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this research was to analyze pore water collected during IODP Expeditions 334 and 344 for solute concentrations and stable isotope ratios that are temperature and fluid source indicators to constrain fluid flow pathways, fluid-rock and biogeochemical reactions, and the origin of hydration/dehydration reactions along the CRISP drilling transect. In addition, we reevaluated the role of marine sediments as a sink in the global ocean magnesium budget and its impact on the Mg isotopic composition of seawater, critical for better understanding Mg cycling between the ocean and lithosphere and interpreting paleoceanographic records.     Findings from this research related to the hydrogeochemistry of the southern Costa Rica subduction zone include: 1) deep-sourced fluid advection is both focused along landward-dipping thrust faults and more diffuse through the sedimentary wedge; 2) advected fluids have a chemical signature that reflects source temperatures of ~90 oC, reaction with both detrital silicates and volcanic ash during migration through the wedge, and pervasive authigenic carbonate precipitation within the wedge sediments that likely contributes to the anomalously high seismic velocities observed within this region; 3) the upper portion of the subducting sediments is accreted and the underthrust sediments are predominantly pelagic calcareous and siliceous oozes with very low particulate organic carbon concentrations; 4) considering the composition of the underthrust sediments, they have a low water production potential through clay dehydration and a higher potential to produce water through opal dehydration; 5) the wedge does not just passively transmit fluids from the thin underthrust sediments, but rather generates additional fluids and volatiles (e.g. methane) that supports the widespread fluid and methane seepage observed at the seafloor across this margin.     Additional findings include: 1) rates of microbially-mediated reductive debromination of organic matter in continental margin sediments are low relative to other metabolic pathways despite the high abundance of dehalogenators in the sediment column; 2) our synthesis of the global pore water geochemical dataset from the forearc of subduction zones shows that the fluid output at seafloor seeps cannot be supported by the input of water through sediment compaction and mineral dehydration, suggesting that other "extrernal" fluid sources and/or non-steady state fluid flow must be involved; 3) we calculate a residence time of the global ocean through subduction zones of ~100 Myr, and show that subduction zones are an important source and sink for seawater Ca, Mg, SO4, Li, Rb, Cs, B, &delta;7Li, and &delta;11B; 4) we provide, for the first time, a robust quantification of the authigenic Mg sink in continental slope, rise, and abyssal sediments showing the marine sediment sink, excluding continental shelves, is &gt;20% of the Mg input to the ocean from rivers and rivals the ridge-crest hydrothermal sink; 5) marine sediments are a sink of the light isotopes of magnesium; 6) changes in the magnitude of the marine sediment sink through geologic time would have a significant impact on the &delta;26Mg and Mg/Ca ratios of seawater.     This project supported the M.Sc. and Ph.D. theses of one graduate student, as well as several undergraduate students who contributed to the lab-based portion of this research.
