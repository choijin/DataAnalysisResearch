<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This project is aimed at experimental and theoretical investigations of linear and nonlinear optical phenomena in the presence of multiple scattering and photon localization in random media. The amplification of weak optical signals, such as linear and nonlinear Raman scattering, due to greatly elongated wave trajectories in strongly scattering optical samples will be explored. Disordered nanostructures in GaP and InP exhibiting controlled microscopic/ mesoscopic disorder and light scattering efficiency will be employed to study their linear and nonlinear optical response. The precise material and structural characteristics in these samples will be optimized to achieve the enhancement of Raman signal that is comparable to the state-of-the-art techniques and is enough to detect environmentally significant concentrations of hazardous chemicals in water solution. The ultimate design of Raman sensor developed in this proposal will be implemented as a prototype that will be tested at the sewage facilities for continuous monitoring of the water quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research brings together collaborators from optical and material sciences to create a unique climate for the active student participation in research and science/engineering education and for the preparation of the future scientists, engineers and educators. Students from the largest and diverse urban centers in Texas and Wisconsin, including those of underrepresented groups, will be able to gain interdisciplinary experience and training in optics, materials, biological and chemical sciences. The significant improvement of chemical sensor architecture, aimed as a part of the proposed research, will have an immediate impact on society and economy through established partnerships with local industrial companies and communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:  Detection of contaminations is an important problem, which requires new  tools and methodologies, if a high level of sensitivity and sensitivity  is desired.  Intellectual merit:  The completed research addressed this problem by providing a new paradigm for ultrasentive detection of molecular species using Raman spectroscopy, which provides molecular specificity, and novel, scattering based, sensing platform, which allows, under proper conditions, increase a weak Raman signal by 9 orders of magnitude. Those experimental results were demonstrated both for detection of minute contaminations in water and for remote chemical sensitive of explosives at kilometer distances.  Broader Impact:  The completed research addressed a very important environmental problem by providing a transformative platform for ultrasensitive detection of contaminations. The same platform can be applied for very inexpensive breath analyzers to be used in medical practice. The developed new methods of Monte Carlo simulations can be used for analysis of multiwavelength multiphoton microscopy of deep tissue imaging.  The completed research involved several undergraduate students (each of those students was admitted into Graduate School), and 5 graduate stduents (2 of them have found jobs in their research area). Collaborations with the Air Force Research Laboratory and several international Universities (Moscow State University, Nzarbayev University, KZ, Univestity of Otago, NZ) have been established and have led to several joint publications.
