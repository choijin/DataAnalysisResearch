<AbstractNarration>The project involves investigations in the analytic theory of automorphic forms.  The PI will work with Wilfried Schmid on creating L-functions from automorphic boundary value distributions, and seeks to generalize their archimedean methods to p-adic fields.  The PI will also work with the string theorists Michael Green and Pierre Vanhove on automorphic realizations of small real group representations and their Fourier coefficients.  Their goal is to produce examples on exceptional groups which shed light on graviton scattering amplitudes.  Finally, the PI will work with the cryptographer Ramarathnam Venkatesan on lattice approaches to cryptographic problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automorphic forms are a central topic in modern number theory, and their L-functions relate them to an even wider range of current investigations.  The work with Green and Vanhove has used automorphic forms to solve questions commonly studied in the string theory literature.  The project with Venkatesan studies the security of commonly used commercial cryptographic algorithms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual Merit:  The project centered mainly on automorphic forms and their applications to other areas of mathematics, as well as to physics.  Automorphic forms are highly symmetric functions on Lie groups, which contain a tremendous amount of information of interest in number theory.  Most of the work involved applications of a particular type of automorphic form known as Eisenstein series.  The PI worked with string theorists Michael Green and Pierre Vanhove to identify the fine structure of certain Eisenstein series, and to match this structure to predictions coming from physics (specifically, they describe correction terms to graviton scattering beyond Einstein's General Relativity).  The PI then used this structure to prove some conjectures in representation theory, which is the study of how symmetry can be manifested in matrices.  Namely, the PI used ideas from physics to show that certain symmetries could be realized as unitary matrices, which roughly speaking means that they are rotations of space under suitably-chosen coordinates.  Other projects included an investigation into new types of cryptosystems formed by matrices which do not commute with each other (i.e., A times B is not necessarily equal to B times A), as well as study of the divisibility of certain values of the Riemann zeta function zeta(s)=1+1/2^s+1/3^s+... by primes.     Broader Impact:  The research of four Ph.D. students was covered by this grant.  The PI supervised a total of five Ph.D. students during this period, and advised an undergraduate student.  The PI coorganized five conferences and served as the Graduate Program Director at Rutgers University.  He also ran a two-week Summer Preenrollment Program for entering Graduate Students.                Last Modified: 06/23/2015       Submitted by: Stephen D Miller]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
