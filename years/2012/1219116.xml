<AbstractNarration>There are two approaches to preventing localized bottlenecks in datacenter networks:  1) building an over-provisioned network capable of supporting worse-case dataflows, or 2) providing rapid (microseconds to millisecond) on-demand provisioning of links, usually optical, between communication hotspots in the datacenter.  This projects studies and prototypes the second approach via a novel interconnect design for datacenter networks (DCNs) with good fault-tolerance and scalability features, termed WaveCube.  In particular, optical wavelength selective switch (WSS) technology is used to achieve cost savings while implementing multipathing and dynamic bandwidth scheduling for improved performance.   The WaveCube topology is a multi-dimension cube with fiber carrying multiple wavelengths (Wavelength Division Multiplexing or WDM).   WDM dramatically cuts down on the number of fibers needed in a datacenter but gives rise to a wavelength assignment problem.   Thus the project will study wavelength assignment algorithms needed to provide connections via multiple WSSs taking into account fault-tolerance and performance.   The project will compare WaveCube wiring complexity to that of other suggested approaches.  The project will also study the performance of WaveCube-based data centers under a variety of processing loads, some derived from actual measurements and some synthetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The PI will create undergraduate datacenter networking courses.  The PI also describes a plan to increase participation of underrepresented minorities and women in the proposed research activities and had previous demonstrations of such outreach via work with programs such as  AGEP, REU, CRA CREW.   The PI's are collaborating with an industrial organization.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Driven by technology advances and economic forces, data centers are being built around theworld to serve as the infrastructures for big data analysis services, Internet-based applications (e.g., web search, e-commerce, and online social networking) and cloud computing services (e.g., Amazon EC2, Microsoft Windows Azure, and Google App Engine). The nature of these applications and services requires that a sustainable data center network (DCN) should have the following properties:     high-bandwidth, scalable (in terms of network size), fault-tolerant, energy-efficient, cost-effective, easy-to-construct/expand.   To our best knowledge, non of existing DCNs (either Electrical or Optical) can meet these properties simultaneously. Designing a DCN architecture that meets all these features is challenging and the target of this proposal.  Outcome of Intellectual Merit: In this project, we took the first effort to investigate a scalable, fault-tolerant and high-performance optical DCN architecture (comply with all above 6 features) as an infrastructure for big data applications.   We achieved the following contributions:  1. Achieve scalability, fault-tolerance and high-performance simultaneously in the Wavecube design.

Quantify the wiring complexity and expansion complexity.  We evaluate Wavecube and compare it with previous DCNs in terms of practical issues like wiring complexity, network expansion, building cost and power consumption.

We further define a metric to quantify the network expansion complexity based on the wiring complexity.  3. Make Wavecube better support applications.  We investigated how to make use of Wavecube i.e., its distinguished property of dynamic link bandwidth, to better serve the applications and network optimization techniques.  We have completed a hardware feasibility analysisfor implementing WaveCube, however, building a non-trivial,fully functional WaveCube prototype is our next step effortand is beyond the scope of this project.  Our analsys shows that Wavecube outperforms previous optical DCNs by up to 400%and delivers network bisection bandwidth that is 70%-85%of a non-blocking network on both realistic and synthetictraffic patterns; its performance degrades gracefully in caseof failures&mdash;a 20% drop even with 20% links cut.

We are contacting industry researchers like NEC and WSS vendors for technology transfer.

For outreach, we have achieved the following objectives:  Created networking courses that involve undergraduates in research.  There are at least five class projects that are developed centered around this research. Graduated two PhD and five MS students in this project.  One of the PhD graduate, Kai Chen, has become a faculty at the Hongkong University of Science and Technology, one of the top universities in Asia. We have published extensively in top networking conferences such as SIGCOMM (including its workshops), NSDI, etc.        Last Modified: 09/02/2016       Submitted by: Yan Chen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
