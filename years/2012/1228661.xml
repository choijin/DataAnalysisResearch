<AbstractNarration>This full scale project focuses on the development of a rapid, validated scale. The scale will be used by teachers, administrators, and evaluators to measure student motivation in accordance with a theoretical view grounded in Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT). The project features a mixed methods approach to establishing the valid and reliable measure along with an established validity framework seeking six types of validity and reliability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By developing and validating the measure, the project team members will add to education and evaluation theory in terms of informing understanding of the cost factor in the Expectancy-Value-Cost model of motivation. In terms of practical applicability, the resulting scale will be available for widespread use to predict important learning indicators and inform potential further interventions with students to improve motivation and other learning outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

Thus, knowledge of students&rsquo; motivation is critical in understanding and designing educational environments that will promote optimal student outcomes, especially in contexts when students tend to have low expectancies for success or low value for engaging in classroom activities (e.g., Cohen et al., 2009; Hulleman &amp; Harackiewicz, 2009).
