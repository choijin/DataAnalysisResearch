<AbstractNarration>Advanced processing and analysis of seismic and bathymetric data will illuminate the record of co-seismic slip associated with the great Tohoku earthquake of 2011. This improved structural imaging should increase understanding of deformation processes, including megasplay behavior, near the toe of the Japan subduction zone including the tsunami source region(s) for the Tohoku event. A step-down in the decollment was recognized at an Integrated Ocean Drilling Program site at the fault and this study will assess the along-strike extent of that structure. In addition to addressing deformation associated with the recent earthquake, results will also address accretionary wedge dynamics at a level of detail not achieved previously, with particular focus on whether sediment erosion versus underplating is occurring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  We analyzed seismic reflection profiles across the region of the Japan Trench that ruptured during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.  We found that, seaward of the trench, normal faults associated with bending of the subducting plate cut from the surface down through the entire oceanic crust. The faults generate horst blocks and grabens that are carried into the trench and farther landward.  The detachment zone between the upper (Japan) plate and the descending Pacific plate rides up and over the horst blocks and down into the grabens. The upper plate has a regional unconformity of Cretaceous age that is covered by thick sediments (up to 3 km) of Cretaceous and younger age. The unconformity is offset by normal faults, but those faults do not extend to the seafloor, suggesting that they are not currently active. Deformation of this regional unconformity suggests that subducting horst blocks cause uplift of the area as they pass under the slope, but they do not cause major subduction erosion of the forearc region as previously suggested.  Our field work and associated lab studies of the western IndoBurman Ranges in Myanmar has identified locations of fragments of oceanic crust (ophiolites) that have been stripped from the subducting Indian plate and accreted to the overriding Myanmar margin.  Eocene and Oligocene strata are tilted to vertical, consistent with diapiric movement of the underlying shales.  Samples from several active surface mud volcanoes suggest that the muds are derived from depths of greater than 1 km below sealevel. The rising mud is part of the larger diapiric structure that has deformed the older strata.  This region suffered more than 6 m (18 ft) of uplift during an earthquake in 1762, demonstrating that the uplift and deformation of the region is on-going.    Broader Impacts  Our work in the Japan Trench has revised the previously-proposed model for development of the margin  that calls for massive subduction erosion of the upper plate.  We have shown that subduction erosion is not needed to explain the structure of the margin.  Our Myanmar field area is north of thezone that ruptured in the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman quake, but is along the same subduction system.  The currently activity documented by our work, along with previously reported uplift from the 1762 earthquake suggests that future large earthquakes are likely.
