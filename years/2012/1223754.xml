<AbstractNarration>Professor Gregory Ezra of Cornell University is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to engage in collaborative research with Prof. Stephen Wiggins (Bristol University, UK) and Professor Barry Carpenter (Cardiff University, UK).  This is an International Collaborations in Chemistry (ICC) award, and the research of Wiggins and Carpenter is supported by the UK EPSRC.  The researchers are undertaking a theoretical and computational exploration of nonstatistical dynamics in organic reactions and its relation to phase space structure in classical Hamiltonian models for polyatomic molecules.  This work, motivated by recent experiments, addresses problems of reactivity and selectivity in organic reactions exploiting state-of-the-art methodology and concepts from the theory of Hamiltonian dynamics.  The overall aim is the development of a phase space approach to understanding and ultimately predicting nonstatistical dynamics in thermal reactions of organic molecules.  The research applies recent theoretical and computational advances in applied dynamical systems theory to study reaction dynamics and phase space structure in multimode molecules, and to probe the dynamical origins of nonstatistical behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the factors that control selectivity is of essential importance for chemical synthesis, and this work provides a rigorous dynamical foundation for the ongoing paradigm shift in the interpretation of organic reaction mechanisms. Annual exchange of postdocs between collaborating institutions ensures that the coworkers involved in the project receive a broad interdisciplinary education in a wide range of research methodologies, spanning the subfields of chemical dynamics, dynamical systems and the study of organic reaction mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Control of selectivity is arguably the most important  problem that synthetic chemists face.   Understanding the factors that control selectivity is of essential importance  to the chemical enterprise, and our work has contributed to providing a fundamental mathematical framework  needed to make non-empirical reaction design a reality, and  to providing a rigorous dynamical foundation for the ongoing  paradigm shift in the interpretation of organic reaction mechanisms. This work is liable to have considerable impact beyond the field of theoretical chemistry.  Specifically, our work has provided a new perspective on novel and important aspects of chemical reaction dynamics, such as the so-called `roaming' mechanism.  We have found that, as for other phenomena  in dynamics, to obtain a full understanding of roaming  it is essential to go beyond approaches based solely  on the energetics of molecular configurations. It is necessary to incorporate atomic velocities as an essential part of the  desciption. In other words, we must work in `phase space'.  By working in phase space, we have been able to elucidate those dynamical factors determining product branching ratios (selectivity) in reactions where there are several possible outcomes.    We have also been able to give a compelling dynamical picture that explains why some trajectories follow the roaming pathway to products, while others do not.  While most of our work has used classical trajectories (Newton), we have also investigated the manifestation of the roaming  phenomenon in quantum mechanics (Schrodinger).  This project has been a unique collaborative effort spanning the fields of physical  organic chemistry, theoretical reaction dynamics and applied dynamical systems theory. There has been fruitful cross-fertilization between the subfields of chemical dynamics, dynamical systems, and the study of organic reaction mechanisms.   The Cornell postdoctoral reseacher associated with the project, Dr. Zeb Kramer, has received a unique scientific training. During the course of the project, he  was able to visit the UK to collaborate with coworkers at the Department of Mathematics at  Bristol University.  Dr. Kramer has recently begun his  independent scientific career, and will continue to work on various research topics that have grown out of the results of this project.
