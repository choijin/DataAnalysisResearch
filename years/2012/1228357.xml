<AbstractNarration>Coercion attacks that compel an authorized user to reveal his or her secret authentication credentials can give attackers access to restricted systems.  The PIs are developing a new approach to preventing coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning from cognitive psychology.  Implicit learning refers to learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of the learned pattern. Using a carefully crafted keyboard-based computer game the PIs plant a secret password in the participant's brain without the participant having any conscious knowledge of the trained password.  This planted secret can be used for authentication, but participants cannot be coerced into revealing their secret since they have no conscious knowledge of it.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores three directions for using implicit learning in computer security.  First, the PIs are developing implicit learning tasks designed to be used in challenge-response authentication. Second, the PIs are experimenting with methods to demonstrate implicit knowledge by measuring electrical activity along the scalp using off the shelf EEG devices.  Third, the PIs are conducting user experiments to demonstrate that participants are able to properly authenticate, but cannot consciously recognize the trained secret.  This project is a collaboration between computer security researchers and cognitive psychologists.  Ultimately, the project aims to understand how the brain represents implicit knowledge.  This in turn will lead to new coercion resistant security mechanisms for high-security applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research proceeded on several projects related to a better understanding of how human implicit learning operates to extract statistical structure from cued motor sequences.  Over the past year, this was reflected in three related areas of research, each led within the lab by Kelsey Thompson (graduate student):  1. Statistical learning of repeating sequences.  In this project, we manipulated the statistical dependencies among sequential items learned during our cued motor sequence task (SISL, Serial Interception Sequence Learning).  We found evidence for relatively high-order sequential conditional probabilities (up to 4th order conditionals) but no evidence for learning of non-adjacent dependencies.  2. Individual differences in implicit skill learning.  In this project, we examined the stability of learning across multiple sessions with new sequences to be learned in each session.  Surprisingly, the amount of sequence-specific learning was robust in most assessments, yet the relative ability was not stable across participants across sessions.  Overall performance speed was stable and correlated with other measures of processing speed.  Across a sample of 200 participants, robust correlateions were found across measures of working memory, fluid intelligence, processing speed and personality, yet none of these correlated with measures of implicit learning.  These results suggest that differences in implicit learning are not generally stable across the population (although there may still be outliers who are unusually good or bad at this ability).  3. Motivation effects on implicit learning.  Working with an undergraduate RA in the lab (Danbee Chon), we found that manipulating motivational state led to a robust improvement in skilled performance expression measured in sequence-specific learning in the SISL task.  The level of sequence specific knowledge was substantially higher when participants were motivated to avoid loss (playing not to lose) compared with motivated to gain (playing to win).  The effect appears to be specific to performance, not learning.  No effects of manipulating positive/negative feedback were observed.  The report describing these results in in press at JEP:LMC.  A manuscript reflecting research supported by this project was accepted for publication this past summe:  Chon, D., Thompson, K.R., &amp; Reber, P.J. (in press). Motivation to avoid loss improves implicit skill performance.  Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory &amp; Cognition.  This project was one of our studies identifying factors that potentially affect learning and/or expression of acquired knowledge during the implicit sequence learning task that we had identified as a candidate mechanism for an unreportable authentication token (password).  Kelsey Thompson, a graduate student supported by this grant, completed the bulk of the research for her dissertation and has completed a full draft of her thesis.  We expect a successful defence of her Ph.D. within the next few months.       Last Modified: 01/15/2018       Submitted by: Paul J Reber]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
