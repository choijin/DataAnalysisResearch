<AbstractNarration>Project Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is establishing a founding network node at Georgia Tech (GT) to successfully replicate the I-Corps curriculum at geographically distributed regions throughout the nation and further study how innovation permeates the academic culture. Although the current NSF I-Corps program trains the nation's researchers in cutting-edge customer development methods, it does not offer additional support for start-ups once the go/no-go decision is made. Providing support to local teams is offering great benefit, since most researchers are unlikely to relocate to the most active geographical regions of entrepreneurial activity. Building a robust network of innovation nodes across the country is critical to help support potential start-ups; therefore, this project is leveraging a connected group of knowledgeable and highly experienced groups to help mitigate the issues and risks associated with creating new enterprises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GT node is delivering the I-Corps hypothesis/validation-based (Lean LaunchPad LLP) curriculum that focuses on customer development methodology to cohorts of NSF-designated teams on a semi-annual basis. This allows for training and development of I-Corps teams in multiple locations, while additionally increasing the breadth/depth of training and helping to scale the overall impact of the I-Corps program. GT organized a team of trainers to present the I-Corps curriculum to I-Corps teams and help expand the pool of prospective I-Corps faculty who are able to teach the I-Corps curriculum, work with the selected teams and help to further inform the national innovation network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The establishment of an I-Corps node at Georgia Tech is fostering the pursuit of both short-term and long-term research and development projects to help achieve the goals of the NSF I-Corps program. The GT node is researching, analyzing, and leveraging data from the I-Corps education, training, and opportunity development efforts to: 1) develop an understanding of how institutions can improve support for innovation ecosystems; 2) create and share methods for successfully scaling effective practices and models that foster innovation; 3) explore how the network can enable new collaborations among geographic regions to support commercialization opportunity development, independent of geographic locations; 4) examine and track the I-Corps teams' dynamics, activities and outcomes; and 5) identify and propose improvements to the I-Corps curriculum materials, training practices, and national innovation network utilization. The GT node is expanding the I-Corps cadre of innovation experts that are disseminating effective practices, fostering a change in culture (particularly in academia) and helping to mentor others in their business development efforts on a national scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Georgia Tech I-Corps Node was one of two inaugural nodes in the NSF I-Corps national network.   Since its founding, the GT Node has been a consistent presence in the teaching of I-Corps at the national level.  The node participated in the second pilot conducted at Stanford in Spring 2012, and since that time hosted national cohorts six times on the campus of GT. GT sent 39 teams through national I-Corps cohorts during the primary award period.  The NSF certified I-Corps instructors from GT have been adjunct or primary instructors at 13 of the 38 national cohorts, and have taught more than 230 of the 805 national teams.  Members of this instructional team have taught instructors from each of the other I-Corps nodes how to teach I-Corps.  Additionally, the GT instructors have taught the curriculum at the NIH I-Corps pilot, and at all NSF SBIR "I-Corps Lite Boot Camps."   The GT I-Corps Node has been prolific in teaching the I-Corps curriculum locally, regionally, and internationally. Node personnel created and delivered several versions of regional programs, each based upon the national I-Corps curriculum. These include the Startup Gauntlet, a specialized Life Sciences cohort, a program for the CDC, and international programs taught in Puerto Rico and Lorraine France.   GT has transformed all of its commercialization and entrepreneurial education programs to align with the philosophy of evidence-based entrepreneurship as practiced in the NSF I-Corps program.  The instructors and staff of GT?s VentureLab have acted as specific agents of change on campus, creating and teaching new courses and workshops, and ensuring that the methodology practiced is kept in careful synchronization with the best practices derived from GT?s participation in the National Innovation Network.  By participating as a founding node of I-Corps, VentureLab has transformed itself from a relatively unknown commercialization group into one of the strongest such groups in the nation and the world. VentureLab?s commercialization process contains steps that both precede and follow the customer discovery phase typified by I-Corps (VentureLab adheres to the more general customer development process, of which customer discovery is a phase).  Each person on the staff of VentureLab has participated in a national, regional, or international cohort as a mentor or an instructor.  All of the many projects/startups in process at GT now are following a commercialization trajectory inspired by I-Corps. The GT I-Corps Node achieved all stated goals for this award.  The node has made significant contributions to the content and pedagogy of NSF I-Corps, and these contributions have been adopted by the other I-Corps nodes and sites. By teaching the curriculum of I-Corps regionally and internationally, node personnel adapted the content, structure, and pedagogy of the national course to suit cultural sensitivities and diversities.  These changes include a modulation to the style of teaching I-Corps, a discovery of cultural perspectives to both failing and succeeding, a shift of schedule to accommodate local burdens of work or travel, a revised methodology for customer discovery techniques when seeking interviews not in the United States, and an emphasis on the merited access to opportunity that I-Corps provides. The personnel of the node participated frequently in conferences and workshops as invited panelists and speakers to discuss I-Corps and the Node's implementation and activities.  The GT Node held workshops and cohorts throughout the Southeast and in Puerto Rico to further disseminate its learnings. The impacts of the GT Node's efforts are profound. The node, through its involvement in the national I-Corps program, contributed variations and modifications to the general curriculum of I-Corps.  This curriculum is being broadly accepted as the gold standard for how entrepreneurial researchers are taught and how research-based startups are initiated. The teaching of I-Corps by the node has changed the mindset of those traditional researchers who participated in the node's various activities, especially in regards to how they approach good problems to be solved.      I-Corps has revolutionized GT's thinking with respect to all areas of technology transfer.  Our tools and techniques allow the institution to categorize the commercialization potential of its IP and researcher in a language that companies and investors understand.   GT developed a systematic way to transition these projects through stages, gated not by opinion, but by data which indicates how much the risk has been reduced at each stage.  GT knows, through measurement, that it is more effective and efficient at translating its research into startup companies and out into the public use than at any point in GT's history, due to this program.  The node's work in the southeast, and in Puerto Rico, is meant to change the entrepreneurial culture of those regions. Georgia Tech believes that the node's efforts likely will have a very broad, very profound impact on the economies of those regions, and, through that, have provided a great public good and impact.
