<AbstractNarration>Community gardens are hotspots of interactions between humans and the environment. Little is known about biogeochemical cycles or metal accumulation in these constructed ecosystems, both of which can impact the health of crops and the people who consume them. These knowledge gaps will be addressed by investigating the impact of management, land use legacy, and neighborhood on soil and crop metal availability in Los Angeles community gardens. Soils will be collected in 12 gardens from cultivated, uncultivated, and surrounding locations and analyzed for pH and concentrations of nutrients, organic matter, and 29 metals. Leafy and root vegetable samples will be collected from each garden and tested for metal concentrations to determine bioavailability and human exposure risk. Gardeners will also be interviewed about their management activities. A multiple regression framework will be used to determine if gardening practices or neighborhood characteristics (e.g., freeway proximity, previous land use) can be used to predict soil metal concentrations and bioavailability at gardener, garden, and regional scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data pertaining to management influence on metal availability will be of use to garden managers and city planning departments. The metal content of urban soils and crops in Los Angeles has important human health implications. Reports on metal content of garden soils and crops, as well as educational materials on soil testing, will be presented to garden managers, participants, and supporting non-profit agencies. These activities will provide access to scientific resources for minority populations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Heavy metals in urban soils are ubiquitous and can compromise human health, especially in urban gardens, where gardeners may ingest contaminated dust or crops. Community gardens, a common form of urban agriculture, are often established in empty lots, where soil metals have not been characterized before cropping begins. Exposure to metals associated with urban gardening has been well documented, but sources of metal contamination and how horticultural practices affect metal presence and bioavailability are less clear. Understanding metal cycling and environmental factors affecting their bioavailability is important for reducing local human exposure.  To identify patterns of urban garden metal contamination, we measured concentrations of lead (Pb), arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) in cultivated and uncultivated soils associated with twelve community gardens in Los Angeles County, CA. This included sequential extractions to partition metals among exchangeable, reducible, organic, or residual fractions. Exchangeable fractions exist in solution and are the most available to plant roots. Reducible fractions are bound to iron oxides and require reducing agents to release them into overall fractions. Organic fractions are bound to complex organic matter and must be broken down chemically to release the metals; these are very unavailable to plant roots. Residual fractions are bound in minerals and recalcitrant to metal cycling.  We found strong statistical relationships between distance from road, age of neighborhood, and distribution of metals. For Pb, an increase in neighborhood age increased reducible fractions in sequential analyses, indicating a legacy of lead paint. Exchangeable and residual Pb concentrations increased with proximity to roads. This indicates that air pollution and persistent lead dust were the source for distance from road-based relationships. Analyses have been done before showing similar results in overall Pb concentrations, but ours is the first to identify source materials using fractional analysis.    As and Cd contamination near roads and with age was mainly in exchangeable form, and showed complex relationships with cultivation activity. Exchangeable forms of both metals, likely deposited from air pollution and tire residue, accumulated near the road and with age of neighborhood. Cd became more diluted in cultivated areas due to tillage practices and likely became bound to organic matter. Commercial agricultural history also affected Cd levels; gardens that had a long history of use as commercial agriculture (1910-1950), had higher levels of Cd due to its affinity to bind to Phosphorous mined for mineral fertilizers.

In addition, we show that bioavailability of metals is influenced by management. Arsenic concentrations were most bioavailable in soils with more than 20% OM, though crops only need 5-10% OM for optimum root growth. Regular soil testing and targeted management could better balance potential exposure to metals with production of fresh food and recreational space.  We show that agricultural, land use, and pollution legacies can all influence metal concentra...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
