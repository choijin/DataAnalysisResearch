<AbstractNarration>Human activities have dramatically increased nitrogen inputs into many rivers and lakes, causing algal blooms that threaten economic and recreational uses of those waters. Lake Taihu, the third largest lake in China, experiences damaging blooms of toxic cyanobacteria as a result of excessive nutrient inputs. The identities, nitrogen processing capabilities, and activities of microbial communities in Lake Taihu will be examined to determine if nitrogen processing can be predicted from knowledge of the identity and genetic makeup of those communities. Various components of the nitrogen cycle will be measured and linked to representative molecular markers which, coupled with high throughput genetic sequencing, will provide a genetic database of nitrogen-cycling processes in freshwater ecosystems. A goal of the project will be to link microbial taxonomic, genetic, and functional data in a model that can predict how reduction of nutrient inputs will affect toxic cyanobacterial blooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have broad applicability to the management of aquatic systems that are threatened by excessive nutrient inputs, a problem that is increasing worldwide. Additional broader impacts will include training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, international student exchanges, training of a postdoctoral researcher, and incorporation of science journalism students into field studies to promote adult scientific literacy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cyanobacteria are often harmful to the health of lakes, which makes understanding and predicting their ecology important. Existing models, developed in the 1970s, are overly simplistic and do not consider the complexity of these microbes, like multiple nitrogen assimilation pathways and cell types (photosynthesizing vegetative cells and nitrogen fixing heterocysts), and they do not make predictions comparable to modern data types. In this project, we worked closely with experimentalists to develop and apply novel models of cyanobacteria in lakes.     We developed a dynamic, mechanistic, molecular-level (i.e., gene, transcript, protein, metabolite) model of Anabaena &ndash; nitrogen interaction. The model was developed using the pattern-oriented approach to model definition and parameterization of complex agent-based models. It simulates individual filaments, each with individual cells, each with genes that are expressed to yield transcripts and proteins. Cells metabolize various forms of N, grow and divide, and differentiate heterocysts when fixed N is depleted. The model is informed by observations from 269 laboratory experiments from 55 papers published from 1942-2014. Within this database, we identified 331 emerging patterns, and, excluding inconsistencies in observations, the model reproduces 94% of them. To explore a practical application, we used the model to simulate nutrient reduction scenarios for a hypothetical lake. For a 50% N only loading reduction, the model predicts that N fixation increases, but this fixed N does not compensate for the loading reduction, and the chlorophyll a concentration decreases substantially (by 33%). When N is reduced along with P, the model predicts an additional 8% reduction (compared to P only).     We also developed a model for hypereutrophic Lake Taihu in China, which includes three-dimensional hydrodynamic and biogeochemical components with explicit representation of the sediment bed.  Nitrogen state variables include particulate organic N, dissolved organic N, NH4+, NO3-, NO2- and phytoplankton N.  Processes include nitrification, denitrification, phytoplankton uptake and excretion, mineralization (dissolved organic N to NH4+), dissimilatory NO3- reduction to NH4+, and fluxes to/from the sediment bed.  We constrain the model by calibration to water quality data and observations from sediment core experiments.  The model is then used to fill in the spatial and temporal gaps in the observations from the field and sediment core experiments, providing a more complete picture of the N biogeochemistry in the lake.  The model predicts substantial temporal and spatial variability.  For example, the denitrification rate can vary by a factor of 4 during the year at one location, and by a factor of 3 across the lake at a single time.     This project included training of a PhD student and the results advance the understanding of cyanobacteria in lake systems and contribute to their sustainable management. The modeling concepts developed will also be useful for other areas of microbial ecology, like wastewater treatment or oceanography.
