<AbstractNarration>Poor visibility into the network hampers progress in a number of important research areas, from network troubleshooting to Internet topology and performance mapping. While the problem has been long recognized and has served as motivation for several efforts to build new or expand existing experimental platforms, capturing the edge of the Internet at sufficient scale remains an elusive goal. At its roots, the problem is one of incentives - in most of the commercial Internet the goals of those hosting the platform and the experimenters that use it are not the same. This effort explores a new model for Internet experimentation platforms that addresses the incentive problem by explicitly aligning the objectives of the experimenters with those of the users hosting the vantage points. The exploration is done in the context of Dasu, a system for Internet Service Provider characterization and Internet experimentation. The effort investigates (i) the challenges and opportunities offered by these types of platforms, (ii) how such platforms can support easy extensibility while remaining secure, and (iii) how to facilitate the design and deployment of experiments from the Internet edge while reducing the impact on both nodes? resources and the underlying network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The effort will offer the general Internet community with immediate benefits through a unique view of a user's ISP service levels. It will produce a set of algorithms, monitoring protocols, software systems, and tools that, by not requiring the deployment and maintenance of additional infrastructure, can immediately benefit their users, making a significant impact on society-at-large. The effort will provide the research community with access to an experimentation platform capable of capturing the diversity of the commercial Internet. It will make significant contributions toward a better understood, more transparent Internet and offer a much-needed testbed for evaluating the effectiveness of measurement techniques, tools and networked systems deployed at the edge of the Internet.  Research findings and outcomes will be made available as publications, datasets and openly released software. The project will have a direct impact on education in communication, network and distributed systems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Poor visibility into the Internet hampers progress in a number of important research areas, from network troubleshooting to Internet topology and performance mapping. Current measurement and experimental platforms like PlanetLab, while indispensable for networked systems research, lack the diversity that characterizes the commercial Internet. Various experimental and measurement platforms have tried to address this by recruiting increasingly large and more diverse vantage points. However, capturing the edge of the Internet (including devices in homes and small businesses) at sufficient scale remains an elusive goal. We posit that, at its roots, the problem is one of incentives. Previous platforms offered two basic incentive models for adoption &ndash; cooperative and altruistic. In a cooperative platform, an experimenter interested in using the system must first become part of it (installing and making machines available with the necessary software). With an altruistic one, users join the platform (typically by installing certain software as with SETI@Home) and contribute for the betterment of science. All these efforts build on the assumption, explicit or not, that the goals of those hosting the platform and the computer science experimenters that use it are the same. As much of the Internet&rsquo;s recent growth occurs in residential broadband networks, this is no longer the case.</p> <p>This project explored an alternate model that explicitly aligns the objectives of the platform with those of the vantage points. It did this in the context of Dasu, a dual-objective system for Internet Service Provider characterization and Internet experimentation. In terms of the experimentation platform, the project showed the feasibility of an experimentation platform running at the network edge, even in the challenging &ldquo;home environment&rdquo; (where, among other complications, many competing applications make concurrent use of the network forbidding or invalidating the launching of Internet experiments), and made advances in evaluating architectures for hosting third-party experiments, designing approaches for experiment coordination and vantage point selection for Internet service characterization. The experimentation system Dasu was made public early on in the project, reaching over 100,000 users in more than 160 countries, and started to host third-party experiments in the second year of this grant.</p> <p>Beyond demonstrating the feasibility and potential of platforms for experimentation at the network edge, the project illustrated the value of such platforms with several experiments from the investigator&rsquo;s research group (and from other groups around the world) including (i) the first evaluation of the impact of public DNS usage on CDN performance, the potential benefits of a proposed edns-client-subnet extension to DNS proposed to address this, and a end-host solution to this challenge; (ii) the first study of broadband services in a broader context including use and the particulars of the market (answering questions such as How much bandwidth do people actually need? How does price affect usage? Do users in developing and developed countries impose different demands on their services? What is the impact of connection quality on usage?); (iii) the first study of the design space of broadband SLAs and an exploration of some of the trade-offs between the level of strictness of SLAs and the cost of delivering them; and (iv) the first work to point out and capitalize on the strong correlation between Internet route popularity and the volume of traffic it carries, introducing a novel approach for characterizing inter-domain traffic by reusing large, publicly available traceroute datasets. The project resulted in new software releases of the original Dasu platform and other services such as namehelp, a system that allows users to leverage the benefit of public DNS without their performance cost.</p> <p>The project was also the training ground for several undergraduate and graduate students, who have developed expertise in network measurement, experimentation, network topology and analysis and routing protocols.
