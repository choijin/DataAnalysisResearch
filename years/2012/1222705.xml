<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Climate controls on the formation of tropical glacier moraines in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda-Congo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glaciers on the world's high tropical mountains are among the most sensitive components of the Earth's climate system. The current melting of these glaciers is a spectacular example of anthropogenic climate change.  However, tropical glaciers are strongly sensitive to precipitation, humidity, and various other climate processes, not just air temperature. A major objective of glaciology and climate research is thus to understand the responses of tropical glaciers to climate change, and to evaluate which aspects of past climate change control glacier advance and retreat.  This project seeks to test whether changes in temperature control the behavior of tropical mountain glaciers by reconstructing past temperature changes and glacier movement in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda-Congo.  Specifically we will generate new records of glacier advance by dating glacier moraine deposits using cosmogenic radinulides, generate a new temperature record based from lake sediment cores, and compare the timing of periods of cooling with the timing of glacier advances.  The Rwenzori Mountains host the most extensive glacier and moraine systems in Africa, but there are virtually no direct dates to constrain the age of past glaciations. Moreover, there are virtually no quantitative temperature reconstructions from tropical African mountains derived independently of glacial mass balance estimates.  Our work will provide new insight into the timing of major glaciations, glacier sensitivity, and temperature changes in tropical Africa, where few such chronologies exist, and will elucidate the climate processes that control tropical glacier dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ongoing dramatic retreat of tropical glaciers is one of the most visible indicators of anthropogenic climate change.  However, the causes of tropical glacier fluctuations are a subject of debate.  This collaborative project focused on improving the understanding of the climate conditions that influence tropical glacier fluctuations by investigating the geologic record of past glacier extents.  We mapped and determined a chronology of past glacier fluctuations in the Rwenzori Mountains of Uganda.  Specifically, we applied surface exposure dating using the cosmogenic nuclide 10Be to date glacial features.  With these data, we documented glacier advances at ~23,400 and 20,100 years ago (Kelly et al., 2014).  These advances occurred at the same time as the coldest conditions of the last global ice age and when large ice sheets reached their maximum extents in the Northern Hemisphere.  During this time in tropical East Africa climate conditions were extremely dry as documented by low lake levels, pollen and other paleoclimate records.  Therefore, we suggest that the Rwenzori glacier advances were primarily influenced by cold temperatures.  Based on these results, we suggest that projected future warming will cause significant deglaciation in the Rwenzori Mountains.  This information, as well as the geomorphic mapping and glacial chronology, is of interest to a broad range of earth scientists and of importance to a range of policy and conservation decisions in the Rwenzori Mountains, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Two female graduate students at Dartmouth College conducted their graduate research and training as part of the project.  One female postdoc is conducting research associated with the project.  We also collaborated with Ugandan scientists on the project.  Results from the research were presented and discussed in classes at Dartmouth College, in public presentations in the United States and in meetings with collaborators in Uganda.
