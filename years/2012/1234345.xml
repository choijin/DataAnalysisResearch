<AbstractNarration>There is growing evidence that genetic variation within and among populations of key species plays an important role in marine ecosystem processes. Several experiments provide compelling evidence that the number of genotypes in an assemblage (genotypic richness) can influence critical ecosystem functions including productivity, resistance to disturbance and invasion or colonization success. However, these studies use only the number of genotypes as a measure of genetic diversity. Recent analyses of species diversity experiments show that phylogenetic diversity may be a more reliable predictor of ecosystem functioning than simply the number of species. However, such approaches have not yet been applied to understanding the effects of genetics on ecosystem functioning. While genetic relatedness within a species holds the potential to predict the outcome of intraspecific interactions, and the functioning of ecosystems that depend on those species, we currently have few data to assess the shape or strength of this relationship. The investigators will build on their own previous work, and that of others, in eelgrass (Zostera marina) ecosystems showing strong effects of genotypic richness on a spectrum of critical ecosystem processes. The investigators will ask whether genotypic richness, or - as in studies at the level of species diversity - genetic relatedness/distance better predicts ecosystem functioning? If genetic relatedness measures are better predictors, then what mechanisms underlie this relationship? Can genetic relatedness predict ecological relatedness? Although the current focus is on eelgrass, the research should be applicable to many systems. The project will assess the relationship between genetic relatedness and phenotypic distinctiveness of a key marine foundation species and use manipulative experiments to test the relative importance of the number of genotypes in an assemblage vs. their genetic relatedness and trait diversity for ecosystem functioning. Specifically, experiments will: (1) characterize the relationship between genetic relatedness and trait similarity among individual genotypes of eelgrass, including responses to experimental warming; (2) compare the effects of genetic relatedness and trait similarity among genotypes on the outcome of intraspecific competitive interactions; and (3) test the relative effect of genetic relatedness vs. number of genotypes of eelgrass on the growth of eelgrass, its associated ecosystem functions it (e.g., primary production, nutrient dynamics, trophic transfer, habitat provision, and detrital production and decomposition). Broader Impacts: Seagrass ecosystems provide important services to coastal regions including primary production, nutrient cycling, habitat for fisheries species, and erosion control. Previous studies have shown these services can be compromised by reduction in the numbers of species of grazers or genotypes, but this study will allow a more predictive approach to diversity loss by integrating the effects of multiple components of diversity and clarifying the extent to which diversity effects can be predicted by the genetic or ecological uniqueness of component genotypes. The PIs will continue to be involved in direct communication of findings of biodiversity-related research to federal and state agencies and other stakeholders. This grant will integrate physiological, community, and genetic approaches to studying marine ecosystem functioning and will train a number of young scientists (postdocs, grad students and undergrads) at this interface. This project will interface with 4 outreach/training programs, including an NSFsupported UBM collaborative program for undergrads, a University of California-sponsored program that brings students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities to UC Davis for summer research experiences at the interface of ecology and evolutionary biology, a GK-12 program based at Bodega Marine Lab focused on coastal marine science; and a program that brings elementary school classes to the campus for a coordinated series of interactive field trips.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Connecting genetic diversity to ecosystem functioning: links between genetic diversity, relatedness and trait variation in a seagrass community  Seagrass ecosystems provide important services to coastal regions including primary production, nutrient cycling, habitat for fisheries species, and erosion control.  Considerable effort is aimed at conservation and restoration of these ecosystems to ensure the continued provision of these important ecosystem services.  Our prior research showed that genetic diversity of the seagrasses themselves enhances the reliability of these important services, but genetic diversity is declining in many places due to human influences.  Restoration success of seagrasses is limited in part by a lack of understanding of exactly why genetic diversity is important and whether specific genotypes  are needed or if diversity per se is sufficient to create a healthy grass bed.  Our project fostered a predictive approach to understanding the consequences of diversity loss in seagrass beds dominated by eelgrass, Zostera marina, by integrating physiological, community, and genetic approaches.      First, we characterized the relationship between genetic relatedness and trait similarity among individual genotypes of eelgrass, and found that in fact relatively small genetic changes could lead to large functional differences so that the was no easy predictive relationship between overall genetic similarity and similarity in ecological traits such as growth rate, nutrient uptake, root length and heat tolerance.  At very small scales we found that very similar genotypes could coexist very well due to shared environmental tolerances.  However, at the scale of even a meter-square patch, the environment was sufficiently variable that many genotypes were required to achieve maximum shoot density and growth rates.  When we did experiments manipulating the diversity of eelgrass assemblages in natural field settings, we found that different dimensions of diversity made independent contributions to predicting the effects of diversity on eelgrass health.  The number of genotypes and the extent to which these were equally abundant in an assemblage both increased eelgrass population growth whereas high relatedness among genotypes decreased growth.  Thus healthy and resilient eelgrass beds are characterized by high genetic diversity, low relatedness among individuals, and high diversity in important growth and survival related traits.  This allows them to maintain high growth rates and density in the face of seasonally and interannually varying conditions in the same way that species diversity in other systems provides a hedge against an uncertain future.       We have shown that this approach enhances the success of restoration activities in Indonesian seagrass beds and have used expertise from this project to advice the California Ocean Protection Council on the potential use of seagrass as a means to combat ocean acidification by removing CO2 from coastal waters.  We?ve also engaged in outreach to local K-12 schools and helped put on exhibits in local museums like the Exploratorium in San Francisco.  The project has trained a number of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers and interfaced with other programs at UC Davis that enhance training of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields to build scientific capacity in the areas of plant genetics, plant physiology and ecology.
