<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this collaborative award is to explore chemical and biological quantum nanosensors by combining quantum coherence in hybrid systems consisting of semiconductor quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles with biomolecules' recognition functionalities. The unique feature of these sensors is their capabilities to utilize quantum coherence in such systems to convert the impact of introduction of biological molecules and chemical substances into noticeable and easily measurable physical quantities. The approach will include using collective properties of single and ensemble of quantum dot-metallic nanoparticle systems, such as molecular-type resonances and coherent dynamics of exciton-plasmons coupling, to detect biological and chemical agents with ultrahigh sensitivity. Optical signal transduction includes the way introduction of these agents changes the time delay that is coherently induced in the emission of the quantum dots when these hybrid systems interact with time-dependent laser fields. This research involves fabrication of nanochips consisting of arrays of semiconductor quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles separated from each other by dielectric materials or biomolecules. In such chips either the quantum dots or metallic nanoparticles are biologically functionalized for target detection.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will link coherent nanoscience to life science applications and can advance the areas of quantum computers, nanodevices and sensors. Through the outreach program of this research, the high school students in Alabama will acquire first-hand experience of nanoscience through mini-workshops that offer meticulously designed experiments and interactive softwares. This research forms a platform for education of undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary disciplines and provides them unique opportunities to investigate nanoparticle systems that harness biology to function, fabricate and test nano-systems with biological and physical applications, and become familiar with the diverse impacts of nanotechnology. Combination of these issues will prepare the ground for development of new curricula and programs and diversify the research activities in nanoscience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most of the current plasmonic sensors are based on measuring the shift of the plasmon peak wavelengths when they are introduced to biological or chemical materials. The objective of this collaborative research was to investigate novel biochemical nanosensors by combining quantum mechanical processes in systems consisting of semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs) and metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) with biomolecules? recognition functionalities. The unique feature of these nanosensors is their capabilities to translate the impacts of environmental changes on such quantum mechanical processes into noticeable and easily measurable physical quantities. Such an interdisciplinary research enterprise combined many aspects of conventional sensors, bioconjugation of QDs with MNPs, basic concepts in quantum mechanics and biology.  The intellectual merits of this research included:  1-Control of photochemical and photophysical properties of QDs using metal oxides:  We demonstrated that metal oxides can dramatically change the way QDs interact with light. In particular aluminum oxide can significantly enhance the emission of QDs by forming a charge barrier that can balance the impact of defects resided in the substrates on QDs. These results were highlighted by AIP news and Photonic Spectra Magazine.  2-Generation of strong coupling between QDs and MNPs (exciton-plasmon coupling) at room temperature: We explored a novel material layer structure consisting of an array of MNPs embedded in amorphous silicon and then coated with an ultrathin layer of Al oxide.  We showed emission of a layer of QDs deposited on the top of the Al oxide can become strongly polarized. Such a strong polarization was caused by generation of a strong QD-MNP coupling. Such a coupling acts as the main criterion for realization of the quantum nanosensors.  3-Ultrasensitive biochemical nanosensors based on transition from localized surface plasmons to plasmonic lattice modes: Introduction of biological or chemical targets to such sensors causes transition from localized surface plasmon resonances to the plasmonic lattice modes. These sensors are based on the optical scattering of localized surfaces plasmons in arrays of gold MNP as means of detection. We identified the regime that such sensors can offer ultrahigh sensitivities using biological self-assembly and QD bioconjugates.  4-Quantum nanosensors based on QD-MNP systems: These sensors are based on the quantum effects generated in the QD-MNP systems when they interact with a laser field. These effects allow these systems to have their own states (collective states), different from those of QDs (excitons) and MNPs (plasmons). Therefore, instead of wavelength shift, as in conventional sensors, such quantum sensors use such collective states for sensing. Using model-based simulation we showed these quantum sensors can detect and recognize single biological molecules.  5-Quantum biosensors for ranging and detection of biological molecules: The model-based outcomes of this research showed that using quantum mechanical processes it is possible to detect and range biological molecules without any need for their physical adsorption or conjugation to MNPs. Such processes allows one to have control over the polarization of near field of MNPs. This includes generation of specific states of polarization that can be used to study conformational dynamics and structures of biological molecules and determine their whereabouts around the MNPs.
