<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this collaborative award is to explore chemical and biological quantum nanosensors by combining quantum coherence in hybrid systems consisting of semiconductor quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles with biomolecules' recognition functionalities. The unique feature of these sensors is their capabilities to utilize quantum coherence in such systems to convert the impact of introduction of biological molecules and chemical substances into noticeable and easily measurable physical quantities. The approach will include using collective properties of single and ensemble of quantum dot-metallic nanoparticle systems, such as molecular-type resonances and coherent dynamics of exciton-plasmons coupling, to detect biological and chemical agents with ultrahigh sensitivity. Optical signal transduction includes the way introduction of these agents changes the time delay that is coherently induced in the emission of the quantum dots when these hybrid systems interact with time-dependent laser fields. This research involves fabrication of nanochips consisting of arrays of semiconductor quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles separated from each other by dielectric materials or biomolecules. In such chips either the quantum dots or metallic nanoparticles are biologically functionalized for target detection.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will link coherent nanoscience to life science applications and can advance the areas of quantum computers, nanodevices and sensors. Through the outreach program of this research, the high school students in Alabama will acquire first-hand experience of nanoscience through mini-workshops that offer meticulously designed experiments and interactive softwares. This research forms a platform for education of undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary disciplines and provides them unique opportunities to investigate nanoparticle systems that harness biology to function, fabricate and test nano-systems with biological and physical applications, and become familiar with the diverse impacts of nanotechnology. Combination of these issues will prepare the ground for development of new curricula and programs and diversify the research activities in nanoscience.</AbstractNarration>

Such knowledge has allowed us to understand that the presence of biomolecules in the environment will induce the sensitive and precise change in the physical properties of the nano-systems and the amount of the biomolecules is correlated with the magnitude in the change in the physical properties. Hence, the nano-systems can serve as a nano-sensor that can precisely detect the target biomolecules.    Intellectual merit of this project:  (1)   We investigated the effects of the shape and size of metallic gold nanoparticles on the enhancement of exciton-plasmon coupling and emission of semiconductor quantum dots induced via the simultaneous impact of metal-oxide and plasmonic effects;  (2)   We discovered the impact of quantum coherence on the states of polarization of the coherent-plasmonic field of the nano-systems made of semiconducting nanoparticles and metallic nanoparticles and demonstrated quantum biosensors based on the management of near-field polarization of nanoparticle molecules using quantum coherence;  (3)   We studied the chemical and biological sensing using arrays of long gold nanorods that supported both multipolar localized surface plasmon resonances and plasmonic lattice modes.

We showed that such sensors can count the number of molecules of the same type, one at the time, or differentiate between different types of molecules with a high degree of certainty;  (5)   We discovered that the photo-induced processes in the semiconducting nanoparticles are influenced by their structures, metal oxides, and substrates. In particular, we discovered that the aluminum oxide can significantly enhance the emission of the semiconducting nanoparticles;  (6)   We demonstrated different types of nanobiosensors that can detect biomolecules with a high sensitivity. Such nanobiosensors take advantage of the biological recognition of the biomolecules as well as the physical properties of the nanoparticles.  Broader impact of this project:  This project will advance the broader areas of nanophysics, nanobiology and nanomedicine. It will help us understand how different nanoparticles interact to generate new physical properties that enable biochemical sensing. It will lay foundation for developing assays that can be used for detecting biomarkers, which are signatures of a particular disease such as cancer.
