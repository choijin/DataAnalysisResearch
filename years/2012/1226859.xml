<AbstractNarration>Cornell University is awarded a grant to develop off-season access to the Shoals Marine Laboratory (SML), a seasonal field-station on 95-acre Appledore Island in the Gulf of Maine and co-operated with the University of New Hampshire (http://www.sml.cornell.edu/). Since inception of research facilities at the island in 1973, the island has been closed to research activity from September to May due to lack of reliable power sources and limited sea access. This project involves adding large battery storage capacity to increase the breadth of research and training that can be undertaken at the island. The improvements to the electrical system will reliably provide for offseason housing and laboratory needs at a 500 square foot dry laboratory via an uninterruptible power supply consisting of a very large array of batteries chargeable by existing wind and solar power sources. The location of the system's installation near existing main generators will take advantage of centralized circuits with the goal of developing a green grid for the 24 buildings and facilities on the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All-season access for research on Appledore Island via these improvements will increase the effectiveness of SML to researchers and students who study bird habitat utilization and migration, seasonal distribution and reproduction of marine mammals such as harbor and gray seals, and intertidal settlement patterns of marine invertebrate larvae. The improvements will also enable SML to continue progress in sustainable engineering, reducing its carbon footprint, and limit its fuel expenditures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opening SML to off-season researchers and students will expand opportunities for new and/or expanded studies of the flora and fauna of the island and its unique location and access to a variety of field sites.  For example, the Appledore Banding Station has operated for more than 25 years and banded more than 100,000 birds, yet is limited by only having island access from late spring to early fall. Intensive research on the populations of great black backed gulls (Larus marinus) and herring gulls (L. argentatus) on the island during the summer will be expanded to more intensive migratory and habitat usage studies over the winter months.  Another developing research area concerns gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in the southern Gulf of Maine. The critical months for observing reproductive behaviors of the nearby population span from December through April, when the only access is long trips from the mainland thus offseason access to Appledore Island will make it possible to begin monitoring this population throughout the year.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We completed all construction on the new Energy Conservation Building (ECB) for Shoals Marine Laboratory (SML), and it is fully operational. NSF support of the overall project helped us leverage private funds to install additional solar panels. We dedicated the building in a short ceremony on August 20, 2015. The ECB houses storage batteries, switching equipment, and computer controls for the laboratory&rsquo;s green grid. Arrays of solar panels are installed on top of the&nbsp;ECB and on adjacent ground-mounted sites. The solar capture capability and storage batteries have the capacity to meet all electrical needs for the fully populated island (100 persons/night in summer) for up to 24 hours with minimal input from diesel electric generators, which start automatically when needed to meet demand. In winter, the solar + battery system can meet needs without requiring any diesel-generated electricity. This was a major step in the history of SML because it frees the laboratory from seasonal restrictions on its use, decreases the carbon footprint of the lab, serves as a practical demonstration of solar + battery solutions for island visitors, and decreases reliance on and costs for diesel fuel. As a result of this and related improvements in energy conservation, SML has reduced its use of diesel fuel for electricity from 10,000 gallons per year to less than 2,500 gallons per year. Also, we have been able to scrap one of our two 5,000 gallon diesel storage tanks on Appledore, which reduces risks of spills and environmental contamination. We insulated Kingsbury House for use as winter quarters for SML faculty, staff and researchers. Additional work on the water system will be completed this fall.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/13/2015<br>      Modified by: William&nbsp;E&nbsp;Bemis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1226859/1226859_10190186_1444733805238_ECBatSML---rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1226859/1226859_10190186_1444733805238_ECBatSML---rgov-800width.jpg" title="Energy Conservation Building at SML"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1226859/1226859_10190186_1444733805238_ECBatSML---rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Energy Conservation Building at SML"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dedication of the Energy Conservation Building (ECB) at Shoals Marine Laboratory (SML) August 20, 2015</div> <div class="imageCredit">William E.
