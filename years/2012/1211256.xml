<AbstractNarration>Bielecki&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1211256&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his colleague continue development of new mathematical methods for risk management in complex stochastic dynamical systems, such as financial markets.  They consider problems in three areas.  The first is mathematical modeling for financial risk management, with application to hedging, valuation, and management of counterparty credit risk (CCR).  Here they develop mathematical tools for evaluating and managing counterparty risk embedded in a large variety of over-the-counter contracts.  The valuation and hedging of CCR in credit default swaps and interest rate swaps, which are essential for the financial industry, are studied and new analytical tools are developed for this purpose.  The second area involves applications of stochastic analysis to investigation of dependence between Feller-Markov processes.  The investigators study dynamic "copula" problems with regard to Markov processes: given N one-dimensional Markov processes, construct a multivariate Markov process such that each component is also Markovian in its own filtration, and such that its law agrees with the law of the original Markov process.  The third area deals with mathematical modeling of dynamic performance assessment indices with applications to conic finance.  New applications of convex analysis, probability, and L0-module theory are developed to study dynamic Performance Assessment Indices.  Dynamic performance assessment indices are measures of performances of a given activity in a random environment.  They apply this theory to conic finance for the purpose of computing acceptable bounds for arbitrage-free bid and ask prices in illiquid markets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his colleague develop methods to analyze and manage risk in financial markets.  By viewing markets as stochastic systems whose behavior changes in time, they can bring to bear concepts from dynamical systems, probability, and stochastic systems.  They aim to take into account the provisions of recent legislation, such as the Dodd-Frank act of 2011, and the provisions of the Basel III regulations.  Outcomes of the project contribute to increasing the efficiency and competitiveness of financial institutions (both government and private), by effectively controlling the counterparty risk and, by extension, the systemic risk in financial markets.  The study of dynamic performance measures and assessment indices in particular provides new tools beyond the classical Value at Risk or Sharpe Ratio for measuring the risk and performance of a given financial institution (or portfolio).  Results are useful for market participants, including regulators and government agencies.  The project includes the training of graduate students in stochastic analysis and its application to financial markets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ New and fundamental results were obtained for valuation of counterparty risk in the presence of so called additional trigger events. These results are of great importance for financial institutions that need to mark their counterparty risk to changes in credit ratings of their counterparties.   We developed a uni?ed framework, which allows, in particular, to study the structure of dynamic monetary risk measures and dynamic acceptability indices. Using L0 module theory we significantly generalized existing results, that give new insides about structure of measures of risk and performance. We obtained a full characterization (robust representation) of conditional assessment indices, and successfully applied it to stochastic processes.  Risk sensitive criterion has been analyzed in the context of dynamic assessment indices. This criterion is recognized to be fundamentally important in finance, economics and risk management. We proved several new results regarding the nature of this criterion, that provide more insight into its workings.   Significant progress has been made in understanding, modeling and analyzing time consistency of dynamic assessment indices.      Significant progress has been made in the area of statistical inference for Stochastic PDEs. In particular, we developed a new theory about hypothesis testing for the drift parameter in linear parabolic stochastic PDEs, that can be potentially applied to counterparty risk management.   Weak and Strong Markov consistency have been fully characterized for multivariate Markov chains. Based on that the theory of weak and strong Markov copulae has been significantly advanced.  Significant contribution to the theory of conditional Markov chains has been made, by providing a general, change of measure based method to constructing such chains.  We devised a bottom-up dynamic model of portfolio credit risk where instantaneous contagion is represented by the possibility of simultaneous defaults. Due to a Markovian copula nature of the model, calibration of marginals and dependence parameters can be performed separately using a two-step procedure, much like in a standard static copula setup. In this sense this solves the bottom-up top-down puzzle which the CDO industry had been trying to do for a long time. This model can be used for any dynamic portfolio credit risk issue, such as dynamic hedging of CDOs, CDSs, or CVA computations on credit portfolios.  New and fundamental results were obtained in the arbitrage pricing theory, accounting for the post credit crisis changes that took place in financial markets, such as amplified impact of counterparty risk, collateralization, multiplicity of funding rates, non-linearities in formation of portfolio wealth, etc.  Significant and fundamental progress has been made in the area of conic finance via use of dynamic assessment indices and backward stochastic difference equations for the purpose of assessment based valuation and hedging incomplete markets subject to various frictions.
