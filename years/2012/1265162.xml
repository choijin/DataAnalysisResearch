<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project encompasses a systematic effort to elucidate the novel physics driven by spin-orbit interactions (SOI) in heavy transition metal oxides and a rigorous search for new spin-orbital materials having exotic ground states. It is recently established that SOI in heavy transition metal oxides vigorously competes with Coulomb interactions, non-cubic crystal electric field and Hund's rule coupling, and critically biases their mutual competition to stabilize ground states with exotic behavior, which sharply contrasts with traditional electronic structure arguments. The most profound effect of the SOI is the Jeff = 1/2 insulating state, a new quantum state that represents the novel physics in the 5d-based systems. Considerable recent experimental and theoretical work has appeared in response to this new quantum state discovered by the PI and collaborators, presenting us new physics and profound challenges. It is the new physics and challenges that the PI seeks to further pursue. This project provides all students involved rigorous training that emphasizes both synthesis and characterization techniques covering a broad spectrum of materials and experimental probes. The transfer of technical expertise will be achieved via direct integration of the students into ongoing research efforts with a goal of professional journal publication of results. The project also constitutes a key thrust within the Center for Advanced Materials (funded by NSF EPSCoR RII) where the PI is Director.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Condensed matter and materials physics addresses identification of novel, fundamental properties of solids and liquids that have generated a remarkable number of cutting-edge technologies in recent decades. It is widely recognized that whoever discovers and controls the optimized synthesis of novel materials generally controls the investigation of their often unique properties and, ultimately, their successful integration into advanced technologies. Unfortunately, U.S. leadership in materials research has seriously eroded in recent years due to a growing shortage of scientists who possess skills in both the synthesis and characterization of new materials. The current situation presents an urgent national challenge that could ultimately undermine our economic competitiveness if left unaddressed. This project will emphasize discovery, synthesis and characterization of novel transition metal oxides that have already revealed a wide array of phenomena seldom or never found in other materials. This project provides all students involved rigorous training that emphasizes both synthesis and characterization techniques covering a broad spectrum of materials and experimental probes. They will be further trained via short courses, seminars, national lab visits, paper and proposal writing, and conference participation. The project also constitutes a key thrust within the Center for Advanced Materials (funded by NSF EPSCoR RII) where the PI is Director, an association that helps nurturing interdisciplinary expertise that will generate synergies and attract new students who are the future human capital in technologies driving the economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this grant period, we have primarily focused on studies of single crystals of heavy transition metal oxides such as iridates, ruthenates, and rhodates.

Our work has revealed that the spin-orbit interaction strongly competes with the Coulomb interaction and certain other interactions that generate a unique energy hierarchy dictating ground states with exotic behavior.
