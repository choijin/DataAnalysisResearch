<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1202213, Principal Investigator: Daniel C. Isaksen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will carry out computations in motivic homotopy theory, i.e., the homotopy theory of algebraic varieties.  The main point of motivic homotopy theory is to import the powerful methods of homotopy theory from topology to algebraic geometry.  The PI would like to turn this relationship around by using results from algebraic geometry to discover new information about classical homotopy theory.  For example, the PI has used motivic homotopy theory over C to completely reconstruct the classical 2-complete Adams-Novikov spectral sequence in a large range.  Similarly, motivic computations over R have revealed new information about equivariant stable homotopy theory. Specifically, the PI is interested in the motivic version of the Adams spectral sequence, with base field R or C, where thorough computations are possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy theory is a technique for studying geometric objects up to certain kinds of deformations.  Homotopical approaches often allow for concrete calculations that are otherwise inaccessible.  Computations of stable homotopy groups have been a major topic of research in topology since the middle of the 20th century.  Although tremendous progress has been made, much remains unknown.  In the 1990's, Fabien Morel and Vladimir Voevodsky developed motivic homotopy theory.  In analogy to classical homotopy theory, motivic homotopy theory allows us to study algebraic objects up to certain kinds of deformations.  Their goal was to import the techniques of homotopy theory into the realm of algebra.  The PI's goal is the reverse: to use algebraic results to obtain new information about classical homotopy theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ High dimensional spheres are the fundamental building blocks of geometry.  More complicated geometric objects can be constructed by fitting together spheres of different dimensions.  It turns out that there are only certain allowable combinations.  The computation of stable homotopy groups is essentially the process of counting these combinations.  Motivic homotopy theory is a technique for importing geometric techniques into algebra.  This theory is a key component of many important recent advances in the  study of motives and cohomology theories in algebraic geometry.  The project furthered the study of stable homotopy groups via new methods from motivic homotopy theory.  Specifically, the project studied the motivic version of the Adams spectral sequence, with base field R or C, where thorough computations are possible.  The attached image displays this spectral sequence in a large range. These computations will be a guide to the further study of motivic homotopy theory.  Motivic computations over C have already revealed new information about classical stable homotopy theory. For example, motivic homotopy theory over C yielded a complete reconstruction of the classical Adams-Novikov spectral sequence at p = 2 through the 59-stem, including differentials and hidden extensions. Previously published computations extended only to the 39-stem.  Similarly, motivic computations over R revealed new information about Z/2-equivariant stable homotopy theory. In particular, the image of J in Z/2-equivariant stable homotopy groups has different orders than the classical image of J.  The broader impact of the project had two main components. First, domestic students were recruited to study graduate mathematics. Students from non-elite REU programs were invited for campus visits for graduate school information days.  Recruitment channels with faculty from local institutions were developed through the Michigan Section of the Mathematical Association of America.  A second broader impact of the project concerned instructional technology. Although the overall shape and timing is not yet clear, it is certain that technology will change the face of university education over the coming decades. Research mathematicians have a unique and vital role in the development of a new generation of standards, methods, and tools for online instruction. The project helped to develop new instructional modes that make efficient use of resources while preserving the integrity of the educational system.   With this eventual transition in mind, classroom techniques for computer presentation were developed.  A partially online version of a general education mathematics course was piloted.
