<AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the 2012 Optical Fabrication &amp; Testing (OF&amp;T) OSA Topical Meeting, to be held at the Monterey Plaza Hotel in Monterey, California, on July 24-28, 2012, is to discuss the rapidly evolving technology, in a small group, with leaders in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The conference will assemble the key leaders in the field to present recent advances in Optical Fabrication &amp; Testing to discuss future developments and applications. The meeting discussions will advance the leading edge of this technology by bringing together researchers from the different impacted disciplines, to define and answer their emerging needs of the next decades. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: &lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this meeting will be instrumental in defining the research required by the growing demands of Optical Fabrication &amp; Testing. This Topical Meeting of the Optical Society of America will contribute to the training of participating students and the topics will be disseminated through the Conference Technical Digest.</AbstractNarration>
