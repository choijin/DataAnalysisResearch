<AbstractNarration>The existence of dark matter is known from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility motivated by other considerations in elementary particle physics is that dark matter consists of undiscovered elementary particles; Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are one possibility. Evidence for WIMPs that could constitute dark matter may come from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN or from sensitive astronomical instruments that detect radiation produced by WIMP-WIMP annihilations in galaxy halos. The orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nuclear collisions of sufficient energy to be observable by sensitive laboratory apparatus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding for research and development steps to support DarkSide-G2, a second-generation ("G2") direct WIMP search using a liquid argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with an active mass of 3.3 tons. Liquid argon is a promising medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile ("pulse shape") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. This is one of the most powerful background rejection factors among all dark matter detectors, and when combined with the measurement of ionization, background rejection is even further enhanced. The performance of a ton-scale or larger liquid argon TPC would be limited by the high rate of 39-Ar beta decays if atmospheric argon was used. DarkSide-G2 will use argon collected from underground sources which has been shown to have 39-Ar content lower than atmospheric argon by at least a factor of 150. These funds will allow the groups to carry out the detailed mechanical design work necessary to ensure the functionality of the detector, develop necessary high voltage and data acquisition elements, and develop and identify the extremely radiopure detector components and techniques necessary to maximize the sensitivity of the experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer a continuing opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute a cutting-edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; and (3) it will support continued development of successful E&amp;O programs such as the LNGS-South Dakota-Princeton summer school for high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The DarkSide program has sucessfully demostrated the operation of a low background dual phase time projection chamber for the use in a direct dark matter search.  The next step in the evolution of the DarkSide dark matter program is to replace the current inner TPC detector and cryostat with much larger versions, containing up to 5 tons of liquid argon, a G2 size experiment.  The current outer detectors have been built so they can house the G2 size experiment, with very little infrastructure change.  The UCLA group successfully demostrated the major components for the HHV and cryogenic systems, and has demonstrated the feasibility of using silicon photomultipliers inside a novel hybrid photodetector.  These novel photodetectors, being developed within the UCLA group, will have the required ultra-low radioactivity necessary for the next generation of large scale liquid noble detectors.  Finally, the group at UCLA continues to work on many other imprtant R&amp;D projects, all pushing to advance the liquid noble detector technology and it application in the field of physics and beyond.  This includes the design, production and operation of small scale R&amp;D projects aiming to characterize the S2 signal, an important aspect of the background rejection techniques used inside liquid argon TPC detectors.  Results from the DarkSide detector R&amp;D program have shown the advantages of using liquid argon TPCs for the use in rare event searches, and strongly supports the continued advancement and use of these types of detectors in future experiments.
