<AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place on July 2013 at the University of Costa Rica in San Jos√©, Costa Rica.  Organized by Dr. Charles R. Wallace and Dr. Linda M. Ott, both from Michigan Technological University, the PASI will bring together software engineering researchers, industrial representatives, students and practitioners in the area of software quality.  Junior researchers will be exposed to state-of-the-art research in a personal, interactive setting that is conducive to building long-term relationships.  Connections formed at the PASI may lead to a community of professionals committed to collaboration to enhance software quality throughout the Americas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PASI will introduce students to many important techniques in software quality.  In addition to the benefits from developing long term synergistic relationships among faculty members, post docs, and senior PhD students, the PASI is intended to help initiate student exchanges between the programs and institutions involved.  It will help make advances in several dimensions: research, teaching, and industrial practice.  Information from the institute will be available on a website hosted at Michigan Tech, which will showcase the activities that result from the PASI and will include a membership option to allow subscribers to locate others with common interests and communicate with one another through a wiki.</AbstractNarration>

The two-week workshop brought together 16 leading software engineering professionals from academia and industry together with 24 graduate students involved in software engineering research.  Seven countries and 30 institutions from across the Americas were represented. The students attended lectures and tutorials, presented their work at poster sessions, and engaged in one-on-one conversations with professionals in their area.  The topics covered illustrate the broad, cross cutting concerns of software quality: requirements engineering, software quality assessment through visualization, partial behavior modeling, scenario-based design, contracts for multithreaded applications, measuring distributed software development, design rationale, service oriented architecture, code inspection, model based testing, quality management. The primary goal of the workshop was to spur greater research collaboration between institutions in the Americas.  To enable and continue the connections established at the PASQI workshop, the PIs secured additional travel funds from the LACCIR Virtual Institute.  These funds are now being used by student attendees who are making tangible progress based on their experiences at the workshop. Post-PASQI collaborations to date include researchers from Michigan Tech and Georgia Tech in the United States, along with five institutions in Brazil, Chile and Costa Rica.
