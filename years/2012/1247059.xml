<AbstractNarration>U.S. colleges and universities have implemented a wide range of programs to promote diversity in the professoriate.  Special recruitment programs, tenure extension policies for new parents, paid maternity leaves, mentoring programs targeting female and minority faculty members, dual-career hiring initiatives, and ethnic affinity networks for faculty are but a few of the initiatives.  Which of these programs work?  It is anyone?s guess, and critics argue that many of the programs may have no effects, or even adverse effects.  This goal of this project is to understand the role of university recruitment, promotion, diversity, and work-family programs in attracting and retaining female and minority professors.  The project will address questions such as:  Do tenure extension programs for new parents help female faculty members win tenure, or do they do more to help male faculty members, who more often have spouses with low-demand careers?  Do networking programs help African-American and Latino faculty members to succeed, or do they stigmatize and isolate those faculty members?  Do formal promotion requirements help women and minorities to win promotion, or do they serve as window-dressing?   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NCSES' Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) data from 1993 to 2008, as well as new survey data, will be used to address these questions.  The project will develop and pilot a questionnaire designed to obtain historical data on university recruitment, promotion, diversity, and work-family programs, develop a sample of colleges and universities and matched SDR respondents, and build methods for analyzing the data.  The goal is to show the effects of the presence, and adoption, of different programs on the career progression of male and female, majority and minority Ph.D.s.  New methods will be developed for analyzing individual-level data from the SDR panels, using multinomial logit methods in hierarchical linear models, in which individuals are embedded in institutions.  We will develop models that account for both left and right censoring in the data, but which make use of the multiple years of observation available for SDR respondents.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  The result of this project will be to show which types of programs help schools to attract, retain, and promote women and minority faculty members, and will guide future administrators in making choices about program utilization and design.  This project will also train 3 to 5 doctoral students to analyze data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, and to use advanced statistical techniques to examine factors shaping the careers of U.S. scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ U.S. colleges and universities have implemented a wide range of programs to promote diversity in the professoriate.  Special recruitment programs, tenure extension policies for new parents, paid maternity leaves, mentoring programs targeting female and minority faculty members, dual-career hiring initiatives, and ethnic affinity networks for faculty are but a few of the initiatives.  Which of these programs work?  It is anyoneÃ†s guess, and critics argue that many of the programs may have no effects, or even adverse effects.  Do tenure extension programs for new parents help female faculty members win tenure, or do they do more to help male faculty members, who more often have spouses with low-demand careers?  Do networking programs help African-American and Latino faculty members to succeed, or do they stigmatize and isolate those faculty members?  Do formal promotion requirements help women and minorities to win promotion, or do they serve as window-dressing?   This is the pilot phase of a two-phase project, the goal of which is to show the effects of different hiring, promotion, diversity, and work-life policies and programs on the career progression of white, black, Hispanic, and Asian-American men and women STEM (science, technology, engineering, and medicine) faculty members.  I seek to understand which policies and programs help women and underrepresented minorities to progress in STEM fields.  Previous research shows that they are more likely to leave academia, and less likely to flourish.  In this phase of the project, my research team merged data from the 1993 to 2008 panels of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, which tracks the careers of a sample of U.S. Ph.D. recipients.   We developed a questionnaire designed to obtain historical data on university recruitment, promotion, diversity, and work-family programs.  We piloted the survey at 30 colleges and universities, refining it with feedback from respondents.  We developed a sample of 1000 colleges and universities to be surveyed in the next phase, matched SDR respondents, and developed methods for analyzing the data.  This phase of the study has proven the feasibility of surveying colleges and universities to obtain historical information on hiring, promotion, diversity, and work-life programs.  We have identified 13,000 SDR respondents who worked at the largest 1000 colleges and universities.  The pilot permitted my collaborator, Alexandra Kalev, and I to write a successful grant proposal to the Sloan Foundation for funding of the next phase, in which we will survey those 1000 schools, merge university data with career information on SDR recipients who worked at those universities, and analyze policy and program effects on career and salary progress for different race/ethnic-by-gender groups.  The next phase will show us which programs help schools to attract, retain, and promote women and minority faculty members, and will guide future administrators in making choices about program utilization and design.
