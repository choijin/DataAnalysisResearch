<AbstractNarration>This action funds Carol Wang of Carnegie Mellon University to conduct a research project, entitled "New probabilistically checkable proofs," during the summer of 2012 at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan.  The host scientists are Professors Kazuo Iwama and Suguru Tamaki. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project includes gaining a deeper understanding of how hard different mathematical problems are. Many problems that arise in practice are thought to be hard to solve efficiently, and this project, if successful, helps determine which problems remain hard even if we allow approximate solutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
