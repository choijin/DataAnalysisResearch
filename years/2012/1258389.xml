<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel of eligible graduate students from US institutions of higher learning to the second International workshop on mobile systems, applications, and services for healthcare, (mHealthSys 2012). Grant recipients will be required to attend the workshop and participate in a special session to discuss their experience. Recent advances in technology such as miniaturization of sensing and computing devices, new bio sensing modalities (e.g. respiration, SpO2), increasing use of mobile phone sensors for health care, and wireless integration of wearable sensors with smart phones are accelerating the&lt;br/&gt;deployment of mobile systems for healthcare. The goal of the grants is to encourage research&lt;br/&gt;interest and involvement of students who are not well-funded, under-represented, or otherwise&lt;br/&gt;not likely to be able to attend high-profile conferences in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By financially facilitating attendance and generating discussion, the grant will encourage such students to become active in the latest research directions in this important field. The mHealthSys conference will take place in Toronto, Canada, in November 2012. mHealthSys will explore, encourage, and accelerate advances in wearable sensing, mobile phone sensing, algorithms, applications, and services that aim to deliver healthcare in the unconstrained mobile environment of individuals. The mHealthSys 2012 workshop we will bring together a group of international researchers with expertise in mobile systems, sensor systems, and medical informatics to push the state of the art of research at the intersection of mobile systems, sensor systems, and healthcare.</AbstractNarration>
