<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Semiconducting perovskite oxides are made from earth-abundant, non-toxic elements, can be synthesized in high quality heterostructures, and have electronic properties that can be tuned through doping. While these properties make them promising candidates for solar energy conversion, fundamental scientific insights, such as understanding the mechanisms that limit recombination lifetime of photoexcited carriers, are necessary before complex oxides can be utilized for efficient solar energy conversion. The intellectual mission of this project is to identify strategies to maximize photoexcited carrier lifetime and mobility using a combination of advanced thin film deposition and ultrafast spectroscopy.  Thin film heterostructures consisting of the ABO3 perovskite structure, where A is a rare earth or alkaline earth ion and B is a transition metal ion (A = Sr, La, Eu; B = Cr, Fe), will be synthesized using oxide molecular beam epitaxy.  Temperature-dependent time resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS), UV/visible transient absorption (TA) spectroscopies, and Hall effect measurements will be used to probe dynamics of photoexcited carriers and mobility in the perovskite thin films. Through this detailed study of perovskite photophysics, this work will lay the scientific foundation for a new generation of oxide-based solar energy conversion devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a rational basis for designing and selecting new perovskite oxides with long lifetimes, high carrier mobilities, and optimal band gaps for solar energy conversion.  Availability of efficient, low-cost, clean, and sustainable photovoltaics and photocatalysts made from earth-abundant, non-toxic materials would have transformative impact on the US energy portfolio. The project will advance scientific education through activities including the training of graduate and undergraduate students in materials synthesis and characterization techniques, student participation in scientific conferences, and in-class demonstrations of thin film deposition and ultrafast spectroscopy equipment. Outreach will also extend to pre-college students by the PIs? continued participation in mentoring local high school teachers through NSF RET and university-initiated programs.  These programs are particularly beneficial for underrepresented groups since most teachers are from the School District of Philadelphia, whose student body is over 80% minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Professors Steven May and Jason Baxter and their team at Drexel University recently completed research for award ECCS-1201957, studying ultrafast dynamics in perovskite oxide thin films for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications.  Perovskite oxides have conventionally been investigated for electronic and spintronic devices due to the magnetism, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, and metal/insulator transitions that can be found in isostructural compounds having the composition ABO3.  However, some perovskites additionally have light absorbing properties that can expand their potential utility for optoelectronics and solar energy conversion.    The Drexel team has grown high-quality thin films and bilayers of perovskites including LaFeO3, SrFeO3, and LaMnO3 and their alloys using molecular beam epitaxy and has characterized their structural, optical, and electronic properties.  By careful adjustment of reaction conditions, these materials could be grown with very low defect densities and in crystal structures that were coherent with the underlying substrate. The perovskite composition, including both La:Sr ratio and oxygen vacancies, was used to control the absorption profile across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, providing new insight into the role of Fe valence in optical absorption. Absorption of light generated both photoexcited charge carriers (e.g. electrons) and heat, which were probed using transient absorption and transient reflectance spectroscopy.  Dynamic response of the materials on picosecond to nanosecond time scales was relatively insensitive to composition within the La1-xSrxFeO3-d family.  Beyond monolithic films, charge and heat transfer across perovskite interfaces were investigated using perovskite heterostructures.  For example, LaFeO3/LaMnO3 formed a Type I heterojunction that enabled heat to transfer from photoexcited LaMnO3 to LaFeO3, but confined photoexcited carriers to LaMnO3.  Such investigations may provide new methods to determine thermal conductivity using ultrafast dynamic response.  In addition to perovskites, our team made contributions to understanding photocatalytic response of other oxides, including brookite (TiO2) and hematite (Fe2O3), using a combination of ultrafast spectroscopy and measurement of photoelectrochemical devices.  Overall, this work has resulted in more detailed understanding of process-structure-property relationships for oxides of interest for photovoltaics and photocatalysis.   Detailed research results have been disseminated to the research community and are also accessible to the general public.  This grant resulted in 7 publications in peer-reviewed journals, with 2 more in preparation.  Research was also presented at 5 national and international conferences.   This grant provided the primary support for education and training of one PhD students and partial support for four others. One of these students now works in the optoelectronics industry at Cree Inc., and three others will defend their PhD theses within the next year.  Additionally, one undergraduate student participated in this project and is planning to pursue a PhD as well.       Last Modified: 11/29/2016       Submitted by: Jason B Baxter]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
