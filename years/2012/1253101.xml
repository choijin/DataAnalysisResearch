<AbstractNarration>Ecologists have long recognized that species interactions change over time due to the progression of seasons and changes in the life stages of organisms. However, our understanding of how species interactions are coordinated in time and of the potential implications of disrupting this coordination remains limited. Better understanding of this is particularly important because climate change has the potential to disrupt the timing of species interactions in ecological communities; detailed studies in real-world, ecological communities are necessary to understand the consequences of these changes. This project will study the consequences of changes in the relative timing of interactions between monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), their host plants (Asclepias spp., or milkweeds), and the associated community of other plants and arthropod. Field experiments, observational studies, historic datasets, and computer simulation models will be used to test: 1) how shifts in the relative timing of milkweed-monarch interactions affect the growth and survival of monarch caterpillars, 2) how the timing of milkweed-monarch interactions has changed over the past four decades, and 3) how the evolutionary history of a community affects the incidence and impacts of shifts in the timing of interactions. This study will create new knowledge about how ecological communities respond to shifts in the timing of species interactions in order to better understand the vulnerability and resilience of complex natural systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work will include a combined research and education project, the Monitoring Milkweed-Monarch Interactions for Learning and Conservation (MMMILC) Project. Under the guidance of faculty and graduate students, undergraduate students in the MMMILC Project will mentor local high school students while they collect long-term observational data on milkweed-monarch interactions. These high school students will include students from groups that are currently under-represented in science. By combining a large-scale, long-term observational research study with a multi-level mentorship program, the MMMILC Project aims to make a lasting contribution to both science and education.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goals of this project were 1) to learn more about the seasonal timing of milkweed-monarch interactions, and 2) to generate a unique local, large-scale, long-term dataset about the timing of milkweed-monarch interactions using a combined research/mentorship model. We have been successful in both goals, producing outcomes with strong intellectual merit and broader impacts for society. &nbsp;</p> <p>Our studies have shown that monarchs at our field sites have &ldquo;seasonal windows of opportunity&rdquo; for successful larval development on milkweed. We used field experiments to show that these windows of opportunity depend on seasonal changes in climatic conditions, seasonal changes in the quality and quantity of milkweed host plants, and seasonal changes in the risk of attack by predators. Subsequent experiments showed that as milkweed host plants get older through the season, the quantity of food available to monarchs also increases, but the quality of this food declines as older plants increase their defensive traits. These studies are important because they show how the nature of milkweed-monarch interaction changes over time; seasonal differences within a species can be as large as mean differences between species.&nbsp;</p> <p>In another study, we used structured experiments to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of climate on milkweeds and monarchs. We showed that both direct and indirect effects are important, and can have opposing effects. In this context, &ldquo;direct&rdquo; effects are the effects of temperature on an organism, while &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; effects are the effects of temperature on an organism mediated by its effects on a second interacting organism. &nbsp;</p> <p>We also experimentally manipulated the seasonal timing of monarch herbivory on milkweeds, and observed that the timing of herbivory had effects on milkweed growth and reproduction that persisted throughout the growing season and into the next generation.</p> <p>During this time, we also generated a high-resolution temporal dataset of milkweed-monarch phenology over multiple years as part of the Monitoring Milkweed-Monarch Interactions for Learning and Conservation (MMMILC) Project. This dataset is allowing us to identify important and previously undocumented patterns of seasonal timing in this system. This project created opportunities for &gt;190 high school students, many from groups underrepresented in science, to make develop scientific skills, and to make substantive contributions to the collection of a scientific dataset.</p> <p>In other studies, we conducted a parallel observational study at remote field sites in order to repeat phenological observations of milkweed-monarch interactions from &gt;40 years ago, examined the role of heat waves on caterpillar growth and coloration, collected data on thermal accumulation cues of spring emergence phenology in two species of milkweeds, used hydrogen isotope data to estimate the natal origins of overwintering monarch butterflies, and supported research into the fitness consequences of phenological shifts in native bees.</p> <p>Two additional projects stand out for their more general contributions to our fundamental understanding of ecology. The first is a modeling project focused on explaining observed variation in phenological shifts under climate change. This model illustrates how the evolution of phenological cueing strategies can explain observed variation in phenological shifts and unexpected responses to climate change resulting from fundamental features of climatic data.This model is important because it shows how fundamental aspects of cue integration systems could affect current and future responses to climate change. Second, this project supported the development of a perspectives review that aims to move community ecology towards the development of a more temporally explicit perspective. This review suggests some specific ways in which community ecology is moving towards a more detailed consideration of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>These research projects have also had broader impacts outside of academic science. We have supported four postdocs, five graduate students, &gt;30 undergraduate students and &gt;190 high school students in their professional development, broadening participation in science. This project has also supported presentations to public audiences, non-governmental organizations, and non-scientific campus groups. These presentations have helped to communicate our scientific findings to a broader audience of interested stakeholders outside of academic science.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/13/2020<br>      Modified by: Louie&nbsp;H&nbsp;Yang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1253101/1253101_10235411_1578100569768_DSC_0201--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1253101/1253101_10235411_1578100569768_DSC_0201--rgov-800width.jpg" title="cover image for Yang and Cenzer 2020"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1253101/1253101_10235411_1578100569768_DSC_0201--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="cover image for Yang and Cenzer 2020"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cover image for Yang and Cenzer 2020, in press at Ecology.
