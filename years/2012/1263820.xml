<AbstractNarration>James Rementer and Bruce Pearson helped the Delaware Tribe of Indians of Bartlesville, Oklahoma create a lexical database of the Lenape or Delaware Indian language.  Lenape is an eastern Algonquian language historically spoken in southeastern New York State, all of New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, and the northern part of the State of Delaware. Many place names in the eastern United States originate from this language, e.g. Manhattan. In this sense, the Lenape language is part of the heritage of the Lenape people and also the wider US English-speaking community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work on the Lenape Language Database Project began in 1997 and was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation.  The database in its current form includes 15,460 single-word entries with sound files, 22 linguistically analyzed narratives and 4 hymns.  The current project, Lenape Language Online Dictionary Project, will add data from lists of Lenape words collected between the 1600s and 1800s.  This addition will allow for commentary on Lenape historical lexical development. The computational sophistication of the search parameters will be developed so that grammatical information will be linked to words to provide semantic and grammatical context to the lexical entries. Consultants on the project include Delaware tribal member and professor of German, Dr. Grant Leneaux and author and expert on early materials on the Lenape, Raymond Whritenour.  The resulting products will create a link betwtee the Lenape community and their heritage language.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    In the year 2002 thanks to funding from National Science Foundation we began to work on the initial dictionary database of the Lenape or Delaware Indian language.  The original homeland of the Lenape was what is now all of New Jersey, northern Delaware, eastern Pennsylvania, and southeastern New York State.  The language used in the Lenape Talking Dictionary is what linguists call the "Southern Unami Dialect."  The language project is now called the Lenape Talking Dictionary.  We had done a survey of tribal members and their families to determine what subjects they were most interested in.  We also questioned what would be the best format and way to reach tribal members and the general public interested in the Lenape or Delaware Indian people.  An online dictionary with over 12,000 words was created beginning in 2002.  Much of the initial work included meetings to plan the layout of the dictionary and assembling of the various recordings made with native speakers that were to be converted into digital format.  It was necessary to edit these files into individual word sound files or sentence files.  In 2006 the Lenape Talking Dictionary went online and was possibly the earliest online dictionary of a Native American language to have sound files spoken by native speakers.  It included many Lenape words with accompanying sound files.  In subsequent years sound files, photographs, sample sentences, a section on grammar, and basic lessons were added.  The database presently has over 16,500 words of which 8,900 have single word sound files. The Sentence section has 1,800 sentence sound files.  Forty-four Story files with 1,110 lines of sound files have also been added.  We found that users of the dictionary were also interested in historic versions of Lenape words so words from lists created in the 1600s were added.  There are very extensive lists from the 1700's mostly the work of the Moravian missionaries such as dictionaries, hymnals, and word lists.  A number of these have also been added.  Some words from the recently published Delaware Indian Language of 1824 have also been added to the dictionary.    There have been frequent requests for translations of Lenape place names.  A number of the old place names were reviewed and recorded with Lenape speakers and some have been added to the Lenape Talking Dictionary.  We plan to continue to add place names along with sound files.  Only names which are clear as to translation have been added.  These are names such as Passyunk (part of Philadelphia) meaning (æin the valley &ndash; pahsayunkÆ), and its variant form, Passaic, New Jersey, meaning  (ævalley - pahsa&egrave;kÆ), and Manayunk (æwhere we drink - m&euml;neyunkÆ) which is also part of Philadelphia.  The Lenape Talking DictionaryÆs website is the only link connecting Lenape people to their ancestral language with the majority of the words being spoken by the last generation of fluent speakers to whom Lenape was their first language.  Moreover, given the significance of Lenape in the Algonquian language family, the linguistic analyses presented by the website constitute a useful reference and model for the scholarly community.  The sound files can be useful in linguistics classes, and the stories section can be a valuable resource for anthropology and folklore studies.
