<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the research of Professor Bevilacqua of Pennsylvania State University to examine proton transfer in a small, non-metalloribozyme.  It is presently unclear how the initial step in this reaction--attack of a 2'hydroxyl on an adjacent phosphate--is catalyzed.  Two limiting models of participation of an anionic guanine and of a solvent-resident species will be examined.  Goals of this research are to identify the general (or specific) base in the reaction, determine its pKa, examine the driving forces for pKa shifting, and establish the base's contributions to proton transfer in the chemical step.  Complementary experiments on model systems will be conducted in an effort to identify driving forces for pKa shifting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of this project are three-fold.  First, several undergraduates will participate in the research.  They will measure driving forces for pKa shifting in nucleotides and oligonucleotides and be broadly trained.  Second, the PI will help develop a departmental-wide program in undergraduate thesis research.  Undergraduates conducting original research will write and orally defend a research topic.  This process will involve several semesters of research and one summer.  Last, the results of this research project will be broadly disseminated through both publication and programs/podcasts available to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award allowed us to investigate the mechanism of catalytic RNAs, or "ribozymes".  Our approach involved both experiments and calculations.  We uncovered two new catalytic strategies of ribozymes: (1) Competition with the nucleophile for a specific atom, to release and activate the nucleophile, and (2) Acidification of the nucleophile to facilitate reaction.  These two strategies allow the reaction to be initiated and so are critical to catalysis.  We then showed, using computational means, that these two strategies are conserved across most known ribozymes.  Other findings from our work include establishing inverse thio effects as a key way to probe ribozyme mechanism, and showing the metal ions can inhibit non-metalloribozymes.  Practical outcomes of these studies are enabling of biotechnology and health-related applications involving RNA switches and therapeutics.  This work also trained a number of scientists including a graduate student who obtained her PhD and now works for a start-up company and an undergraduate who obtained his BS studying with this graduate student and is now pursuing his PhD at UC Irvine.  In the course of these studies, the PI helped establish a program for ALL students (not just honors students) to write a research thesis and graduate with a certificate of research excellence (SCIRES at Penn State).  We also established a summer chemistry workshop for the Millennium Scholars program, which has brought over 100 primarily underrepresented students to Penn State as undergraduates.
