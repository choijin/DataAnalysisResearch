<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop in-clinic proof of concept for fully automated cardiac multiparametric strain analysis (MPS) technology capable of identifying left ventricular (LV) contractile injury. The innovation in this technology is centered not in MRI tissue tagging (which has been clinically available for decades), but rather in the post-processing cardiac MRI files. Post-processing analysis of cardiac MRI tissue-tagging displacement information is based upon the comparison of three systolic strain components to the normal average and standard deviation established in our normal human strain database. The strain values are "normalized" and combined into novel and powerful multiparametric strain indices. Because cardiac MRI can capture transmural and not just wall contractility over the course of a cardiac cycle, MPS post processing can identify the erratically functioning loci through the ventricular wall. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development and commercialization of a reliable metric that provides insight into accurate timing of surgery. Many heart failure programs have adopted a very low threshold for early highly invasive intervention. The associated yearly cost of caring for heart patients has risen above $300 billion. Heart failure is currently the most rapidly increasing clinical manifestation of cardiac disease in the United States. A better understanding and the ability to monitor contractile injury distribution over time could lead to more precise surgical referral. This would represent a major improvement in diagnostic and therapeutic heart failure care and have the potential to profoundly impact U.S. health care.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S. and across the globe. Cardiac surgical and catheter-based interventions in patients with coronary arterial, valvular, and myopathic (heart muscular) disease have proven clinical effectiveness. Timely identification of a disease process and immediate, aggressive, therapeutic intervention can have dramatic impact on outcomes in these patient subsets. However, such intervention often comes too late. The very first symptom of at least one third of patients with ischemic coronary artery disease is sudden death. In addition, many patients with valvular and myopathic disease remain relatively asymptomatic for much of the natural course of their disease, during which significant irreversible myocardial injury can be sustained.  There is a critical need to be able to identify the disease process in a timely fashion before irreversible myocardial damage is sustained or sudden death occurs. The aim of the CardioWise Phase I project was to prove a method of quantitatively monitoring cardiac health over a period of time that will provide predictive information to guide medical and surgical therapeutic intervention. The CardioWise method of quantitatively monitoring cardiac health makes use of well-established magnetic resistance imaging (MRI) equipment and techniques. The method involves first acquiring a set of MRI images in a precisely specified sequence, then processing the images to develop a point-by-point health score. With the status quo, various measurements or images may be made to assess the heart. However, there is lack of ability to quantify such information, and to evaluate changes over time. Typically, a radiologist evaluates the results and provides the physician with qualitative assessment. With any repeated evaluation, comparison of results is purely qualitative. As a result,  $17 billion is spent in the U.S. each year on additional tests, many of them unnecessary.  In addition, intervention is often delayed, resulting in  compromised effectiveness.  During the project, CardioWise, Inc. demonstrated the feasibility of developing a cardiac strain analysis software package (CardioWise MPSA) capable of quantitative four-dimensional (three dimensions of strain with time) analysis of the left ventricle of the heart as it moves through the full cardiac cycle.  The CardioWise MPSA uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to measure and analyze contractile function  (viability of the heart muscle).  Essentially, MPSA measures "the ability of the heart to pump blood".  This addresses the first and most important question that a cardiac surgeon needs to have answered to determine the most effective intervention when a patient presents with cardiovascular disease symptoms. Due to the comprehensive nature of the analysis, all three critical areas of concern, coronary arteries, myocardium (heart muscle) and valves may be evaluated with a single MRI scan.  Once developed, CardioWise MPSA may also accurately predict patient response to medical therapy and surgery, enabling medical professionals to more confidently select cardiac treatment regimens.   The guiding principle of CardioWise is that "Patients are our Customers."  So, it very important that patients be able to understand their diagnosis, that they have timely access to the data, and that procedures are affordable (saves healthcare costs). The analysis output is depicted in a transparent, rotatable, 4D color map that is easy to interpret.   CardioWise completed the goals of the NSF SBIR Phase I project that were originally defined to further those corporate values:  Developed the end-to-end cloud-based capabilities for image acquisition, analysis, and reporting.  This allows the analysis to be sent to any mobile device so that patients (or caregivers) can see and understand their analysis and actively participate in decisions regarding their treatment. Automated the components of the image analysis currently...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
