<AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial financial support for a two-day workshop that will bring together ERFI/RESIN principal investigators, program directors, and others from universities, federal agencies, and industries to discuss theories and methods to advance the design of future infrastructures that will be more resilient and sustainable in light of the growing coupling between infrastructures.  A white paper will be crafted on the challenges facing researchers in this field.  Included will be identification of research gaps, determination of common ground that defines metrics and evolving theories of sustainability and resiliency.  The workshop will continue to define education requirements for professionals charged with designing and managing complex, critical infrastructures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to organize the fourth workshop in the series of National Science Foundation (NSF) EFRI RESIN workshops and disseminate its results.  The EFRI program is an Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation program intended to fund high risk, multi-disciplinary research to address problems of broad concern and significance to the American people.  In 2007 NSF solicited proposals to address a specific EFRI program topic RESIN (REsilient and Sustainable INfrastructures).  In particular NSF was interested in how to develop new technologies that coupled infrastructures together.  Traditionally infrastructures are design, developed and maintained assuming they had little effect on other infrastructures.    This assumption had practical benefits in the earlier days of technology development but is not a very good one in our complex interdependent world.  This is especially true as new technologies are developed that couple infrastructures together in ways not originally anticipated when those infrastructures were developed.  For example the advent of plugin hybrid vehicles coupled the transportation and electric power infrastructures.  So a fundamental research question how is one designs plugin electric hybrid vehicles so that not only does the vehicle perform well but that the resilience and sustainability of the transportation and electric power infrastructures are improved.     The fourth in a series of workshops was held in November 29 and 30, 2012, "Challenges to the Emerging Discipline of Resilient and Sustainable Interdependent Critical Infrastructures "at NSF in Washington DC.  The workshop was attended by the Project Directors and their collaborators of the EFRI RESIN projects funded by NSF.  The NSF "project" for which this outcome report is being written sponsored the workshop.     The objective was to define the future challenges of research on interdependent or coupled infrastructures.  More specifically to discuss and agree on the following questions: (1) What are the accomplishments of the RESIN program? (all projects viewed collectively); (2) Are these accomplishments important and, if so, why?;. (3) What remains to be accomplished?; (4) Are these challenges important to address?; and (5) Would a Resin II program be an appropriate way to provide support for addressing the challenges?     The specific outcomes were: 1) Coming to a common understanding of why the RESIN program was important. 2) Agreeing on reasons why future programs supporting research on coupled infrastructures are needed. 3) Recognizing that while all the RESIN teams were interdisciplinary some very important disciplines were not represented (e.g., sociology, public policy, business, etc.) and 4) Additional programs being offered that push teams to broaden their interdisciplinary teams is critical.     A set of detailed recommendations was sent to Bruce Hamilton, Project Monitor for NSF, shortly after the workshop.  A detailed report about the workshop and its results can be found in the projectÆs final report.          Last Modified: 07/21/2015       Submitted by: Jeffrey L Stein]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
