<AbstractNarration>This EAGER project develops and tests a new model for integrating education research and evaluation with education innovation and practice.  This project explores using a Network Improvement Community which aims to eliminate the silos that frequently arise in communities driven by theoretical interests. Instead, researchers are encouraged to collaborate with  practitioners and design/developers on understanding and solving high-leverage problems of practice. The approach developed in the proposal provides an alternative to the usual investigator-driven one that guides most education research efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model will be developed and tested in the context of Statway, a large educational improvement project focused on community college developmental mathematics led by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.  Specifically, the project will create and develop a research network that will function as one component of Statway.  The project will determine if researchers and students, and can be recruited into the network and sustain their engagement in investigating a significant problem of practice.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to design, implement, and test a new approach to engaging academic researchers in improving education. This new approach included getting researchers to work on high-leverage problems of practice, to take a systems approach to improvement, to collaborate with practitioners and design/developers, and to work, at least partly, in the context in which their research findings are intended to be applied.  We created an alpha lab research network attached to a national, education improvement project: the Carnegie Pathways Project, a community college developmental mathematics initiative. Through the Network, academic researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds contributed their knowledge and expertise to solving the most challenging problems that are faced by the Pathways.  We identified and prioritized problems facing community college developmental math students that might be resolved through alpha lab research; identified researchers who have the skills, experience, and interest required to work on the problems, and recruited them into the alpha lab network; supported these researchers to secure funding for their work, and to make their projects successful; and provided researchers with a means of sharing their findings with other researchers and with the wider networked improvement community.   A primary mechanism to encourage scholars to become involved in alpha lab research was the granting of four pre-doctoral fellowships (though we also lent support to scholars who did not receive funding from us).  We hypothesized that pre-doctoral fellowships would be an economical way to involve not only new scholars, but also senior scholars, who served as their mentors.  Our pre-doctoral fellowsÆ projects have thus far produced the following findings:  Project 1: The mindset intervention developed and tested in this project led to a closing of the achievement gap (i.e., pass rates) between Hispanic and White students. An alternative writing activity (i.e., summarization) demonstrated efficacy for improving pass rates across classes. These effects were strongest in lower-level courses and particularly strong for individuals receiving Pell grants.  Project 2: This project tested effects of an arousal reappraisal intervention on exam performance among developmental math students.  Students in the arousal reappraisal condition reported improved stress appraisals (i.e., decreased negative appraisals) from Exam 1 (pre-manipulation) to Exam 2 (post-manipulation) and exhibited improved performance compared to placebo controls.  Project 3: One aim of this project was to test whether institutional difficulties undermine first-generation studentsÆ sense of belonging.  Undergraduates were randomly assigned to complete either a frustrating or non-frustrating web form that was ostensibly part of a new university program to help students. First-generation students who completed the frustrating form reported lower belonging than those who completed the non-frustrating form. No effects were observed among continuing generation students.  Project 4: The newest of our supported projects is investigating the psychological construct of the value of community college and will culminate in the development and testing of a scalable intervention.  Interviews with community college students have led to a practical theory that points to potential motivational problems that community college students could face &ndash; problems that could be exacerbated by typical relevance interventions.  A grant proposal spawned by the work we funded has recently been recommended for funding from IES.  Another proposal is currently being revised for re-submission and a third is still in review. As the work of these researchers continues, the interventions they develop with spread to other classrooms and to other campuses.  In fact, the beginnings of that spread is underway.  Overall, our test of a new approach to engaging academic researc...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
