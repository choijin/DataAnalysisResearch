<AbstractNarration>Public policy and system engineering for cyber security depend on effective techniques for assessing and comparing architectures, designs, algorithms, protocols, implementations and performance within hostile and malicious operating environments. This workshop is to advance a general approach to predictive measurement for cyber security and information assurance based on work factor analysis. Various frameworks for analysis will be adduced across classes of algorithms, systems and architectures and application areas. The aim of these frameworks include enabling market mechanisms for security based on sound metrics, assessing the resilience of critical infrastructure against nation-state threats, and evaluating the effectiveness of asymmetric cyber operations against adaptive organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will raise awareness across the many communities increasingly involved with cybersecurity and will encourage greater participation in discussion of critical issues at the intersection of public policies for cybersecurity and science of security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Public policy and system engineering for cyber security depend on effective techniques for assessing and comparing architectures, designs, algorithms, protocols, implementations and performance within hostile and malicious operating environments. Predictive security and resilience metrics can enable market mechanisms to scale security, enterprise architects to assess the resilience of critical infrastructure against nation-state threats, and military planners to evaluate the effectiveness of asymmetric cyber operations against adaptive organizations. Predictive security and resilience metrics are urgently need to help advance engineering of trustworthy systems and design of robust enterprise security architectures. In February 2013, the Obama Administration issued an Executive Order (EO) 13636 and Presidential Policy Directive PPD-21 to improve security and resilience in critical infrastructure. Naturally, the National Institute of Standards mandate to define best practices in its Cyber Security Framework can become a better tool leading to better outcomes as it is able to incorporate predictive metrics. This project explored a general approach to predictive measurement for cyber security and information assurance based on Work Factor Analysis.  Work Factor Analysis (WFA) conceptualizes the security domain as a game between an attacker and a defender across a set of attack surfaces and seeks to assess the difficulty of attack and defense across their life cycles as a guide for better security engineering. WFA utilizes evaluation frameworks and associated metrics to characterize the fitness of designs and architectures to statically and dynamically resist adversaries with specific multi-spectrum capabilities. To this end, the project organized and held a 3-day workshop on evaluation frameworks for predictive security and resilience metrics and a follow up smaller 1-day workshop:   The Workshop on Multi-spectrum Metrics for Cyber Defense (WMMCD), October 2013   Workshop on Defining a National Research Agenda for Work Factor Analysis and Predictive Multi-spectrum Metrics (WMMCD2), December, 2015   WMMCD brought together 72 leading scientists and engineers, scholars and practitioners to advance development of methodologies for predictive security and resilience metrics for use in the design, production, operation, and evaluation of cyber systems and their organizational embeddings. The workshop considered predictive metrics based on WFA in the following technical domains:   Host architectures, including hardware, operating systems, programming languages;   Network architectures, including routing, monitoring, tagging, provenance;   Cryptographic systems and infrastructures;   Enterprise IT architectures and critical infrastructure, including cyber physical systems.   After a review of the state of the art in security and resilience metrics, the workshop sensitized leading experts from academia, industry, and government to the WFA approach to predictive security and resilience metrics in the context of transformational architectures, novel algorithms, recent advances in cryptography, and challenges of enterprise architectures, including critical infrastructure. As a follow up to the original workshop, WMMCD2 brought together 22 experts from academia, industry, and government to focus on the need for a research program to develop the discipline of work factor analysis for predictive multi-spectrum metrics. A WFA discipline will enable systematic design of systems and organizations to resist the capabilities of various classes of threat actors from hackers, who use attack tools downloaded from the Internet, up to top tier nation states, who create new vulnerabilities. Such a research program is necessary for prioritization and strategic leverage in cyber strategy, for evaluation of research  and operational investments, and for scaling cyber defense. As a general outcome, the workshop sought to advance our knowledge of threat-informed predictive security metrics in order to enable research programs for trust metrics based on work factor and resilience analysis. Beyond sensitizing the research community to WFA and predictive metrics, the two workshops catalyzed various analyses and designs incorporating WFA, industry efforts to achieve work factor impacts in their products, courses incorporating WFA, and  concepts for a research program. The Intellectual Merit is based on the pressing but challenging problem to create measurable metrics for security, which entails the modeling of current and anticipated attackers and of systems, including defenses against attacks.  Predictive security and resilience metrics are a known infosec grand challenge problem.
