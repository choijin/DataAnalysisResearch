<AbstractNarration>For fifty years, the Tibetan Plateau has been recognized as the largest topographic feature that perturbs atmospheric circulation.  It serves as an ideal field laboratory for understanding the geodynamic processes that build high terrain.  Accordingly, the growth of the plateau should have altered atmospheric circulation and therefore written an evolving paleoclimatic signature not only on eastern Asian regional climates, but on global climate as well.  Despite many recent studies, we still do not know precisely when the Tibetan Plateau reached its current dimensions and how it perturbs atmospheric circulation.  This project brings together geodynamicists, atmospheric scientists, and paleoclimatologists in a multidisciplinary study of the when and the how.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major goals of the project is to quantify the extent to which Tibet has grown by crustal thickening, by thrust faulting and folding, by flow within the crust that redistributes material there, or by replacement of cold mantle lithosphere with hotter material (all in a state of isostatic equilibrium). Such quantification will take big steps toward the understanding of how high plateaus are built and how continental lithosphere deforms, topics at the forefront of geodynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determining how Tibet has grown will require determining when crustal shortening and thickening occurred, using basic field methods and modern laboratory techniques, and quantifying paleoaltitudes with new isotopic tools. Applying such paleoaltimetric techniques, however, requires an understanding not only of how the atmosphere transports isotopes, but how the evolving high terrain affected surface temperatures at times in the past.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching aim of this project was to study the rise of the Tibetan Plateau and its influence on climate.   Among the several collaborating institutions, the University of Minnesota group focused on studying the climate history of the region.  We did so by collecting deposits that formed in limestone caves.  We then analyzed the layers in these deposits.  One type of analysis gave us an indication of the climate at the time the layer formed.  The other type of analysis gave us the age of the layer.  By piecing together the information from thousands of successive layers, we constructed a histories of climate, from different localities in the region.  The longest of these climate records extends back in time over 250,000 years.  The records, themselves, may be the most important of the results of our research, as they will be used by other scientists for many years.  We did, however, analyze our newly-constructed records for clues about the relationship between the Tibetan Plateau and climate change.  We did so in collaboration with fellow scientists in the larger group, who studied our records using computer models.  Others (including the Colorado group leading this project) had proposed that the seasonal pattern of rainfall in China is affected by the position of the jet stream relative to the Tibetan Plateau.  In the winter, the jet passes to the south of the Plateau and climate to the east of the Plateau, in southeastern China, is dry.  As the jet moves northward during the year, it hits the southern portion of the Tibetan Plateau in late spring.  This results in moderate rainfall in southeastern China.   As the jet moves further north in summer, heavy monsoon rainfall hits southeastern China.   The analysis of our records indicates that, at times in the past, the jet did not reach as far north as it does during the summer today.  At those times, there was less summer rainfall in southeastern China.  This result is important for understanding one way that climate can change in the region.  It is also important as we consider whether or not the circumstances that led to past changes in climate could emerge in the coming decades and centuries.
