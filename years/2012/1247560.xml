<AbstractNarration>The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), organized under the auspices of the International Council for Science recently completed a synthesis of its first decade of research and is embarking on its second decade with a broader, and even more integrative research agenda. The overall goal of this effort is to study interactions between biological, chemical and physical processes, and human systems. This effort will be conducted through eight core projects focused on the three major Earth System compartments (land, ocean and atmosphere), the three interfaces between these compartments, and two projects dealing with systems-level integration from the past through the present and into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IGBP will be coordinated by a scientific committee supported by the IGBP Secretariat. These coordination and integration activities will be aimed at facilitating the Earth System Science focus of the IGBP network by a) affecting efficient and comprehensive communication between the IGBP core projects and providing the Earth System context for the these projects; b) collaborating with its international partner programmes in the transdisciplinary Earth System Science Partnership to address wider issues of sustainability science and put IGBP results in the global change context; c) communicating the results of IGBP investigations into global environmental change in an understandable way to the wider scientific community, the education sector, agencies and other stakeholder organizations, and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integration will involve careful planning: identifying systems-level hypotheses and questions, constructing research infrastructure to address them, and ensuring that the efforts of the IGBP core projects are carried out in a synergistic manner. This will enable scientists from the natural and related social sciences and from more than eighty countries to collaborate in an efficient and focused manner to advance, not only their disciplinary fields, but, more importantly, address systems-level global environmental change issues. The IGBP will also continue to develop new ways of communicating the results of its research to stakeholders outside the science community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Solutions to global environmental challenges require new ways of thinking and new approaches to problem solving. Science, policy, industry and other stakeholders must find new ways of working together. The magnitude and complexity of regional and global environmental challenges require expanded international collaborations and resources, additional expertise and enhanced leadership. Over the course of three decades, IGBP has embodied this approach. With NSF sponsorship over the past three years, IGBP enhanced the organizationÆs international network to create and sustain leadership in research and activities in support of global sustainability. The organization set new research priorities and developed the international research agenda for coming decades by engaging a range of stakeholders; it deepened engagement between IGBP scientists and the Earth observations community and major space agencies, including NASA.

The IGBP Secretariat worked closely with the UNFCCCÆs Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) to deliver policy-relevant findings on climate change. Over the years, IGBP has coordinated SBSTA "research dialogues"; addressed data and information gaps; identified good practices for knowledge and research capacity building; and provided key scientific highlights.
