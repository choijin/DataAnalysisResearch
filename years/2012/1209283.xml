<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: California State University Long Beach and the University of California Los Angeles are studying interdisciplinary collaborative research models (ICRM) and the impact of ICRM experiences on undergraduate women in computer science and engineering (CSE). The central objective of the study is to investigate how ICRM experiences in CSE departments shape undergraduate women's educational and vocational trajectories (persistence in major, graduation, intention to pursue graduate degrees and/or careers in computing) to generate data relevant for improving CSE curricula/programs. The theoretical approach incorporates the intersection of personal and organizational variables: organizational culture theory allows for close analysis of the departmental cultures in which students experience ICRM, and vocational choice theory includes background and societal impact and allows for individual agency in career decisions.  The study will include six pre-selected case study institutions and incorporates a multi-phased approach in which the cases and research subjects are studied in-depth over three years involving in-person observations and interviews with students, faculty and academic leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: ICRM activities are increasing in colleges and universities, and understanding their impact is important for enhancing the enrollment, persistence, and graduation of women CSE majors who pursue computing professions. The results of this study, disseminated through multiple venues to both practitioners and researchers, will provide an understanding of how ICRM activities may positively impact women's educational and vocational trajectories in computing fields. Moreover, the study has the potential to build networks of practitioners and researchers who have an interest in improving the experiences and retention of women in CSE departments and professions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Highly trained technology workers are key to the 21st century economy.  Computer science and engineering (CSE) have become popular majors on college campuses, and many students who major in other subjects take at least one CSE course during their college careers. Despite CSE?s growth, we have not witnessed a corresponding expansion of women who pursue CSE majors and careers. In fact, CSE has one of the lowest female participation rates of all engineering disciplines, with women comprising less than 15% of the undergraduate CSE population as compared to nearly 40% for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields overall. Research has demonstrated that CSE is not attractive to women and that many CSE departments and professional domains are inhospitable to women, given their male-dominated cultures.     CSE undergraduate departments are seeking ways to mitigate these problems, and some are employing innovative approaches to address the dearth of female CSE students and graduates. Using a theoretical grounding in Martin?s (2002) Theory of Organizational Culture and Gottfredson?s (2002) Theory of Circumspection, Compromise, and Self-creation, we sought to understand how innovative CSE departments effectively promote undergraduate women?s interest in and preparation for pursuing computing careers. Our central goal was to identify the common denominators of innovative CSE departments to better understand what other universities can do to ensure that women select, persist, and graduate from CSE departments with the potential to continue with a technology-related career.     Our collective case study spans five years and includes four institutions with highly innovative programs and strong track records of attracting and retaining women alongside two counterfactual cases with more traditional curricula and lower involvement of women. The innovative institutions were selected based upon meeting four criteria: (1) participation as an Academic Alliance member of the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT), (2) having 10 or more undergraduate women majors, (3) having a high proportion of females among the graduating class (&gt; 15%), and (4) having significant presence of innovative activities/curricular for undergraduates. In addition, the researchers selected two counterfactual institutions that (1) have traditional curricula, (2) are not members of NCWIT, (3) have low graduation rates of women, and (4) have at least 10 undergraduate women enrolled. The research team of principal investigators and graduate student researchers collected over 120 hours of observational data across the six sites and conducted 45 interviews with faculty, departmental administrators, and staff. As a central focus of the study, 115 female and male undergraduate students were interviewed each year from their sophomore year through two years post-graduation.     Drawing from both the student and departmental perspective, this study highlights four integral promising practices for promoting undergraduate women?s involvement in computing: (1) highly innovative departments intentionally prioritize and implement strategies designed to attract and retain women; (2) these departments devote resources to promoting exemplary teaching, especially for gateway courses; (3) curricular innovations at these sites feature collaborative, hands-on, practical, and interdisciplinary approaches; (4) the departments purposefully cultivate a welcoming community environment and provide specialized courses, programs, and events for women. Key to these promising practices is the fact that the highly innovative institutions in the study have all made intentional efforts to attract, retain, and graduate students from their departments, especially women. When these promising practices were employed, the innovative CSE departments were more successful with attracting, retaining, and graduating female students. Both male and female graduates of these innovative institutions found themselves to be highly prepared for completing projects in their professional positions in top technology companies.  These findings are further strengthened when the practices at highly innovative sites are compared to the counterfactual cases which enrolled far fewer women in their departments and were less likely to retain women in their programs, ultimately providing fewer intentional supports to support both women and men.      In looking at the career trajectories of students, far more students from the highly innovative sites were successfully pursuing careers in top tech companies, start-ups, or technical positions in other companies while students at the counterfactual cases often took longer to find employment in technical positions, which often required lower level computer science skills than their counterparts at the innovative institutions.  These differences were also notable for women&mdash;i.e., women from the innovative sites were often pursuing careers or graduate programs that capitalized on their computer science background whereas women at the lower innovation sites were more likely to pursue non-technical computer science related positions or positions outside of computer science.     Insights gleaned from the study inform practices designed to broaden participation in computing and beyond. A broad range of STEM departments could employ similar strategies to intentionally diversify by attracting more women, thus contributing to the overall technology workforce and increasing the number of females who pursue STEM careers.
