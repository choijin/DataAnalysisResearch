<AbstractNarration>The proposed research will provide an important set of observations on the nature&lt;br/&gt;of the earthquake cycle for a major continental strike-slip fault with direct implications for earthquake&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, estimating earthquake repeat times, crust and upper mantle rheology as a function of the state&lt;br/&gt;of stress, and interaction between earthquake processes and regional tectonics.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Implications: This case study provides information on the mechanics of continental strike-slip&lt;br/&gt;faults in general, including the San Andreas Fault, earthquake and tsunami hazards in the greater&lt;br/&gt;Istanbul area, and opportunities for international scientific collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
