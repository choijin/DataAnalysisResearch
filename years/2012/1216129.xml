<AbstractNarration>This research award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by Professor Shawn Burdette at the University of Connecticut to develop complexes that release zinc upon exposure to light. Current research suggests that labile zinc may function as a neurotransmitter and signaling agent within cells. While zinc can be released from intracellular vesicles by electrical stimulation or applied exogenously, the new caged metal complexes will allow greater control over the amount of zinc introduced into biological specimens with enhanced spatial and temporal resolution. Caged complexes are metal ion chelators that release analytes when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. The structural properties of cages will be varied rationally and systematically to tune the properties of the caged complexes for the desired biological applications. In addition, a summer research program to provide Connecticut high school students to chemistry research (School of Exploratory Chemistry Research Experience and Training, SECRET) will continue to be offered on a yearly basis. Recruiting more students for SECRET from underrepresented groups will be an area of emphasis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disruption of zinc signaling pathways and zinc homeostasis are implicated in numerous human diseases and disorders. Understanding the underlying signaling functions of zinc is important for developing strategies to treat these conditions. Developing caged complexes will provide the chemical tools that are necessary for studying these zinc signaling pathways.</AbstractNarration>
