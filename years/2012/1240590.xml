<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project takes advantage of the latest development in X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) at the Linac Coherent Lisht Source (LCLS) to structurally characterize intact photosynthetic organelles, chlorosomes and carboxysomes. The research undertaking embodies high-risk, high reward research since every experiment undertaken at the LCLS is at the frontier of imaging biology which continues to be under development. Chlorosomes and carboxysomes have not yet been subjected to these methods. Both types of complexes provide unprecedented test cases for XFELs diffraction in that they can both be treated as single particle experiments but with crystalline components. Particles of this size and complexity have not yet been characterized. This is a high risk project in that it is difficult to anticipate the characteristics of the resulting data from these "diffract and destroy" experiments. Methods for processing and analyzing these data will be developed. The results of the project will lay the foundation for visualization of functioning macromolecular organelles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project is associated with the training of young scientists at arguably the most exciting intersection of math, physics and biology in a large (9 groups) international collaboration. The pioneering methods developed will be useful for advancing the community of researchers gaining access to LCLS beam-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Biomolecular Dynamics Structure and Function Cluster and the Networks and Regulation Cluster.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biological assemblies, such as the carboxysome and the chlorosome play important roles in photosynthesis. These organelles are involved in CO2 fixation and light energy capture, respectively is of significant scientific and economic interest.   The specific objective of the current research was to determine the structures of these complexes using a new imaging technology.  The exact manner in which carboxysomes and chlorosomes perform their tasks is not well understood. The use of a powerful X-ray light laser can provide insights in how these organelles perform their tasks.  As part of this research, Free Electron Laser X-ray scattering experiments on carboxysomes and other biological nano-compartments were performed. Given the novelty of these experiments, new theory and algorithms were developed to provide interpret the X-ray scattering data.  X-rays are capable of producing snapshots of objects like carboxysomes and chlorosomes in great detail.  But at present, a clear view of the object structure is marred by strong imaging artifacts.  In order to make progress, it was necessary to develop computer algorithms capable of removing these artifacts automatically, so that the structural features of the object of interest can be clearly identified.  We have developed a computer algorithm capable of performing this task for X-ray snapshots produced by X-ray lasers.  This constitutes an important step in the effort to determine the structure of the carboxysomes and chlorosomes by single-particle X-ray methods.  Computational methods were also developed for the analyses of Fluctuation X-ray Scattering data, a new biophysical technique that contains substantially more information than traditional scattering methods.  The analyses of Fluctuation X-ray Scattering data from biological nano-compartments is current ongoing.            Last Modified: 08/14/2015       Submitted by: Cheryl A Kerfeld]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
