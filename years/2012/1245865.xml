<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Prairie pothole lakes (PPLs also referred to as wetlands) are important hydrologic features in the glacial till of the Upper Midwest. The hydrology and climate of the region coupled with the composition of the till have developed water chemistries unique to PPLs, including extremely high  levels of sulfate. Results of a pilot project funded by NSF showed that sulfate undergoes reduction in the sediments to produce reduced sulfur species in the mM levels. Our data demonstrated that unaltered PPL pore waters sampled from lakes P1 and P8 in the Cottonwood Lakes Area abiotically and rapidly degraded chloroacetanilide and nitroaromatic pesticides (which are heavily used in row crop agriculture in the region). Additionally, we found dissolved organic matter levels in the 100s of mg/L-C in the pore waters, which are among the highest measured for lacustrine systems. This proposal expands upon our previous work to understand the linkages between hydrology, the evolution of the unique biogeochemical composition of PPL pore waters, and its ability to attenuate agricultural pesticides. We hypothesize that changes in the local hydrology in response to drought, evapotranspiration, and precipitation can influence the composition and abundance of chemical species capable of attenuating pesticides. Our specific hypotheses are: 1). During periods of drought, evapotranspiration is an important driver of groundwater flow out of PPLs; 2). Extensive precipitation creates water table mounds that can reverse hydraulic gradients and cause groundwater to flow back into wetlands; 3). The biogeochemical composition of PPLs is influenced by these local and seasonally varying hydrologic processes; 4). Overland flow is capable of transporting both pesticides and other chemical constituents to PPLs; and 5). PPL pore water constituents are capable of attenuating other classes of commonly used pesticides beyond those studied in the pilot project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prairie pothole lakes are a critical hydrological and ecological feature of national and international importance (e.g., groundwater recharge, habitats for waterfowl and other fauna, etc.). Their unique water chemistry makes them an important means for mitigating the effects of pesticides used in this extensively farmed region. Our research could influence how these lakes are managed in the future, especially with respect to the intractable problem of nonpoint source agricultural pollution. The proposed research will support three graduate students who will be responsible for conducting the research and aiding our USGS colleagues. The students will coordinate research and sampling events between the collaborating universities and the USGS laboratories. Research results will be broadly disseminated through conferences, journal publications, and informal town hall meetings with local stakeholders. Outreach to high school students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering will occur through activities oriented non-residential summer camps. Further, we propose to recruit a high school teacher to accompany us on our sampling trips and share these experiences through electronic journals and in his/her classroom. This outreach initiative is based upon the NSF funded ARCUS TREC model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study explored how water and chemicals dissolved in it move to wetlands called "Prairie Pot Holes" located in north central United States and south central Canada. Some of these wetlands naturally  remove toxic pesticides that get into them by chemical processes that involve sulfur. We particularly looked at how the sulfur gets into the wetlands when they have sufficient water to become small ponds.  To do our work; we installed monitoring devices to extract water from the muds under the wetland ponds as well as intact cylinders of the mud itself and also determined the what the mud consisted of (mineral matter and organic matter) using remote sensing technique calle "resistivity". This method involves measuring how resistive the muds under the ponds are to conducting an electrical current.  From out work, we discovered that the sulfur comes from ground water discharging to the ponds during wet times, but when the ponds dry up, the sulfur moves downward through the wetland soils to form buried crusts of the mineral gypsum--the same mineral used in manufacturing sheet rock used to make walls in homes.  This sulfur-bearing mineral then can re-dissolved when the ponds become flooded again to continually provide sulfur to the pond water sufficent to enable bacteria to degrade  pesticides that might get into it where farming occurs within groups of Prairie Pot Hole wetlands.
