<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The Evolutionary Cell Biology Workshop will be held at the Airlie Conference Center in Warrenton, Virginia.  The goal of this multi-investigator project is to organize a Workshop that will bring together  investigators from diverse scientific communities and with diverse perspectives including evolutionary biologists, cell biologists and computational biologists  to define the nascent field of  "evolutionary cell biology"  and to identify the key issues and fundamental principles that are in most urgent need to being addressed in order to foster this exciting and emerging area of research.  With the fact that there are mature fields of molecular evolution, genome evolution and even developmental evolution, there is no recognizable field of evolutionary cell biology.  With that in mind, this is an opportunity for both cell biologists and evolutionary biologists alike.  Therefore, the potential payoff of organizing a meeting that focuses on evolutionary biologists and cell biologists is significant.  The development of a field of evolutionary cell biology should have impacts on disciplines beyond cell and evolutionary biology, e.g., by helping scientists figure out how to rationally alter cell biological features or even to invent new ones, thereby contributing to the emerging fields of synthetic biology and artificial life.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The development of a field of evolutionary cell biology is expected to have major impacts on the disciplines of cell biology and evolutionary biology but it will influence other fields as well.  Establishing an understanding of the principles of evolutionary cell biology should help scientists establish how to rationally alter cell biological features or even to invent new ones, thereby contributing to the emerging fields of synthetic biology and artificial life.  The requested funding will be used to support travel, meals and/or lodging for 35 participants from US and international locations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main purpose of this grant was to support a interdisciplinary workshop on Evolutionary Cell Biology, which was held May 29-31, 2012.      The primary Intellectual Merit of this project was that it encouraged the growth of the field of Evolutionary Cell Biology (ECB) and fostered the growth of the ECB community. A major goal of our efforts in building this community was to encourage cell biologists to consider cell biological problems from the standpoint of evolutionary processes, and to encourage evolutionary biologists to think about evolution from a cellular perspective. This was an important goal because there are major questions in both fields that can best be addressed at the interface between these fields.  We outlined these questions and some specific research goals in our Workshop Report, which can be found at the following link: http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/bio12009/bio12009.pdf.  We also have provided an updated discussion in a recent article in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA (Lynch et al., 2014, 111(48):16990-4).      Participants in the workshop funded by this grant have continued their efforts to build the ECB community, as evidenced by a number of other ECB-related meetings that have been organized by workshop participants.  These include:  &bull;  The recent ECB meeting at Janelia Research Campus held March 15-18 2015 (https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/conferences/evolutionary-cell-biology);  &bull; The upcoming Program in Evolutionary Cell Biology at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, which will occur in the Fall of 2015 (http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/dbdetails?acro=EVOCELL15).       This project had and will continue to have a number of important Broader Impacts.   First, promoting development of ECB should also promote advances in other fields such as synthetic biology and artificial life, since establishing an understanding of the principles of ECB should help scientists predict how to rationally alter cell biological features or even create new ones.  Second, the development of ECB should impact teaching, since typical training of cell biologists presently includes little evolution, and typical training of evolutionary biologists rarely includes much cell biology. Finally, since the exploration of cell biological diversity at the organismal and biochemical level will be an important component of the study of ECB, this growth of this field will deepen and broaden our understanding of biodiversity.  Overall, the growth of the ECB community that was fostered by this project should help to foster scientific discovery in a number of fields and deepen understanding of evolutionary processes in the scientific community and in society at large.
