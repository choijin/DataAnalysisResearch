<AbstractNarration>This project, in collaboration with scientists from Taiwan, will study of the deformation, exhumation, and landscape evolution of the Central Range of Taiwan with focus on recently recognized patches of low relief at high elevations that straddle the crest of the range and stand in stark contrast to the steep and rugged topography predicted for an orogenic system considered to have reached steady-state topography. The research team will test the idea that these areas of low relief are uplifted remnants of a relict landscape that formed prior to a recent transient acceleration in rock uplift rate and that the acceleration in uplift was driven by crustal-scale imbrication as suggested by preliminary interpretations of seismic tomographic analyses. To test these linked hypotheses, the team will carry out three related lines of research: 1) geomorphology and cosmogenic analyses (detailed analysis of the topography; detailed field mapping of fluvial terraces; and determination of erosion rates for the areas of low relief primarily using 10Be); 2) field-based and crustal-scale kinematic analyses (documentation of the spatial distribution, relative age, and orientation of outcrop-scale faults and kinematics; determination of the dominant deformation mechanisms; and inversion of fault earthquake data for the shape and orientation of the strain ellipsoid); 3) thermochronometry studies. The integrated dataset from this study has the potential to transform understanding of the crustal deformation and landscape evolution of one of the type examples of an active, arc-continent collision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taiwan represents one of the most active tectonic environments on Earth. The island marks the collision between the Luzon volcanic arc and the passive margin of Asia and for decades the collision has motivated geodynamic models to explain the evolution of many mountain belts around the world. The paradigm for Taiwan is that the obliquity between the northeast-southwest trending passive margin and the north-south trending volcanic arc has led to steady southward propagation of the mountain belt and a time-for-space equivalence so that cross sections of the belt can be treated as time slices for different stages in a characteristic evolution. Moreover, the relatively constant width of the orogen has led numerous workers to argue for a topographic steady state where the influx of material is balanced by erosion. This project aims to examine the idea that the mountain belt is punctuated by episodic events that perturb the steady state system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Earth Sciences Division Tectonics Program and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Taiwan is approximately the size of New Jersey and Connecticut put together, yet it has mountains almost 13,000&rsquo; above sea level (nearly 60 peaks are &gt;11,000&rsquo; high). Taiwan, in fact, hosts one of the most rapidly uplifting mountain belts on Earth. These mountains result from the tectonic collision of the Luzon volcanic islands with the continental shelf of SE China, and have been described as steady-state, wherein the uplift is exactly balanced by erosion. We set out to understand features of these mountains that are at odds with this characterization, specifically gentle rolling hills and lakes that occupy the crest of the range. We documented recent acceleration in the rock uplift rate that may explain these low-relief topographic oddities. We also showed that earthquakes today are accommodating thinning of Earth&rsquo;s crust in the southern Central Range, and that this thinning may play a role in exhuming rocks that have recrystallized at depth during the tectonic collision. The NE-SW direction of extension that marks the thinning, however, is oblique to the overall trend of the mountain range. This same extension direction is also recorded by relatively recent faults exposed along highways and rivers in the mountains. Essentially all published attempts to reconstruct the uplift history of the southern Central Range have focused on vertical sections constructed perpendicular to the mountain belt. Our results suggest that these rocks record relatively recent to ongoing flow crossing such vertical sections. In order to understand how exhumation of the crystalline rocks here is accommodated it is therefore appropriate to look in NE-SW trending vertical sections. Our work motivated the collection of new samples along NE-SW traverses in hopes of shedding light on the exhumation history of the southern Central Range. We are presently analyzing these samples with help from Dr. Chih-Tung Chen at National Taiwan University in Taipei. He is using a method that employs laser scattering from carbon-rich material to estimate the maximum temperature that the rock has experienced.

This same student co-authored a publication in a peer-reviewed journal with PI Lewis and a colleague in Taiwan (Lewis et al., 2015). The paper has implications for understanding the tectonic collision in eastern Taiwan.
