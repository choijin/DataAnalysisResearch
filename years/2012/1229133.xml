<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Ram Mohan from Illinois Wesleyan University and colleagues Rebecca Roesner and Brian Brennan will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) so-called environmentally friendly organic synthesis using bismuth and iron compounds as catalysts; (b) therapeutics for sickle cell disease; and (c) development of azamacrocyclic receptors for polyoxometalates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at Illinois Wesleyan University and neighboring institutions such as the local community college (Heartland Community College).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purchase of a 400 MHz NM spectrometer has facilitated the research of PI Mohan and Co-PI Brennan and Roesner.  The primary user of this instrument has been Dr. Ram Mohan whose research focuses on the development of environmentally friendly organic synthesis using bismuth, iron and erbium compounds as catalysts.  Research in the Mohan group is inspired by green principles and involves development of synthetic methodology suitable for adaptation by the process divisions of pharmaceutical industry.  Bismuth compounds are remarkably non toxic and hence especially attractive from a green chemistry perspective.  Most bismuth compounds are even less toxic than NaCl!  In addition to their nontoxicity, bismuth salts are relatively inexpensive, reasonably stable in air and tolerant of small amounts of moisture.  It is these properties of bismuth salts that make them attractive from a green chemistry perspective.  The 400 MHz spectrometer was used to characterize intermediates and products obtained during the course of the development of synthetic methodology.  Without a high field instrument it would not have been possible to characterize the products easily.  The NMR spectrometer was used by undergraduate research students to run advanced 2-d NMR experiments.  In addition to help them identify products, learning to run such advanced experiments is also excellent training for graduate school.  Specifically we have successfully demonstrated the use of bismuth bromide for development of multicomponent reactions.  Multicomponent reactions involve the combination of several reagents in one-step, and thus save steps.  In addition they are generally atom economic and generate very little waste.  Bismuth bromide was used to catalyze the multicomponent synthesis of polyhydroquinolines.     PI Mohan is also interested in developing discovery-oriented laboratory experiments for undergraduate organic chemistry labs.  Unlike cookbook labs, which are designed to verify known facts, discovery-oriented labs are open-ended and encourage critical thinking among the students.  PI Mohan has developed the isolation of thymol from carom seeds.  The isolation was possible because of easy access to a high field NMR spectrometer.  This laboratory experiment is now being used in the sophomore organic chemistry sequence at Illinois Wesleyan University.  Student feedback shows that students like the discovery aspect of the experiment that also provides them with extensive training on the hands on use of the NMR spectrometer.  The NMR spectrometer was also used extensively by students in an upper level inorganic synthesis lab at Illinois Wesleyan University.  During the spring of 2015, the Advanced Inorganic Synthesis and Analysis (CHEM 380) students continued to use the JEOL NMR for both routine characterization of organic materials and multinuclear NMR of metal-containing compounds.  Cobalt-59 NMR was used to distinguish between the lamda and delta forms of the tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) ion, which form distinguishable diastereomers with (R,R)-tartrate.  Similarly, proton, carbon-13, and fluorine-19 NMR were used to distinguish between the facial and meridional isomers tris(1,1,1-trifluoro-2,4-pentanedionato)cobalt(III).  Phosphorus-31and vanadium-51 NMR were used to characterize polyoxometalate catalysts, which were subsequently used to oxidize styrene to benzaldehyde. Twelve students, including 8 men and 4 women, participated in these activities.  In addition a local community college (Heartland Community College) students also use the NMR spectrometer to identify unknowns in the sophomore organic chemistry laboratory course.
