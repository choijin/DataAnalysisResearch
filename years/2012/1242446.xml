<AbstractNarration>The proposed innovation will pioneer next-generation haptic devices and interfaces to enrich and enhance remote interactions within applications of gaming, remote communication, military use and assistive aids. Although gaming is targeted initially, a haptic belt immediately generalizes across diverse domains where augmented perception of those around us and objects of interest enhances and quickens awareness of our present situation. Moreover, the availability of a commercial haptic belt will open new vistas for research and development within research areas of human haptic perception, multimodal display design and interaction, human-centered multimedia computing and socio-behavioral computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial availability of the proposed innovation will be a catalyst for the development of assistive technologies that will positively impact the lives of individuals with sensory impairments (visual impairments, vestibular impairments) and perceptual impairments (prosopagnosia)- a market the team plans to eventually transition to after gaming. It will also significantly impact the general population, providing a novel communication channel with many uses from navigation and spatial orientation to augmented/virtual reality, and to the perceptual enhancement of togetherness, important for long distance relationships and families often separated by the travel demands of work. The availability of a haptic belt will also benefit component disciplines including psychophysics and psychology of haptics were access to a functional, scalable and reconfigurable haptic display will attract and motivate researchers exploring the sense of touch as a receptive channel.</AbstractNarration>

Our team included Dr. Troy McDaniel (entrepreneurial lead), Mr. Donald J. Becka (I-Corps mentor) and Dr. Sethuraman Panchanathan (principal investigator). As part of the I-Corps program, we explored different haptic technologies within the application domains of assistive and rehabilitative technologies. Haptic technologies communicate information through the sense of touch, and therefore, enable new ways for technology to present information to the body. Alternative communication channels, such as the sense of touch, are particularly useful when other senses, such as vision or hearing, may not be available. This research is being conducted at the Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing (CUbiC, <a href="http://cubic.asu.edu/">http://cubic.asu.edu/</a>) at Arizona State University.

To reach a big enough market, we began by testing the value of this technology in the multi-billion dollar gaming industry. At our current price point, our customer discovery activities revealed limited interest from gamers, so we pivoted to another haptic technology: low-cost wearable computers for stroke rehabilitation (see figures), which found wide acceptance and enthusiasm among patients and therapists during our customer discovery efforts. We conducted over 80 interviews with physical therapists, occupational therapists, stroke experts and industry professionals to test our business and product hypotheses. Based on our findings, we made a clear &lsquo;go&rsquo; decision to commercialize our stroke rehabilitation technologies. Since moving forward with this decision, we were accepted into the Furnace Technology Transfer Accelerator (AZ Furnace) to accelerate start-up efforts; we founded our business, RehabDev, LLC (<a href="http://www.rehabdev.net/">http://www.rehabdev.net/</a>) in February 2013; we submitted a detailed provisional patent application in March 2013; and we worked with a local neurorehabilitation clinic to conduct a preliminary pilot study, the results of which were published in the proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare 2013.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We believe our technologies will lead to pioneering next generation haptic technologies including wearable vibrotactile displays for use in assistive technologies and rehabilitation solutions.
