<AbstractNarration>This action funds Nancy Kim Pham of Florida Institute of Technology to conduct a research project, entitled "Establishing genetic relationships in the longnose seahorse along South China's coast," during the summer of 2012 at the Chinese Academy of Science in Guangzhou, China. The host scientist is Dr. Qiang Lin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies with an investigation of the population genetic structure of the longnose seahorse, Hippocampus trimaculatus, which gives a first account of the levels of genetic variation and gene flow along the northern South China Sea. The results promise to assist in decisions about longterm resource management and conservation efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
