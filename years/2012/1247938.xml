<AbstractNarration>The biology teaching assistant project (BioTAP) will create a network of academics to inform best practices for biology graduate teaching assistant (GTA) professional development, with an eye toward fostering practices aligned with reformed biology courses.  To improve GTA professional development on a national scale, this RCN-UBE network will first identify the instructional skills needed by GTAs to teach reformed biology courses, and then gather and study professional development models from institutions across the nation to identify those which may serve as standards of best practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: BioTAP will foster national dialogue to improve collegiate biology instruction, and expand and promote the project at network and professional meetings.  The project will enhance the communication among national professional organizations, biology faculty, laboratory coordination staff, teaching and learning centers, and GTAs to reduce duplication, unify resources, and promote the instructional strengths of biology GTAs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: BioTAP aims to be the premier resource guiding biology GTA professional development in the nation.  The findings of the network will be disseminated via articles and conference presentations, and by using the existing networks of other RCN-UBEs and professional organizations.  By the end of the incubator funding, new members of the Steering Committee will broaden the representation of institutions and academic experiences, and a list of potential network participants will be compiled. The findings of the project will be made available to this network through a file sharing site.  BioTAP will inform professional development practices across the nation to better prepare GTAs for their roles as future faculty members and improve their ability to deliver reformed biology courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts towards support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Biology Teaching Assistant Project (BioTAP) brought together individuals at undergraduate academic institutions who train biology graduate students to teach with a goal to improve this professional development (PD) for teaching.  The project ran for two years, and had face-to-face meetings with 17 primary network individuals and input from 123 network members across the US and Canada.  The group identified common contextual factors that impact how different institutions approach PD for biology graduate students, and then created a draft list of instructional skills that all biology graduate students should learn regardless of institutional context. To inform future activities of the network and document the current PD practices in the field, the group conducted a national survey of PD practitioners for biology graduate students.  The survey found that 96% of responding academic institutions provide some form of PD for teaching for their biology graduate students.  The length of this training is short, however, and may not best support the development of excellence in teaching.  Practitioners indicated that they wanted more PD time to present information about appropriate pedagogy and to observe graduate students and provide feedback about their teaching.  Additionally, it was clear that assessment of PD program impacts is limited and not conducted in such a way to allow the comparison of practices across institutions.  The BioTAP network has plans to submit a proposal to continue funding for the group, specifically to provide national workshops to practitioners about how to conduct research on PD programs to identify best practices in biology graduate student PD.  These efforts have the potential to have a huge impact on undergraduate education in the US and Canada.  A recent survey of the network discovered that 44 individuals train 972 biology graduate students per semester, and that those graduate students in turn teach 41,409 undergraduate students in one semester; and this number is only a small sample of the total impact of PD practitioners across the US and Canada.  Thus, improving the way that we prepare graduate students to teach biology courses could have a profound impact on the undergraduate students taking majors and non-majors courses at universities.  These students will go on to become future scientists and citizens voting on important scientific challenges in the future; the quality of instruction that graduate students provide will make a difference to the success of these students.  We believe that the BioTAP network has the potential to play a critical role in improving instruction at institutions in the US and Canada by focusing on a subset of individuals who have traditionally not been part of the national conversation about professional development for teaching.
