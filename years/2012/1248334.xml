<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based acoustic emission (AE) sensors for structural health monitoring. AE is a well-established nondestructive testing technique commonly used to monitor for active fatigue cracks in metals, leaks in pressurized lines and tanks, impact damage, and matrix and fiber damage in composites. The project team will develop novel MEMS AE sensors to be applied generically to concrete, steel, and composite structures and rotating machinery in structural health monitoring  applications.  The primary goal is to design and implement an array of high quality factor MEMS resonant-type capacitive transducers in the frequency range between 100kHz and 1MHz, corresponding to the frequency spectrum of the ultrasonic wave generated when elastic energy is released in a structure during permanent and irreversible crack formation.  Secondly, the sensor packaging issues will be addressed in parallel with the performance to ensure the development of a robust sensor for commercial applications. The proposed research is an innovative and transformative effort with anticipated performance enhancement particularly with regard to both the mechanical resonant characteristics and sensor packaging aspects of the AE sensor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project related to the safe and economical operation of publically and privately held assets (bridges, railroads, pressure vessels, etc.) around the world.   This infrastructure is aging and significant investment must be monitored continuously.  The proposed technology will be low-cost and high volume solution to this massive aging infrastructure issue.   Economically speaking, the objective of the proposed technology is to monitor two orders of magnitude (100X) more structures inspection budget levels.  The technology, therefore, will have a significant impact in bridge, pressure vessel, commercial and military aircraft, vibrating machinery, etc.  Non-proprietary information about the technology shall be disseminated through journal and conference publications.  Since there is a large market for this technology a significant number of technical jobs will be created by the successful development of the technology via engineering student interns, post-docs, and professional engineers.  Successful development of the technology will also create significant amount of field technician employment opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report - Acoustic Emission Technology on a Chip - AECHIP     The objective of the Phase I and Phase IB work for award #1248334, Acoustic Emissions Technology on a Chip - AECHIP, was to develop novel MEMS acoustic emission (AE) sensors that will be applied generically to power plants, concrete, steel, and composite structures and rotating machinery in structural health monitoring (SHM) applications.  Project effort focused on delineating the minimum basic performance specifications of the MEMS AECHIP sensor, designing and building the device and the vacuum setup and testing methodology for the electromechanical and acoustic characterization.  This nondestructive acoustic emission sensor technology will fulfil the urgent need for a low-cost technology that is capable of continuously monitoring and predicting the remaining operation life of structures under harsh environments, which today are being inspected by periodic evaluation of its structural properties during scheduled non-operational periods. However, periodic evaluation is cumbersome and only provides limited knowledge and unanticipated failures can occur between intervals.  Therefore, the benefits of the proposed AE sensor on chip technology include:  - Allows detection of growing cracks at known and unknown locations on structures that are under high temperature.  - Increases the safety of the infrastructure and the efficiency of maintenance management through reliable fatigue crack detection.  - Extends the life of the structure through accurate assessment of condition ratings.  - Identifies the cracks that need immediate attention and repairs that could be deferred and hence, aids to use repair and rehabilitation funds more effectively.  The required AECHIP sensor was designed to achieve the following characteristics:  - The device must have sufficient sensitivity to detect AE events.  - The sensor frequency range span should cover 100 kHz to 1 MHz.  - The sensor requires a sensing mechanism that enables the sensor to work at high temperature (higher than 200 degrees C).  The following important milestones were reached during Phase I:  - Established the AECHIP sensor minimal performance and specifications.  - Designed comb drive and "crab leg" structures.  - Designed a custom vacuum chamber for electrical and acoustic characterization of the AECHIP.  - Designed a readout circuit for the transduced AE signals.  - Established the methodology for performance evaluation of the AECHIP sensor.  The following important milestones were reached during Phase 1B:  - A remaining life model was developed using acoustic emission measured by the AECHIP for high temperature power generation components.  - A high temperature sensor preliminary design using low cost materials for temperature above 650 degrees C was developed.  During Phase I of this project, preliminary work was completed on the development of novel MEMS acoustic emission (AE) sensors that is applied to concrete, steel, and composite structures and rotating machinery in structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. The first approach undertaken for the design and fabrication of an array of capacitively-transduced MEMS AE sensors was using a surface micromachining foundry service. The second approach was developing an "in-house" process. The "in-house" process development and the vacuum chamber design and implementation were completed in order to provide a controlled low-pressure to mitigate potential air damping for low-loss (high-Q) operation. To finalize the proposed phase I tasks, an electro-mechjanical device characterization plan was established and a readout circuit was designed and implemented.  During the period of Phase IB research, we developed the technology required to monitor the performance of biofuel power plant components. To this end, a methodology to correlate acoustic emission to crack growth rates and intensity factors was established.  The experimental validation of this corre...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
