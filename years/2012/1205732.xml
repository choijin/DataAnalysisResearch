<AbstractNarration>This award will support a multifaceted theoretical study of the mergers of various types of compact objects such as neutron stars. Understanding the full sequence of events in these mergers is a great interdisciplinary challenge of high current interest.  The work will model binary formation and gravitational wave-driven inspiral; the hydrodynamics of mergers; the viscous, thermal and nuclear evolution of the post merger remnant; the general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics of the collapse to neutron stars and black holes (with its associated gravitational wave signals); and the nuclear and radiation hydrodynamics of the unbound ejecta that produces observable electromagnetic (light, radio wave, etc.) signals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major motivation is to model both gravity wave and electromagnetic signatures from these mergers. The two types of signatures provide important information about different regions of the sources. Gravitational waves will determine the 'engine' of the sources, their masses, spins, and inclinations. The electromagnetic signals will provide the precise locations, compositions, and their relation to the rest of astrophysics (nucleosynthesis, pulsars, magnetars, transients, Type Ia supernovae, formation rates and progenitors). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the training of graduate students and in regular student exchanges between the participating institutions. Members of the research team will continue their efforts to give non-technical lectures for the public, high schools and undergraduate institutions, and consult on curricula, films, TV and radio. The results of this research, on topics that tend to generate broad interest (stellar collisions, explosions, collapse to black holes, gravitational waves in space-time), will be incorporated into these activities. The team will also make the results from this study widely available to the astrophysics community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This grant supported the Caltech portion of an inter-institutional collaboration between UC Berkeley (PI Quataert, co-PI Kasen), UC Santa Barbara (PI Bildsten), and Caltech (PI Ott, co-PI Phinney). We combined our joint diverse expertise to study both the gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) emission produced by the sources likely to be detected by the newly commissioned Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitatiional Wave Observatory (LIGO) and upcoming astronomical transient surveys.           Our researched focused on three classes of GW/EM sources: neutron star mergers, both of pairs of neutron stars, and of a single neutron star with a black hole, accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of massive white dwarfs, supernovae and their stellar progenitors and neutron star (pulsar) descendents.  Our results have been published in scientific journals.  For neutron star mergers, our main emphasis was on the postmerger dynamics, neutrino emission and nuclear reactions and the resulting observables. We found that the dynamics and isotope synthesis (and hence the electromagnetic signal from radiactive decay) depend sensitively on the neutrino transport, which determines the electron fraction of ejected material. We developed two improved methods for the neutrino transport, and an improved nucleosynthesis code, and have published descriptions and made these open source and publicly available. We also determined the gravitational wave signals from low mass neutron star mergers.  For AIC, our work focused on understanding both the progenitor white dwarfs (pushed over the mass limit by accretion or merger with another white dwarf) and the ultimate GW and EM signature of collapse and explosion. To do this we had to overcome significant challenges in the formulation of  equations of state for nearly-degenerate,  non-nuclear-statistical-equilibrium matter  For supernovae, our work focused on mechanisms of explosion and light curve predictions. We undertook several fully 3-D simulations of the effects of turbulence and the standing accretion-shock instability on supernova explosions, which enabled us to understand the signficiant differences between previous 1-D and 2-D simulations, and the equally significant effects of resolution on 3-D simulations.  We devised an analytic method for estimating and understanding the gravitational wave signatures of core collapse, and compared it to numerical simulations.  One of the codes we developed for simulating supernova light curves of partially stripped stars we have made open source and publicly available.  It takes as input stellar models from the open source MESA code.  For massive stars, our work focused on understanding their rotation, late mass loss, and the effects of companions. We showed that internal gravity waves generated by convection can transport significant amounts of angular momentum, and thus have a major role in determining the rotation rates of the cores of evolved stars.  We also showed for the first time that asteroseismological observations with the Kepler satellite demonstrate the existence of very strong magnetic fields (millions of times stronger than Earth's) in the cores of red giant stars.  For stellar companions in close proximity to pulsars, heated by the relativistic particles  and radiation from the pulsar, we demonstrated that in some cases,  winds on the companion effectively carry heat to the `dark' side, equalizing the temperature, while in other cases heat is not carried to the `dark' side, leading to dramatically different optical signatures.
