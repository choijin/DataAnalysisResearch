<AbstractNarration>The image processing domain is experiencing rapid increases in data size and algorithm complexity. These increases in data size and algorithm complexity demand large amounts of computing and storage power. However, modern computer architectures have evolved to be extraordinarily complex, and frequently become a challenge rather than a help for general researchers and educators who work in image processing technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to fill the gap between complicated modern architectures and complex applications, and to support the research and education of image processing, the PIs are developing an integrated image processing research environment within a computing Cloud infrastructure. This infrastructure includes: 1) an open image processing computing Cloud to support researchers and students to conduct image processing research, share knowledge and research results, and stimulate education materials among three universities: Prairie View A&amp;M University, University of Houston, and University of Delaware; 2) a high-level domain specific language designed to provide an abstract and productive programming model for image processing applications; 3) a general compiler optimization framework with the capability to tune into image processing applications at various levels starting from high-level representations to low level transformations in the Cloud environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project was to build a high-performance and high-productivity image processing research Cloud Computing infrastructure to fill the gap between complicated modern architectures and emerging image processing algorithms, as well as to meet the computation resource demands of image processing researchers. This project established a multi-institutional domain-specific Cloud Computing infrastructure to enable new high-performance image processing research and education opportunities by collaborating across one minority-serving institution and two research institutions.  Using an example image analysis application, we designed and implemented necessary algorithms for detecting cars and identifying available parking spots.  This was undertaken to be able to define a workflow that could be used as a use case for definining a user environment for a cloud infrastructure.  We conducted extensive experiments in designing and implementing efficient Cloud infrastructure to accelerate image analysis applications with specific computing requirements.  For supporting energy efficient storage of images at extreme scale, the team investigated the feasibility of integrating tape libraries with the current Cloud storage framework. The team designed a new hybrid storage infrastructure and middleware services for extreme scale image and video processing with magnetic tapes integrated with disk and Solid State Drive based storage. We also integrated the state-of-the-art Xilinx FPGAs with the image processing cloud infrastructure and ported open source MapReduce support to the FPGAs. The Xilinx FPGA integrates ARM processors with programmable logic arrays.  Using high level synthesis tools, general purpose C programs including image processing kernels written in DSL were compiled and downloaded to the FPGAs. Such CPU and FPGA combined framework is ideally suited for high performance domain specific data processing in the Cloud.  We designed the core components and functionalities of an integrated development and user environment for data processing on the cloud infrastructure. The team evaluated several available software tools for this purpose in identifying the tools needed to implement the environment. We studied Spark resource management and the integration of Ckan with Spark and found it to provide a meaningful solution for the user environment needed to set up and develop image processing applications utilizing cloud infrastructure. Our results show that It significantly improves the usability of cloud computing resources, help users better organize and manage large data sets and execution workflow, thus improving image processing research productivity.  This project led to interdisciplinary research and increased awareness of cloud computing beyong Computer Science researchers.  Several undergraduate and graduate students participated in this effort and gained fundamental knowledge in cloud computing.  Finding of this research have been disseminated through several publications.       Last Modified: 08/05/2016       Submitted by: Shishir Shah]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
