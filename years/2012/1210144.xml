<AbstractNarration>This action funds Ellery Ames of University of Oregon to conduct a research project, entitled "Mathematical methods for understanding gravity near big-bang type events," during the summer of 2012 at University of Otago in Dunedin, NZ.  The host scientist is Florian Beyer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to investigate long-standing questions in gravitational theory regarding the early universe and to develop mathematical techniques to aid in these investigations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
