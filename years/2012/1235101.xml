<AbstractNarration>This project will support the evaluation and development of micro-sequential Lab-On-Valve methodology used for determination of trace elements in seawater, which has potential as a new analytical system to be used in ocean observing systems.  Sequential Injection methodology will be adapted to oceanographic trace element determinations and thus become a significant contributor to a new generation of analytical systems that are needed to utilize the expanding array of platforms dedicated to unattended data gathering. These platforms such as moorings, floats, and gliders, provide an opportunity to extend data gathering beyond the reach of conventional shipboard sampling and hence improve our understanding of long term temporal processes as well as access to areas that are logistically difficult to reach. The ocean sciences community at large will therefore benefit from the development of the new micro-fluidic technologies for trace element analysis. A further benefit will be the training of graduate students that represent the next generation of specialists in the development and application of this novel trace element analytical technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding from this project led to the development of some new methodologies that will find their application in the field of Chemical Oceanography.  In oceanography making analytical measurements on seawater samples allows us to understand the physical, biological and chemical processes that are occurring within the ocean, which is a vital part of understanding how the oceans interact with the Earth systems, most notably including climate.  Of particular interest are the distributions of trace elements that have short lifetimes in the oceans because these species are chemically reactive, occur at very low concentrations and act as tracers for many important physical, chemical and biological processes.  The methodologies that we currently use though are fairly cumbersome and difficult to use at sea and impossible to adapt for remote deployment on moorings or other autonomous platforms that would considerably expand our ability to obtain data in remote and hostile regions.  Our work was aimed at developing new chemical methods that take advantage of a new class of instruments (micro-sequential injection analysis-lab on valve) which have properties more suited to remote deployment.  To this end we developed a new chemical method for determining dissolved zinc (Zn) in seawater that uses only 75 uL of seawater and generates only a small  amount of chemical waste (~150 uL/sample).  In addition to the development of this method we also developed a mechanism that allows us to pre-concentrate the Zn from a larger volume of seawater (4-8 ml) before the determination making the method capable of measuring the very lowest levels of Zn found in open ocean seawater (&lt;0.1nM).  In addition to the Zn method we also adapted an existing analytical method for dissolved iron (Fe) in seawater to work on the same analytical equipment.  This method was then used at sea to identify dissolved Fe that is an important marker of the hydrothermal plumes that are emanating from the summit of Loihi which is a tectonically active seamount off the coast of Hawaii's Big Island.  With the funding from this grant one student completed a PhD and another completed a MS degree.       Last Modified: 09/02/2016       Submitted by: Christopher I Measures]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
