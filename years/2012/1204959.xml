<AbstractNarration>The Game-Framed Mathematics &amp; Science (G-FMS) initiative supports existing digital media curricula at Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos Community College by reimagining how fundamental concepts in mathematics and science can be engaging to digital learners. Current remedial and college level mathematics and science curricula are being redesigned by framing the subjects within game design, providing a foundation for programming-centric courses and providing the skills for students to pursue careers in game design as well as interactive media. A collaborative group of professors from mathematics, physics, the natural sciences, design, and education are part of the team redesigning courses based on this game-framed pedagogy resulting in six new courses in mathematics, biology, environmental science, and physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include an implementation of the G-FMS curricula in a Summer Games Institute for secondary school students and through professional development workshops for college and secondary school educators interested in mirroring this pedagogical approach. Assessment goals are to improve scores on the COMPASS Mathematics placement exam, to increase student engagement in STEM courses, to increase student engagement with programming concepts, to create pathways from high schools to game design and STEM programs, and to provide student game design research opportunities. The evaluation plan utilizes surveys, interviews, and tools for student reflection. Dissemination is accomplished through faculty workshops, a dedicated website, presentations at a variety of game education conferences, and peer-reviewed publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the Summer of 2013 Hostos Professors Catherine Lewis and Rees Shad received funds from the National Science Foundation?s ATE grant to develop play centric curriculum in order to improve student completion of remedial and introductory science courses at Hostos Community College.  In a project that they dubbed Game-Framed Math &amp; Science, the professors assembled a cross disciplinary team of educators to identify targeted areas of student difficulty in remedial and introductory STEM courses in order to achieve greater student engagement.  Though this grant was not awarded for the purpose of designing actual games for educational purposes, the PIs did not find appropriate games on the market that involved these target areas.  To address this need, the PIs assembled a group of Hostos media design students to help them design and produce over fourteen tabletop games that reinforce course materials in these problem areas.  The games were introduced into the revamped curricula along with course work involving students designing their own games as study aides in the Spring of 2014.  The initial results were encouraging, raising retention and thereby completion rates in many of the related courses.  In addition to introducing this approach to Hostos STEM classes, the faculty introduced the new pedagogy to high school students at the nearby Health, Education and Research Occupations (H.E.R.O.) High School where students are involved in an accelerated High School to Associates degree program in nursing and community health.  Many students from the high school attended a NSF/ATE funded Game-Framed summer camp in 2014 as well as 2015.  All materials developed were painstakingly documented and are available for educators at the project?s web site (www.hostosgfms.com).  Downloadable versions of the games and curricula as well as a wide range of accompanying instructional videos make the materials available at no cost to the public.  Members of the public wishing to acquire more professionally produced versions of the game can purchase them on the game production site www.thegamecrafter.com.  The production of these games spurred their designers (now Hostos Alumni)  to incorporate as a educational game company called Colmena Design.  Colmena specializes in systems of play with an educational and socially impactful focus.  The group has designed and begun leading professional development workshops that help educators develop Game-Framed syllabi. The team leads faculty through the process of understanding and incorporating games into their classrooms in the most productive ways possible, and have also been engaged in developing several new games to meet specific educator parameters.  In this way the grant?s mission of propagating the pedagogy has been nicely attained.          Last Modified: 05/11/2017       Submitted by: Rees Shad]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
