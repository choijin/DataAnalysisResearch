<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to elucidate the fundamental processes of the oxygen transport, permeability, and release in porous, metal oxide supported biofunctionalized membranes, as materials for bioelectrodes and biofuel cells.  The research project will study the catalytic, redox, and oxygen storage and release properties of metal doped and mixed metal oxides within a porous tridimensional network that will be used to fabricate "oxygen-rich" surfaces that are able to operate under physiological and ambient temperature conditions.  A suite of spectroscopic, electrochemical, and scanning electrochemical microscopy methods will be used to facilitate understanding of the oxygen transport mechanism at the enzyme/doped metal oxide interface in the porous layer and to establish correlations between composition, morphology, and corresponding bioelectrocatalytic performance.  This research will improve oxygen availability and permeability at surfaces, enhancing the overall performance of bioelectrodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this interdisciplinary collaborative effort will enable development of a new generation of materials and surfaces that can be used in oxygen restrictive conditions.  This research introduces a unique technology in the field of bioelectrochemistry and biofuel cells for facilitating oxygen mobility and providing storage/release capabilities.  This research project will promote innovation and development of critical thinking skills in all aspects of student training to develop a foundation of knowledge that will enable future discoveries.  Graduate and undergraduate students, especially minorities and women, will participate in this research.  K12 students and teachers will be exposed to this research through established mechanisms at the two collaborating institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The co-I of the project titled "Engineering Design of Oxygen Rich Surfaces for Bioelectrodes" has completed research related to the synthesis and characterization of ceria and ceria-doped nanoparticles in terms of their potential applications in the field of biofuel cells. The objective of her work was to create materials that will enhance oxygen availability and mobility when these particles are deposited on electrodes and used in proximity of enzymes that can catalyse a series of reactions in environments where oxygen availability is scarce.  Stanciu and her students at Purdue University investigated the effect of composition on thermal stability and oxygen storage capacity of a series of doped ceria mixed oxides.   The total oxygen storage capacity (total OSC) of  fresh and aged mixed oxides were measured using thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis under alternating reductive and oxidative environments. Ceria doping was found to be effective towards an enhancement of its redox properties. The addition of Zr4+ into the CeO2 lattice was found to have the least effect in enhancing the catalytic properties. In contrast with other studies in literature, increasing  ZrO2 content, led to an increase of the OSC for 75% Zr4+ content. On the other hand, the CeO2-CuO with (1:3) molar ratio showed an almost three times higher oxygen storage capacity value than CeO2-ZrO2 , which is deemed in literature as one of the most promising OSC material. Here, the highest OSC values were obtained for the fresh sample with CeO2-CuO (25:75) composition.
