<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Boise State University that will provide research training for 8 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014- 2016.  This REU program is supported by the NSF's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO REU program).This program engages undergraduates in field and laboratory research with a thematic focus of Raptor Research.  The juxtaposition of Boise State University?s Raptor Research Center (RRC), The Peregrine Fund (TPF), Idaho Bird Observatory (IBO), numerous state and federal natural resource agencies, and the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (NCA) makes Boise, Idaho a hub for exciting and important raptor research.  REU students conduct basic and applied research using raptors as focal organisms and participate in a core program that includes instruction on the biology of diurnal and nocturnal raptors, workshops on endangered species propagation, and development focused on responsible conduct of research, career planning, and scientific communication.  The program culminates with an interdisciplinary student research conference that provides participants the opportunity to communicate their research to a diverse audience of students, faculty, scientists, and lay people.  Weekly seminars and other activities provide for regular student-mentor and student-student interaction, and REU students become part of the Summer Undergraduate Research Community at Boise State University, joining undergraduate research students from numerous STEM disciplines.  Recruitment occurs via digital and print media, and students from groups underrepresented in science and from institutions with limited opportunities for research are targeted during recruiting efforts.  Students are selected for participation based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in raptor biology.  Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the REU experience.  Information about the program is assessed by exit surveys, mentor evaluations, and use of an REU common assessment tool.  More information is available by visiting http://biology.boisestate.edu/reu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Jim Belthoff at 208-426-4033 or jbeltho@boisestate.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>From 2014-2017, the REU-Raptor Research (REU-RR) Site (<a href="https://biology.boisestate.edu/reu/">https://biology.boisestate.edu/reu/</a>) partnered Boise State University&rsquo;s Raptor Research Center, Intermountain Bird Observatory, The Peregrine Fund, Inc., College of Western Idaho (community college), U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, and the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (NCA) to guide undergraduate research of REU-RR participants for 10 weeks each summer. Through a variety of research and professional development programs, REU-RR participants (1) developed self-efficacy as researchers, (2) identified as scientists, and (3) gained understanding of the values and ethics of the scientific community. Birds of prey systems provided the basis for research ranging in scope from physiology and behavior to ecosystem function and landscape ecology. Each REU-RR participant completed a separate research project in the field and/or laboratory under the guidance of university faculty, senior scientists, early career investigators, visiting Fulbright Scholars, community college faculty, and government and NGO biologists. In addition to mentored research, REU-RR participants completed professional development programs that included workshop instruction on the biology of diurnal and nocturnal raptors, endangered species restoration, global raptor information networks, museum collections, tree climbing to access raptor nests, avian marking/handling and blood draw clinics, responsible conduct of research, applying to graduate school, career planning, the publication process, and communication with scientific audiences and the public. REU-RR was integrated into the Summer Research Community at Boise State University, which provided professional development, networking, and social activities, including learning about Shakespeare research and attending a performance at the Shakespeare festival in Boise. REU-RR collaborated with three other REU Sites on the Boise State University campus in the fields of Math, Computer Science, and Materials Science and Engineering through interdisciplinary STEM Forums which provided both formal and informal cross-disciplinary interaction for REU-RR participants and practice in formal communication across science disciplines. Interdisciplinary housing among REU programs fostered even better interaction among participants outside of formal research activities. Each summer, REU-RR culminated with student presentations at the statewide Idaho Conference on Undergraduate Research (<a href="https://academics.boisestate.edu/icur/">https://academics.boisestate.edu/icur/</a>) hosted by Boise State University, which included scientific programs and professional development opportunities for students. REU-RR participants also applied for and received extramural travel scholarships to make conference presentations each fall at the annual meeting of the Raptor Research Foundation (RRF), which was held in Corpus Christi, TX (2014), Sacramento, CA (2015), Cape May, NJ (2016), and Salt Lake City, UT (2017). Each year at the RRF conference, the REU-RR students participated in professional development offered exclusively for early career scientists, including hands-on science workshops and networking opportunities. In 2014, 2015, and 2016, a different REU-RR participant was recognized with the William C. Andersen Memorial Award for Best Student Poster at the Annual Conference for their REU-RR research (<a href="http://www.raptorresearchfoundation.org/grants-and-awards/william-c-andersen-memorial-award">http://www.raptorresearchfoundation.org/grants-and-awards/william-c-andersen-memorial-award</a>).<strong> </strong>Another REU-RR participant received a best student paper award at the National Conference for Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Latinos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS). Journal articles authored by REU-RR participants are published or in progress, and REU-RR results are incorporated into education programs at Boise State University, Idaho Bird Observatory, the Peregrine Fund, and the NCA. All student participants indicated that REU-RR increased confidence in their ability to do research as well as their ability to contribute to science. Compared to intentions before participating in REU-RR, 83% of participants indicated they would be more likely to enroll in a PhD program in a STEM field. Indeed, all REU-RR participants who have graduated are either enrolled in a graduate program or engaged in a STEM position.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2017<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;R&nbsp;Belthoff</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263167/1263167_10237953_1512078440726_D_1406_022_023--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263167/1263167_10237953_1512078440726_D_1406_022_023--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Field Research"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263167/1263167_10237953_1512078440726_D_1406_022_023--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Field Research"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Two REU-Raptor Research students collect data from burrowing owls near Grand View, Idaho.</div> <div class="imageCredit">J.
