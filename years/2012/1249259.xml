<AbstractNarration>Carbon-based nanostructures and films define a new class of engineered materials that display remarkable photonic, electrical, and mechanical properties.  Graphene is a monolayer of sp2-bonded carbon atoms in a two-dimensional (2-D) structure.  This layer of atoms can be wrapped into 0-D fullerenes, rolled into 1-D nanotubes, or stacked as in 3-D graphite.  A novel technique to grow graphene films in open environments on substrates has been developed using multiple inverse-diffusion flames with methane as fuel.  The post-flame hydrocarbon species (rich in CHm and Cn), which serve as reagents for carbon-based growth, are generated in quantities much greater than that achievable in stable, self-sustained premixed flames.  Moreover, the inverse diffusion flame geometry ensures that oxygen is completely consumed at the flame front, permitting the production of high-quality films.  This flame synthesis configuration is potentially transformative and breaks away from the conventional need for confined synthesis (as in standard chambered Chemical Vapor Deposition), and is capable of nanomaterials synthesis in open-atmosphere environments, affording not only scalable large volume production, but also large-area growth over different contoured surfaces (e.g. by rasterizing burner or translating substrate) at high rates. This exploratory program is aimed at increasing fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of graphene growth in flames, and utilization of that understanding to define process conditions that enable high-rate and high-quality synthesis of graphene films.  Specifically, experiments will be conducted to characterize the effects of fuel composition, flame temperature, inert addition, hydrogen addition, oxygen concentration, pressure, substrate material, substrate temperature, burner-substrate distance, and other controllable process parameters on graphene growth and properties.  In-situ laser-based diagnostics, including spontaneous Raman spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, will be used to determine the local growth conditions, such key gas-phase chemical species concentrations and temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isolating monolayer graphene by microcleaving and discovering its amazing properties has generated intense experimental research on its fabrication.  However, widespread use of graphene will require large-scale synthesis methods.  Production methods that currently exist are typically expensive, require long processing times, and are limited to confined synthesis.  The growth of these nanostructures and films over large areas remains especially challenging.  Accordingly, it is evident that there is a strong need for better methods of synthesizing nanostructures, particularly carbon-based nanostructures.  Flame synthesis has demonstrated a history of scalability and offers the potential for high-volume continuous production at reduced costs.  In utilizing combustion, a portion of the hydrocarbon gas provides the elevated temperatures required, with the remaining fuel serving as the hydrocarbon reagent, thereby constituting an efficient source of both energy and hydrocarbon reactant.  These aspects can be especially important as the operating costs for producing advanced materials, especially in the semiconductor industry, far exceed the equipment costs.  In addition, the research affords the possibility of coating large existing structures with graphene in open environments, which is currently not possible.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Carbon-based nanostructures and films define a new class of engineered materials that display remarkable physical, photonic, and electronic properties.  Graphene is a monolayer of sp2-bonded carbon atoms in a two-dimensional (2-D) structure.  Isolating monolayer graphene by microcleaving and discovering its amazing properties has generated intense experimental research on its fabrication.  However, widespread use of graphene will require large-scale synthesis methods.  Production methods that currently exist include ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), annealing of SiC, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  CVD, where hydrocarbon gas is pyrolyzed near the substrate at temperatures around 1000oC, has emerged as the primary method for the production of graphene.  Although these techniques can fabricate graphene, the processes are typically expensive, require long processing times, and are limited to confined synthesis.  Flame synthesis, which readily provides high temperatures and precursor carbon species, serves as a scalable method for the production of 0D and 1D carbon nanostructures.  In this project, the Investigators have grown graphene films in open environments on metal substrates using a novel multiple inverse-diffusion flame (m-IDF) burner with methane as fuel.  The net effect is that post-flame gases are largely comprised of pyrolysis species that have not passed through the oxidation zone.  The post-flame hydrocarbon species (rich in CHn, Cn and CO), which serve as reagents for carbon-based growth, are generated in quantities much greater than that achievable in stable, self-sustained premixed flames.  This flame synthesis configuration is potentially transformative and breaks away from the conventional need for confined synthesis (as in standard chambered CVD), and is capable of nanomaterials synthesis in open-atmosphere environments, affording not only scalable large volume production, but also large-area growth over different contoured surfaces (e.g. by rasterizing burner or translating substrate) at high rates.  The project is aimed at increasing fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of nanomaterials (e.g., graphene) growth in flames, and utilization of that understanding to define process conditions that enable high-rate and high-quality synthesis of nanomaterial films over large areas.  In terms of intellectual merit, the following research outcomes have been achieved in this project:  (a)  Experimental conditions have been found to synthesize mono-layer graphene on substrates using the m-IDF technology.  The growth mechanisms of mono-, bi-, and few-layer graphene and their defect level using unconfined flame synthesis have been investigated, with systematic variation of parameters such as substrate material, temperature, growth time, carbon precursor, and hydrogen flow rate.  (b)  Experimental conditions have been found to purposefully create defects such as nanoscale pores and vacancies in graphene layer(s) using the m-IDF technology.  Such defective graphene is important in its own right (compared to single-crystal graphene), as it has a myriad of applications, such as ultrafiltering membranes, gas sensors, and optoelectronics.  (c)  Utilize in-situ laser-based diagnostics such as spontaneous Raman spectroscopy (SRS) has been employed to observe the evolution of the gas-phase precursor species in the synthesis flow.  The growth of graphene on copper is observed for a wide range of temperatures ranging from 850 ?C to 1000 ?C, with high-quality graphene produced at 1000 ?C.  The parameters have been determined to enable the growth of mono-layer graphene in an open-atmosphere environment for the first time.  (d)  The transition from growing iron oxide nanocrystals to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on stainless-steel substrates with different carbon content has been investigated.  The growth of CNTs and &gamma;-Fe2O3 hybrid materials is achieved by performing a two-step flame synthesis, where the temperature is initially set at 500 ?C and then tuned to 850 ?C.  Such hybrid materials afford applications in many areas, such as batteries and sensors.          Last Modified: 10/11/2017       Submitted by: Stephen D Tse]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
