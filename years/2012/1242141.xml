<AbstractNarration>The goal of this NUE in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Societal, Ethical, Economic and Environmental Issues Relevant to Nanotechnology" (a Nano Bio Ethics course), at the University of Alabama (UA) Tuscaloosa, under the direction of Dr. Leila Ladani, is to develop a new multidisciplinary pipeline development co-created course in the University of Alabama's Colleges of Engineering and Arts and Science on nanoscience and its implications with regard to ethics, society, economic considerations and the environment. The course will consist of seven modules consisting of: (1) Introduction to Nanotechnology and Biotechnology, (2) Emerging Applications of Nanotechnology and Biomedicine (3) Seeing is Believing and Micro/Nanofabrication, (4) Economics of Nanotechnology and Biotechnology, (5) Philosophy, Ethics, Science and Engineering, (6) Nanotechnology, Biotechnology and Society, and (7) Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, and the Environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research address the creation of a pilot pipeline from high schools to major research programs in Alabama.  The pipeline will help prepare secondary, two-year and four-year college students for strategic economic sectors in the state tied to emerging technologies while fostering awareness of their implications to society.  It is anticipated that the pilot will involve 200 students per year with 40% underrepresented group participation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Nanoscience education presents opportunities to further the growth and development of nanotechnology through creating student awareness and stimulating their interest in the subject matter.  In order to increase awareness and interest in nanotechnology and its societal and ethical  implications, especially in minority and underpriviledged students, an introductory course in nano and bio technology was created at the University of Alabama consisting of instructional modules focued on three pillars of sustainability: economical, environmental, and societal impact, with additional focus on nanotechnology itself from a scientific standpoint. Emphasis was placed on authentic learning and quality hands-on, technology based activities conducted in a classroom setting, class discussions, research and development projects with junior high school students, and trips to see first-hand applictions and research techniques related to nanotechnology.  The developed course was offered twice during the spring semesters of 2014 and 2015, first opened to only honors students and then offered to all students without restriction.  To support class lectures, student learning was enhanced through in-class experiments, many of which were modified original modules generated by UA's NSF supported Math Science Partnership for Nano Bio Science.  Learning was also supported through the use of field trips and guest speakers whose work involved nanotechnology.  Skype was frequently used to communicate with remote speakers.  Virtual access was made available for special class sessions to remote participants.  An integrated curriculum with an authentic learning experience was established.  A canned draft version of the course is now available for use and on-going conversations with other institutions such as Alabama A&amp;M University, Drake Technical College, and others are taking place to explore the possibility of online offerings at those institutions.  The developed course represents an integral curriculum in nanoscience which provides students with an authentic learning experience that enables them to develop a well-rounded understanding of the fundamentals of nanotechnology, its relationship with biotechnology, as well all its societal and environmental implications.    The intellectual merit of this efforts involves the novel integration of engineering and philosophy as a means of addressing issues related to the impact of nanotechnology using the three pillars of sustainability for describing 21st Century issues involving society, engineering ethics, economics, and the environment.     The broader impacts of the project involved stimulating the interest of high school and undergraduate students from both two-year and four-year colleges, and from a wide variety of disciplines,  in an emerging technology, as well as fostering awareness of its implications to society.
