<AbstractNarration>To meet America's cybersecurity needs, the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) is developing educated professionals in this interdisciplinary field by offering scholarships for students to study cybersecurity and Information Assurance at UMBC under the CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) Program.  Scholars pursue BA or BS, MS, combined BS/MS, MPS, or PhD degrees through existing programs in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and the Masters in Professional Studies: Cybersecurity in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.  Qualified students from related fields also are welcome, including Electrical Engineering, Information Systems, Mathematics, Physics, Education, and Public Policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students at the UMBC Center for Information Security and Assurance engage in mentored research projects at partner organizations, including Northrop Grumman, JHU Applied Physics Lab, Convergent Technologies, DoD Cyber Crime Institute, Parabal, and the UMBC Office of Information Technology.  Research opportunities exist at many UMBC labs, including at the UMBC Cyber Defense Lab, where current projects include digital cloud forensics, forensics visualization, high-security voting systems, and delay- and disruption-tolerant networks for a solar system Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is increasing the number of qualified professionals in cybersecurity, which strengthens American security and competitiveness. To enhance quality in cybersecurity education, in years 2-4 of the project, UMBC is hosting a one-day regional public workshop focusing on innovations for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate cybersecurity education.  To attract and retain minorities and other underrepresented students, UMBC's SFS effort cooperates closely with UMBC's nationally recognized Meyerhoff Program, Center for Women in Technology, and other university organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The specific aims of the UMBC SFS Scholarship Program are to attract qualified prospective students to UMBC?s undergraduate and graduate programs in cybersecurity, to educate them, and to produce qualified cybersecurity professionals in service to the Nation.  At UMBC, SFS scholars may pursue degrees in any cyber-related field, including CS, CE, EE, IS, and Cyber, at the BS, MS, MPS, or PhD level.  We graduated 30 students.  We hosted the Innovations in Cybersecurity Education Workshop (ICEW) three times.  We offer the INSuRE cybersecurity research course once every two years.  We hold an SFS Research Study once a year during which SFS scholars analyze the security of a targeted portion of the UMBC network.  Throughout the year, SFS scholars at UMBC benefit from a variety of enriching activities, including biweekly meetings of the UMBC Cyber Defense Lab.  We extended SFS scholarships to two nearby community colleges: Montgomery College and Prince George?s Community College.  SFS students from these schools transfer to UMBC to complete their 4-year degrees.  Our students are thriving and engage in interesting summer internships.  Some of our SFS scholars participate in the UMBC CyberDawgs cyberdefense team, which in 2017 won first place at the National Collegiate Cyberdefense Competition.  Our SFS scholars contribute to a variety of cybersecurity research projects at UMBC, including, for example, the Cybersecurity Assessment Tools (CATS) Project, which is developing two concept inventories for cybersecurity to measure the effectiveness of different approaches to cybersecurity education.
