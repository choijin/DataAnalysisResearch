<AbstractNarration>A thriving nuclear physics program for undergraduates at Muhlenberg College has been established. Sourced by activities with the PHENIX Collaboration, students and the primary investigator engage in summer research at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). There, research using the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) proceeds along two lines. The first line of inquiry is the study of nuclear matter at very high temperature and density, such as existed a few millionths of a second after the Big Bang. Under these conditions, a hot brew of quarks and gluons is created. RHIC recreates these conditions via the collision of nuclei at very high energies. The Muhlenberg group will help to characterize some of the properties of the plasma. The other line of inquiry is the quest to understand the source of the proton's intrinsic angular momentum (or spin). As the only stable hadron, the proton is a system of fundamental importance. Protons and neutrons (collectively referred to as nucleons) constitute most of the mass of ordinary matter in the universe. PHENIX has implemented a new hardware upgrade, a Muon Trigger, to probe the contribution of antiquarks to the overall spin of the proton.   The group will carry out performance studies of the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) that are core components of the upgrade. Such studies are crucial to maintain the RPCs in good operating condition and to parameterize time dependencies in the RPC performance as input to the offline analysis. The information gleaned using this upgrade will supply answers to an important piece of the so-called spin puzzle. This collaborative activity at a national laboratory exposes students to research experiences they could not otherwise obtain at a small college. It provides students with new skills and a better understanding of the scientific enterprise, and it can help with informed career choices, whether in physics or in other areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Muhlenberg College, a small, undergraduate only liberal arts college, through this project, has developed a thriving research program that connects the faculty PI and students at the College with research performed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL).  The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is used to recreate conditions like those that existed a few microseconds after the big bang.  As an institutional member of the PHENIX collaboration, a group of scientists and engineers who have designed, built and operated one of the two largest detectors at RHIC, the Muhlenberg group studies some of the global properties of the matter created in RHIC collisions.  This project aims to study a commonly measured property of the matter created at RHIC, transverse energy, in an uncommon way.  That is, transverse energy is usually measured using particles that move perpendicular to the colliding beams, but Muhlenberg is studying the transverse energy for particles that move largely along the direction of the colliding beams.  While this may seem a small difference, it provides information about different parts of the "fireballs" created in these collisions.   Transverse energy can be used to estimate the energy density in these "ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions," to help search for a critical point in the phase diagram of nuclear matter, to discriminate between different models characterizing these collisions, and even to determine the state of the accelerated material just before the collisions.  In order to make these measurements, however, various experimental issues must first be handled.  For example, while some particles are created moving directly toward the detectors used in the analysis, other particles that initially head away from the detector sometimes send their decay products into the detector.  The amount of this "inflow" must be characterized.  Muhlenberg has made significant progress in quantifying this, and several other similar effects.   The College has also made some progress in calibrating the detector used for this analysis, called the PHENIX Muon Piston Calorimeter (MPC) for collisions between gold nuclei.  This detector has been calibrated many times for collisions between protons, and for collisions of deuterons with larger atomic nuclei, but the procedure is complicated by the effects of colliding two large atomic nuclei.  The work on the measurement described above, and in helping with the construction of another detector (called PHENIX resistive plate chambers) designed to investigate the source of the protonÆs spin has led to other opportunities to serve the collaboration.  For example, the PI is on the internal review committee for two papers, and is a member of a paper preparation group that will report transverse energies for particles moving perpendicular to the beam (termed "central rapidity") for a large number of beam collision energies and different colliding systems.  All of the uses of transverse energy described earlier will be informed by these measurements.  Finally, this research program has had a significant impact on the students who have participated in it.  In the summers of 2012, 2013, and 2014, sixteen summer research stipends were awarded, and additional awards were made during the corresponding academic years.  Since the early years of this research program, nearly all the participating students have gone onto careers in science, technology, engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).  The experiences students have had performing this research at Muhlenberg, and often reporting on it at the conference experience for undergraduates sessions of the American Physical Society Division of Nuclear Physics meetings, has inspired them to continue on in STEM careers, and, in some cases, to continue on as experimenters in nuclear physics.  For example, two of the students who worked on the project during the period of this recent award (2012-2014) are currently working on RHIC physics in gradu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
