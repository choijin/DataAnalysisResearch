<AbstractNarration>This award supports the production of a one-hour documentary on the speech of African Americans in the United States and in the African diaspora intended for broadcast on a major TV channel and other venues of public education about language differences. National controversies about the speech of African Americans have been erupting for more than a half-century now, calling attention to the depth of people's beliefs and opinions about language differences and the need for informed knowledge about language variation in public life. The documentary and accompanying instructor's guide promote an understanding of the status and use of African American Language in American society, an appreciation for its historical and current development, and an understanding of its role in education. Footage will be shot in a variety of locations in the US that include large urban areas (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago), rural regions in North Carolina and Texas, and diaspora sites in the Caribbean and in West African (Liberia). A prominent group of researchers who serve as an engaged Board of Advisors will collaborate in designing the themes and format for production, in collecting footage, and in monitoring the editing. This project addresses the language variety of English most strongly affected by dialect prejudice, stereotyping, and linguistic discrimination. In portraying the history, development, and symbolic role of language in the lives of African Americans, this documentary and outreach program hopes to situate African American varieties of English as an integral part of the historical and cultural legacy of African Americans and to help counteract the persistent popular mythologies and misinformation about these language varieties in American society. It further helps to understand the effect of language differences on educational skills and assessment.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project resulted in the production of a one-hour documentary for national television broadcast titled <em>Talking Black in America: The Story of African American Language</em>. The documentary is currently under review for national broadcast at PBS, and will be shown on UNC TV, the State affiliate of PBS. It will also be submitted to a select set of top-tier film festivals (e.g. Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, Tribeca, etc.) The documentary was produced from extensive footage collected during on-site filming at more than 10 different regional locales and more than three dozen venues, with more than 100 hours of collected footage. Filming was conducted in sites throughout the United States and beyond, including Harlem, Charleston (SC), rural Mississippi, Atlanta, Detroit, Chicago, Oakland (CA), the Sea Islands, and the Bahamas. The sites represent diversity in region, status, everyday activities, individual speakers and performative contexts. In addition, more than 40 expert linguists, historians, educators, and performers were interviewed in depth to gain perspective on the themes and issues covered in the documentary. The majority of content is derived from comments of everyday speakers reflecting real world language experiences, curated in alignment with comments by experts to present an entertaining, highly informed portrayal of language issues related to African American heritage, culture, performance, and education.</p> <p>The film is organized into chapters (<em>Talking Black, </em><em>Access, Language Systems, The Imprint of History, Migration, Skills, Transformation, Legacy</em>) typically set in a particular location that highlights a specific aspect or issue related to the speech of African Americans. This firsthand footage, along with complementary archival images and video footage, serve as primary sources for the production of the documentary. Feedback from a number of focus groups (public audiences, high school students, university students, educators, etc.) and an Advisory Board of expert linguists and cultural experts was solicited in the production process.</p> <p>The documentary has premiered at a number of different venues (Raleigh, St. Louis, Philadelphia, etc.) with highly enthusiastic responses and reviews, and thus far more than 20 different institutions will host screenings in the coming year. At the same time, a national television broadcast is expected during the 2017-18 television season. It will also be shown at national conferences (Linguistic Society of America, National Council of Teachers of English, American Educational Research Association, New Ways of Analyzing English, etc.) and featured in a number of film festivals in the coming year.</p> <p>The general educational goals for our language awareness program involve (a) a sociocultural parameter that focuses on understanding the social role of language in community life; (b) a sociohistorical parameter that focuses on understanding the historical roots and orderly development of African American speech; (c) a cognitive parameter that focuses on understanding the systematic language patterning of vernacular African American English, and (d) an affective parameter that focuses on confronting the attitudes and stereotypes of linguistic subordination that often characterize the public perception of African American language.</p> <p>There are two levels of significant results; the short-term distribution and screenings of the documentary and the long-term formal and informal educational effect. While the documentary is still in the incipient stages of distribution, it has generated considerable interest among different audiences and the media. The preliminary indications suggest that the documentary will have a significant impact on students' and the public's understanding of African American speech as the DVD is distributed, as local screenings multiply, as education materials are developed, and as it is viewed on television and through other media. Although it is difficult to predict the long-term effect of the documentary, based on our experience in the production of other language-related documentaries, we anticipate an extended lifespan in informal and formal education. A common response by educators and others in attendance at screenings suggests that the documentary will be useful for educating current and future generations about the history and status of African American speech for at least the next 25 years.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/10/2017<br>      Modified by: Walter&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wolfram</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494362828541_TBA_DVD_report--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494362828541_TBA_DVD_report--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cover of DVD"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494362828541_TBA_DVD_report--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cover of DVD"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">DVD Cover for Talking Black in America</div> <div class="imageCredit">Danica Cullinan</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Walter&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wolfram</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cover of DVD</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494274861483_Wolfram_Lanehart--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494274861483_Wolfram_Lanehart--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Wolfram with Adviser Sonja Lanehart"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494274861483_Wolfram_Lanehart--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Wolfram with Adviser Sonja Lanehart"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Wolfram with Advisory Board Member Sonja Lanehart</div> <div class="imageCredit">Walt Wolfram</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Walter&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wolfram</div> <div class="imageTitle">Wolfram with Adviser Sonja Lanehart</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494338305060_BrewsterProjectsinDetroit--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494338305060_BrewsterProjectsinDetroit--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Filming on location"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494338305060_BrewsterProjectsinDetroit--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Filming on location"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Filming in Detroit at the Brewster Projects</div> <div class="imageCredit">Walt Wolfam</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Walter&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wolfram</div> <div class="imageTitle">Filming on location</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494365576249_panorama--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494365576249_panorama--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Overflow crowd at p;remiere"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494365576249_panorama--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Overflow crowd at p;remiere"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Filled auditorium at Talking Black in America premiere</div> <div class="imageCredit">Roger Winstead</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Walter&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wolfram</div> <div class="imageTitle">Overflow crowd at p;remiere</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494421578776_Screenshot--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494421578776_Screenshot--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Screening of Talking Black in America"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1247567/1247567_10277748_1494421578776_Screenshot--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Screening of Talking Black in America"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Premiere of Talking Black in America</div> <div class="imageCredit">Walt Wolfram</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Walter&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wolfram</div> <div class="imageTitle">Screening of Talking Black in America</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
