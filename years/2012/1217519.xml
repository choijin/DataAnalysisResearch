<AbstractNarration>Microprocessors form the heart of most electronic systems that pervade our daily life and they are responsible for the bulk of the power consumption of those electronics. In this research, the PIs propose a promising method to significantly reduce that power consumption, using an approach called Razor. One of the issues with modern chips manufactured using silicon semi-conductor processes is that the performance of the electronic components (such as transistors, gate, etc) on these chips has become very unpredictable in terms of their computational speed. This means some chips will run fast while others will run slow.  Currently, we address this performance uncertainty by operating all chips at a slow speed that is considered safe for all possible chips. However, this is hugely wasteful for most chips which can operate at a much faster performance. We harness the performance margin of these chips by lowering their operating voltage, such that they still meet the same safe performance constraint, but operate significantly more energy efficiently.  It has been demonstrated that this approach can save as much as 50% of the power consumption of an electronic circuit. The proposal suggests new ways for the chip to automatically determine its lowest possible operating voltage while still meeting the needed performance.  It does so by progressively lowering the supply voltage till the chip start to fail. These failures are then detected and corrected and tell the voltage control that it has reached the limit of voltage reduction. In this proposal, the PIs outline a new method to perform this error detection and correction in a more efficient manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed methods, if successful and transferred to industry, could significantly reduce energy consumption of processors and other electronic circuits. The significantly larger energy efficiency of the proposed techniques could bring about a number societal benefits. These technique will enable more effective usage of energy for electronic circuits. Power consumption of electronic circuits (computers, handhelds, servers farms etc.) is currently the fastest growing component of the nation?s overall energy demand. Hence, reducing power consumption of electronics is a critical concern for energy policy and could reduce our dependence on oil and other non-renewable energy sources. In addition, the proposed method will address a critical need to design circuits that are immune to the increasing uncertainty in chips as we scale the silicon technology further. This could play an important role in extending Moore's law of scaling and have significant benefits for the semiconductor industry and the nation?s economy. As part of this research, the PIs will expand our recent practices of engaging with high school students through lab demonstrations and tours to prepare these students for low power computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on developing lightweight (low overhead) and energy efficient techniques to cope with growing process variation in modern semiconductor processes.  Since circuit performance varies widely across process/voltage/temperature/aging (PVTA), designs must be margined &ndash; this means that they operate sub-optimally to ensure proper functionality across all chips and environmental conditions.  Intelligent design approaches use specialized registers to reduce large timing margins and offer near-optimal energy efficiency on a chip-by-chip basis. These are called error detection and correction (EDAC) approaches.  They have typically incurred significant overheads, in both area and design effort.  This project focuses on techniques to reduce these overheads while achieving excellent energy efficiency in leading edge integrated circuits.              To this end we have proposed iRazor: a new, low-overhead EDAC technique that employs a three-transistor current-sensing circuit to detect data transitions within a detection window. The proposed iRazor registers are integrated into an industrial-class ARM Cortex-R4 processor with an 8-stage pipeline. Using local detection and clock stalling, the pipeline is halted within one cycle of a detected error, allowing the EDAC technique to be integrated into the processor without requiring rollback or architectural changes.

Another approach focuses on static random access memories, or SRAM.  This is a key building block of all modern microprocessors and systems-on-chip (SoCs).  They can be performance, or voltage scaling, limiting though.  This project proposed timing error detection and correction for SRAM arrays to improve performance at low Vdd.  By double sampling during reads and merging wordlines in a dual-port bitcell for writeability gains, energy efficiency at 0.6V is improved by 70%.  These improvements are experimentally demonstrated in 28nm CMOS.  The broader impacts of this work have focused on 1) educating a diverse set of PhD and earlier stage students, including two females (1 being an undergraduate), and 2) offering significant gains in energy efficiency of deeply scaled CMOS ICs, in which technology alone can no longer provide major benefits.
