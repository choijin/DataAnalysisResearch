<AbstractNarration>Located in the heart of the American Southwest, the University of Arizona Insect Collection (UAIC) is the oldest, largest and most geographically diverse arthropod museum in the state of Arizona. For the past century the UAIC has been focused on the Sonoran Desert Region (including the Madrean Sky Islands), one of the most biodiverse regions of North America. It contains many unique records of endemic species, including documentation of changes in species distribution patterns and northward expansion of insect pests into the region. Today the collection contains 2 million research specimens, 83% identified to the species-level. This project will provide funds to install a mobile storage system, with modern steel cabinets, drawers and unit trays. By making the proposed improvements, (1) the future of 2 million high value specimens will be assured, (2) much needed new space for growth and research will be available, (3) collection data and images of all species held in the collection will be searchable online for professionals, agencies and the public, and (4) a very popular outreach program for schoolchildren and the public will be able to thrive. Safeguarding the future of this collection and making associated specimen-level data available online will impact many communities by providing a valuable resource for academic researchers, federal and state agencies in both conservation and agriculture, and the public.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Located in the heart of the American Southwest, the University of Arizona Insect Collection (UAIC) is the oldest, largest and most geographically diverse arthropod museum in the state of Arizona. Our 2 million research specimens, 83% identified to the species-level, are primarily from the Sonoran Desert Region (including the Madrean Sky Islands), one of the most biodiverse regions of North America. Funding through the NSF&rsquo;s Collections in Support of Biological Research allowed us to completely secure our pinned insect collection (2.0 million specimens representing an estimated 35,000 species) in modern standard-sized cabinets, drawers and unit trays. Cabinets were installed on a mobile system, allowing us to compactorize them and make more efficient use of space allotted to the collection. This sizable compactor system has allowed us to incorporate eight previously orphaned collections into the main collection and has left sufficient space for an estimated 15-20 years worth of growth. We also recurated our alcohol collection in new standardized jars with teflon-lined lids. We have established a specimen level database for the collection and it forms part of the Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN). We have databased all of our carabid beetles and ant specimens as well as major other ground dwelling arthropod groups (as part of another NSF-funded project). We also established a Digital Image library of Sonoran Desert insects which we host on our website.</p> <p>The UAIC contains many unique records of endemic species, including those which document changes in species distribution patterns and northward expansion of insect pests into the region. By safeguarding the future of this collection and making specimen data available online, we have impacted many communities by providing a valuable resource for academic researchers, federal and state agencies in both conservation and agriculture, and the public. This project also trained a graduate student and three minority undergraduate students in the importance of collections including curation, databasing for online accessibility, and insect systematics. This project provided hands-on museum experience to students at many levels and fostered scientific interest and expertise in specific groups of insects. Further, all students who worked on this project participated in our established and ongoing outreach activities providing teaching experience and enhancing our resources for hundreds of visiting schoolchildren and the public.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Wendy&nbsp;Moore Brusca</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203398/1203398_10173471_1480357780741_Slide09--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203398/1203398_10173471_1480357780741_Slide09--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project Overview slide"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203398/1203398_10173471_1480357780741_Slide09--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project Overview slide"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Project Overview slide</div> <div class="imageCredit">W.
