<AbstractNarration>Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) technologies have been proposed and researched for 15 years, yet only some relatively experimental systems are in operation today.  This research explores some essential but unexplored techno-economic aspects of DSA that are crucial if these systems are to come to commercial reality.  One major thrust is an exploration of how substitutable different frequency bands that these systems might use are with each other.  Another major thrust is how a firm that might be considering the use of DSA technologies can manage the technical and financial risk inherent in them.  To accomplish this, a fungibility score based on mathematical models and agent-based simulations are developed to evaluate the substitutability among spectrum bands to assist firms as well as policymakers in assessing candidate bands for use in a DSA system.  For risk management, the project employs real options analysis to develop a set of risk measures and mitigation strategies for technical and financial risk to assist secondary users in DSA systems.  This work will help policymakers develop better guidelines for the industry.  It will also help firms seeking to use DSA technologies reason more clearly about which technical and financial choices are best and why, providing guidelines for growth and job creation.  The expected outcomes of this project will include a set of tools that will enable entrants into a secondary spectrum market to make decisions as well as for policy makers to evaluate the factors that may influence their regulatory guidelines in order to promote viable DSA markets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We refined the notion of fungibility metrics by using widely  used one-dimensional propagation models (Hata and COST) and applied them  to the simulated trading markets that we had developed earlier.  The  application of notions of fungibility caused us to refine their  application; in particular, we learned that we were able to reason  differently about notions of spectrum for coverage vs. spectrum for  capacity.  The results showed that when these more realistic spectrum  trading scenarios resulted in secondary markets that were less liquid  than if we did not consider fungibility.  This was not surprising.  What  was surprising was that this effect was less pronounced than we  expected it to be.  We used what we learned to build a simulation using  LTE Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) as a proxy for a tradeable capacity  unit that was (more or less) independent of the frequency band being  used. Secondary markets that used these as the tradeable unit were much  more liquid. The initial decision model that we built required  an enumeration of the choices faced by spectrum entrants (i.e., users  who do not currently have spectrum access but who desire it).  The  choices consist of acquiring a license, using unlicensed spectrum, and  becoming a secondary user of spectrum.  Over the course of this  research, we added LSA/ASA as an intermediate option, as it falls  between licensed and secondary use from the point of view of economic  modelling. We developed this model by first modelling the risks and then  combining them into a decision model.  We used real options as a  technique for spectrum entrants to mitigate the risks that they face.   The specific objectives that we accomplished included:  Building  a series of agent-based simulations in a way that the results were  comparable so that we could estimate the consequences of different types  of tradeable commodities. Developing quantitative models of  different spectrum access technologies so that the risks of spectrum  etnrants can be quantified.  An example of such a model uses embedded  queueing systems calibrated to measured and published wireless system  usage data.  Constructing a real-options framework to show how spectrum entrants could manage/mitigate the risks that they were facing. An analysis of the choices faced by spectrum entrants           Last Modified: 08/28/2018       Submitted by: Martin B Weiss]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
