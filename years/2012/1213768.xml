<AbstractNarration>The proposed work will develop new observations and data from historical ground&lt;br/&gt;rupturing earthquakes to improve understanding of the earthquake rupture process. Prior&lt;br/&gt;observations have worked to define the role of fault geometry in rupture propagation, addressed&lt;br/&gt;and discounted self-similarity in the description of surface rupture slip distributions, shown&lt;br/&gt;clearly that fault rupture is not consistently uni- or bi-lateral, that earthquakes do not consistently&lt;br/&gt;initiate on the section of fault ultimately recording maximum slip, and thatthe relationship&lt;br/&gt;between average coseismic slip and rupture length for large strike-slip earthquakes appears to&lt;br/&gt;require coseismic slip at progressively greater depths below the seismogenic layer as a function&lt;br/&gt;of rupture length. Previous work was been limited by time and funding to a set of about three&lt;br/&gt;dozen large continental earthquakes which shared the characteristics that there existed (1) maps&lt;br/&gt;of the surface rupture trace, (2) maps of the nearby active faults that did not rupture, and (3)&lt;br/&gt;measurements of coseismic offset at many points along the strike of the rupture to define the&lt;br/&gt;surface slip distribution. The resulting compilation has already become a heavily cited and&lt;br/&gt;widely used resource for the larger earthquake physics community. This work will extend&lt;br/&gt;previous analyses to a list of more than twice as many earthquakes that have produced surface&lt;br/&gt;ruptures but for which documentation may not simultaneously satisfy all three criteria. The&lt;br/&gt;premise of this proposal is that many observations and insights are yet to be gained in following&lt;br/&gt;a similar approach and extending the analysis to these additional surface rupturing earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance:&lt;br/&gt;Placing observational bounds on our efforts to understand the physics of the earthquake&lt;br/&gt;process is at the heart of quantifying earthquake hazard imposed by mapped active faults; this is&lt;br/&gt;the broadest and most practical impact of the proposed research. Other researchers have&lt;br/&gt;developed numerical models of earthquake rupture behavior, but knowing how well they predict&lt;br/&gt;real earth behavior depends on observational data from real ground ruptures. Research questions&lt;br/&gt;include how far a rupture can jump from one fault to another, how angle deviations in a fault&lt;br/&gt;trace affect rupture, how deep into the crust rupture extends, and how surface rupture correlates&lt;br/&gt;with expected ground motions. As a practical example, the empirical observations will improve&lt;br/&gt;tools to define the expected endpoints and thus rupture lengths of earthquakes in California.&lt;br/&gt;Funding will also contribute to the training of a graduate-level geoscience student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We studied historical earthquakes that broke the ground surface in order to understand how steps in the surface trace of faults affect rupture propagation.  If steps often stop earthquake ruptures, geologists can use a map of the surface trace of a fault to better estimate likely earthquake sizes and locations.  These estimates in turn help engineers, emergency responders, insurers, and the public make more informed decisions about potential consequences of seismic events.   In detail, we analyzed a set of 76 mapped surface ruptures for relationships between geometrical discontinuities in fault traces and earthquake rupture extent. In all we include 46 strike-slip, 16 normal, and 14 reverse mechanism events.  Our survey shows that ~85% of ruptures have at least one end at a mappable discontinuity, either a fault end or a step of 1 km or greater. Dip-slip ruptures can jump across larger steps than strike-slip earthquakes, with maxima of ~12 vs. ~6 km, respectively.  By far most strike-slip steps are 4 km or smaller. Modeling predicts that steps of 1 km or greater will be effective in stopping rupture about 45% of the time.  This rate is similar between strike-slip and dip-slip subsets. We also compiled sizes of steps successful in terminating rupture. The strike-slip subset was large enough to compare with the set of broken steps inside ruptures.  We compare interior and end steps with the passing ratio, the ratio of the fractions of each set of steps of a given size. In the range from 1-6 km, the passing ratio &asymp; 1.85 &ndash; 0.27*step width, in km.  Steps of ~3 km are equally likely to be broken or to terminate rupture, and ruptures through steps greater than ~7 km are not expected.  The existence of a passing ratio has been anticipated from dynamic models of earthquake ruptures, but this is the first study to be able estimate it directly from field data. We also compiled the incidence of gaps of 1 km and longer in surface ruptures.  Gaps occur in ~43% of ruptures and occur more frequently in dip-slip than strike-slip ruptures.  Gap data will be useful for interpreting remote sensing images of ruptures where site access cannot be arranged.  Broader impacts include scientific and social elements.  Scientifically, results from this study will be used by others to calibrate dynamic models of earthquake rupture, and especially to better understand how faults connect at depth.  This will improve our understanding of fault mechanics, and more broadly, our understanding of how faults work to release tectonic stresses.   Synthesized rupture maps will be a resource for study by others.  Socially, our results will be used to improve estimates of seismic hazard interpreted from fault maps and slip rate.  This project supported the education primarily of one graduate student, and technical presentations at several meetings with international attendance.
