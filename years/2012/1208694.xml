<AbstractNarration>This action funds Shay Mailloux of Clarkson University to conduct a research project, entitled "Self-Assembled Nanowire Arrays for Electrocatalytic and Biocatalytic Applications" during the summer of 2012 at The University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.  The host scientist is Professor Justin Gooding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project involves taking the first step in fundamental studies focusing on understanding how magneto-assisted self-assembling of nano-structured interfaces can be used for tunable interfacial properties.  The proposed research addresses the key issues of novel biocatalytic applications for biosensing and biofuel cells. The experimental design of a general interfacial platform is being advanced for various biocatalytic and bioelectrocatalytic systems. Among the potential uses of the improved systems include new biosensors and biofuel cells, as well as biomedical and environmental applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

Cultural Experience   My cultural experience of Australia and every day life was extremely rewarding and amazing, and I hope to return one day.  I also experience the country on the level of the University and the group I had become a guest in. I really had to adapt my way of thinking and executing things from my home laboratory to my host, as they were quite different. The biggest shock to me was the size of the lab.

I come from a very small town in Northern New York, and when they heard about the opportunity I had been given, the support was overwhelming. Community members, teachers from my high school, and even students wanted to hear about my research and what I would be doing. This award is amazing, for this reason, among others. It opened up a discussion about science in the general public, something that is often times neglected. I had some amazing opportunities to talk about my research and share my passion for what I do in lab every day with the people who watched me grow up into the scientist...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
