<AbstractNarration>Gamma-ray astrophysics is a rapidly evolving field that has experienced a huge development during the last five years with the successes of a new generation of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, such as VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System), located in southern Arizona, and the launch of the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope. Very high energy (VHE, with energies above 100 GeV) gamma-ray observations sample the sky at the highest photon energies, pointing towards the most extreme cosmic accelerators. The mechanisms by which particles are accelerated and produce VHE gamma-rays are of great interest because of the extreme environments where such acceleration takes place: strong radiation fields (pulsars), shock acceleration (SNRs) or accretion powered relativistic jets (blazars).The exponentially increasing numbers of detected sources, together with the improved quality of observations, are dramatically improving our knowledge of the most extreme processes in the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides operational funding for scientists at Barnard College to carry out high energy astrophysics studies with VERITAS, an array of four large imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes that has been fully operational since spring 2007. VERITAS represents a dramatic step forward in the study of extreme astrophysical processes in the universe, and is providing high-quality gamma-ray observations and an increasing number of source detections. The PI will contribute by participating in observing campaigns, carrying out scientific data analysis, and working on code development for improvements to VERITAS analysis techniques. In particular, the PI will focus on the study of extragalactic sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) of the blazar class, as well as Galactic sources, and unidentified GeV-TeV sources, including both archival and new multi-wavelength studies, in order to study the nature of particle acceleration in these objects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The Barnard Group expects to play a strong role in outreach efforts to K-12 students. As a Barnard College faculty member, the PI is able to reach a broad audience of high school girls interested in science by participating in college-sponsored science lectures such as the Saturday Science Seminars. The PI's research at Barnard College, a 4-year liberal arts school for women, has significant impact in influencing women in the physical sciences, and the PI will continue to be a mentor to undergraduate women in astrophysics research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>Very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations probe astrophysical environments with extreme conditions of electromagnetic or gravitational potential and highly efficient particle acceleration. Several classes of astrophysical objects which accelerate particles to tens or hundreds of TeV have been identified so far. What drives these cosmic accelerators is a major question in astrophysics. VHE gamma rays are also indirect probes for studying astrophysical sites where ultra high energy cosmic rays are accelerated. Charged cosmic rays are deflected by interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields and cannot be traced back to their source (except at the very highest energies). Photons point directly back to their production site, providing a powerful way of identifying and characterizing cosmic particle accelerators. When a very-high-energy gamma ray photon reaches the Earth, it interacts with the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere and produces a shower leading to the emission of short pulses of Cherenkov light. VERITAS uses large mirrors, sensitive photodetectors, and fast electronics to image the Cherenkov radiation and infer the energy and direction of the incident gamma-ray.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;The principal objective of this proposal was to carry out studies of VHE emission to understand the physical processes in VHE gamma-ray sources.&nbsp;</p> <p>One significant outcome of this project is the reporting of the discovery of gamma rays from the blazar VER J0512+211. The extragalactic TeV sky is dominated by blazars, a class of active galactic nuclei, powered by supermassive blackholes, with ultra-relativistic jets (outflows of particles) pointed close to our line of sight. Observations of blazars at TeV energies probe the innermost regions of these powerful particle accelerators, where the bulk of their luminosity is emitted, and are sensitive probes of particle acceleration within the jets. The VERITAS observations were motivated by the discovery of a cluster of photons with energies greater than 30 GeV in the ?rst year of <em>Fermi</em>-LAT&nbsp;observations.&nbsp;The measured gamma-ray flux was significantly variable over the three months of observations, with an average of about one tenth the brightness of the Crab Nebula in gamma rays. At an estimated distance of 500 megaparsecs, the jet power of VER&nbsp; J0521+211 is 3 x 10<sup>37</sup> Watts, 100 billion times more powerful than the Sun. This discovery gives us a chance to study in detail how relativistic jets dissipate energy and interact with their environment in one of the most powerful systems known to date. (Reference:&nbsp;&ldquo;Discovery of a new TeV gamma-ray source: VER J0521+211,&rdquo; 2013, DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/776/2/69.)</p> <p>The study of the gamma-ray properties of VHE blazars was another significant outcome of this project. The synergy between the <em>Fermi</em>-LAT and ground-based Cherenkov telescope arrays gives us the opportunity for the first time to characterize the high-energy emission from blazars over five decades in energy, from 100&nbsp;MeV to 10&nbsp;TeV. In this study, we performed a Fermi-LAT spectral analysis for TeV-detected blazars and combined it with archival TeV data. We examined the observational properties in the gamma-ray band of our sample of TeV-detected blazars and compared the results with X-ray and GeV-selected populations. In our study we found that simple parameterizations such as a power-law function do not always reproduce the high-energy SEDs, where spectral features that could indicate intrinsic absorption are observed.&nbsp;In addition to understanding the astrophysics of relativistic jets in AGNs and their role in galaxy evolution, TeV observations of blazars will address other fundamental questions in cosmology such as the density and spectrum of the infrared extragalactic background light and the strength of intergalactic magnetic fields.
