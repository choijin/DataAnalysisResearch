<AbstractNarration>Ethnographic, historical, and psychological evidence suggests that peaceful interactions among individuals of different ethnicities can play an important role in shaping the cultural characteristics of ethnic groups.  However, the general mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood.  Dr. John Bunce, of the University of California, Davis, will conduct a two-year investigation of the effects of inter-ethnic interaction among individuals on cultural norms of behavior in neighboring Mestizo and indigenous Matsigenka communities along the Manu River in Amazonian Peru.  This study will advance our understanding of the processes by which ethnic-typical cultural characteristics are maintained, lost, or transformed as different ethnic groups come into contact and expand interaction.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actual distributions of behavioral norms and markers of ethnicity (e.g., language, dress, etc.), along with personal inter-ethnic interaction experience, will be identified and recorded in Mestizo and Matsigenka focal communities using structured interviews and extensive participant observation.  The isolation of the small communities makes inter-ethnic interaction relatively limited in scope, easy to observe, and easy for people to recall.  Experimental "games" will then be used to investigate individuals' perceptions of norms and markers in their own and the other ethnic group.  Agent-based evolutionary models will be developed to gain further insight into causal mechanisms underlying the observed patterns of interaction experience and norm and marker distributions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this research will contribute to social science theory of culture change that occurs as the result of intergroup contact.  In addition to dissemination in scientfic venues, results also will be discussed in culturally-appropriate contexts with the focal communities and regional indigenous organizations. Understanding mechanisms of cultural change will empower them to, if they wish, design effective strategies to limit the loss of cultural characteristics that they collectively want to preserve while simultaneously engaging with outsiders.  At the communities' request, the investigator teaches weekly reading and math classes while working there.  Additionally, this project will expand dialogue and collaboration with Peruvian researchers through participation in seminars at Peruvian universities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Cultural change is of great concern to many minority ethnic groups around the world who interact with majority groups of a different ethnicity. When two culturally-distinct human groups come into contact and begin interacting with each other at a boundary, one or both of the groups may experience some form of cultural change. Several outcomes are possible, for instance: 1) the cultures of the two groups could mix and become more similar to each other; 2) the cultures of both groups could change to become more different from each other; or 3) the culture of one group could replace the culture of the other group. We currently lack a framework to understand why each of these outcomes occurs in a given population. This study takes two approaches to investigate how cultural norms (beliefs about what constitutes &ldquo;correct&rdquo; behavior in a given context) change when minority and majority ethnic groups engage in overtly peaceful interaction with each other. First, I measured the distributions of cultural norms and inter-ethnic interaction experience in a population of minority indigenous Matsigenka and majority Mestizos living in a remote region of Amazonian Peru. The remoteness of this population and its limited access to mass media allowed me to focus attention on the effect of direct inter-individual interaction on changing norms. Second, using this empirical data as a guide, I designed general mathematical models of cultural change at minority-majority ethnic boundaries. Analysis of these models suggests several mechanisms that may drive the different possible cultural outcomes of inter-ethnic interaction between minority and majority ethnic groups.</p> <p>Ethnographic and quantitative data collected over 19 months of fieldwork in Peru suggests that the distributions of cultural norms in several domains of life (e.g., child rearing, education, healthcare, labor) differ markedly between Matsigenka and Mestizos. Analysis of the quantitative data suggest that inter-ethnic interaction in the domain of boarding school education appears to strongly reduce the likelihood that a Matsigenka individual will retain Matsigenka-typical norms in several domains as an adult. In contrast, inter-ethnic interaction in the domain of wage-labor appears to have much less of an effect on Matsigenka-typical norms. Thus, different types of inter-ethnic interaction between minority and majority groups seem to have different effects on cultural change. The general mathematical model, inspired by the fieldwork and developed at the University of California, Davis, suggests two strategies by which ethnic minority groups may be able to maintain ethnic-typical norms while simultaneously interacting with a majority group: 1) monopolize resources perceived as valuable by the majority; and/or 2) establish a restricted-access minority homeland, from which minority individuals can temporarily leave to interact with majority members, but into which no majority members can enter.
