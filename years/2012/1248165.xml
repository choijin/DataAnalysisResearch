<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at demonstrating the feasibility of a novel multiple access (multi-band) phase shifter (MAPS) concept, capable of effecting the phase shifter function on multiple frequency bands simultaneously. The proposed MAPS concept addresses the need for increasing spectral efficiency and reuse, given the proliferation of wireless systems operating in an increasingly congested spectrum. While the performance of current phase shifters (PSs) is impressive, they lack the ability to simultaneously operate on multiple frequency bands. There is a need, therefore, for PSs that can enable enhanced system capacity, as well as new architectural solutions and concepts to enhance spectrum efficiency and reuse. The proposed research has two primary objectives: 1) to design and fabricate a novel MAPS; and 2) to demonstrate its feasibility via the measurement and characterization of its performance. The research addresses key technical challenges related to MAPS architecture to maximize operating frequency bands, and to its fabrication process. The anticipated results include: 1) Elucidating the design principles for the MAPS; and 2) The experimental realization and testing of the feasibility-determining elements of the MAPS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be large. In the first place, the innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding in the areas of MAPS operation, design and fabrication. In the second place, the innovation will pave the way to enabling new capabilities in both high-end systems, such as aerospace and defense systems, automotive radar and consumer electronics, in particular, the innovation is anticipated to have a potential commercial value in the tens of millions of dollars. And in the third place, the research will enable the further scientific training and mentoring of a post-doctoral researcher. In particular, the post-doctoral researcher will be engaged in activities toward career development, such as, training in the preparation and writing grant proposals, publications and presentations; guidance on ways to improve teaching and mentoring skills; guidance on how to effectively collaborate with researchers from diverse backgrounds and disciplinary areas; training in responsible professional practice; and technology transfer. The project will impact a number of technology areas and market sectors, such as, Phase Shifters, Phased-Array Antennas, Wireless Communications, Satellite Communications, Automotive Radar, and nanomanufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this NSF Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) proposal, entitled "Multiple Access Phase Shifter" (MAPS) are prolific..  In the first place, the project resulted in the demnstration of a fabrication technique thought not possible, which will enable the utilization of novel nanotechnology materials into mainstream integrated circuit manufacturing used in a wide range of applications, including both consumer and defense systems.  In the secondl place, the work undertaken achieved the demonstration, for the first time, of a novel electronic function, thus bringing new degrees of freedom to electronics designers, which may exploit the device to create new, more efficient, systems.  In the third place, the results of the project have paved the way to lower cost, highest performance safety systems for automobiles. In principle, then, the results of the project may well, in the future, impact every automobile endowed with safety features for preventing accidents.  Finally, the project provided a training ground for engineering students from underrepresented groups, who gained invaluable skills and experience to make them more competitive in the market place and enable them to secure high-paying jobs.  Finally, in addition to resulting in the creation of new knowledge, the project elicited the creation of new intellectual property, with the potential to generate economic prosperity for the nation..
