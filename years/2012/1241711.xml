<AbstractNarration>Ensuring the security of the world's and our own nation's computers and networks is a key national challenge.  A significant need exists in Delaware and northern Maryland for trained cybersecurity graduates critical to large regional employers.  This Regional Cybersecurity Education Initiative, formed by the University of Delaware (UD), Delaware Technical and Community College (DTCC),  and Harford Community College (HCC) along with government and industrial partners is establishing ongoing education and research collaborations that is building programmatic capacity and establishing a pipeline of graduates skilled in the theories and practices required to address these challenging Cybersecurity issues.  The project is completing initiatives including:  expanded Cybersecurity courses and Minor at UD producing students able to design state of the art secure software and systems, a 2+2 Program to allow 2nd year DTCC and HCC student to transfer into four year UD CIS and CPEG BS degree programs, and establishing cybersecurity outreach including an internship program, middle and high school student and teacher summer camps and bridge programs to energize and attract the next generation of Cybersecurity professionals.  The program's initiatives are establishing a sustainable comprehensive approach to engaging and educating a continuous pipeline of Cybersecurity professionals.  The intellectual merit of the proposed activities centers on the new discoveries that will be made possible by students, faculty, and professional partners through the unique collaborations and established creative education and outreach programs. The education and outreach activities, and the regional and national capacity needs addressed, directly represent the programmatic broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>
