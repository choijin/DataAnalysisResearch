<AbstractNarration>This project will design and trial a new service called WiMed that provides high-quality, robust data communications between moving ambulances and the destination hospital.   WiMed maps a small number of large flows to multiple wireless networks.   WiMed is application aware and able to cross-layer and cross-application optimization when connectivity characteristics change due to ambulance location.  The communications capability will enable high-quality audio-visual links and real-time patient data transfers between the ambulance and the receiving emergency room enabling an early assessment of a patient condition by a doctor and thereby reducing treatment delay.   It will also enable trialing of feeding real-time traffic video feeds to the ambulance driver in support of navigation guidance for ambulances.    Wireless networks that will be used in the project include the UW-Madison GENI WiMax network, available WiFi networks, and various public 3G/4G networks.  The WiMed system will be trialed on ambulances operated by the West Allis Fire Department, part of the Milwaukee County Emergency Medical Services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will enable medical ambulances to establish high-quality, robust audio-video and data links between the ambulance and emergency room doctors thus leading to faster treatment for patients needing emergency services.    All students involved in the project will acquire significant hand-on implementation, experimentation and deployment experience in wireless systems applied to socially important applications.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The goal of this US-Ignite project has been to design higher bandwidth and robust connectivity solutions for various public safety scenarios. Public safety is a challenging task and often require personnel to respond quickly in safety-critical and life-threatening scenarios. The PI team has worked with two different domains --- medical ambulances and police patrol vehicles. The team has developed a technology that allows personnel and systems in these vehicles to access Internet-based resources in a robust and efficient manner. The key idea of the developed system is to provide wireless connectivity over multiple wireless networks simultaneously. Such a design ensures that no one network can be the performance bottleneck for connectivity and the personnel can enjoy the benefits of the throughput available over multiple networks at the same time. More importantly, given that every wireless network tends to have its own coverage holes and dead-spots, the use of multiple networks ensures far greater connectivity than would be feasible otherwise. The project has solved various technical barriers in designing a practical system based on the above idea and has deployed them in multiple environments. It was first deployed extensively in a scenario involving medical ambulances which was used routinely for responsding to various medical emergencies. Subsequently, it was also deployed in a state patrol vehicle for allowing officers involved to better access information in real-time when responding to incidents. In both environments, the work demonstrated improved connectivity that led to better discharge of their public safety tasks.
