<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PIs will investigate the consequences of recent observations that the dynamics of the cell scaffolding is wavelike in many biological processes - from amoeboid chemotaxis to development. The PI's goal is to elucidate how this wave-like characteristic of the motility machinery affects navigation of cells in complex environments, and collective behavior of cell groups. The PIs will use D. discoideum as a model organism that exhibits both individual and collective cell migration behavior, and that exhibits wave-like protrusive activity even when cells are suspended without any surface contact. The specific goals are: 1. Wave-surface coupling: The PIs will analyze how waves interact with surfaces to generate forces and motion using micro-fabricated local adhesion patches and lines. The aim is to understand how patterns of adhesivity may direct migration and to integrate this insight into stochastic simulations of collective cell migration. 2. Cell-cell coupling: The PIs will measure how waves propagate through groups of cells that are in contact and integrate this finding in simulations. The aim is to elucidate mechanical aspects of cell-cell signaling and group migration. 3. Triggering waves and resonances: the PIs will use the strengths of their team in nonlinear dynamics, microfabrication, and quantitative studies of amoeboid cell migration, to achieve these goals. The PIs will carry out the proposed work through the combination of expertise in controlled 3D microfabrication and surface functionalization of local adhesion patches, systematic shape dynamics quantification, and stochastic modeling of collective dynamics. To make their findings broadly accessible, the PIs will also develop a series of videos for YouTube that will highlight wavelike cell migration and cell-cell communication as a jumping point to introduce different scientific topics at a level that is suitable for the general public. The PI will train women and underrepresented minorities in this research program. All students will receive highly interdisciplinary training involving elements of biophysics and materials science.</AbstractNarration>

Our focus was on cells whose motion and behavior is influenced by other cells or by nearby obstacles.  We concentrated our measurements and analysis on the role of the dynamics inside the cell (such as the growth and shrinking of its internal scaffolding) and on analysis of the collective behavior of groups of touching cells. The dynamics of the inside of a cell and their collective motion is a fundamental physical characteristic that is a key aspect of a broad range of functions of living systems from wound healing to cancer metastasis.     Dictyostelium discoideum, an amoeboid cell, served as a model of migrating white blood cells for our studies. We demonstrated that when fast moving cells are confined between two walls, they maintain their speed and direction of motion for long times.  For our measurements we zoomed in on the scaffolding inside each cell, the growth and shrinkage of which drives cell motion. We determined that cells remain in contact with both sidewalls and alternate protrusions of their leading edge near each wall. The growth of the cell scaffolding occurs most strongly in localized regions at the side walls that persist about 20 seconds, as well as along the leading edge. We developed an excitable-network model that accounts for this persistent motion, which can be technically described as a "confinement-induced symmetry breaking".  Underlying this ability of cells to follow confinement guidance cues is the dynamics of the scaffolding inside a cell.  This scaffolding constantly grows and shrinks, with very reproducible dynamical properties.  We showed that the loss of cell-surface contact does not significantly alter the dynamic pattern of protrusions and retractions generated by the scaffolding.  However, when the attachment between cells and surface is lost, their ability to adhere to other cells is also greatly diminished.
