<AbstractNarration>***Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the low temperature thermodynamic properties of graphene from 10mK to 10K.  The focus is on measurements of the relevant thermal conductance channels, electron diffusion, phonon emission, and photon emission; this research will produce sensitive measurements of the electronic heat capacity. The work will be accomplished through the development of wide-bandwidth noise thermometry utilizing very sensitive, nearly quantum-limited microwave detection systems allowing to explore the difference between graphene on various substrates (SiO2, BN, etc.) and suspended flakes. Another important goal is the potential use of graphene as an ultra-sensitive bolometer and calorimeter.  The initial estimates suggest that this material and measurement system will be capable of detecting single microwave photons and the photon shot noise; these capabilities would produce many opportunities in the fields of quantum measurement and quantum information.  This project will be essential to the training of one junior scientist (Phd student or postdoc) and will involve summer undergraduate students.  The PI will also reach out to the Navajo Nation to seek the involvement of an undergraduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Graphene is a single atomic layer of crystalline carbon, i.e. one layer of graphite from your pencil.  Since 2004 when it was discovered how to easily isolate this material, there has been an intense effort to probe the remarkable electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties.  In this work, measurements are made to find how heat is transported in the material and to determine the heat capacity of a tiny flake.  It also explores the use of a tiny micron-sized flake of graphene as a very sensitive bolometer.  A bolometer is a sensor which converts energy in the form of light or microwaves, into heat, and then this heating is detected.  Bolometers have been used to provide very sensitive probes of the radiation from the big bang and future astronomy missions will require even more sensitive bolometers.  From estimates, it appears that graphene can be used to create this next generation bolometer, and this study will determine if this is indeed true.  These experiments will be lead by a junior scientist (Phd  student of postdoc) and will also involve summer undergraduate students.  The group will reach out to the Navajo Nation to seek the involvement of an undergraduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported work in two directions.  We investigated the thermal transport of the electron gas in two dimensional graphene flakes over the temperature range from 300mK to 300K. We firt performed a theoretical study to understand the expected sensitivity of a micron sized flake to microwave heating, thermal time constants, and heat capacity.  We then built a ultra-low noise microwave detection system to measure the temperatuer of an electron gas with mK sensitivity and GHz of bandwidth.  We fabricated graphene sample with both normal gold leads, and sampes with superconducting leads.  We measured the thermal transport and showed that the electron-phonon coupling was significantly different than expected for clean (low disorder) samples of graphene.  We worked closely with a theory group who computed the expected electron phonon coupling for disordered electron gas.  Our experimental results where in close agreement with this theory.  We measured the thermal conductance over a very wide temperature range, the thermal time constant, and achieved a world record for smallest heat capacity ever measured.  In addition to the work on graphene, resources from this grant were use to explore the quantum nature of mechanical motion.  We achieve a number of notable results in this field.  We were able to sense the force noise from the quantum fluctuations of an electromagnetic mode with a mechanical element.  We were able to avoid this force noise and side step the quantum backaction from measurement by sensing a single mechanical quadrature.  We were able to cool a mechanical mode to an occupation factor of 0.3 and then squeeze the motion such that the fluctuations in one quadrature of motion were below the zeropoint level.  We went on to demostrate quantum squeezing of 5db, exceeding the 3db limit from parametric effects.  These results were reported in two article in Science       Last Modified: 11/02/2015       Submitted by: Keith Schwab]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
