<AbstractNarration>A central theme in geometric group theory is to classify finitely presented groups up to quasi-isomtery.  This gives rise to the study of properties of groups which are invariant up to quasi-isometry.  The primary focus of this project is to study various quasi-isometry invariants which come from ``fillings'' in geometric spaces modeling the group.  These include Dehn functions, which capture the difficulty  of filling loops with disks or other surfaces, and divergence functions, which measure the rate at which geodesics emerging from a point move away from each other.  One aspect of the project is to study these invariants and their higher dimensional analogs in a variety of classes of groups, such as non-positively curved groups, Coxeter groups and mapping class groups.  Another is to understand the relationships between different filling functions in a given group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are fundamental objects of study in mathematics.  A good example of a group is the collection of symmetries of an object.  The result of composing symmetries (i.e. performing them one after another) is again a symmetry.  Many groups can be specified by giving a finite presentation: a finite list of generators, and relations which indicate when two orders of composing elements give the same answer.  Naturally, it is important to understand when two presentations define the same, or similar groups, but this is not always evident by examining the presentations.  One of the themes in geometric group theory is to use geometric tools to address the question of determining whether the groups given by two presentations have the same large-scale features.  The goal of this project is to conduct a detailed study of a class of such tools called filling functions.  These investigations give us better insight into the structure of finitely presented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal goal of this project was to conduct research in geometric group theory.  This is a vibrant field in mathematics that combines tools from topology and geometry to answer questions about groups.  Groups are mathematical entities that arise naturally, for instance as collections of symmetries of objects.    As in many fields, a central question in in mathematics is to classify the objects of study.  In geometric group theory, one seeks to classify groups in terms of their "large-scale geometry", that is, one seeks to understand exactly when two groups are "quasi-isometric" or "commensurable" to each other.    This project revolves around studying certain quasi-isometry invariants called filling invariants, and addressing the classification question for a class of groups called right-angled Coxeter groups.  The PI, together with coauthors Thomas and Stark have made considerable progress towards understaning this classification.  The results of the project have been written up as three papers:    1. P. Dani and A. Thomas, Divergence in right-angled Coxeter groups, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 367 (2015), no. 5.  2. P. Dani and A. Thomas, Bowditch's JSJ tree and the quasi-isometry classification of certain Coxeter groups, submitted.    3. P. Dani, E. Stark, and A. Thomas, Commensurability for certain right-angled Coxeter groups and geometric amalgams of free groups, submitted.   These have also beed posted on the preprint server Arxiv, and the latter two have been submitted to high quality journals.  Further work has been conducted on certain filling invariants called Dehn functions by the PI's graduate student, which will be published as a dissertation in the future.  The research in this project has inspired further research by other mathematicians.            Last Modified: 03/22/2017       Submitted by: Pallavi Dani]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
