<AbstractNarration>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is a one cubic kilometer neutrino telescope at the South Pole with unique capabilities to observe high-energy phenomena in the Universe. Its primary goal is to discover cosmic neutrinos from Active Galactic Nuclei, Gamma Ray Bursts, or other astrophysical sources. The IceCube design makes it possible to discover extra-terrestrial point sources of muon-neutrino flux as well as a diffuse flux of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos that may originate from multiple sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide support for this group to analyze data obtained with the recently completed ICNO. They plan to measure the spectrum of yet unobserved high energy (~ TeV neutrino energies) atmospheric neutrino-induced cascades and to make sensitive searches for the diffuse flux of neutrino-induced muons. The combination of these search channels is anticipated to enhance the discovery potential of all-flavor diffuse neutrino flux searches. Once a signal is observed, the information about the neutrino flavor composition at Earth can be used to study the initial flavor composition of these fluxes at their source. The group will also study directional cascade reconstruction to search for up- and down-going neutrino-induced high energy cascades. This serves both astrophysical purposes and also the PI's longer-term interest to gain sensitivity to the high-energy neutrino-nucleon scattering cross section. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this award involve Stony Brook University's educational and outreach programs. The PI will take part in the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program, which is designed to increase the number of women in science, math, and engineering. This will consist of a WISE introductory research course unit on cosmic ray research and detection, and in facilitating related research opportunities for undergraduate WISE students. The group will also participate in outreach activities for local high school teachers and students through K-12 and Summer programs organized by the Center for Science and Mathematics Education (CESAME) and in activities aimed at the general public, such as the Stony Brook Astronomy Open Nights.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The nature, acceleration mechanisms, and even the location of the sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays present a long-standing mystery and challenge to fundamental science.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neutrinos are unique probes in the quest to solve this mystery.&nbsp; Because of their weak interaction with matter, neutrinos propagate almost freely through the Universe.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The nature, acceleration mechanisms, and even the location of the sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays present a long-standing mystery and challenge to fundamental science.   Neutrinos are unique probes in the quest to solve this mystery.  Because of their weak interaction with matter, neutrinos propagate almost freely through the Universe. This makes them ideal messengers and, at the same time, challenging to observe. Experimental development over many years has culminated in IceCube, the largest underground neutrino observatory to date. The IceCube detector is sited at the South Pole and has an instrumented volume of 1km3. In 2012 IceCube  has discovered a flux of extraterrestrial neutrinos, which has spiked interest in neutrino astrophysics. Follow-up searches for transient and for time-independent individual point sources of astrophysical neutrinos have so far yielded null-results.  Substantial knowledge about the possible acceleration and neutrino production mechanisms is being gained by measuring and characterizing the aggregate flux of astrophysical neutrinos and by studying the flavor-composition (neutrinos exist in three flavors).  Hadronic production mechanisms of these neutrinos (from so called "pp" sources, for example in AGN cores) and photoproduction mechanisms (so called "p&gamma;" sources, in GRB?s or AGN jets) are predicted to induce observable differences in the astrophysical neutrino energy spectrum.   The research supported by this award focused on the reconstruction methods and analysis of so-called cascade-signatures of high-energy neutrinos in IceCube.  It resulted in a new flux measurement of astrophysical neutrinos, based on 2 years of IceCube data.  The results are uniquely sensitive to the electron and tau neutrino flavors in the 1012 &ndash; 1015 eV (electron-volt) energy range.  This work has yielded the largest sample of well-reconstructed cascades to date, 172 events with energies above 10 TeV, of which more than 60% have not been previously reported by any other IceCube analyses.  Example event displays from this analysis  are shown in Fig.1.   Figures 2, 3 and 4 show the results from this analysis: the visible energy and zenith-angle distributions of fully contained cascades  as well as  the unfolded astrophysical (electron and tau) neutrino flux, respectively.
