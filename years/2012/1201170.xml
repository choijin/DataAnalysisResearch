<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the development of a computational approach for checking the compliance of textual construction plans (such as storm-water pollution prevention plans) with environmental regulations and contractual requirements. This is intended to automatically detect non-compliance instances and provide a relatively rich analysis of the non-compliance such as which regulation was violated, the reason for the violation, the possible consequences of the violation, etc. To achieve such deep levels of text processing and automated reasoning, three algorithms will be developed and combined into one computational platform: 1) a machine learning-based algorithm for classifying text, 2) a hybrid syntactic-semantic (that utilizes grammatical and meaning-descriptive features of the text) algorithm for information extraction, and 3) a logic-based algorithm for compliance reasoning. The automated analysis will be facilitated by a knowledge model of normative reasoning (deontic model) in the construction domain. The algorithms will be implemented in a proof of concept prototype software. Real life-based test case scenarios will be formulated - in collaboration with construction contractors - and used to test and validate the algorithms developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the area of automated regulatory and contractual compliance checking in construction. The long-term goal of this research is to provide construction industry professionals and regulators with an approach that can help reduce compliance assessment errors, as well as reduce the cost and time associated with compliance checking. The proposed work will also contribute to the computational tools and methodologies available for both deep natural language understanding/processing and semantic reasoning. This project will also involve educational and outreach activities to promote teaching and learning, engage undergraduate and graduate students, and reach out to female high-school students. This includes the development of a project website, course modules, and hands-on outreach material about environmentally-conscious construction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes and its Intellectual Merit  Compliance checking is a bottleneck in the project delivery process. Automating this task could save significant time and cost. For example, violators spend an estimated total of $12 billion per year to achieve environmental compliance.

In addition, the team developed a new information representation and reasoning schema to facilitate complete automation in ACC reasoning.  The following is a brief description of the main outcomes of the project, along with a summary of their intellectual merit:  1) An information model for supporting automated compliance checking in the construction domain: The model establishes the foundation for an intelligent automated compliance checking (ACC) system that can allow the computer to process the text based on content and domain-specific meaning.  2) Machine-learning-based text classification methods and algorithms for classifying construction regulatory documents: These algorithms address challenging text classification problems. For example, a developed hierarchical text classification algorithm allows for a more granular classification of text according to detailed subtopics. The proposed algorithms can support document analytics in the construction domain.  3) Novel information extraction methods and algorithms for extracting information from construction regulatory documents: The proposed novel methods and algorithms are the first to enable deep (i.e., full sentence processing and capturing of the entire meaning of a sentence) and accurate information extraction from unstructured text in the construction domain.  4) Novel methods and algorithms for fully automated compliance checking and their implementation in a proof-of-concept prototype software system: The new methods go beyond the state of the art by allowing fully automated ACC, including automated extraction of requirements from codes and formalization of the extracted requirements in the form of rules. We have shown the feasibility of the proposed approach in supporting fully automated ACC. The impact of this research, beyond ACC, can be far reaching. The developed methods can be extended to support automated information extraction and analytics for many other applications, such as analysis of accident reports to identify safety risks.  Broader Impacts of the Project  So far, the project outcomes had three main types of broader impacts:    1) Promoting teaching, training, and learning: Graduate and undergraduate students were provided with state-of-the-art research training opportunities, including participation in the research activities, advancing their professional skills, presenting at conferences, etc. In addition, a proof-of-concept prototype software for compliance checking in the construction domain was developed. Undergraduate and graduate students would be able use the prototype on actual and hypothetical cases.  2) Broadening the participation of underrepresented groups: The project provided an opportunity to improve the performance and skills of members of underrepresented groups with an aim at improving their access to research. For example, a woman of color was given the opportunity to actively participate in the research activities of this project.  3) Disseminating the research results: Ten peer-reviewed journal papers and twelve peer-reviewed conference papers were published as a result of this project. In addition, a number of posters were presented to disseminate the research results at events that target broader communities.   In addition, the results from this project are likely to make a future impact on society in two main ways:  1) Promoting compliance with environmental regulations in construction, thereby protecting human health and the environment: Checking the compliance of designs with applicable laws and regulations has been error-prone. Automated compliance checking is expected to reduce the probability of making compliance assessment errors, thereby improving compliance with codes and regulations. Environmental compliance protects human health and the environment by enhancing environmental practices.  2) Reducing the cost and time of compliance checking in construction and speeding up the regulatory process: Checking the compliance of designs with applicable laws and regulations has been costly and time-consuming to, both, the regulators and the regulated. Automated compliance checking is expected to enhance the efficiency of the process, and consequently reduce the associated cost and time, and speed up the regulatory process.
