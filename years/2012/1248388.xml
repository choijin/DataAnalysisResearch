<AbstractNarration>1248388&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the availability of the genome-scale metabolic network models, computational procedures that identify mutant strains for over production of biofuels and other valuable chemicals are widely in use. However, there is a significant gap between the complicated results generated from large-scale computational models and biologically meaningful knowledge that can be easily appreciated and directly utilized by biologists. Such a gap limits the potential impact of genome-scale models on metabolic engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project will advance the state-of-the-art in systems metabolic engineering through the development of a new systems identification based metabolic flux analysis tool. Such a tool will not only enable us to bridge the aforementioned gap, but also help infer cellular regulatory mechanisms. It is worth noting that although system identification is a well-established field and has been widely used in many areas, its proposed application to metabolic engineering is the first due to the lack of quality data required by the system identification tools. By combining the specially designed in silico perturbation experiments with system identification tools, biologically meaningful information contained in the complex network structure will be extracted and presented in the form that is easily interpretable by biologists. The proposed approach will be validated using E. coli and S. cerevisiae as the model systems with the focus on the production of advanced biofuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project will be the first to extend the system identification techniques to study genome-scale metabolic networks.  The  extracted  biological  information  will  not  only  provide  insights  on  cellular  regulatory mechanism, but also enable the validation of metabolic network models using existing biological knowledge that are often qualitative in nature.  By validating the proposed approach with E. coli and S.  cerevisiae on  advanced  biofuels production, valuable knowledge on how mutant strains regulate their cellular metabolism will be obtained and will serve as part of the foundation for a future regular proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach can be applied to study cellular metabolism of various microorganisms as well as other living cells, such as cancer cells, as long as their metabolic network models are available. The discovered knowledge on cellular regulation mechanisms will have significant impact on metabolic engineering, advanced biofuels, applied microbiology, drug discovery and other areas.  In addition, the basic idea of the proposed approach can be extended to study other cellular networks, such as gene regulatory networks and signal transduction networks, to extract valuable information from massive amount of data generated through in silico experiments.</AbstractNarration>

However, there is a wide gap between the complicated results generated from computational models and the biologically meaningful knowledge that is straightforward to understand, such as those obtained through reductionist approaches. In our opinion, this gap has limited the potential applications and impact of the genome-scale models to the metabolic engineering field.  In this project, we have developed a system identification based framework to extract the comprehensive knowledge embedded in genome-scale metabolic network models, which is then visualized and used for model validation and refinement. In the framework, designed in silico experiments are carried out to probe the genome-scale models, then multivariate statistical analysis approaches are applied to analyze the results, and to extract and visualize the knowledge embedded in the generated data. The effectiveness of the developed framework has been demonstrated in comparison and evaluation of two genome-scale models of Scheffersomyces stipitis, as well as the development of an improved model for S. stipitis.  In addition, we have extended the system identification based framework to phenotype phase plane analysis, which not only allow us to easily characterize different phenotypes predicted by a genome-scale model, but also allow us to identify the "hidden" phenotypes that have the same shadow price but show different metabolic characteristics. The effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated in analyzing an E. coli core model.  In summary, the developed framework can significantly speed up the validation and refinement of genome-scale models, which is one of the most challenging tasks in systems biology.  Also, it should be noted that the application of the developed system identification framework is not limited to microorganism modeling; instead it can be used to analyze other metabolism such as cancer metabolism as well.
