<AbstractNarration>Hall/1246170&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to reconstruct past ice-surface elevations from detailed glacial mapping and dating of moraines (using 14C dates of algae from former ice-marginal ponds and 10Be surface exposure ages) in the region of the Darwin-Hatherton Glaciers in Antarctica in order to try and resolve very different interpretations that currently exist about the glacial history in the region. The results will be integrated with existing climate and geophysical data into a flow-line model to gain insight into glacier response to climate and ice-dynamics perturbations during the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM) in Antarctica. The work will contribute to a better understanding of both LGM ice thickness and whether or not there is any evidence that Antarctica contributed to Meltwater Pulse (MWP)-1A a very controversial topic in Antarctic glacial geology.  The intellectual merit of the work relates to the fact that reconstructing past fluctuations of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is critical for understanding the sensitivity of ice volume to sea-level and climatic change. Constraints on past behavior help put ongoing changes into context and provide a basis for predicting future sea-level rise. Broader impacts include the support of two graduate and two undergraduate students, as well as a female early-career investigator. Graduate students will be involved in all stages of the project from planning and field mapping to geochronological analyses, interpretation, synthesis and reporting. Two undergraduates will work on lab-based research from the project. The project also will include visits to K-12 classrooms to talk about glaciers and climate change, correspondence with teachers and students from the field, and web-based outreach.  This award has field work in Antarctica.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Understanding the history of the Antarctic Ice Sheet is important for constraining its behavior under a variety of environmental conditions. Such information will allow better predictions of its likely behavior in the future and of its potential to contribute in a significant way to global sea-level rise. In this project, we examined the behavior of Hatherton Glacier, an outlet that flows through the Transantarctic Mountains from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet to the Ross Sea. Our work included 1) geomorphological mapping of deposits laid down by a formerly larger glacier that existed during the last global glaciation; dating of these deposits by association with freeze-dried ancient algae from former ice-dammed ponds; and, in collaboration with co-workers at the University of Washington, dating deposits using beryllium surface exposure ages. We carried out two field seasons to accomplish our work. Based on our research, we found that Hatherton Glacier did expand during the last glaciation in the Ross Sea region, in contrast to some prior suggestions. Maximum ice elevations along Hatherton Glacier, however, were not attained until about 10,000 years ago and were maintained for only a few hundred years before the onset of deglaciation. This timing for maximum ice extent lags the global glacial maximum by nearly 10,000 years, but is in keeping with other records from the Transantarctic Mountains in similar geographic position. Once begun, deglaciation proceeded smoothly without any obvious periods of rapid ice decay, reaching modern ice level at about 2000 years ago in the upper reaches of the glacier and a few thousand years earlier near the glacier mouth. Overall, our work is consistent with the hypothesis that the timing of both the local ice maximum and deglaciation is driven by an interaction between ice retreat in marine-influenced areas and ice expansion due to increased accumulation over the past 18,000 years. This work highlights the important role accumulation has in maintaining high ice levels during times of warming climate. In addition to the intellectual results cited above, our work also had important broader impacts and included the support for and mentoring of a female Ph.D. student and the incorporation of results into lectures given both at the University of Maine and at the K-12 level. This work also was featured in articles written by students in the Medill School of Journalism science and environmental reporting program.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/06/2017<br>      Modified by: Brenda&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hall</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246170/1246170_10247953_1507293763569_PC220761--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246170/1246170_10247953_1507293763569_PC220761--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The edge of Hatherton Glacier during the last glaciation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246170/1246170_10247953_1507293763569_PC220761--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The edge of Hatherton Glacier during the last glaciation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The line between light-colored white sandstone rocks (right) and more yellow sandstone rocks (left) marks the former limit of Hatherton Glacier roughly 10,000 years ago.
