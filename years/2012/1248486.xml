<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of real-time data analytics over deep web repositories. A major part of the deep web consists of online data repositories that are hidden behind restrictive web search interfaces and therefore cannot be effectively crawled by existing search engines such as Google. The proposed technology uses a sampling-based framework to quickly generate visible depictions of deep web analytics by issuing a small number of search requests though the existing web interfaces of deep web repositories. The specific technical objectives include the ability to 'drill into' a small subarea of interest and download the desired data with minimal query cost, as well as the ability to extract metadata information automatically from a deep web repository. The anticipated technical results are algorithms that discover the data of interest and/or metadata information after issuing a predetermined number of requests through the search interfaces of deep web repositories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is understood by recognizing that it democratizes the market sectors of financial, political, and market analysis which would otherwise require heavy human effort and/or computing resources such as highly paid subject matter experts or servers and storage for web crawling/indexing. Instead of incurring such high costs, the proposed technology provides customers an affordable solution for the real-time aggregate analysis of multiple deep web data repositories. More broadly, real-time data analytics over the deep web is needed by knowledge workers in a wide variety of corporations, governments, and intelligence agencies. The prospects of empowering the general public with the ability to pose high-level analytical queries over the deep web, using the enhanced scientific and technological understanding achieved through this project, are tantalizing and beneficial to the entire society at large.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project studied two problems critical for enabling real-time data analytics over deep web repositories, which, in contrary to surface web pages, are hidden behind web search or browsing interfaces and cannot be effectively crawled by traditional search engines that rely on hyperlinks to traverse the surface web. The two technical problems studied are (1) subarea drilling, the ability to &ldquo;drill into&rdquo; a small &ldquo;subarea&rdquo; of interest in a web database and retrieve complete and precise information from a deep web repository, and (2) attribute discovery, the automated discovery of attribute values, including not only text and structured values but also multimedia information such as images, from unstructured web resources. To address these two problems, we developed solutions that leverage existing web services (e.g., web page and image search engines) to overcome interface limitations imposed by many web databases. Our solutions also leverage the overlap of information provided by multiple web databases in the same domain, as well as the user-configurable scoring functions supported by some web databases, to facilitate the retrieval of structured information from unstructured data sources. Solutions developed in this project are critical for the design of a data analytics platform over deep web repositories which is needed by knowledge workers in a wide variety of corporations, governments, and intelligence agencies which have a need for collecting, understanding and mining data stored in the deep web.
