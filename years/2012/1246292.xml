<AbstractNarration>The McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica are recognized as being the driest, coldest and probably one of the harshest environments on Earth. In addition to the lack of water, the biota in the valleys face a very limited supply of nutrients such as nitrogen compounds - necessary for protein synthesis. The glacial streams of the Dry Valleys have extensive cyanobacterial (blue green algae) mats that are a major source of carbon and nitrogen compounds to biota in this region. While cyanobacteria in streams are important as a source of these compounds, other non-photosynthetic bacteria also contribute a significant fraction (~50%) of fixed nitrogen compounds to valley biota. This research effort will involve an examination of exactly which non-phototrophic bacteria are involved in nitrogen fixation and what environmental factors are responsible for controlling nitrogen fixation by these microbes. This work will resolve the environmental factors that control the activity, abundance and diversity of nitrogen-fixing microbes across four of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. This will allow for comparisons among sites of differing latitude, temperature, elevation and exposure to water. These results will be integrated into a landscape wetness model that will help determine the impact of both cyanobacterial and non-photosynthetic nitrogen fixing microorganisms in this very harsh environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dry Valleys in many ways resemble the Martian environment, and understanding the primitive life and very simple nutrient cycling in the Dry Valleys has relevance for understanding how life might have once existed on other planets. Furthermore, the study of microbes from extreme environments has resulted in numerous biotechnological applications such as the polymerase chain reaction for amplifying DNA and mechanisms for freeze resistance in agricultural crops. Thus, this research should yield insights into how biota survive in extreme environments, and these insights could lead to other commercial applications.</AbstractNarration>

Although the bulk mineral soils of the Dry Valleys (DV) are extremely arid, during the brief Antarctic summer months, temperatures within the DV become warm enough to melt exposed surfaces of glaciers resulting in the formation of melt-water streams that flow periodically (approx. 4 to 10 weeks) during the summer months. Wetted soils adjacent to the melt-water streams and wet soils surrounding lakes, defined as ?hyporheic zones?, extend up to several meters on either side of the water source and are hotspots for microbial life and biogeochemical cycling. The microbial communities that form in these hyporheic zones survive the winter months in a desiccated state and are re-activated through hydration by summer melt-waters. As a result these communities can form large concentrations of responsive biomass even under extreme insituenvironmental conditions. It has been hypothesized that these communities may represent a major source of nitrogen and carbon to the entire DV ecosystem through wind transportation of mat detritus to the low productivity bulk arid soils. Therefore, the microorganisms fixing both N2and CO2within these hyporheic mat communities may represent keystone communities supplying both nitrogen and carbon to the arid DV desert soils. However, investigations into the microbial members, biogeochemical activities and the genetic underpinnings responsible for these transformations in wetted DV soils are lacking. Therefore, through the current project we intended to fill this knowledge gap, specifically studying nitrogen and carbon dynamics and associated microbial communities that proliferate along glacial melt-water streams and lake edges in the Miers Valley locale of the DV.  Our analyses have uncovered several novel findings relating to both N2and CO2fixation in wetted soils of the DV. We have revealed the identities and activities of N2and CO2fixers in the DV, and most importantly, have proven that a large diversity of non-phototrophic N2fixing bacteria exist in these habitats that can account for over 50% of the N2fixation activity. These surprising results are in contrast to the commonly held belief that cyanobacteria are the primary N2fixers in DV soils. Comparison between the microbial communities in wet and arid soils also indicate that although some microbes are shared, a large proportion of the microbial members are specific to their environment and are not present in the contrasting wet or dry soil biotope. Likewise, there appears to be CO2fixing microbes that are specific to their respective wet and dry environments which may be indicative of specific adaptation to their contrasting habitats.  Our results also indicate that these wetted soil systems harbor microbial cell concentrations that often exceed values found in temperate zone streams with N2fixation rates that are similar to rates reported in temperate and tropical marine systems.   It is now projected that Antarctica will begin to warm along with the rest of the planet as the ozone hole slowly closes over the next century.  During our final sampling expedition and with the help of the New Zealand Antarctic Biocomplexity Survey (NZTABS) team a portion of the Adams Glacier melt-water stream in the Miers Valley was diverted to an area of arid soil. The goal of the experiment was to observe how an associated, yet non-hyporheic, microbial community responds both spatially and temporally to the long-term presence of liquid water. Microbial response (change in community structure and activities) in the wetted soils and nutrient levels were followed over a 7 week time period. Analyses indicate a rapid change (&lt; 24 hours) in community structure due to the wetting event dispelling the currently held belief that these cold arid systems will be very slow to respond to a changing climate.    A second experiment was carried out during the last season of the project to understand the importance an contribution of these non-photosynthetic nitrogen fixers to the Dry Valley ecosystem.  Our standing hypothesis was that their contribution would be most significant during the spring and fall months when lights conditions would not be favourable for photosynthesis and nutrients would be in excess due to degrading microbial mats.  We performed a 1-month shading experiment of a flowing stream and mat community that simulated fall and spring light conditions.  We monitored the rates of nitrogen fixation, and the expression of marker genes involved in nitrogen fixation that would allow us to assess the relative contribution from phototrophs and heterotophs under the different light conditions.  Our studies indicate that during fall and spring heterotrophic N2 fixation dominates over phototrophic fixation and identifies that a significant contribution to the nitrogen pool in these arid polar deserts has been overlooked.
