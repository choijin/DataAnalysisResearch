<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to support ongoing multidisciplinary research and provide student training in semiconductor and thin film research through the acquisition of a Sputtering System for Device and Material Research at The University of Texas-Pan American and at The University of Texas at Brownsville. This approach is being taken to enrich the multidisciplinary research partnership and strengthen the collaboration between professors and students from the two institutions, attract new sources of research support, and elevate device and material education to a competitive level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is focused on finding solutions to multidisciplinary issues such as higher reliability, easier thermal management, and simpler manufacturing processes in semiconductor materials and devices. The project supports and promotes a hands-on, entrepreneurial, educational experience in micro-fabrication to enhance research infrastructure through characterization, improvement and development of thin films and electronics devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact includes academic enrichment in a historically underrepresented region of south Texas with a population of 1.5 million. The investigators will work to find out the key issues behind the low number of women entering the engineering discipline and to explain the necessity of having more women involved in this technology-related field. The acquisition will also help to prepare qualified and skilled graduate and undergraduate students and lays the foundation for strong integrated research and education initiatives centered on devices and materials at Minority Serving Institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes/Findings  The main outcome of the project is the establishment of a new sputtering system research laboratory for the students, faculty members and community in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV), TX  the fourth largest populated area in Texas; which is  historically underrepresented region. The area has a population of 1.5 million and UTRGV is the only institution that offers graduate programs in the engineering fields.  Now many researchers have access to the sputtering system and the students are now able to use a fabrication facility to support Science and Engineering research.   The project enables promising young investigators with the resources required to greatly raise the stature of research in the RGV, attract new sources of research support, and elevate device and material education for Hispanic students to a competitive level. It is also promoting  a hands-on, entrepreneurial, educational experience in  micro-fabrication to increase retention and to enhance research infrastructure;  The research laboratory serves as the foundation in which core research is being conducted at a world-class level; collaborations between UTPA/ UTB drive significant advances in interdisciplinary research; and significant opportunities are made available to both undergraduate and graduate students.     Impact on UTPA/UTB/UTRGV :   The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV)  is established in 2015 in a historic move that brings together the resources and assets of UT Brownsville (UTB) and UT Pan American (UTPA). UTPA and UTB have been growing tremendously over the past ten years. U.S. college access rates have flattened, and the gap in rates of college attendance between low income and other Americans has persisted. However the new university growth rate is promising. The current studentsÆ enrollment is over 28000. The College of Engineering &amp; Computer Science (COECS) at UTRGV has now over 3100 students.  The new university is maintaining state leadership in the preparation and production of public school teachers in south Texas. The Sputtering system research laboratory is also playing an important role for the research infrastructure at UTRGV.     The intellectual merits and broader of impacts include (but not limeted)     i)                 To perform a broad range of research related to devices and materials; the system allows us to grow thin films and then structures as well as to fabricate micro-pumps, microfluidics and MEMS devices in-house.  ii)              To enhance the Physics, Electrical Engineering (EE) and Mechanical Engineering (ME) curriculum at UTPA/UTB/UTRGV and to encourage undergraduate students to join graduate school at the new university UTRGV.  iii)          To  prepare qualified and skilled graduate and undergraduate students who are working in worldÆs leading companies, such as Intel, Reytheon, Texas Instrument, NASA, Alps, General Electric, Boeing, Caterpillar, FreeScale, IBM.  iv)             To enhance the multidisciplinary research partnership among different departments leading to collaborations for further external funding.     Attracting Underrepresented Groups/K-12 students/teachers:   The K-12 teachers spent their summer in the Sputtering System Research Laboratory at UTPA through the  NSF RET project. Teachers learnt about engineering design and nano-material research through active participation in the engineering research labs. The modules developed by the K-12 teachers were showcased at an annual teacher workshop sponsored by the RET-ENET program and was disseminated to a larger group of teachers within the local school districts and beyond. The research activities like these attract more underrepresented groups into college/university.      Strengthening Graduate Program   UTRGV/UTPAÆs Engineering graduate program is relatively new and growing fast. Enrollment of EE and ME graduate students has increased due to the recent increase in research infrastructure.  To accommodate t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
