<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Phase I project proposes to develop technology and products that will eliminate the use of polyvinylchloride (PVC) in one of its largest volume uses, flooring materials.  Interfacial Solutions has recently demonstrated that a high volume low cost plastic waste stream can be converted into a valuable flooring sheet product by using innovative material compounding and novel continuous sheet processing techniques.  The high volume low cost plastic waste stream comprises polyolefins that have been reclaimed from waste streams typically having little value and usually discarded to landfills.  Innovations to effectively homogenize the variability in the waste stream and remove contaminants have been developed to create a plastic compound that can be converted into flooring sheet materials and potentially useful as a replacement to PVC in the flooring market.  A novel process to continuously create sheet materials has also been determined.  To complete the development of this technology and disrupt incumbent products, the new technology needs to be advanced to improve the adhesive bonding between layers in the flooring construction, engineer flame retardant properties to meet industry specifications, and demonstrate a cost effective process with the durability and performance of current products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the removal of PVC from flooring products and the conversion of a significant plastic waste steam into useful products. The waste stream being utilized is largely scrapped into landfills today.  From an environmental and health risk standpoint, PVC is problematic.  Worldwide, government agencies and NGOs are seeking alternatives for PVC replacement.  Furthermore, PVC cannot be easily recycled, and therefore a significant source of waste once it has reached a products? end of life, also with significant health and environmental consequences during disposal due to its propensity to liberate dioxins.  By developing this new technology to convert a low cost plastic waste stream into composite materials with properties comparable or exceeding PVC, an opportunity exists to remove some 2 billion square meters of PVC flooring per year.  The technology platform developed by this proposal can also be of utility in replacing chemically treated plywood used in outdoor signage, marine plywood and concrete forms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF-SBIR Phase I research for Federal Award ID 1248584 entitled 'An Environmentally Sustainable Approach to PVC-Free Flooring' was successfully completed in full.  The key findings of the research showed that a novel, low cost, reclaimed feedstock based on low density polyethylene could be properly compounded and fabricated into sheet material having attributes required to be considered as a a replacement for PVC in flooring applications such as Luxury Vinyl Tile (LVT).    The research focused on completing four primary technical objectives.  These included achieving proper thermal expansion properties (known as dimensional stability within the flooring industry), obtaining good adhesive bonding between the substrate and decorative films necessary to construct LVT, achieving the ability to directly print onto the substrate, and demonstrating options to minimize the impact of decomposition caused by heat.  Each of these properties needed to be obtained without negatively impacting the required compound costs and mechanical properties so as to maintain competitive performance relative to PVC.  The specific results of the research showed that novel inorganic fillers, when combined with proper processing methods resulted in sheet products having minimal thermal expansion characteristics.  Specific targets included the attainment of &lt;0.25% expansion when heated from room temperature to 70C and less than 0.2% shrinkage when heated from room temperature to 70C and subsequently cooled from 70C back to room temperature.  These values were found to be comparable to commercially available PVC used for LVT applications.  The results also aligned with customer expectations and represented performance not typically found in non-PVC plastics being considered for flooring applications.  The results also demonstrated that commercial plasma treatment, in the presence of a unique gas mixture, resulted in a robust and long lasting change in the surface character of the substrates that were produced.  The surface energy of the substrate was raised from approximately 30 dynes/cm to 50 - 70 dynes/cm depending on the watt density of plasma imparted.  Substrates modified to surfaces energies of 60 dynes/cm or higher were found to be directly printable as well as readily bonded.  Commercially available acylic inks and polyurethane adhesives were respectively used.    The adhesive bonding was done five weeks after the plasma treatment.  The attainment of high bond strength, that was maintained after an industry standard heat and humidity aging cycle, suggests that the surface modification enabled by the commercial plasma treatment is long-lasting.  Further aging experiments to fully validate this important finding are continuing.  The research also investigated via cone calorimetry different flame retardant packages.  These tests measured the ability of the flame retardant packages to slow the onset of flame ignition, minimize the heat released during combustion and reduce the amount of smoke liberated.  The cone calorimetry results showed the smoke liberation effect was most readily modified with traditional flame retardants when used within our composite materials.  Depending on the results of specific industry standard flame retardant tests, the experimental flame retardant packages will be further investigated and optimized to achieve the required performance.  The successful conclusion of the technical objectives of this Phase I research effort clearly demonstrate that cost-effective production of a non-PVC substrate to replace PVC in flooring applications such as Luxury Vinyl Tile is feasible.  This work lays a very strong foundation for further research that can be dedicated to scaling up this product and technology platform.  The optimization of leading prototypes formulations at a full manufacturing scale and the extension of the technology into fully integrated flooring alternatives to PVC-based flooring are proposed as the next steps ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
