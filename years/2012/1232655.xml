<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to develop experimentally validated physics-based models of the mechanical material removal processes in biological tissue machining. The approach is to characterize unique aspects of biological tissue machining in four related research activities. 1) Describe the transition from material deformation and plowing to material removal. The specific objective is to develop machining test systems and material removal models for the new classes of work materials being studied. 2) Develop and validate machining force and debris size models. The specific objective is to predict machined surface and subsurface damage that is directly related to medical treatment success. 3) Create artery deformation models that are directly linked to material removal models. The specific goal is to infer short- and long-term effects in the project application process of atherectomy, the removal of plaque from blood vessels. 4) Characterize the dynamic behaviour and effects of long, flexible tool drive systems on tool-work interactions. The specific objective is to provide realistic medical procedure inputs to machining process and work damage models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, fundamental machining studies and research results will be widely useful in many tissue machining processes. The benefits of this research will be improved performance of commonly used medical devices, new machining test systems, and new tissue machining models that include work material deformation models directly related to possible machining damage and surgical treatment success. The project will extend the integrated activity of manufacturing engineering, biomedical engineering and health care by immediately bringing together practicing professionals in engineering, medicine and medical device design who have committed to actively participate in the research. These individuals will bring with them graduate and undergraduate students and working technicians from these fields.</AbstractNarration>
