<AbstractNarration>The overall objective of the proposed research is to investigate changes in the dynamics of the active layer and the top layers of ice-rich permafrost on the North Slope of Alaska using InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar). We will use both C-band and L-band data, acquired during the last two decades (1991-2011). More specifically, (i) we will implement the InSAR Frozen Ground Algorithm (InSAR FGA) to detect changes in ALT and near-surface permafrost, (ii) we will investigate spatial variations of ALT and ground ice content of the near-surface permafrost through drilling, mechanical probing, and ground penetration radar (GPR).  Data and information obtained from this fieldwork will also be used for InSAR FGA validation and calibration, (iii) combining InSAR FGA outputs, field data, and available climate data, we will investigate spatial and temporal changes and variations of the active layer and near-surface permafrost and their response to climate change from 1991 through 2011 on the North Slope of Alaska. The expected results of the proposed research will provide (i) a validated InSAR FGA useful for regional-scale active layer and permafrost studies; (ii) time series of ALT and their changes over the study period, (iii) long-term (1991-2011) mean of ALT across the North Slope of Alaska, and (iv) potential ground-ice melting in the top layers of ice-rich permafrost across the North Slope of Alaska with a resolution of from tens of meters to hundreds of meters.  The results from this study will be ideal for model inputs and validation and can be used to assess risk to human infrastructure in the Arctic.  The postdoc Liu will gain educational experience by mentoring an undergraduate student in the Summer Research in Geoscience and Engineering program, and results will be disseminated to the public through the NSIDC All about Frozen Ground website and via lectures at the Fiske Planetarium and Boulder Public Library.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[We successfully developed new remote sensing techniques to measure Active Layer Thickness (ALT) and monitor permafrost dynamics.  Permafrost is perennially frozen soil and the active layer is the surface layer of soil that thaws in summer and refreezes in winter.  ALT is the maximum annual depth of thaw and is a fundamental measure of the thermodynamic status of permafrost.  We use the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique to measure surface subsidence due to the freezing and thawing of the active layer (Figure 1).  Permafrost contains ice that greatly exceeds the pore space of the soil in the form of lenses, layers, and wedges.  Thermokarst activity is the melting and subsequent drainage of this excess ground ice, which results in a long-term subsidence trend.  As the active layer freezes, the water in the soil changes to ice and expands, resulting in a seasonal frost heave of 1-4 cm.  We make an assumption about the vertical distribution of water in the active layer and estimate ALT from the seasonal subsidence.  The following examples illustrate the kinds of processes we can study in permafrost regions using the InSAR technique.  InSAR represents a new and powerful tool to study permafrost dynamics and monitor permafrost status. Figure 2 shows the ALT around Barrow, Alaska on the Arctic Coastline.  The average ALT around Barrow is 30 cm with an uncertainty of 10-15 cm.  The ALT is slightly greater within the many drained lake beds that dot the area around Barrow.  Several of the drained lakes show very deep ALT that actually reflects excessively strong thermokarst activity.  Maps such as these are useful for a variety of ecological and city planning applications. Our techniques allow us to study individual thermokarst features at a level of detail that was not possible before.  Figure 3 shows such a feature, called Pipeline thermokarst, located 20 km south of Deadhorse, Alaska along the Alaska pipeline.   Interviews with local construction crews indicate the feature was triggered by building the access road in the 1970s, which blocked the normal, northward flow of water resulting in pools of standing water that promote additional thawing.  Over the past 40 years Pipeline thermokarst has expanded southward from the access road to currently occupy an area of ~0.75 km2.  The land is relatively flat with minimal erosion, so the thermokarst front is not a sharp wall, but a gradual change in slope advancing at a rate of ~20 m yr-1.  We predict the thermokarst feature will reach the nearby lake in 10-15 years, triggering it to drain and perhaps damaging the access road. Our technique is also useful to study the impacts of fire.  Figure 4 shows how ALT increased after the Anaktuvuk fire, which occurred in 2007 about 200 km southwest of Deadhorse, Alaska on the North Slope.  Fire removes the surface organic layer, which increases ALT, impacts vegetation, and changes soil hydrology.  The seasonal subsidence increased by up to 8 cm yr-1 after the fire, driven by a combination of an increase in ALT and thawing of ice-rich permafrost.
