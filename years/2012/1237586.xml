<AbstractNarration>The "Ninth Mississippi State - UAB Conference on Differential Equations and Computational Simulations" will be held for two and a half days during October 4-6, 2012 at McCool Hall at Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, Mississippi. The website for this conference is http://www.ccs.msstate.edu/deconf/de2012. &lt;br/&gt;The mission of the meeting is to provide a joint forum where mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from industry, federal laboratories, and academia can exchange ideas on theoretical, applied, and computational developments in differential equations. The emphasis of this year's conference will be on reaction-diffusion equations with applications. The primary objective of the conference is to optimally fulfill the aforestated mission, while at the same time to promote research and education in mathematical and computational analysis of differential equations and associated simulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is a collaborative endeavor between the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and the Center for Computational Sciences (CCS), a High Performance Computing Collaboratory (HPCC) member center, at Mississippi State University, and the Department of Mechanical Engineering at University of Alabama at Birmingham. This award provides travel support to graduate students and recent Ph.D.s for an opportunity to present their work, meet other researchers, educators and practitioners, learn about recent developments in the proposed interdisciplinary field, and produce a new generation of mathematical models and challenges.</AbstractNarration>

The conference was also dedicated to ALFONSO CASTRO, Professor of Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College, in celebration of his 62nd birthday and his outstanding contributions to differential equations.  This is a truly multidisciplinary conference with a focused theme, which is needed in the area of Differential Equations &amp; Computational Simulations, mathematical models, mathematical and numerical analysis, computation techniques and their applications to real world problems. The Department of Mathematics and Statistics (http://www.math.msstate.edu) and the Center for Computational Sciences (http://www.ccs.msstate.edu), a High Performance Computing Collaboratory (http://www.hpc.msstate.edu) member center, at Mississippi State University (http://www.msstate.edu), along with the Department of Mechanical Engineering (http://www.uab.edu/engineering/home/departments-research/me) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (http://www.uab.edu), provided the perfect opportunity to assume a leadership role for this mission. Participants enjoyed the collaboration and interactions between mathematics, science, and engineering. This promoted active interdisciplinary research in the areas of differential equations and computational simulations.  Another important feature of the conference is the involvement of many young researchers (especially underrepresented minorities) in mathematical sciences, including gradua...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
