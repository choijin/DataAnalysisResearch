<AbstractNarration>Personal healthcare systems based on wearable/implantable medical devices are being increasingly deployed for a variety of diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic applications. A consequence of the increased functional complexity, software programmability, and wireless network connectivity of such devices is that they are now vulnerable to security attacks that have plagued general-purpose computing systems. Recent demonstration of security attacks on commercially deployed systems has raised medical device security concerns significantly. Unfortunately, medical devices come with extreme size/power constraints and unique usage models, making it infeasible to simply borrow conventional security solutions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on developing a non-intrusive medical security monitor that snoops on all wireless communication to/from medical devices and uses multi-layered anomaly detection to identify potentially malicious transactions. While formal methods have been previously used to check for implementation flaws, they are not geared towards verifying the safety behavior of the medical device software in its interactions with the real world, which can expose logical flaws as well. The work investigates these interactions by transforming properties specified at the real-world interfaces (sensors and actuators) into program properties against which the medical device software can be verified. The findings will be disseminated through conferences and journals.  The hardware and software developed will be placed in the public domain, and disseminated to the industry. The knowledge developed will be integrated into various courses. Undergraduates will be encouraged to perform independent research on this topic. Fellowships and outreach programs will be leveraged to encourage participation of female and minority students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Implantable/wearable medical devices  (IWMDs) are being increasingly used in diagnostic, monitoring, and  therapeutic applications. Their increased functional complexity,  software programmability, and wireless network connectivity,  unfortunately, also make them more vulnerable to security attacks. We  had demonstrated an attack on insulin pumps earlier, others have shown  an attack on pacemakers. However, it is not easy to defend IWMDs against  such attacks since they come with extreme size and power constraints,  and unique usage models.  The major goals of this project were two-fold:  (i) Wireless monitoring and anomaly detection for medical devices.  (ii) Improving the trustworthiness of medical devices.  We made the following technical contributions:  (i) Developed a methodology for safe and secure design of IWMDs.  (ii) Developed a very low energy overhead method for a wakeup and key exchange mechanism for enabling symmetric encryption in IWMDs.  (iii) Explored physiological side channels from the human body and IWMDs.  (iv) Investigated long-term energy-efficient continuous health monitoring using wearable medical sensors.  (v) Addressed the trustworthiness of IWMDs and body-area networks.  (vi) Investigated attacks against and countermeasures for machine learning on biomedical datasets.  (vii) Investigated the use of wearable medical sensors for continuous authentication.  (viii) Investigated security attacks based on sensor-trigerred emergency responses.  The broader impacts are as follows:  (i) Some of the technology developed in this work is being evaluated for possible commercialization.  (ii) Four graduate students (one female) and a post-doc were trained in this important field.  (iii) A female undergraduate did her senior independent project on this topic.  (iv) The technical articles were published in prestigious journals and conferences.  (v) The results were disseminated through invited talks.  (vi) Work on security attacks on insulin pumps was cited in New York Times Sunday Magazine.  (vii) Results were incorporated in a course on Embedded Computing taught by the Principal Investigator.        Last Modified: 09/03/2016       Submitted by: Niraj K Jha]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
