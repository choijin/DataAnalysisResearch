<AbstractNarration>Graphs provide a natural representation of real-world networks e.g. world-wide web, biological networks, social networks.  There is a growing body of work on both models of network structure and algorithms to automatically discover patterns (e.g., communities) in the structure. However, statistical methods for  assessing the significance of discovered patterns or  distinguishing between alternative models have received less attention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robust statistical models, which can accurately represent distributions over collections of graphs, are critical for principled quantitative investigation of networks and their properties. Specifically, since sampling distributions (either analytical or empirical) can be used to determine the likelihood of a given sample, statistical models facilitate hypothesis testing and anomaly detection (e.g., graphs with low likelihood can be flagged as anomalous). However, unlike metric spaces the space of graphs exhibits a combinatorial structure which poses significant theoretical and practical challenges which need to be overcome for accurate estimation and efficient inference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the interplay between choice of model representation, parameter estimation, and sampling/inference to develop statistical models that can accurately estimate (parametric) probability distributions over the space of graphs (i.e., graph populations). Speicifically, the project focuses on a novel probabilistic graph model that generates graphs by quilting together a set of subgraphs sampled from simpler basis graph models and the application of the resulting model to (i) explore and define graph classes, (ii) detect anomalies and assess their significance, and (iii) investigate graph dynamics and formally characterize notions of temporal stationarity and dynamic evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will advance the state of the art in probabilistic models, and rigorous statistical methods for analyis, of graph structured data. The proposed work also contributes to research-based training of graduate and undergraduate students at Purdue University. All of the software, publications, and data resulting from the project will be freely disseminated to the larger research and educational community.</AbstractNarration>

Although a special case of this process was introduced as an efficient approximate sampling algorithm for the KPGM, neither why such an approximation works nor what is the actual distribution this process is sampling from had been.

We outline an efficient method for estimating the parameters of AGM, as well as a sampling method based on Accept-Reject sampling to generate edges with correlated attributes. The AGM approach was developed for use with relatively simple generative network models (GNMs) and does not work well with more complex hierarchical GNMs. In contrast to simple GNMs where the probability mass is spread throughout the space of edges more evenly, hierarchical GNMs concentrate the mass to smaller regions of the space to reflect dependencies among edges in the network---this produces more realistic network characteristics, but also makes it more difficult to identify candidate networks from the sampling space.

Our framework is inspired by state-of-the-art smoothing techniques used in natural language processing (NLP). However, unlike NLP applications which primarily deal with strings, we show how one can apply smoothing to a richer class of inter-dependent sub-structures which naturally arise in graphs.  Together the models, algorithms, and methods developed in this project will facilitate the study of large complex structures of the kind frequently encountered in domains like ecology, bioinformatics, chemo-informatics, and social network analysis--by allowing researchers in these domains to leverage efficient and statistically sound computational methods.
