<AbstractNarration>This project identifies science labs at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill with large data-intensive research projects on campus that would benefit most from improvements in network infrastructure. The project focuses on network enhancements by replacing networking equipment, both building links and access layer, related to these research labs on campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enhancements consist of upgrading the existing 100 Mb-only switches in the affected departments with gigabit Ethernet switches providing multi-gigabit links back to upgraded building aggregation switches that, in turn, connect to the existing network backbone at 10Gbps. This provides 10Gbps connectivity from each building to the campus research computing services, as well as to Internet2 resources. The enhancements also include a monitoring machine equipped with a 10Gbps DAG monitoring card to collect traffic header traces at the ingress-egress routers at the edge of the campus network. These enhancements will enable better and faster access to the large amounts of data transferred regularly by these labs, thus enhancing data management in their respective research projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research labs directly and significantly impacted by this project are involved in the following research projects: &lt;br/&gt;* Biological Sciences: producing mathematical models of animal flight (e.g., hummingbird, butterfly), using recordings of high-speed and high-resolution video from locations throughout the campus. &lt;br/&gt;* Biological Sciences: studying the evolution and genetics of de novo genes; obtaining the data, particularly the raw data, demands several minutes to several hours of uninterrupted downloads. &lt;br/&gt;* Geological Sciences: collecting, aggregating, and moving data from volcanic and seismic monitors (some in real-time), real time analysis of ongoing geologic processing.&lt;br/&gt;* Environmental Science and Engineering: Lattice Boltzmann modeling that requires large lattice sizes (8003) that translate to state storage of 8.7-95.3GB per state point. &lt;br/&gt;* Computer Science: transferring large network traffic datasets captured at the main campus link to clusters of data processing machines in the lab for use in network experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project additionally has direct impact on the undergraduate and graduate curricula in the various departments represented by these research labs, broadening the participation of student researchers. These research labs continue their investment in promoting undergraduate research by involving undergraduate students, including actively promoting women and minorities in their groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent years, as research across multiple departments has become increasingly data-intensive, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) researchers have often found their efforts constrained or inhibited by inadequate networking capacity within basic science buildings, between basic science buildings, and across the network backbone.  Campus research efforts suffer from older equipment that has restricted network access links on desktops to 100Mbps and building access links to 1Gbps.  While the above mentioned link speeds would serve home networks very well, research labs that share, and thus frequently move terabytes of data for computation, are severely hampered with slower network links. This project has enabled us to enhance network capacity in several research labs on campus.  The installed infrastructure, made available from this grant, has enhanced and thus directly impacted several data-intensive research projects on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The building housing the environmental sciences lab has been upgraded to a 10Gbps link and we are benefitting from this increased speed as we are doing a lot of computing using the central campus computing resources that require access outside the building. We especially use computing resources at the Oak Ridge National Labs (ORNL). Large-scale computation plays a central role in the work of the environmental sciences lab, both through local and remote supercomputing sources.  The upgraded facilities have enabled the group to do simulations and analysis that would not have been feasible before the upgrade of the facilities---enabling a more rapid advancement of this important area of science than would have been possible without this grant.   In our genome sciences labs, one of the goals of our research is to produce software for assembling RNA and DNA data produced through high throughput sequencing technology, especially 3rd generation sequencing technology. The cutting edge sequencing technology we use generates enormous amounts of data.  The UNC sequencing core generated about 92 trillion nucleotides of sequence data this year. These large datasets can be compressed, but even after that compression these data files need to be shifted from sequencer to the cluster, to the individual researchers, and ultimately to some repository.  This demands the high capacity network infrastructure that the CC-NIE project has supported. In our biology labs, network infrastructure upgrades through this project have affected research in in several ways. Notably, a three person team is working on analysis of an ~3 TB video data set of stereo views of Chimney Swift flocks (birds) engaged in their characteristic massed landing pattern.  The network infrastructure allows the team to keep the data in one location rather than attempting to synchronize among several different workstations, reducing the complexity of teamwork and allowing more effort to be devoted to research. The enhanced network infrastructure continues to allow the lab to increase the frequency of 2nd site backups of the lab data server, something that was not possible before this project. In summary, the network infrastructure improvements have greatly streamlined the operations of the biology lab group and contributed to several recent publications which depend on large video datasets.  In our geological sciences labs, we rely heavily on the internet for data, communication and transfer of information, sometimes in real time. The facility improvement introduced by the upgrade of the building to 10Gbps communication, through this project, has been essential for the daily operation of numerous projects. In Seismology we constantly exchange large data volumes of seismic and infrasound wave forms for modeling and development of earthquake and volcano hazard mitigation. Our web based GIS courses require transmission of large satellite images for monitoring rivers and environmental va...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
