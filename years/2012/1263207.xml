<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Tuskegee University that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2015. The Tuskegee University IBS-REU site offers undergraduates (in the STEM majors, but particularly in Biology, Chemistry, Animal Sciences, Plant and Soil Sciences, Agricultural Economics, and other bioscience majors) a novel approach to conduct research by integrating multiple areas in the biosciences with an emphasis on bioinformatics. We define "integrative biosciences" research as any research where the continued integration of two or more science disciplines is requisite, for example, determining the consequences of genetically-modified sweet potato (Plant Genomics, Plant Sciences) on soil microbial biodiversity (Soil Science, Soil Microbiology, Genetics). Over 30 university faculty will serve as mentors, offering a wide range of interesting and exciting projects for participants. Students are expected to do full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and career development workshops, such as the ethics and responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry, government and academia, preparing for the GRE and the graduate school application process. REU students have access to a rich array of individual mentor's facilities as well as many labs and centers with core facilities across the Tuskegee University campus. The program's multi-phase recruitment effort consists of both traditional "hard copy" formats as well as digital-based advertising. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in integrative biosciences with an emphasis in bioinformatics. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool available to BIO-funded REU PIs. More information is available by visiting http://www.onemedicine.tuskegee.edu/IBS/project/IBS_REU.htm , or by contacting the PI (Dr. Olga Bolden-Tiller at obtiller@mytu.tuskegee.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Deloris Alexander at dalexander@mytu.tuskegee.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For more than 130  years, Tuskegee University  (TU) and its diverse faculty has been well known for the mentoring and training of undergraduate students in STEM  fields, having gained the distinction of having trained over half of the country?s African American scientists, currently ranking 8th in the nation.  During the summers of 2013- 2017, we provided 41 students (29 funded by NSF REU and an additional 12 funded by TU and non-TU collaborators) from diverse backgrounds across the United States with research experience directed by a co-mentoring team.  Though the research projects were multidisciplinary in nature, the Integrative Biosciences Research Experience for Undergraduates (IBS REU) projects shared a common theme: bioinformatics/computational biology.  . The NSF-funded TU Site Program," Award ID 852049.    The primary objectives of this project were to: Increase the number of undergraduate students, particularly minorities, involved in integrative biosciences research; and to broaden the recruitment pipeline for the IBS PhD program at TU and similar programs at institutions across the country by exposing an increased number of undergraduates to a highly productive research environment .  The intellectual merit of the proposed IBS REU was in the integrative nature of the program. The broader impacts were increasing the number of African-American and other minority students in the science and engineering PhD pipeline and broadening their participation in the STEM fields.     The main components of the program were recruitment, career development, building community (emphasis on diversity and inclusion), authentic research, and assessment. A website was developed to advertise the program.  Advertisement flyers were developed and sent to contacts at partner institutions, national conferences and faculty at TU.  A total of 73 students were trained over the funding period, of which 61 were funded by IBS REU and an additional 12 students funded through partner programs.  The common theme for all of the research projects was using an integrative approach to answer a question in life sciences.   IBS REU students submitted bi-weekly progress reports, signed by the mentors, describing their research and delineating the roles of the students, faculty mentors, and graduate student mentors.  The research experience was enhanced by the inclusion of a Near-Peer Mentoring component, which included a half day "How to Mentor" workshop and a two-week period during which the REU students served as near peer mentors for high school.  A series of seminars and workshops (Research Safety and Certification Series, SWORD (Survival While on the Road to the Doctorate,  Ethics Component,  Journal Club, "Lunch with an Academic," Social Activities to Build Esprit d?Corps) were organized by the leadership team for the IBS REU.     Assessment of the impact of the workshop and related activities was utilized to improve the project activities and external reviewers from Mississippi State University, Lawson State University, and/or Miles College met with students toward the end of the program and provided feedback to the leadership team from the students on these programmatic activities.  Students were provided GRE Prep training using Genius 360 training materials.   Several steps (ice breakers,  joint ethics workshops, classes, and social activities, a Scavenger Hunt competition, working with other summer programs on the TU and Auburn University campuses, a BBQ, a fishing expedition, Suite Sensations "dorm" party,  Macon County Fun Day, Hiking in the Tuskegee National Forest, Walking Tour of Historic Tuskegee and more), were taken to help build community among students. Assessment results indicated that the REU participants were very satisfied with the camaraderie and the IBS REU Facebook page indicated that these individuals kept in contact with each other.  For over 50% of the participants, the IBS REU was their first experience having a minority person as a research advisor or instructor at the collegiate level.  35 of the 61 participants presented their research findings at national (22) or local (13) conferences following IBS REU ( 57%).
