<AbstractNarration>For fifty years, the Tibetan Plateau has been recognized as the largest topographic feature that perturbs atmospheric circulation.  It serves as an ideal field laboratory for understanding the geodynamic processes that build high terrain.  Accordingly, the growth of the plateau should have altered atmospheric circulation and therefore written an evolving paleoclimatic signature not only on eastern Asian regional climates, but on global climate as well.  Despite many recent studies, we still do not know precisely when the Tibetan Plateau reached its current dimensions and how it perturbs atmospheric circulation.  This project brings together geodynamicists, atmospheric scientists, and paleoclimatologists in a multidisciplinary study of the when and the how.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major goals of the project is to quantify the extent to which Tibet has grown by crustal thickening, by thrust faulting and folding, by flow within the crust that redistributes material there, or by replacement of cold mantle lithosphere with hotter material (all in a state of isostatic equilibrium). Such quantification will take big steps toward the understanding of how high plateaus are built and how continental lithosphere deforms, topics at the forefront of geodynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determining how Tibet has grown will require determining when crustal shortening and thickening occurred, using basic field methods and modern laboratory techniques, and quantifying paleoaltitudes with new isotopic tools. Applying such paleoaltimetric techniques, however, requires an understanding not only of how the atmosphere transports isotopes, but how the evolving high terrain affected surface temperatures at times in the past.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Asian monsoon is the strongest heat engine on the planet, and it influences climate all around the world.  In Asia, there actually are three monsoon regions: The Indian Summer monsoon (ISM) which strongly influence southern Asia, the Western North Pacific Summer Monsoon (WNPSM) which strongly influences SE Asia, and the East Asian Monsoon (EASM), which appears to be a blend of moisture from both the ISM and WNPSM, and influences central and northern China.     We have studied the past behavior of these monsoons using the isotope 10Be (beryllium 10), which is produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays, but is carried to the ground in rain, and is thus a proxy for rainfall.  Using records of 10Be recorded in wind blown sediments from central China, we have generated a 1/2 million year long rainfall record, which reveals the EASM monsoon has waxed and waned in strength due to cyclic changes in the shape of the Earths orbit.  We find the main period of these changes is linked to the 23,000 year cycle of precession of the Earth's orbit around the sun.  This cycle causes northern hemisphere summers to be somewhat warmer or cooler at opposite ends of this cycle.  The opposite happens in the southern hemisphere.  As a result, when summers are warmer in the northern hemisphere, winters are cooler in the southern hemisphere, and vis versa.    One of our chief finding is that the EASM is generally somewhat stronger when the northern hemisphere summers are warmer, and weaker when it is cooler. We also found that when northern hemisphere summers are warmer, more of the moisture in the EASM monsoon arrives from the ISM, and less from the WNPSM. This situation reverses when northern hemisphere summers are cooler.    There appear to be other factors that influence EASM strength as well, such as the size of the polar ice caps, which also wax and wane in response to changes in the Earths orbit around the sun.  But whether the size to the ice caps are controlling the strength of the monsoon, or the other way around is still unclear.  This relationship may actually work in both directions at different times.    One other important thing we found is that it's the difference in heating between the north and south subtropics ( ~30&deg;N and 30&deg;S) that most strongly influences Asian monsoon strength. The reason for this is linked to the Hadley circulation in the atmosphere.  The Hadley circulation is comprised of two world encircling circulation cells that move air and energy from the tropics to the subtropics and back again. When its summer in the northern hemisphere, the boundary between these two cells--which is called the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ for short)-- moves into the northern hemisphere, and the southern Hadley cell becomes bigger and stronger, while the northern cell becomes smaller and weaker. When the Asian monsoons are strong, towering thunderstorms force air to rise in the monsoon areas.  This air flows outward at the top of the atmosphere towards the subtropics where it sinks back to ground level. Because the southern Hadley cell is stronger during northern summer, most of this monsoon outflow goes into the southern hemisphere subtropics, and less of it goes into the northern hemisphere subtropics.  This means air has to flow towards the Asian monsoon in the lower  atmosphere to replace the monsoon outflow air moving into the southern hemisphere at the top of the atmosphere.  This general circulation (lower air in/upper air out) is what sets up the Hadley circulation going north and south.    But a smaller part of the monsoon outflow from Asia flows eastward into the northern Pacific region, and descends back to the surface in the North Pacific Subtropics. This means surface air has to flow back westward from the north Pacific to the Asian monsoon.  This sets up an E/W circulation cell call the Walker Circulation.    What we found is that when the Northern hemisphere warms because of changes in the earths orbit, the Northern hemisphere Walker circulation weakens and the Southern Hadley circulation strengthens. The opposite happens when northern summers cool because of changes in the Earths orbit.    Thus this work has helped us to understand how the Asian monsoon is linked to the Hadley and Walker circulation of the atmosphere, and how the monsoons are linked to the ice ages, and how both are influenced by changes in heating between the northern and southern subtropics caused by orbital shape changes.
