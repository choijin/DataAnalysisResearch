<AbstractNarration>This action funds Christine Offerman of Tufts University to conduct a research project, entitled "A formula regarding the averages of functions over spheres in a symmetric space," during the summer of 2012 at Okayama University in Okayama, Okayama Prefecture. The host scientist is Prof. Tomoyuki Kakehi. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to prove a generalization in harmonic analysis and integral geometry on symmetric spaces with the intent to prove a generalization of the √Åsgiersson Mean Value Theorem. Proving this theorem admits solutions to the multi-temporal wave equation and other interesting partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

I was able to generalize many of these results to certain types of symmetric spaces. The wave equation in the cases I am interested in becomes a system of differential equations with multiple "time variables." Whereas in the classical case there is a single equation and a single time variable. I derived solutions to this multi-temporal  system on the tangent space to a symmetric space of noncompact type using the Fourier and Radon transforms. I also obtained results regarding various properties of these solutions including their uniqueness and propagation speed.
