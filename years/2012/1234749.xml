<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for Sherlock, a Cray YarcData uRiKA data appliance consisting of a next-generation Cray XMT supercomputer (NG-XMT) running the uRiKA application architecture and augmented by Cray XT5 compute nodes to broaden the range of relevant applications to address the challenges of graph-based data analytics.  The system will be deployed at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC).  The Cray NG-XMT is a massively multithreaded supercomputer, based on the Cray XT5 infrastructure and specialized for analytics. Its Cray-proprietary Threadstorm 4.0 processors implement multiple, powerful features to support lightweight multithreading, latency hiding, and advanced memory interfaces with AMD HyperTransport-attached SeaStar2 interconnect chips to provide a flat, globally-addressable memory. This will be the first system of its kind to be available to the NSF research community.</AbstractNarration>

Urika embodies a novel approach to graph analytics. Graph analytics leverages graph structures to understand, codify, and visualize relationships that exist between people or devices in a network.

PSCÆs Big Data workshops filled beyond their planned capacity and introduced graph analytics and Sherlock to 417 workshop participants at 16 institutions nationwide.
