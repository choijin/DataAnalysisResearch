<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to develop a proof-of-concept peer review matching algorithm and demonstrate if it is a valuable and viable methodology for conducting peer review.  Peer review is a proven method that has positive impact on student learning.  The project will test the algorithm on Model Eliciting Activities in the engineering classroom, and investigate how changing peer review can affect student learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project is the transformative potential of improving peer review processes, since peer review is used throughout STEM and medical fields.  Thus this preliminary investigation can extend outside the realm of improving student learning.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.</AbstractNarration>

The PI then explored training students for a gut reaction evaluation. The solutions students generate typically take 20-40 minutes each for a proper evaluation. The purpose of this effort was to train TAs to evaluate solutions in two minutes or fewer &ndash; using a "gut reaction" that relied on an internal evaluation heuristic. Two students were trained in the long-form evaluation process and were expressly told that they would need to evaluate solutions quickly and that they should be developing this internal heuristic. They then applied this gut-reaction evaluation technique to archival data and their results were compared with an expert?s evaluation. Their evaluations were similar in accuracy to those of TAs conducting the long-form evaluation, but still less accurate than the computational approach found above and not sufficient for practical informed peer review matching.  Parallel to the "reviewee need" work, efforts were underway to analyze archival data to identify ways of predicting "reviewer skill". As part of the review process, reviewers were asked to evaluate a sample solution. They were then shown their review next to an expert?s review of that same sample. Only after they had compared their review to an expert?s review were they allowed to peer review a solution from one of their peers.
