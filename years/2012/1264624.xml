<AbstractNarration>PI: Ghovanloo &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1264624&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his team have developed a wireless tongue-operated assistive technology (AT), known as the Tongue Drive System (TDS).  Clinical trials on participants with tetraplegia using an external version of the TDS (eTDS), which resembles a wireless headphone, have well established the functionality, ease of use, and acceptability of the eTDS over traditional devices, such as Sip-n-puff.  However, mechanical stability of the eTDS is insufficient, and affects its reliability and usability in uncontrolled daily life conditions.  While it is possible to firmly secure the eTDS on the user's head with stretchable traps and buckles, the result may reduce the comfort level in long term usage and negatively impact its appearance.  An alternative solution is a highly miniaturized intraoral version of the TDS (iTDS) in the form of a dental retainer, which can be customized based on the user's oral anatomy and clasp onto the user's teeth similar to an orthodontic brace.  However, very little is known about the feasibility, level of comfort, and usability of an intraoral appliance to be used as a wireless tongue-operated control surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The main objectives of the proposed research are: (A) Design and development of a fully functional proof-of-concept iTDS prototype that can be used in human subject trials, while solving key technical challenges.  (B) Qualitatively compare the eTDS and iTDS in terms of acceptability, level of comfort, and potential interference with other activities such as speech and ingestion using mockup oral appliances and headsets, interviews, and focus groups involving potential end users with severe physical disabilities. (c) Detailed quantitative assessment of the pros and cons of the intraoral approach in comparison with the eTDS approach based on widely accepted performance measures in the field of human-computer interfacing as well as reliability and robustness against external interfering factors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The number of people with disabilities is increasing among all age groups, particularly the elderly who currently comprise 12% of the U.S. population.  Individuals severely disabled as a result of various causes from spinal cord injuries to stroke, cerebral palsy, and ALS find it extremely difficult to carry out everyday tasks without continuous help.  We intend to transform the lives of the most severely disabled individuals by helping them live active, self-supportive, and productive lives.  Paralysis is considered one of the most expensive disabilities.  Solutions such as the iTDS could help reduce healthcare and assisted-living costs and increase the employability of people with severe disabilities, allowing them to participate more fully in the society, while relieving their family members or dedicated caregivers.  iTDS can even be used by able-bodied individuals, where motion of the limbs is hindered.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We have developed a wearable device that can wirelessly track the position of the tongue within the oral space in real time without interfering with the free voluntary tongue motion. Tongue Drive System (TDS) is an ultra-low power embedded system that provides access to the position of a small magnetic tracer in the 3D oral space. As a result of prior NSF support, we have developed custom circuits and systems for interfacing with the magnetic sensors and also included all the other necessary blocks, such as analog-to-digital converter, power management, and dual-band RF communication on a single ASIC, also known as the system-on-a-chip (SoC) approach. In this project, we have developed a stand-alone iTDS (Kong et al, 2018) by improving the wireless communication from a highly variable environment inside the human body (the intraoral space), and evaluating its performance compared to the eTDS, which has been developed in the form of a wireless headset and clinically tested with NIH support. We are now trying to go one step further and convert the eTDS to a multimodal TDS (mTDS) to capture any remaining ability of the end user and effectively direct them towards the target devices that are necessary in vocational and recreational daily activities, such as computers, smartphones, TV, etc. Our advanced SSP algorithm can discriminate between seven distinct tongue positions that are user-defined in real time and also eliminate external sources of interference, such as the earth?s magnetic field. We have explored antennas and their radiation patters to find the most suitable radiation option to establish robust communication between an intraoral device and the outside world (Kong et al, 2018). We have also studied the physics of magnetic field around a dipole and identified the best numerical approaches to solve the inverse problem in order to localize the position of the magnetic tracer from the data acquired by an array of magnetic sensors. As a result of these advancements, the iTDS is one of the very few assistive technologies that can adapt to the users? varied and changing abilities, preferences, and lifestyles, which is expected to address one of the major issues that result in AT abandonment among those individuals.</p> <p>We have developed a wireless, wearable device that for the first time can take advantage of the tongue motion as a human motor output without interfering with its other natural roles in speech and ingestion. This is a new mechanism to indirectly interface with the human brain, and its key advantage is being non-invasive, while not suffering from extremely limited bandwidth and external interferences like EEG-based BCIs. The results of a dual center clinical trial on the usability of the eTDS in comparison with a traditional ATs have been presented in the Journal of Science Translational Medicine (Kim et al, 2013).&nbsp; We have started to explore the human factors of the tongue motion. We have been able to compare the able-bodied human performance when accessing computers using their fingers via keyboard and when accessing computers using their tongue via Tongue Drive System. The results have been published in the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (Yousefi et al., 2011) and (Yousefi et al., 2012). In addition, we have explored the use of tongue motion to substitute a joystick function as a proportional controller in navigating powered wheelchairs more efficiently and naturally. However, due to the complex nonlinear relationship between magnetic field and the position of the magnetic tracer, more work is needed to achieve a smooth controller that is not too computationally expensive for a wireless and wearable AT. We are exploring potential applications of the TDS in post-stroke rehabilitation. Studies of neuroplasticity indicate that areas of the brain not injured by stroke are able to reorganize neural pathways when actively engaged. We are combining the TDS with a robotic hand therapy device, called the Hand-Mentor, to determine the effects of the wearable TDS paired with the Hand Mentor therapeutic robot (TDS-HM) and KinArm (TDS-KA) on improving upper extremity motor functions in stroke survivors with severe hemiparesis.
