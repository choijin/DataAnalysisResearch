<AbstractNarration>The "Rocky Mountain Summer School 2012: Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Epidemiology," will be held at the University of Wyoming in Laramie during June 11-22, 2012.  This summer school brings together students from diverse backgrounds in ecology, epidemiology, and mathematical sciences, and provides focused training in mathematical modeling at the interface between life sciences and mathematical sciences. Close daily interactions with a group of leading scientists through class lectures, guided hands-on experience and independent group projects will not only enable trainees to learn the language and basic skills for effective cross-discipline communication and collaboration in critical emerging fields, but will also uniquely position trainees to advance their career goals in an increasingly interdisciplinary scientific community. This summer school also enhances local interactions by bringing together mathematics, life sciences, and the new supercomputing center at the University of Wyoming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the summer school is to provide effective training for collaborative research in ecology and epidemiology using mathematical modeling and qualitative analysis. Our goal is to educate students of mathematics and statistics to address issues of great importance in ecology and epidemiology, and to educate biologists as to why and how mathematical and statistical techniques and tools are useful. Students in the mathematical and biological sciences will learn how to communicate with one another, preparing them not only to build models in ecology and epidemiology, but also to be ambassadors capable of teaching others how to cross the boundaries between biology and mathematics. It is also hoped that students brought together in this intense learning environment will develop future collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
