<AbstractNarration>At every meal, thousands of species of plant-eating mammals confront the possibility of being poisoned by the natural toxins produced by their food. The generalized foraging habit of mammalian herbivores, eating many different plant species on a daily basis, is thought to result from limitations of their liver enzymes. Generalists are hypothesized to have a "jack of all trades" style of detoxification system that consists of liver enzymes able to metabolize a wide array of plant toxins but with low catalytic efficiency. In contrast, specialists are thought to have detoxification enzymes with enhanced efficiency towards a restricted number of toxins. This concept of biochemical tradeoffs with respect to dietary specialization has essentially become dogma without any experimental support. This research will capitalize on the extensive knowledge of mammalian detoxification enzymes gained from studies of drug metabolism in model species and humans, as well as on the availability of a superlative wild rodent model of mammalian herbivory. The long-term objective is to determine how dietary exposure to plant toxins has shaped the mammalian detoxification system through a focused study of liver enzymes in the cytochrome P450 subfamily 2B (CYP2B) in herbivorous woodrats (Neotoma). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of this collaborative research are: &lt;br/&gt;1.) Characterize the CYP2B enzymes in woodrats at the amino acid level.  &lt;br/&gt;2.) Use new metabolomic approaches to identify key P450 substrates in diets of woodrats and compare metabolism of plant toxins by woodrat CYP2B enzymes.  &lt;br/&gt;3.) Conduct structure-function analyses using site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray crystallography of woodrat CYP2B enzymes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will address a longstanding hypothesis by drawing upon cutting-edge biochemical and structural biology approaches to generate the first detailed examination of CYP2B enzymes of wild herbivores, identify substrates, and compare enzyme function. The ultimate goal is to solve the crystal structures of woodrat enzymes in complex with plant toxins. Currently, knowledge of detoxification enzymes of mammals is rudimentary. The work has the potential to contribute to the understanding of drug metabolism in humans given preliminary data of these investigators on woodrat enzymes. In addition, woodrats are nature's historians; their behavior of storing food has facilitated an understanding of the natural changes that have taken place in the desert southwest over the last 35,000 years. An interactive display about the ecology of woodrats and their importance to society will be developed at the Utah Museum of Natural History. The PIs will mentor a new generation of trainees (high school students through postdoctoral fellows) in interdisciplinary research. This award is co-funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At every meal, thousands of species of plant-eating mammals confront the possibility of being poisoned by the natural toxins produced by their food, plants. The generalized foraging habit, i.e., eating many plant species on a daily basis, of mammalian herbivores is thought to result from limitations of their liver enzymes. Generalists are proposed to have a "jack of all trades" style of detoxification system containing liver enzymes with low catalytic efficiency able to metabolize a wide array of plant toxins. In contrast, specialists are proposed to have detoxification enzymes with enhanced efficiency towards a restricted number of toxins. This concept of biochemical tradeoffs with respect to dietary specialization has essentially become dogma in the field without any experimental evidence supporting it. Our research capitalized on the extensive knowledge of mammalian detoxification enzymes from studies of drug metabolism in model species and humans and on the availability of a superlative wild rodent model, the woodrat, of mammalian herbivory. The long-term objective is to determine how dietary exposure to plant toxins has shaped the mammalian detoxification system through a focused study on liver enzymes in the cytochrome P450 subfamily 2B (CYP2B) in herbivorous woodrats.  In this project, we characterized the CYP2B enzymes at the amino acid level in a generalist and specialist woodrat, as well as a specialist vole.  We found that the amino acid sequences of these species differed in such a way to confer functional differences in the CYP2B enzymes.  That is, the amino acid substitutions were at key locations that could change the function of the enzyme. Using a quantitative Western blot, we measured the amount of the CYP2B enzyme in these species on different diets, and found that the specialist woodrat induced CYP2B to the greatest extent when feeding on its natural diet of 100% juniper, which is rich in a class of toxins known as terpenes (aka turpentine).  We also quantified the number of CYP2B genes using q-PCR and found that the specialists have more CYP2B genes than the generalists.  Taken together, these differences in CYP2B may explain the how species like Stephen?s woodrat and the red-tree vole are able to survive on a diet levels of terpenes that are toxic to most other mammals.  The work contributes to our understanding of drug metabolism and detoxification enzymes, and advances our knowledge of how mammals can survive on toxic diets.Several students and postdocs were trained in interdisciplinary scientific research during this project.  The work was broadly disseminated at numerous scientific conferences.  It is profiled in 10 peer-reviewed publications, three of which were featured on the cover on the journal.  The research was made generally available to the public through media coverage.           Last Modified: 07/09/2018       Submitted by: M. Denise Dearing]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
