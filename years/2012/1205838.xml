<AbstractNarration>Investigation of molecular phenomena at cold and ultracold temperatures has become a major area of research in atomic, molecular and optical physics in recent years. This award supports theoretical investigations of a variety of atom-diatom chemical reactions and molecule-molecule collisions at cold and ultracold temperatures. Barrierless chemical reactions involving alkali metal and non-alkali metal atom systems as well as tunneling dominated reactions will be investigated.  The research will shed insights into novel energy transfer mechanisms in molecular collisions in the extreme quantum limit and explore how van der Waals interaction potentials in the reactant/product channels may influence reactivity at ultralow temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will provide improved understanding of chemical reactivity at temperatures close to absolute zero and may reveal new pathways for control of chemical reaction dynamics. Computational algorithms developed during the course of this research could also be applied to describe molecular processes in diverse environments ranging from ultracold molecules to atmospheric chemistry as well as astrophysics and plasma fusion reactors.  Research performed with this award will also contribute to future workforce development in Science and Technology at a time when the overall interest in Science and Engineering is on the decline in the United States.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to explore how molecules interact, exchange energy, and undergo chemical transformations at temperatures close to absolute zero.  Atomic and molecular samples are routinely created in many laboratories in the United States and elsewhere with temperatures in the milli-Kelvin (referred to as "cold") and micro-Kelvin (referred to as "ultracold") regimes. Ultracold trapped molecules, in particular polar molecules, are of considerable interest because their interactions can be controlled by an external electric field due to their dipole moment. They present exciting opportunities for precision measurements (because motional effects are almost eliminated allowing high-resolution spectroscopic observations), quantum information and quantum computing applications, and quantum simulation of many-body interactions mediated by dipolar forces.

This is a computationally and mathematically challenging problem because it requires solution of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation including all relevant degrees of freedom (rotation, vibration, translation, spin, etc.). No standard computational codes exist to describe such processes and an important goal of this project is to develop and implement efficient and accurate methods to study molecular processes and chemistry in the ultimate quantum regime.  A key accomplishment of this project is the development of a hybrid method that combines quantum close-coupling (CC) and the multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT).
