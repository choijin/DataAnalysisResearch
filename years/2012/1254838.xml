<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:The objective of this CAREER proposal is to resolve some of the significant problems currently limiting microwave biomedical radar in an innovative approach equipped with adaptive circuits and sensor fusion. A ?smart? portable biomedical radar sensor will be devised for pervasive motion-adaptive health care by monitoring the important physiological motion of human beings. The proposed approach is founded on a hybrid of radar and camera solutions, enabled by novel agile RF/analog circuits and demodulation algorithms. The hand-in-hand revolution of hardware and algorithms enables an adaptive radar architecture that can dynamically tune multiple operation points to combat clutter generated DC drift and the associated signal distortion. Fusion with a portable camera will ensure effective noise and interference removal, which would be otherwise impossible to do using multiple radars only. Furthermore, a CMOS smart-radar-on-chip solution will be conceived to demonstrate the feasibility of truly portable biomedical radar devices that could be as popular as an iPhone. The impact will be embodied as a revolution in human life style and quality. Software configurability will be a driving force in this effort to revolutionize the capability of radar systems to achieve being ?smart?. The proposed research bridges the fields of biomedical engineering, microwave engineering, embedded systems, and radar signal processing. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:The proposed smart radar sensor system will have broad impacts on health care solutions to benefit the long-term U.S. healthcare program. If successful, this research can be directly used for the monitoring and treatment of sleep apnea and sudden infant death syndrome. It can outperform other technologies in motion-adaptive tumor tracking during cancer radiotherapy in many anatomic sites. When configured as a nonlinear vibrometer, the radar will also advance approaches to monitoring rotating and reciprocating machinery in the transportation and manufacturing industries. This program will provide a thorough understanding of the capability and limitations of continuous wave radar sensors for short-range applications, which is not only valuable to the scientific community, but also beneficial to education in general. The studies involved in this research are at the crossroads of engineering and health care disciplines, and will enable unique educational opportunities that are often missing in traditional engineering curriculums. The program will provide the opportunity to strengthen electrical and computer skills of health care professionals.</AbstractNarration>
