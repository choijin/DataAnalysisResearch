<AbstractNarration>The most successful model of the universe involves a period of immense expansion during the first small fraction of a second following the Big Bang.  This "phase-change" in the early universe explains a number of key observations, including the extreme flatness of the universe, the very similar properties of causally unrelated regions of the observable universe, and the lack of magnetic monopoles.  An important prediction of inflation is the "handedness" of polarization imprinted by gravitational waves that are thought to have existed at the time of the last photon scattering.  Searching for this "B-mode" polarization signal is a fundamental test of inflation, diagnostic of the energy scale over which the phase change operated, and one of the key science themes identified for the next decade by the ASTRO2010 survey New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Adrian Lee of the University of California Berkeley and collaborators elsewhere within the U.S. as well as in Canada, United Kingdom, and Japan plan an experiment to detect and explore for the first time the B-mode polarization using a dedicated radio antenna high on the Atacama Plateau in Chile and a state-of-the-art 7,588 pixel bolometer array to map the sky at the dual frequencies of 150 and 220 GHz with higher sensitivity and an order of magnitude faster than current experiments.  The project, POLARBEAR-2, is very well motivated scientifically and equally well justified on a technical and management footing by the pilot project POLARBEAR-1, now complete and obtaining initial data at the Chilean site.  Technical developments made through the project will be important at other wavelength regions of astronomical detection, including the sub-mm.  Postdoctoral and student involvement is included in important elements of the development and testing, continuing the strong tradition of training in the hardware and techniques of radio astronomy at U.C. Berkeley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for the development of the POLARBEAR-2 project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this ATI-funded project was to build a next-generation bolometric receiver for the POLARBEAR CMB polarization experiment.  This receiver will have a factor of ten higher mapping speed than the existing POLARBEAR-1 receiver.  The receiver has the following innovative features:  A 7,588 bolometer focal plane with dual-frequency (150/220 GHz), dual-polarization pixels that are based on a planar log-period antenna with more than two octaves of bandwidth.  The design is expandable, and we have tested pixels with up to seven bands. Wide-field refractive reimaging optics that give a 4-degree wide field-of-view while creating a cold aperture stop for low sidelobe response and high mapping speed.      POLARBEAR-2 is developing a number of technologies that are critical for next-generation deep sky surveys hoping to measure the polarization in the CMB. Our multichroic detector arrays allow us to more efficiently use the very limited and expensive focal plane area in order to both achieve unprecedented mapping speeds and to gain control over systematics and foregrounds. In tandem with the detector technologies, the development of low loss cryogenic optics and high-multiplex factor readout electronics will be necessary for future experiments.   The technologies that we are developing can have an impact on instrumental design over a wide frequency range from the far-infrared to the radio. The detector arrays that we are developing could be adapted for a wide range of wavelengths by other research groups.    Berkeley was responsible for detector fabrication and readout development.  In the first year, two rounds of test arrays were built with the goal of optimizing the detector properties.  Starting at the end of the first year, the first observation quality arrays were produced, and they were through year 2.  Detector testing was done at all three of the U.S. institutions.  UCSD made spectral measurements of the bands to assess bandwidth and placement.  Colorado and Berkeley worked on dark bolometer tests of saturation power and noise and optical beam map measurements.
