<AbstractNarration>Complex network theory has proved to be a versatile framework to represent and analyze relational data in many disciplines including the social sciences, biology and information systems. One particular application that has benefited from these developments is cognitive neuroscience. Contemporary neuroimaging techniques provide neural recordings with increasing spatial and temporal resolution yielding rich multichannel datasets that can be exploited for detailed description of functional connectivity patterns in the brain. Recent research provides evidence that neural integration across various spatial and temporal scales plays an important role in a wide range of cognitive and executive processes as well as in the manifestation of neural diseases and psychopathologies. The current characterizations of functional brain networks are limited to global and static measures that quantify average activity across subjects, brain regions and time. This research addresses this problem by developing a signal processing framework to study the time-varying nature of the functional brain networks based on multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) data for a better understanding of cognitive control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops three major approaches to study the dynamic nature of functional connectivity in the brain. First, time-varying measures of synchrony along with statistical hypothesis testing are implemented to construct sparse weighted graphs across time and frequency.  Second, hierarchical multiple subject clustering algorithms are developed with information theoretic criteria to identify time-varying community structure. Third, a statistical signal processing framework is developed to summarize dynamic network activity with a few representative networks and to identify transient and stationary activity. Finally, this research is applied to the study of cognitive control for identifying the pathways that control cognition and perception, and in understanding the basic network causes of psychopathologies.</AbstractNarration>

These measures are derived from complex time-frequency distributions and have been implemented to quantify the connectivity between different brain regions. Once pairwise connectivity values are computed at each time and frequency point, they are used to construct weighted connectivity networks from neuroimaging data. These networks are then sparsified through statistical testing.</p> <p>2) Development of a hierarchical consensus spectral clustering algorithm for clustering networks across multiple subjects, referred to as the Fiedler Consensus Clustering Algorithm (FCCA). Information-theoretic metrics of completeness and homogeneity are developed to determine the optimal number of clusters. This clustering algorithm has been shown to be robust to outliers, noise in the data and computationally efficient.</p> <p>3) Development of a tensor based statistical framework for tracking time-varying networks. A two-staged algorithm to first identify the change points in the time-varying networks and then to summarize the networks within the detected change points has been developed. The first stage of the algorithm develops a low-rank tensor approximation to connectivity networks at each time and uses a subspace distance to determine the change points in the network topology. The second stage focuses on tensor projection to obtain data reduction.</p> <p>4) Application of the developed methods to functional connectivity networks constructed from a study of cognitive control in the brain. Connections<br />are largest among medial and lateral frontal regions<br />in the error-related negativity (ERN) network state relative to the other network states, consistent with engagement of these regions during the<br />ERN. While some left-lateralized parietal regions<br />are functionally connected to the frontal regions during the<br />ERN window, a larger central and right lateralized parietal<br />cluster is deactivated during increases in frontal activity. This<br />is consistent with a functional state dominated by frontal and<br />lateral-frontal regions. The pattern for the network state<br />prior to the ERN window contains a similar<br />structure, with a difference being that,&nbsp; the density of connections among frontal regions is decreased while connections among parietal regions is<br />increased.</p> <p>Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this project are:</p> <p>1) Train the next generation of researchers in the interdisciplinary area of computational neuroscience. Two graduate students and one undergraduate student have been supported by this grant. These students were actively involved in the data analysis, writing and reporting the results.</p> <p>2) The methods developed as part of this project were applied on electroencephalogram (EEG) data in collaboration with researchers from Psychology and Radiology. These methods have been applied to different data sets&nbsp; in cognitive control EEG and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/22/2016<br>      Modified by: Selin&nbsp;Aviyente</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1218377/1218377_10208609_1479834912265_Figures-combined-v2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1218377/1218377_10208609_1479834912265_Figures-combined-v2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Network States for ERN"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1218377/1218377_10208609_1479834912265_Figures-combined-v2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Network States for ERN"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(a) Waveform for error trials across all subjects; (b) The subspace distances betweenthe projection operators at consecutive time points,  where red lines mark the identified change points; (c) The most significant edges for the different time intervals</div> <div class="imageCredit">Edward Bernat</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Selin&nbsp;Aviyente</div> <div class="imageTitle">Network States for ERN</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1218377/1218377_10208609_1479834497110_rev_change_ch--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1218377/1218377_10208609_1479834497110_rev_change_ch--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Dynamic Functional Connectivity Network Tracking"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1218377/1218377_10208609_1479834497110_rev_change_ch--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Dynamic Functional Connectivity Network Tracking"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Change Point Detection from Dynamic Functional Connectivity Networks Through Low-Rank Tensor Approximation</div> <div class="imageCredit">Arash Golibagh Mahyari</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Selin&nbsp;Aviyente</div> <div class="imageTitle">Dynamic Functional Connectivity Network Tracking</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1218377/1218377_10208609_1479834652354_sum_ch--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1218377/1218377_10208609_1479834652354_sum_ch--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Network State Summarization"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1218377/1218377_10208609_1479834652354_sum_ch--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Network State Summarization"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dynamic Functional Connectivity Network State Summarization Through Tensor Projection</div> <div class="imageCredit">Arash Golibagh Mahyari</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Selin&nbsp;Aviyente</div> <div class="imageTitle">Network State Summarization</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1218377/1218377_10208609_1479834332163_ern-crn-clusters--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1218377/1218377_10208609_1479834332163_ern-crn-clusters--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Brain Network Clustering"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1218377/1218377_10208609_1479834332163_ern-crn-clusters--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Brain Network Clustering"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cluster Structure for Error-Related Negativity (5 clusters) and Correct-Related Negativity (4 clusters)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alp Ozdemir</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Selin&nbsp;Aviyente</div> <div class="imageTitle">Brain Network Clustering</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
