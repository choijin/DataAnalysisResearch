<AbstractNarration>The shift to parallel computing, including multi-core processors, cloud computing, and heterogeneous systems, has induced a workforce development crisis for computer science (CS) education.  This project addresses how crowded CS curricula, traditionally structured around sequential (non-parallel) computing, can be changed to effectively incorporate the rapidly-evolving body of parallelism knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saint Olaf College, Calvin College and Macalester College are demonstrating how colleges and universities can insert short (one- to three-day) teaching modules on parallel computing into their courses through self-contained units that present conceptual principles and reinforce them by hands-on experience and follow-up exercises.  New modules that incorporate emerging curricular recommendations, relevant applications to other fields, and parallel design patterns are under development. Parallelism is infused incrementally throughout the CS curriculum. Having developed this modular strategy in a predecessor CCLI Type I grant, this project demonstrates the scalability of this approach to other universities and colleges by targeting two geographical regions with workshops and follow-up adopter support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other project activities reward participants for creating new modules, promote the national dissemination of this modular approach through conference workshops and presentations, and expand existing synergistic partnerships between CSinParallel.org and related efforts in industry, academia, and professional organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The CSinParallel project seeks to address the emerging challenges and opportunities of parallel and distributed computing (PDC) in computer science (CS) undergraduate education.  For example, nearly all computers and mobile devices now incorporate a form of parallel computing called multi-core hardware, in which each computing unit contains multiple circuits for carrying out computer instructions simultaneously.  Also, cloud computing is a form of distributed computing, where multiple separate computers interact over a network in order to perform a computation.  PDC has become ubiquitous over the past ten years, but computer science curricula traditionally focused on single-core computations on a single computer.  CSinParallel provides learning strategies for incrementally adding PDC to multiple courses throughout a college?s  undergraduate CS curriculum, in order to prepare the computing workforce for the conceptual principles, technical considerations, and potential benefits of the parallel and distributed computing that is now available everywhere.   CSinParallel provides brief (1-3 class days) modular learning materials that present conceptual principles of PDC reinforced through hands-on experience, which modules are self-contained and can be used flexibly in wide-ranging curricular contexts.  These materials can be taught on many available PDC computing platforms, and can be quickly adapted for emerging developments in PDC hardware and software, as well as for new strategies for delivering PDC education. This project produced new modular teaching materials that focus on parallel programming patterns, which constitute a framework of effective and reusable problem-solving strategies discovered and developed in industry, and which provide a head-start for CS undergraduates creating PDC applications, taking advantage of the wisdom of industry experience.  Other new modules focus on exemplar applications that feature realistic uses of PDC in other fields, which provide motivation for learning about PDC, engage students with applications that make a difference in people?s lives, illustrate issues that arise when concepts and technologies meet actual applications, and serve as examples for encountering and comparing multiple PDC technologies.
