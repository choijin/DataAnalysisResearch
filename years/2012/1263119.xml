<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) Site led by Professors David Paul and Julie Stenken both at the University of Arkansas. The REU Program entitled "Encouraging Students in Science" will motivate a diverse group of students to pursue careers in scientific research.  The nine participants will be integrated into different research groups and activities are planned to promote student independence and to develop professional skills and judgment during the ten week summer program.  Each participant will be given the opportunity to present his/her research at a meeting within the department, and to write up a summary of their work in a journal format that will be compiled for distribution to their home institution. The participants will be provided an experience which will not only enable them to obtain a realistic view of modern chemical research, but will also expose them to an environment indicative of what they can expect in graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will help to prepare young scientists for global competition in science and innovation. The nine participants will be sophomore or junior undergraduate students majoring in chemistry or biochemistry.  Special efforts will be made to recruit women and minority groups traditionally underrepresented among professional chemists. The University of Arkansas Fayetteville, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry has established procedures that will assure success in the recruitment of students from these groups. This aspect of the recruitment plan will utilize the University's infrastructure in minority recruiting.  Previously, these methods have been successful by recruiting into the program 54% women and 33% underrepresented minorities (African American or Native American). The majority of the previous REU participants have continued their studies post baccalaureate in chemistry or biochemistry, with many of the participants attaining positions of responsibility in the chemical industry, or as graduate students at Ph.D.-granting academic institutions.</AbstractNarration>
