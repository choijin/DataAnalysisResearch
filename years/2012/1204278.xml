<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tropical geometry has established itself as an important new field bridging algebraic geometry and combinatorics, with important connections to areas as diverse as geometric group theory, nonarchimedean analytic geometry, operations research, and phylogenetics. Tropical geometry can be regarded as a combinatorial shadow of algebraic geometry: given a solution set to a system of polynomials in n variables, one can associate to it a tropical variety, which takes the form of a polyhedral subset of R^n. Tropical varieties remember information about the classical varieties they came from. Thus, they open up algebro-geometric problems to a combinatorial toolkit. This correspondence is just the tip of the iceberg as far as applications of tropical geometry are concerned.  My postdoctoral fellowship resulted in 8 publications/preprints concerning tropical geometry and related topics: tropical curves and their moduli spaces, determinantal and permanental varieties, Brill Noether theory, and related combinatorics.  Funding enabled me to travel to conferences and collaborate with mathematicians across the country.  I also taught four courses during my postdoc including a graduate topics course in tropical geometry.  Other broader impacts from the award included giving many talks, supervising two undergraduates, and organizing various conferences and seminars and participating as a teaching assistant in two graduate summer schools.
