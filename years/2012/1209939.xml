<AbstractNarration>This action funds Lu Yao of University of Chicago to conduct a research project, entitled "Chinese fossils and the evolution of Old World Monkeys," during the summer of 2012 at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, China.  The host scientist is Dr. Wei Dong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in morphological analyses of the jaws and teeth of early Pleistocene Old World Monkey fossils from the Tuozidong site in China in order to gain new insights into adaptive radiation of the genus Macaca and evolution of Old World monkeys in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Chinese Fossils and the Evolution of Old World Monkeys      Introduction. Primates have long been a major focus in the field of evolutionary biology, but progress has been hindered by gaps in the fossil record. Even the fossils that are available are often fragmentary because of the fragile nature of the skeleton in small- to medium-sized mammals. So the discovery and analysis of new primate fossils is essential for a better understanding of the origins of modern primates. For this study, I focused on an Old World monkey (family Cercopithecidae) fossil from the early Pleistocene because it will enlighten us about the phylogeny of this group.   Relatively recently, a rich assemblage of mammal fossils has been discovered at the Tuozidong site in eastern China, notably including carnivores and artiodactyls8,9. This site is significant because it constitutes a biostratigraphic sequence with the presence of an array of fossil taxa. In particular, fossil Old World monkeys have been recovered at the site dating to around two million years ago, including a right upper jaw of Macaca.  Research Methods/Results. I implemented my research with supervision from Dr. Wei Dong at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Guided by his expertise, along with the help of Yemao Hou and Dr. Zhikun Gai, I was able to learn how to produce a 3D reconstruction of a fossil macaque right upper jaw that included 3 molars and 2 premolars. In fact, we fused my American techniques using the Adobe Photoshop and VGStudioMAX packages with the Chinese method using Amira.   When I arrived in China, Dr. Dong and his colleagues had already conducted micro-CT scanning of an early Pleistocene maxillary fragment (upper jaw) of Macaca from the Tuozidong site using a state-of-the-art high-resolution CT tomography imaging device located at the Key Laboratory of Evolutionary Systematics of Vertebrates. This device permits non-destructive generation of a micro-focus X-ray image of a specimen. Before the fossil itself can be subjected to virtual examination, its anatomical components must be isolated from the surrounding matrix. To perform this task, I first remove the matrix from the scanned fossil to isolate the enamel, dentine and cavities of the teeth using Adobe Photoshop. There were approximately 1800 images for this section of the upper, jaw, and I cut it down to just 900 by taking only the odd slices. This allows me to maintain a high resolution but cut down the number of slices I have to work on (I have to perform the isolation three times for each section of the teeth, giving a grand total of 2700 slices).   Then using VGStudioMAX, I loaded in the CT slices to form the 3D image of the upper jawÆs teeth. In addition, my colleagues taught me how to load the CT slices into another 3D imaging program called Amira. I also learned how to manipulate the 3D figure to get very vivid colors of the different teeth parts (Figure 1).   Some morphological aspects of the 3D reconstruction, volume and surface area, were measured (Table 1) to refine the classification of the specimen and to explore its significance with respect to evolution of Old World monkeys. More measurements, such as the angles of the space between the cavities, still need to be taken in order to make a definite conclusion. In addition, we need more fossil macaque 3D reconstructions for comparison but these fossils takes a long time to reconstruct so we will have to wait to do so.           Visits. In addition, I was able to visit two paleontological sites near Nanjing along with the Nanjing Provincial Museum in order to better understand Old World monkey evolution through the analysis of fossils. The first site was at Tuozidong, which is located at Tangshan about 30 km east of downtown Nanjing. The second site was where Nanjing Man was discovered, at Yuanrendong. What surprised me was the state of Yuanrendong. I was expecting it to be another som...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
