<AbstractNarration>The PI is inspired by some ambitious rigidity conjectures, such as (1) the Lorentzian Lichnerowicz Conjecture and its generalizations; (2) an "Open-Dense" Conjecture for certain geometric structures; and (3) the Smooth Cannon Conjecture.  The PI and her collaborators have developed new dynamical techniques in the setting of Cartan geometries that have been quite effective toward proving results supporting conjectures (1) and (2).  Recent results and some current work of the PI, however, indicate that these conjectures do not hold in the broad generality originally speculated.  For many of these questions, Lorentzian manifolds seem to be the borderline cases.  The following additional question has an affirmative answer in the Lorentzian case, but is open in higher signatures: (4) is a compact, flat, pseudo-Riemannian manifold always complete?  The PI's plan is to work towards settling conjectures (1)-(4), by proof or counterexample.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI works in pseudo-Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry, an area of mathematics that that underlies general relativity and the physics of spacetime.  Isometries or conformal transformations of Lorentzian manifolds correspond to conservation laws in physics, and they feature in most models of spacetime. Conjectures (1) and (2) above arise from an ambitious program, initiated by Zimmer and Gromov in the 1980s, to classify group actions on manifolds preserving differential-geometric structures.  Conjecture (3) appears in Gromov's fundamental work on delta-hyperbolic groups, and (4) is an important case of the Markus Conjecture on flat affine manifolds. The educational component of the project comprises (a) further development of writing workshops for DC area math graduate students; (b) involving undergraduates in summer research projects related to topic (2) above; and (c) advising graduate and undergraduate students in the Directed Reading Program at the University of Maryland.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was primarily concerned with unsolved problems about symmetries of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.  These include Lorentzian manifolds, the setting for General Relativity.  At the time of the proposal, examples has just been discovered showing that the Lichnerowicz Conjecture in conformal geometry, which led to the spectacular 1971 Ferrand-Obata Theorem for Riemannian metrics, does not hold for other kinds of metrics.  The most significant result of the project in this direction is the PI’s 2019 preprint with V. Pecastaing proving the Lorentzian Lichnerowicz Conjecture (LLC) for Lorentzian manifolds with finite fundamental group &ndash; for example, for spheres of any dimension &ndash; provided they are real-analytic.  The proof of this result required new arguments that will likely be useful toward further progress on the LLC.  It also builds on previous work of the PI and collaborators, particularly on local normal forms, which convert arbitrary conformal vector fields to explicit, standard forms.    In the project period, the author published additional such normal forms results, for vector fields preserving a wide family of geometric structures.  The PI and K. Neusser proved that vector fields preserving a 1-graded parabolic geometry, assuming it is sufficiently differentiable, are in many cases determined by their first derivatives at a point, unless the structure is flat.  For one such case, of (2,n)-almost Grassmannian structures, also known as Segr&egrave; structures, the PI and A. Cap constructed an example that is only once differentiable and does not satisfy the previous conclusion.  The construction is based on a novel implementation of a deformation procedure, which has the potential to lead to further interesting examples.  The PI proved a normal forms result in the context of hyperbolic dynamics, that a nonuniformly contracting family of differentiable maps can be converted by changes of coordinates to polynomials of a special form, called resonance polynomials.  This paper moreover provides differential-geometric interpretation of the normal forms, which have subsequently been applied to help obtain rank rigidity results in differential geometry.   With C. Frances, the PI proved a result on the topology of transformation groups of arbitrary parabolic geometries, greatly generalizing previous results for particular structures that were won by other, often more analytic, means.  Early in the project, the PI obtained, together with S. Dumitrescu, a result on non-existence of three-dimensional, real-analytic, quasihomogeneous Lorentzian manifolds &ndash; meaning roughly that highly symmetric, three-dimensional Lorentzian spaces cannot be real-analytically embedded in larger three-dimensional Lorentzian spaces.  The question whether such containment can occur without real-analyticity was the basis for a summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project run by the PI, which resulted in new understanding of the question and valuable computational tools for future study.  The PI successfully collaborated in the project period with postdoctoral researchers Neusser and Pecastaing; supported Ph.D. students as RAs; and ran several workshops for graduate students on mathematical expository writing and on writing postdoctoral and fellowship applications.  The PI delivered 8 colloquiua, 4 invited plenary talks, and 2 general audience mathematics talks in the project period.  The PI co-organized 4 mathematics conferences.  The PI served as faculty advisor to the Directed Reading Program at the University of Maryland and supported undergraduate participation in the program, in which they are paired with volunteer graduate student mentors for semester-long independent study projects.
