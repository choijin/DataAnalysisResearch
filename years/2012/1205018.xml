<AbstractNarration>This project will further understanding of ocean-ice-atmosphere interaction around the Jakobshavn Isbrae and Disko Bay region of west Greenland, with a particular focus on the role of sea surface temperature and sea ice variability in modulating past outlet glacier behavior and ice sheet/cap mass balance (snowfall and melt) over the past two centuries.  The PIs will reconstruct past environmental conditions in the Disko and Baffin Bay region based on new glaciochemical and stratigraphic records from three 100-m deep ice cores, several firn cores, and geophysical studies from three sites surrounding Disko Bay.  Their field activities will commence in 2013 with the primary ice coring activity in 2014 and lab and computation work following to derive climate reconstructions from the cores.  The results will complement recent glaciological studies of regional ice dynamic behavior, as well as recent paleoceanographic and glacial geologic reconstructions of conditions from this area and era.  Das and Frey will each supervise a full-time PhD student, and Evans will supervise undergraduate research assistants and senior theses.  A high school science teacher will also participate in the field work and interact with students at his school in Massachusetts as well as from the ice.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Recent changes, including the dramatic speedups of several large outlet glaciers, and increased rates of surface melting, have increased Greenland&rsquo;s contribution to sea-level rise from near zero in the 1990s to a large negative imbalance today. Poor knowledge of the processes driving these changes is one of the main limitations on prediction of future ice sheet contributions to sea level rise. An increasing number of observations point towards the influence of coupled ocean-ice-atmospheric processes in modulating ice sheet mass balance and outlet glacier behavior, but most studies are limited to the past few decades restricting our ability to extrapolate these relationships over longer time periods, given their high inter-annual variability. In this study, we used over 1200 Landsat images spanning all seasons between 1985&ndash;2015 to investigate the behavior of 17 marine-terminating glaciers that outlet into Disko and Uummannaq Bay, West Greenland by manually digitizing over 5000 individual frontal positions. The number of observations allowed for calculation of an annual range in terminus position as an estimate of seasonal variability. Using breakpoint algorithms, we were able to determine the occurrence of change points (trend transitions) in terminus retreat (advance) behavior between 2000&ndash;2015. We found 15 of 17 glacier termini retreated an average of 1.2 km over 1985&ndash;2015 with ~80% of this retreat occurring since 2000. Nine of these glaciers also underwent change points in the trends of their terminus positions. During the active change periods of these glaciers, we observed a greater range in seasonal variability and an associated increase in cumulative retreat. The high spatial and temporal resolution of our dataset allows for insights into the seasonal and long-term behavior of West Greenland outlet glaciers and will be particularly useful for future studies such as better defining individual fjord geometry controls, understanding inland propagation of disturbances at the glacier front, and predicting occurrence of future tipping points in terminus behavior.
