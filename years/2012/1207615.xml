<AbstractNarration>This action funds Colin Michael Haynes of the University of California, San Diego to conduct a research project, entitled "Improving damage prediction capability for composite aerospace structures," during the summer of 2012 at the University of Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan.  The host scientist is Professor Nobuo Takeda. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to enable better damage prediction for structural health monitoring of composite aerospace structures.  This objective is being accomplished through ultrasonic guided wave inspection with fiber optic strain sensors coupled with damage prediction models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project was to evaluate a structural health monitoring system for detecting damage in composite bolted joints in aerospace structures.  The overall strategy for monitoring these structures is to use ultrasonic guided waves (a form of "structural sonar") to get information about the progression of damage so that the need for repair can be evaluated reliably and cost-effectively.  In particular, joints made of composite materials were targeted because of their now-widespread use in aerospace structures and the fact that their failure mechanisms are not as well understood as those of traditional materials.  Over the course of this project, several specimens were tested destructively in tension to introduce bolt bearing failure.  Macro-fiber composite sensor-actuators and fiber Bragg grating strain sensors were applied to the specimens to evaluate their effectiveness as sensor systems for monitoring aerospace structures.  Prior to and after each tensile test, ultrasonic guided waves were excited in the material, interacted with the damage, and were received by other sensors.  The results show that damage progression can be monitored by observing the changes in the received signals.  Many parameters relevant to the inspection procedure (such as excitation frequency and the sensor angle relative to the damage direction) were studied to find the optimal choices for this type of damage.  These results will be helpful in designing structural health monitoring systems that are desperately needed by todayÃ†s aerospace industry to provide cheaper, safer, and more reliable inspection techniques for airplanes.  Furthermore, this work took place at the University of Tokyo, which allowed the author a unique opportunity to be immersed in a different culture, experience an academic research environment abroad, exchange ideas with foreign collaborators, and develop valuable relationships.
