<AbstractNarration>This capacity building project is a collaboration between a four year (Lehman college, CUNY) and a two year (CUNY Hostos Community College) college, with the community college as the lead institution.  Other partners include the American Museum of Natural History and the Black Forest Consortium, a mountainous area 50 miles north of New York City maintained as a resource for research and student and teacher training by the institutions within the consortium.  The project is designed to provide a clear pathway to STEM teacher certification from the community college to the four year school with an emphasis on providing chemistry and earth science teachers well prepared to serve students in high needs schools.   The partners are: (a) aligning the curricula of Hostos STEM courses and programs of study with those required for Lehman chemistry and environmental science majors, with a minor in education, to create two joint-degree/dual-admission programs to enable students to attend Hostos and then transition seamlessly to Lehman to complete their bachelor's degree; (b) leveraging existing partnerships with the American Museum of Natural History and the Black Rock Forest station to design summer internships and semester workshops to provide field experiences, teacher preparation, and other research opportunities introducing Hostos students to chemistry and environmental science; (c) creating a bridge program, incorporating an intensive screening process to identify the students most likely to succeed in a Noyce Scholarship program and offering extensive mentoring and advisement to ensure that the selected Hostos students successfully transition to Lehman; (d) devising an effective public relations and recruitment plan to inform potential students about SEED at Hostos, so that STEM majors are made aware of the opportunities for careers in education; (e) designing a set of activities to support teachers during their induction years and (f) working with an evaluator who will design and implement an evaluation plan that will measure the stated objectives and outcomes of Project SEED.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Active Collaborative Advisory Council has been formed and has been continuously producing results aiding the ultimate goal of a speed program launch.  Partnerships with the American Museum of Natural History and the Black Rock Forest Consortium were created, and, as a result, a series of summer internships were drafted to be formalized by the end of the 2015-2016 academic year.  Detailed drafts of joint degree Agreements between Hostos CC and Lehman College have been prepared, outlining program details, different paths toward graduation, course requirements for students pursuing teacher certification, as well as those who might decide to pursue other careers in Chemistry or Environmental Science.  The change in terminology from Environmental Science to Earth Science, as well as the minor course adjustments, needed to comply with teacher certification, are reflected in these agreements.  The workshops/lessons/ presentations were started  in fall 2015 and spring 2016 in Hostos CC in Chemistry, Environmental Science and Biology.  Twelve faculty workshops during the 2012 - 2016 Academic Years were developed and facilitated.   SEED Website completely developed, fully operated, repeatedly updated; website is detailed, informative and interactive.  The full deployment of the project?s Website meant to inform and encourage further discussions among the SEED Advisory Council members, as well as raising awareness of the structure and goals of the Project SEED among faculty members who were not directly involved with the initial development of the program.  The design and review of the second half of the two new joint degrees (third and fourth year of courses to be completed at Lehman College) with courses carefully chosen to adequately prepare students for careers in education while building a strong general education foundation consistent with the new CUNY-wide Common Core requirements (The Pathways Initiative). The curriculum also provides the strong, pure scientific knowledge groundwork necessary for the realization of excellence in high school science education.  The creation of a dedicated team of faculty members across different disciplines from both colleges via workshop participation, formal discussions and informal conversations, all of whom strongly believe in the project?s necessity, merit, significant benefits for the students and great potential for success.  Survey was conducted between students of Hostos CC fall 2015 and spring 2016; students from classes CHE 210 (chemistry), CHE 220, CHE 310, CHE 312, ENV 110 (environmental Sciences), PHY 210 (Physics), BIO 120 (biology), BIO 130, BIO 210, BIO 230, BIO 240  participated in survey, total 284 students. For question in survey: "Do you think the new joint-degree program in Science and Education will be interesting for students of Hostos CC" 93% of students answered  positively and only 7% answered negatively or not interesting. Comments in survey were very wide and two of them presented in the report: "This is great, especially since there are so many women in science course at Hostos - we need more women in STEM fields &amp; STEM education. Great idea!; "I think it's a great idea and opportunity for students. It is also a great opportunity for both schools. There is a need for teachers in the city, mostly quality teachers. There is a need for teachers to teach in the city and from the city".          Last Modified: 01/08/2017       Submitted by: Vladimir I Ovtcharenko]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
