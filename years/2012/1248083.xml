<AbstractNarration>This NSF award supports a planning workshop on Innovation in Medical Cyber-Physical Systems.  This activity arises from an interagency exploration of emerging CPS research directions.  The meeting will develop plans for further assessment by the CPS community of biomedical research needs and opportunities.  The meeting and subsequent community-wide assessment are conducted in the context of the interagency High Confidence Software and Systems Coordinating Group.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
