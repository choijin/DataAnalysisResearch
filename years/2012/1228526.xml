<AbstractNarration>Visual working memory is a core cognitive function that allows people to actively maintain and manipulate information about stimuli that are no longer in view. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Frank Tong of Vanderbilt University is investigating how the human visual system actively maintains information about visual features and objects over delay periods of many seconds. This project is evaluating the hypothesis that visually specific content is maintained in working memory as a result of top-down feedback to early visual areas of the brain as well as to higher-level object-selective areas of the brain. The question is to what extent early visual brain areas can retain visually precise information about an actively remembered object. Dr. Tong is developing advanced methods to decode patterns of human brain activity for the purposes of reading out information about what item a person is maintaining in working memory. Experiments are investigating how multiple visual areas represent information about simple visual patterns and complex objects. Additional experiments are for testing whether these working memory representations are robust to visual interference, and whether their contents can be dynamically manipulated and modified based on the goals of the participant. The results are designed to provide new insights into the neural bases of visual working memory, its robustness to interference, and its capacity for flexible manipulation of remembered visual content. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The visual working memory system provides an essential link between immediate perception and higher-level cognitive processes, and is important for mental imagery, vision-based learning, visuospatial planning, and the maintenance of an updated representation of the objects in one's environment. Understanding the neural bases of visual working memory is important for advancing knowledge of human brain function and is also relevant to developing better methods to improve learning in educational settings. Research on visual working memory is also a prerequisite to developing better methods to diagnose individuals with impairments in visual working memory, and it may eventually lead to treatment interventions. The methodological advances from this project are also highly relevant to research on brain-computer interface, and they constitute an advance in the ability to decode specific mental content from patterns of human brain activity.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="DataField11pt-Single">Visual working memory is a core system that allows people to actively maintain information about stimuli that are no longer in view for periods of several seconds. Thus, working memory provides an essential link between immediate perception and higher-level cognitive processes. Individual performance on working memory tasks is highly correlated with measures of fluid intelligence and problem solving ability, so understanding the mechanisms of working memory is critical for understanding the systems that support human learning and intelligence. This project provided a rigorous test of the sensory recruitment hypothesis, namely that visual working memory depends on top-down feedback to the visual cortex to maintain perceptually based information over prolonged delays. Our functional neuroimaging results demonstrated that both spatially specific and feature-specific information about actively remembered items are maintained in the activity patterns of early visual areas. Previous studies of perception have shown that people are much more accurate at discriminating subtle differences in orientation for tilted lines that are closer to vertical or horizontal than for those that are oblique. This project revealed how visual working memory relies on these perceptually based representations, and how the magnitude of errors is more greatly magnified for oblique orientations in working memory. Through computational modeling, it was further demonstrated how the precision and capacity of working memory performance can accurately quantified and predicted, by incorporating these perceptually based representations to calculate an upper limit to the number of items that an individual person can actively maintain. These working memory representations accumulate internal noise over time, leading to a gradual loss of memory precision, though the rate of information loss can be reduced if a particular visual feature or object is attentionally prioritized over other competing items. Studies of working memory for complex objects also demonstrate how memory precision improves with greater visual expertise with a stimulus, but that the capacity of working memory does not increase. As a whole, this project has provided compelling evidence for a more powerful and predictive model of working memory that relies on perceptually based representations, which consist of both feature-specific and spatially specific information that is actively maintained in the early visual cortex. Undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainees received cutting-edge training in advanced computational methods during this project, which is key to advancing STEM initiatives. The results of this project can inform approaches to visual and cognitive learning as well as the design of visual displays for conveying big data. The multivariate approaches for analyzing neuroimaging data also provide useful information for the development of brain-machine interfaces.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/16/2016<br>      Modified by: Frank&nbsp;Tong</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
