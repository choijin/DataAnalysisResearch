<AbstractNarration>This Partnership for Innovation project from Purdue University is aimed at fully enabling the commercial application of Modulation-Assisted Machining in the discrete products sector. By superimposing a low-frequency/small-amplitude modulation on the cutting tool, Modulation-Assisted Machining produces small, discrete chips, while dramatically reducing friction and energy dissipation in machining. The Modulation-Assisted Machining research platform will expand the range of application of this technology from the current stationary drilling configurations (developed and commercialized via prior NSF support) to a wide range of rotating tool applications in drilling, turning, boring, trepanning, and related processes. Benefits include greater than two-fold increases in production rate, and large reductions in tool wear and machining emissions. Equally important, the platform will provide for development of robust methods for effecting power transfer to rotating tools and machines in the discrete products manufacturing sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are higher productivity, improved product quality, greater use of higher performance alloys that cannot be manufactured economically by conventional machining, and major reductions in machining emissions with associated environmental benefits. These are a consequence of enabling the implementation of Modulation-Assisted Machining across high-performance machining applications. The platform will also offer new cost-effective routes for powder materials manufacturing, and improved cutting techniques for orthopedic surgery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are Purdue University (Schools of Industrial, Materials and Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering), M4 Sciences LLC (West Lafayette, IN; Type II small business) and American Micro Products (Batavia, OH; Type I small business), all Knowledge Enhancement Partners; complemented by other partners: Cummins Inc. (Columbus, IN; large business), Seco Tools (Fagersta, Sweden; large business, now part of the Sandvik Corporation), Purdue College of Veterinary Medicine (part of Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN) and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, Rochester Institute of Technology (Rochester, NY; non-profit).</AbstractNarration>

Important consequences are formation of small (controlled) discrete chips that are easily evacuated from the machining zone, and dramatic reduction in severity of machining conditions and energy dissipation, as demonstrated in preliminary experiments.   The technology had been commercialized for "stationary" small hole drilling processes by M4 Sciences LLC, a Purdue-based start-up, based on patents licensed from Purdue University and research supported by the NSF. These stationary systems are machining configurations wherein the MAM system actuating the tool does not rotate, but the component being machined rotates. The commercial system, consisting of the actuating device and controller, is installed as an accessory to machines analogous to a "computer mouse", with minimal changes to the machining equipment. The innovative capability of MAM and M4Sciences-Purdue partnership had been recognized by significant product sales in applications ranging from automotive to biomedical (Fig. 2), an R&amp;D 100 Award and a Small Business Administration (SBA) Tibbetts Award.  Building on this prior research and commercialization, the present partnership involving Purdue University, M4 Sciences LLC and various large and small companies has significantly expanded the capability of modulation-assisted machining  technology by enabling applications in rotating drilling systems ( with live tools).  This has been accomplished by  addressing key research challenges pertaining to power transmission to rotating (MAM) actuator devices, characterization of machining performance of the rotating systems, and detailed quantification of benefits of this technology  to product quality, tool wear, and energy dissipation, building on the preliminary findings.The key outcomes are:  a) Using deep hole drilling as the application platform, a prototype system  was constructed and demonstrated with rotating live tools. Machining  performance tests were successfully conducted with the protoype system  in difficult to machine titanium and nickel alloys,  steels, cast irons and soft metals.  b) A modulation maching testbed was established to obtain critical performance data needed by customers in evaluating and making decisions about this new technology for implementation.  c) The machining system demonstrated significantly better performance than conventional drilling/machining in these metals: upto 4 fold increase in material removal rates, 40-70% reduction in  machining energy, 1-2 orders of magnitude reduction in tool wear, ability to drill metal  alloys that could not otherwise be machined in any practical way, and  better component surface qulaity in terms of surface finish and texture.  The system could also effect novel topographical surface textures, many  of which could be of value for improving fucntional performance of  components.  Various key enabling partnerships have been established with a  number of companies in the discrete products sector encompassing energy  systems, biomedical, metals and tool manufacturers, and oil and gas,  that should in the coming years lead to spread of the MAM technology  prototypes emerging from this PFI-BIC program. These partnerships are now  robust and can be enablers for other technology development...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
