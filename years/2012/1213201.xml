<AbstractNarration>1213201&lt;br/&gt;Zauscher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biointerface Science is an area of research experiencing explosive growth. The 2012 Biointerface Science GRC, organized by Dr. Wolfgang Knoll (Chair) and Dr. Stefan Zauscher (Vice Chair), seeks to capture the excitement of this burgeoning field by a cutting-edge scientific program and roster of distinguished invited speakers and discussion leaders who will present the latest research results in Biointerface Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2012 GRC on Biointerface Science aims at bringing together scientists and engineers that work (and learn) in the diverse fields of physics, chemistry, biology, biotechnology, materials science, diagnostics, medicine, and environmental technologies. By presenting and discussing the latest fundamental research results dealing with the interactions between biomolecules of different chemical nature and origin and surfaces of various materials, this GRC will try to bridge the gap and enhance the intellectual interaction between molecular/cellular biology and the medical disciplines on the one side, and the physical and chemical sciences on the other side.&lt;br/&gt;This cross-disciplinary dialog is expected to enhance the quantitative understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the response of complex macromolecular and/or biological systems when exposed to artificial surfaces and devices. By integrating engineers and materials experts into the discussion, the GRC on Biointerface Science will contribute to the translation of the developed biomolecular concepts into the world of applications, e.g., biomedical devices,and sensors that are urgently needed for diagnostic strategies and new medical treatments of human diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New in 2012 is the Gordon Research Seminar on Biointerface Science, which is a unique forum for graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education, to present and exchange new data and cutting edge ideas related to Biointerface Science. The GRS meeting will immediately precede the GRC. By inviting young scientists and students to the GRC we also hope to engage them in the GRS and to contribute to a paradigm shift in the way we train our young colleagues at the intersection of the natural sciences,medicine and engineering. By providing support for this GRC, the NSF will facilitate the interaction of physical scientists, engineers, biologists and medical scientists in this unique scientific forum that will positively impact the direction of this young field and lead to important advances in the understanding of biointerfacial problems, and the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference organization has a strong commitment to supporting diversity in the sciences.   In the 2012 preliminary program 7 speakers/discussion leaders are women.  There are likely to be many more women/minority attendees selected from among those submitting applications. The organizers will further strive to ensure that women, underrepresented and disabled participants will be offered opportunities to attend the meeting. Attendees will be selected from the applicant pool in order to represent a cross-section of researchers working in this area, and with a view toward expanding the community to include scientists working in related fields. Efforts will be made to represent the gender and racial diversity characteristic of the researchers working in this area. Leading scientists and engineers from companies working in the Biointerface Science area will also be recruited to participate. With the help of this grant and other financial resources, the conference chairs will accept a  number of junior investigators, postdocs and graduate students and offer them registration and travel support (goal of 10 or more from pooled sponsor resources). The supplements will be decided based on a "state,emt of purpose" to attend the conference and financial need and affirmative action metrics.</AbstractNarration>
