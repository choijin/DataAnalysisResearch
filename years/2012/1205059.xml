<AbstractNarration>Del Mar College (DMC), in collaboration with several other institutions including The School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California (USC) is developing a Revising Science Education with Vision (REVISION) program.  The program involves DMC students using more contemporary scientific skills and provides them more practice with methods that develop critical and independent thinking.  Research components embedded within several laboratories based on the Vision and Change concept-based curriculum recommendations are being used to assist student in developing their troubleshooting and problem-solving activities.  Additionally, with the help of the USC Annenberg Innovation Laboratory, the students will be provided with highly engaging curricular materials that use mobile device platforms to encourage participation, learning and faculty/student community building using technologically advanced tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  The program is preparing and training students to be critical thinkers and giving them practice using new and emerging skill sets associated with biotechnology, an important sector in the nation's economy.  By providing research opportunities for students and professional development opportunities for faculty, the program is serving as the cornerstone of contemporary curricula and faculty development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This proposal provides educational and training opportunities for students to be more competitive for biotechnology jobs and be better prepared to enter the workforce or post-baccalaureate degree programs.  Because DMC is a Minority Serving Institution that serves many first-generation college students, additional and more diverse student populations and faculty are benefiting from the learning opportunities provided by the project.</AbstractNarration>

The DMC REVISION Team is a member of the Science Education Alliance (SEA) program that includes the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) National Genomics Research Initiative, a program that integrates both research and education in genomics for undergraduate students or SEA-PHAGES. The DMC Team has observed that the HHMI research program provides a natural alignment with the Vision and Change core concepts and competencies.</p> <p>The DMC REVISION Team has also incorporated two other discovery-based research programs into the bioscience classrooms: Assessing the Prevalence of Antibiotic-Resistance in the Environment (PARE) and the Small World Initiative or Crowdsourcing Antibiotic Discovery (SWI).&nbsp;</p> <p>The DMC REVISION Team has observed that research-mentored students are able to grasp laboratory techniques faster and work more independently.&nbsp;The Team has tracked the student research experience and collectively the outcomes are significantly transforming the students compared to traditionally taught students.</p> <p>&nbsp;REVISION mentored students have reported better performance in science classes, enhanced career options and direction, more self-confidence, better problem solving and critical thinking skills, and better student motivation and career focus. Also, the faculty and student assistants have noted an elevated level of student excitement and engagement compared to the traditionally mentored science labs.&nbsp; REVISION mentorship instilled the students with a diverse skill set of science technician skills such as meticulously maintaining a laboratory notebook.&nbsp; Recent emphasis has been placed upon data archiving and record management skills. The REVISION grant has stressed the critical importance of &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; training to make students more competitive in the workplace. Many of the REVISION students are offered employment before graduation. For example, students have been offered a full time positions with government laboratories and pharmaceutical firms.</p> <p>Further the extraordinary DMC student outcomes would not be possible without the REVISION program and the combination of the apprentice model of individual mentoring.&nbsp; A REVISION mentored research intern in the summer of (2010) won the $10,000 grand prize during a student poster competition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science. At the 2016 AAAS student poster competition a REVISION SEA-PHAGES student competed against 4-year university and graduate students from Tier I research universities. It is noteworthy that he was not competing against any 2-year college students.&nbsp; The DMC REVISION student was the winner of the 2016 Student Poster Competition in Cell and Molecular Biology. His ability to conduct independent research at Del Mar College is unprecedented for a two-year college student at such an early stage in his career.</p> <p>In addition, a former&nbsp;DMC REVISION student won first place in a&nbsp;nationwide competition against more than 60 students from some of the&nbsp;largest universities in the US. &nbsp;Her presentation was held at&nbsp;the research campus at the Howard Hughes Medical&nbsp;Institute's 4th Annual Science Education Alliance Symposium. &nbsp;Another direct outcome of the REVISION is the most recent DMC team of students that won $6,500 for the first place in the prestigious 2017 NSF Community College Innovation Challenge.&nbsp; Over 100 college teams competed in the challenge by applying science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) to innovations to solve to real-world problems.&nbsp;</p> <p>REVISION spear-headed and enabled the formation of a new and award winning Del Mar College biotechnology program, supported student research internships and procured &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; lab equipment. Since undergraduate research was embedded into life science courses at Del Mar College (DMC) it has accomplished impressive project results. Since the research program was implemented in 2011, the graduation and completion rate of biotechnology program have increased more than 50%, the transfer and employment rate has been over 80%. In summary, REVISION students have excelled with achievements such as publishing in peer-reviewed scientific publications, presenting at national and regional scientific meeting, winning the grand prize and 1st place at national scientific poster competitions, securing employment or matriculating into 4-year degree programs.</p> <p>DMC REVISION efforts have sponsored 18 all-campus student poster sessions to expose the student body and disseminate program outcomes to the surrounding community regarding the research mentoring experience. Over 3000 participants have attended the over 18 annual all-campus poster sessions including DMC faculty, staff and students, AP high school teachers and students, regional university faculty, collegiate high school science students, parents, teachers and college administrators. The DMC Board of Regents recognized the student researchers upon completion of summer internship experiences, which drew extensive regional television and print media coverage. In addition, REVISION has sponsored over 100 students to present their work at scientific venues. Freshman REVISION students&rsquo; presenting their research results at national and regional scientific meetings is simply not possible with traditionally taught science courses.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/19/2017<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;R&nbsp;Hatherill</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205059/1205059_10199869_1511128435390_2.DMCStudentsConductingDiscovery-basedresearch--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205059/1205059_10199869_1511128435390_2.DMCStudentsConductingDiscovery-basedresearch--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Del Mar College Revision Students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205059/1205059_10199869_1511128435390_2.DMCStudentsConductingDiscovery-basedresearch--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Del Mar College Revision Students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Del Mar College Revision Students working on research projects</div> <div class="imageCredit">J.
