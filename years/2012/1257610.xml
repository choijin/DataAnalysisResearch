<AbstractNarration>This study will examine processes that lead to the diversification of species -- in number, form and ecology. First, a phylogeny of the Madagascar pseudoxyrhophiine snakes will be produced. This highly diverse group of vertebrates, with more than 130 species, occurs in arboreal, terrestrial, fossorial, and aquatic habitats, as well as tropical rainforests, mountain forests, swamps, grasslands and deserts. Using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques to generate hundreds of genes, the first comprehensive phylogeny of this snake group will be produced. Second, the phylogeny will be integrated with morphological and ecological data (including remotely-sensed data and GIS), in a computationally intense framework, to reveal how species, ecology and morphology evolve together over time and to examine the processes associated with adaptive radiations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also train undergraduates, doctoral students, and a postdoctoral researcher. Results will be widely communicated to the public via the American Museum of Natural History's Science Bulletin, CUNY's TV Program "Study with the Best", and other formats. In addition to revealing complex evolutionary processes, results of this research will also have valuable conservation applications for this group of snakes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project had the main objective of describing the evolutionary history of the Gem Snakes (Pseudoxyrhophiine) of Madagascar (currently an endemic group of 81 snake species), to provide new evidence about the processes of speciation within an isolated continental mega-island. Though intensive new field surveys in Madagascar, and the collections of a vast amount of new genetic data, this project was also expected to discover many new species to science, and contribute important new biodiversity data for conservation purposes.   The major results of this study are: 1) fieldwork collected more than 500 new snake DNA tissues from across Madagascar (including many species previously lacking DNA samples), as well as many other amphibian and reptile species; 2) a collection of more than 900 snakes tissues was assembled for this study, which included 93% of all known species from Madagascar; 3) a total 109 species were included in this study, of which 39 are new species for science, discovered by our new results (two species so far have been formally described); and 4) using an Anchored Hybrid Enrichment approach, we obtained DNA sequence data for 371 loci in 366 snake samples, making this one of the largest molecular data sets so far assembled for a species radiation.
