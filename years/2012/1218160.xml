<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop a better understanding of the relationships between the design features of tangible user interfaces (TUIs), the gestures used when thinking about creative tasks, and creative problem solving. There is an increasing interest in developing tangible user interfaces to digital environments that has resulted in a large number of graspable interactive devices. This project seeks correlations between tangible computing and cognition, and more specifically, with creative cognition, and then uses that correlation to impact the design of environments for tangible interaction. One hallmark of creative problem solving is the ability to solve a problem by recognizing its similarity to another already solved problem, particularly if the problems appear dissimilar on the surface, but share an underlying structure. The act of recognizing that two superficially different problems are analogous requires a key creative step, which can be characterized as making a mental leap. TUIs may facilitate a mental leap in creative problem solving by enhancing perception and therefore cognition of spatial or structural similarities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project, arising from the synthesis of the results of the observation and design sessions are: a methodology for studying children's activities while they use TUIs that has two parts: observation and design; a reusable coding scheme for observation data that is based on research in tangible computing, gesture and thought, and creativity; and design principles for tangible devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The results of this project can be used to develop motivating learning technology for children and adults that encourage learning in non-traditional ways. The project will also have an impact on public and professional understanding of the role of tangible computing in education through an association with the University of Maryland HCILab activities and their association with pubic radio. The proposed project has benefits to society more broadly by focusing on the importance of creativity in education and learning, which leads to a more innovative and competitive society.</AbstractNarration>
