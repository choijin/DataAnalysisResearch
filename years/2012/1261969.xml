<AbstractNarration>For the further exploration of the newly discovered Higgs boson and for gaining more precise understanding of new physics, an electron positron collider operating in the 300 to 1000 GeV energy range would be a powerful research facility.  Two candidate e+e- collider technologies exist, the International Linear Collider (ILC) based upon superconducting accelerating structures, and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) using structures powered by an intense drive beam of electrons. This award supports the continued participation and leadership of Prof Paul Grannis of SUNY at Stony Brook in the international electron positron collider effort as a member of the Linear Collider Steering Group of the Americas (LCSGA).  The broader impacts of the effort are strategic, giving the US a significant role in an important area of global science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposed International Linear Collder is a pair of particle accelerators, that bring beams of electrons and positrons into head-on collisions.  The total collision energy will initially be 250 billion electron volts, with the possibility to extend the accelerators later to increase the energy.  The total length of the initial project is about 20 km.   The beam particles will be accelerated in superconducting niobium cavities that provide an unprecedented 30 million electron volts of energy gain per meter.  The price tag of the project  will be in the $10 billion dollar range.  The large detectors that record the results of the collisions will have subdetectors to measure thedistance particles fly before decaying, the momentum of the curving tracks of charged particles and the energy of particles.  This information recorded can be used to completely reconstruct the collision event in subsequent computer reconstruction program.  One of the main goals of the ILC in its initial stage is the measurement of the properties of the Higgs boson to much higher precision than is possible at the Large Hadron Collider, where this particle was first observed in 2012.  These measurement are the key to understanding the nature of new unknown forces and particles that are confidently expected to exist.  This grant supported work to bring the ILC project to reality.   If it is to be built, it will require the support from nations in Europe, the Americas and Asia working cooperatively together.  Japan has announced its interest in hosting the project with contributions to the accelerator and detectors coming from other nations.  The PI of this grant has long worked to bring physicists and nations together to invest in the ILC.  During the period of this grant, activities centered on the Americas Linear Collider Committee which interfaced to funding agencies in  the US and other nations, and supported cooperative research worldwide on the accelerator and detector technologies.  There is now widespread agreement that the scientific goals of the ILC are compelling and that the technology to achieve it is in hand.  Extensive discussions around the world and particularly in Japan toward starting the project are expected to culminate in late 2018 with a decision on whether or not to pursue the project.  Besides the step forward in understanding the construction of our universe and the particles and forces that define it at the basic level, the ILC will bring technological  and social benefits.   Among the former, the development of cmmercially viable superconducting acceleration cavities have great potential for medical treatment facilities, non-invasive screening of cargo, treatment of radioactive waste, and military applications.  The latter benefits include new organizational structures by which large-scale cooperative projects can be undertaken by nations of different political, social and technological character, with each country contributing in-kind, and organized in a truly international way.
