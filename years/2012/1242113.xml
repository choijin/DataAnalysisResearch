<AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in Cartagena and Bogot√°, Colombia.  Organized by Dr. Jose Holguin-Veras, Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Pan-American Advanced Institute on Sustainable Urban Freight Systems aims to promote enhanced cooperation among transportation researchers in the Americas around the subject of sustainable urban freight systems (SUFS). The proposed PASI intends to develop a new generation of researchers and practitioners with a holistic view of urban freight system issues and their solutions that, ultimately, will have an impact on research, education and practice to foster SUFS.  The PASI will bring together instructors who are international experts in major disciplinary groups including engineering, decision sciences, management, and economics. The multidisciplinary nature of this team, as well as the opportunity to engage in international collaborations, will ensure cross fertilization among the participating disciplines and, ultimately, will pave the ways for new paradigms of transportation sustainable systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PASI will introduce students to many important techniques in the above subjects.  In addition to the benefits from developing long term synergistic relationships among faculty members, post docs, and senior PhD students, the PASI is intended to help achieve the support the education and advancement of underrepresented students.  It will also provide up-to-date information on the deliberations of the PASI to a wider audience through a web page to disseminate results and reports of the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
