<AbstractNarration>The Amazon Basin is Earth?s most biodiverse watershed, yet much remains unknown about species diversity, population structures, biogeographic ranges, and ecological and evolutionary processes. This project will document and analyze the aquatic biodiversity of a 130 km-long anastomosing maze of high-energy rapids in Brazil: the Lower Xingu River Rapids (LXRR) and adjacent stretches of the Xingu.  The LXRR faces imminent change from its wild state to both dewatered and lentic, impounded habitats following completion of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam. New comprehensive specimen collections of fishes, crustaceans and mollusks and associated data will be used to address key questions in taxonomy, evolution and ecology, and will provide a permanent record (placed at US and Brazilian museums) and environmental baseline of life within the LXRR to assess future anthropogenic impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance understanding of the contribution that large river rapids make to tropical biodiversity and productivity, and will train a wide range aquatic scientists needed for the future study, protection and restoration of these habitats. An on-line, publicly accessible illustrated guide to the identification of LXRR fishes and invertebrates will be created.  Two postdoctoral scientists will be supported. Training and learning opportunities will be offered for high school, undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

This project documented the aquatic biodiversity and ecology of the Xingu River, the Amazon&rsquo;s largest clear-water tributary, in a 130-km reach of its lower course with an anastomosing maze of high-energy rapids. These structurally and hydrologically complex habitats support an unusually diverse and endemic fauna, but the Lower Xingu River in Brazil faces imminent change following recent completion of the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex. A series of expeditions were made to the Lower Xingu during different phases of the annual hydrological cycle. Over a three-year period, an international science team surveyed habitats throughout the lower river reaches and collected environmental data and specimens of fishes, crustaceans and mollusks. Tissue samples of fish, aquatic invertebrates, plant and algae were collected for analysis of stable isotope ratios to explore feeding relationships and food web structure. Additional tissue samples were collected for studies of molecular systematics and population genetics by project collaborators funded by a companion project. The two projects obtained thousands of biological specimens, associated tissue samples and field data, and identified several undescribed species and intriguing genetic variation among fish species morphotypes. The project trained several Brazilian students who will be needed for future study and conservation of Amazonian biodiversity.

Seasonal changes in functional trait distributions were statistically analyzed for local fish assemblages inhabiting rapids of the Lower Xingu River. Recent research on trait-based community assembly has emphasized changes in the relative influence of assembly mechanisms across spatial gradients, but considerably less attention has been given to how these mechanisms vary over time. Animals can mediate competitive interactions through dispersal, suggesting that the relative importance of assembly mechanisms can vary over short time scales in response to ontogenetic changes in dispersal or seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions. To evaluate alternative hypotheses of fish community assembly, this project devised new methods for data analysis that employ a null model approach to test for significant non-random patterns.&nbsp;Higher functional richness in local fish assemblages was found during the dry season, which supports an interpretation of species niche complementarity during the period when biotic interactions are strongest.

Differences between morphological and trophic diversity of the dominant fish families in the region (Anostomidae, Cichlidae, Loricariidae, Serrasalmidae) provide further insight into how this diverse fish assemblage may be partitioning niche space, with implications for how species may respond to future hydrologic alteration from the dams.</p> <p>The design of the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex creates three distinctly altered segments: a flooded section upstream of the main dam, a middle section between the dam and the main powerhouse that will be dewatered, and a downstream section subject to flow alteration from powerhouse discharge.

The dominant compositional pattern observed during all survey periods was the high number of rapids-adapted species found in the upstream and middle sections. These results further highlight this region of the Xingu as a hotspot of aquatic diversity, and identify the future dewatered section as critically important for the conservation of this exceptional fauna. Research is needed to estimate an environmental flow regime to maintain this globally unique habitat and its associated aquatic diversity throughout the Lower Xingu, and scientists, policymakers and stakeholders should engage to explore means to implement the prescribed regime.
