<AbstractNarration>This Partnership for Innovation project from Cornell University will create carbon-based nanocomposite materials suitable for advanced batteries, super capacitors, and magnetic storage media. The approach relies on co-polymerization of inorganic and organic polymer precursors to create composite materials in which inorganic nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in an electrically conductive carbon host. This platform technology will be applied to the development of new high-energy battery cathodes and anodes based on metal/carbon, metal sulfide/carbon, and metal oxide/carbon nanocomposites. Batteries based on the new composite electrodes offer energy storage capacities four to five times higher than the most advanced units in use today and are expected to find applications in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles. By incorporating highly conductive graphene structures into the composite materials, the project further aims to develop supercapacitors with high power and high energy storage capacities for the power utility grid storage. In addition, the project utilizes mixed metal precursors to create composites based on metal alloys and inter-metallic nanoparticles that facilitate independent control of the magnetic permeability and electrical conductivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research ultimately will include acceleration of commercialization of several unique battery systems with potential market-changing impacts. The global market for secondary batteries alone was estimated to be $11-$13 billion in 2010 and is expected to quadruple by 2020. By bringing together researchers from Cornell University, known world-wide for their innovative contributions in the rechargeable batteries field, with two Up-State New York technology concerns possessing complementary expertise on materials synthesis, formulation, and manufacturing, the project creates a path toward commercial deployment of lithium battery systems that offer multiple unique features.  These features include best-in-class energy storage capacity and best-in-class power density. The project will also develop materials and manufacturing processes for battery electrodes, supercapacitors, and magnetic materials that are familiar from other sectors of technology. By doing so, costs associated with deployment of battery manufacturing processes will be contained--a required first-step for improving competitiveness of the new lithium battery systems in the marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are Cornell University as the lead academic institution and&lt;br/&gt;Small Business partners Graphene Devices Ltd., Rochester, New York; and NOHMs Technologies, Ithaca New York.</AbstractNarration>

Research performed in the project took advantage of density functional theoretical (DFT) analysis to design nitrogen-containing polymers that can be tethered to carbon to create composite cathodes with strong binding energies for sulfur to maximize utilization and prevent sulfur loss to the battery electrolyte. The project developed multiple scalable in-situ process for manufacturing such nanocomposites based on highly conductive microporous carbons, which our studies show are highly effective in overcoming all of the challenges that have inhibited commercial development of Li-S and Na-S batteries. The project also developed two new deposition processes that allow multilayered sorbent coatings to be applied to the separator or anode of a Li-S or Na-S battery. In so doing, the research in this PFI project has demonstrated multiple sulfur cathode and separator configurations that enable stable long-term charge/discharge cycling of high-energy lithium-sulfur and sodium-sulfur batteries suitable for commercial development.   A highlight among the project outcomes is that the partnership with KEP NOHMs Technologies has opened up exciting, new opportunities for cathode design and for separator engineering that are already being implemented to create room-temperature lithium-sulfur batteries for aerospace, automotive, and portable electronics markets. Another highlight among the PFI project outcomes relates to opportunities the project provided for educating graduate students. In addition to developing fundamental skills in materials chemistry, materials physics, and electrochemistry to design materials configurations able to overcome the difficulties with Li-S and Na-S battery technologies, students supported by the project worked in collaboration with KEP partners on development of scalable manufacturing processes for these materials and in evaluating potential market opportunities for products developed in the study. This range of experiences is uncommon in university-based research projects, but is a requirement for workforce development. It is an important strength of the PFI program.
