<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Sumit Das and Alfred Shapere at the University of Kentucky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the use of techniques of string theory and quantum field theory to understand quantum properties of gravity and properties of systems near phase transitions. In recent years, physicists have discovered an intimate relationship between quantum gravity as described by string theory and conventional quantum systems. This relationship has been used to understand many equilibrium and near-equilibrium properties of rather complicated systems near phase transitions, like superconductors or colliding heavy ions at high temperature, using methods of string theory. The present proposal involves novel methods which will shed light on properties of these systems far from equilibrium.  At the same time, the proposal aims to develop a deeper understanding of the quantum aspects of gravity by relating such aspects to systems which can be investigated using conventional methods of quantum mechanics. In a parallel direction, powerful methods of supersymmetry will be used to classify phase transitions and their related universal behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include the training of graduate students and postdocs in cutting-edge research techniques and preparing them for research careers.   The investigators will give lectures and seminars on their research which are open to all, and will incorporate ideas gleaned from their research activities in the courses they teach.  The investigators will also continue their work to modernize the University of Kentucky's physics curriculum and to bring its students into contact with frontier research in these subjects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we studied how systems behave when their parameters depend on time. This problem has far-reaching applications in many areas of physics. In cosmology this is a key ingredient in understanding the emergence of structure. In other areas of physics this is related to the study of how things become thermal. This problem is also of interest in the study of phase transitions, where the response is expected to be universal and independent of microscopic details. In this project, we derived such universal properties using ideas of "gauge gravity duality" which relates this problem to a seemingly uinrelated problem in Einstein gravity. In the process we discovered new universal behavior which can be potentially tested in experiments using ultracold atoms.  Another part of the project studied scale-invariant theories, which have no built-in length or mass scale.  These theories describe most types of phase transitions. It turns out that scale invariance is a highly constraining symmetry, especially when combined with relativistic invariance. We showed that, in two dimensions, the parameters defining such theories are constrained in many ways. Specifically, we were able to show that the values of large number of these parameters must be small (in a precise sense), but on the other hand the number of small parameters cannot be too large.  These results are expected to have analogues in three dimensions as well. Through the principle of gauge-gravity duality, they imply corresponding contraints on black holes in three-dimensional gravitational theories.  Among their broader impacts, our results have general implications for phase transitions in two dimensions, which are of central interest in condensed matter physics.   A third aspect of the project was concerned with systems with time-dependent minimum energy states, which we call "time crystals".  In conventional systems, the energy is minimized only when all velocities are zero, so that the minimum-energy state is necessarily time-independent. We found that it is theoretically possible to sidestep this requirement, by postulating an unconventional dependence of energy on velocities.  Such a system would be something like a perpetual motion machine,  exhibiting constant motion without dissipation.  We have found and studied candidates for time crystals in domains as far-flung as cold atoms and cosmology, and developed new techniques for studying theories of this general type.  Recent experiments have made progress in realizing a weak variety of time crystals - a qualitatively new state of matter.  Among their broader impacts beyond the original scope of this project, time crystals have become an area of intense experimental and theoretical research activity in the fields of condensed matter and cold atom physics.  They have also attracted significant notice in the popular press.                     Last Modified: 05/23/2017       Submitted by: Alfred Shapere]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
