<AbstractNarration>This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at University of Texas - Pan American in the summer of 2013 on solitons in two-dimensional water waves and applications to tsunamis. The principal speaker will be Professor Yuji Kodama from Ohio State University. The lectures will cover such areas as Grassmannians, two-dimensional soliton solutions and stability, and the Mach reflection problem. In addition to the 10 main lectures by Dr. Kodama, lectures will be presented by other experts in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hallmarks of the NSF/CBMS regional conference series are focus on a single important and timely area of research by a leading practitioner, a published monograph for a wider audience, and continued effect and local stimulation through regional recruitment emphasis. This conference will also entail a lecture aimed at the public on Japan's tsunamis.  This award will support approximately 30 participants in the conference, many at early stages of their careers.</AbstractNarration>

This lecture was also streamed live on internet.   &bull;  An experiment of two-dimensional water waves provided students an opportunity to learn how mathematics can be used to analyze real phenomena.
