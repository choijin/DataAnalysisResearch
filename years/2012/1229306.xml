<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 12-29306&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Mahmood, Akhtar H; &lt;br/&gt;  Alam, Mohammad S; Severini, Horst; Zain, Samya; &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Bellarmine University&lt;br/&gt;Title:   MRI/Acq.: High Resolution Visualization System to Enable Large-Scale Data-Intensive Collaborative Research and Cyber-Learning using Grid Computing&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project from an EPSCoR state and a non-PhD granting institution, acquiring a high resolution visualization instrument, aims to set up an Advanced Visualization and Computational Lab (AVCL) to enable large scale data-intensive collaborative research (data analyses, simulation, and visualization tasks) in high energy physics. In collaboration with University of Oklahoma, State University of New York at Albany, and Susquehanna University, the project spans four geographically dispersed institutions. The acquisition targets a cost-effective high-resolution tiled display system providing a collaborative visualization environment. This visualization system will be constructed as a tiled display wall (16- foot wide by 4.6-foot tall) over an area that fills a user?s field of view to provide a display that looks nearly borderless. It will be connected to several Tier-4 data analyses workstations via a wall processor, so that the scientists can simultaneously display multiple ATLAS data events all at once. 2D and 3D visualization tasks will be carried out using Atlantis, GraXML and VP1 visualization software package. The studies and research projects in high energy physics will be enabled, including, but not limited, to the research for new types of subatomic particles, such as the charged Higgs boson and Supersymmetric (SUSY) particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and ?Search for Charged Higgs Boson from tt Production?. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation increases institutional capacity to conduct cutting-edge research in cost-effective visualization system. Since the large amount of data cannot be otherwise analyzed and studied, visualization is fundamental for high energy physics. The acquisition of this visualization system should significantly increase the research capability within all the participating institutions. Moreover, the acquisition of this visualization system will serve as a campus-wide resource and provide an exceptional opportunity to engage students in research at the forefront of data-intensive computational science, visualization, and high-energy physics. Through this effort, student training (including underrepresented groups) will be emphasized, as well as the knowledge dissemination. Its impact may be significant.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Finding new Information and patterns in Big Data is the new imperative.  Large-scale data-driven applications are on the rise, and so is the need to extract rare signals (new information) from terabyte and petabyte-scale data sets (Big Data).  In order to understand and visualize complex Big Data analysis environments for extracting new information, we need new types of technology for visualization, as well as novel data analytics tools.   Visualizing multi-dimensional, time-varying datasets is both a challenge to the computational infrastructure and also to the current visualization display technologies.  A single computer monitor can constrain the way in which we can analyze large volumes of data events.  We can view either a low-resolution image that represents the entire extent of the data events and thus risk missing the detail, or we can view small portions of the data events in high resolution while losing the full context.  At Bellarmine University we have setup and implemented an Advanced Visualization and Computational Lab (AVCL) using the state-of the art next generation visualization technology, called Hiperwall (a highly interactive parallelized display wall) to enable visualization of very large datasets with a very high resolution.  Advanced visualization instruments like the Hiperwall display system can be used in a broad range of commercial, educational, and Big Data research environments to visualize large quantities of information at a single glance.  We broke new grounds by being the first undergraduate institution in the US (and the only institution in Kentucky) to implement the Hiperwall technology in the field of high energy physics for analyzing and visualizing HEP (High Energy Physics) collision events and extracting information about new subatomic particles from the petabyte-scale datasets from the ATLAS experiment.  This Hiperwall visualization project at Bellarmine University is a collaborative research effort with Susquehanna University, University of Oklahoma and SUNY at Albany.  Hiperwall is a high performance, high resolution visualization system.  The 16.6 mega-pixel Hiperwall visualization system consists of a 16-ft-wide by 5 ft-high tiled display-wall connected to 9 high-end Tier4 Data Analysis workstations equipped with dual-NVIDIA multi-core graphics technology that provides parallel processing capabilities needed to visualize very large datasets, efficiently.  The display-nodeÆs computer-cluster that drive the Hiperwall system work in parallel which allows users to place contents and images on multiple display tiles with a very high resolution.  Our Hiperwall display system has been designed to be a collaborative visualization platform to enable visualization of large-scale data events in real time.  We wrote web-based software so that undergraduate students can easily use the Hiperwall visualization system using a dedicated web portal to explore the collision data events from the ATLAS experiment.   The Hiperwall visualization system allows the user to display a wide variety of high-resolution 2D and 3D images, animations, and time-varying data in real time on multiple display tiles that can be configured according to the needs of the user.  HiperwallÆs tiled grid-based display system software architecture applies parallel processing techniques to overcome the performance limitations typically associated with the display of multiple large images on multiple display tiles simultaneously.  Users can display a single image across the entire display area, or can display many different images simultaneously on the display tiles, all at once.  With Hiperwall, we can see both the broad view of the HEP data event and the minute details about the particle tracks, concurrently.   Our Hiperwall visualization system can display extremely large images (provided each file size does not exceed one TB), conduct interactive analysis of large datasets, view multiple images or parameters of large datasets,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
