<AbstractNarration>The Doctoral Scholars in Engineering (DSiE) project  at Morgan State University has initiated a community of doctoral scholars in engineering that is focused on academic achievement and career preparation The objectives of this project are to: 1) increase access to the doctorate, especially for underrepresented minority students; 2) improve doctoral degree completion and time to degree by relieving scholars of the need for off-campus employment; 3) improve support programs for doctoral students in the School of Engineering; and 4) increase the preparation and placement of doctoral students in academic and research careers. This project is producing graduates who are well grounded in their disciplines and well prepared for career success. The project strategies are designed to improve doctoral student retention and graduation rates, thereby contributing to an increased engineering work force.</AbstractNarration>
