<AbstractNarration>This project is addressing student learning in the natural sciences through integrated science literacy instruction in an introductory, prerequisite biology course. The materials being developed address the student needs of learning a new language that includes the use of symbols, learning to think more abstractly and make associations between concepts, and learning how to read a scientific textbook  to  build on prior knowledge, read and interpret charts and graphs, and  make sense of static drawings of active processes. These materials are increasing the retention and graduation rates and better preparing students for certification testing and/or transfer to a four-year institution. The project also focuses on instruction for faculty on how to best use these materials in the classroom. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underrepresented students, students from rural areas, and women are gaining the science literacy skills necessary to successfully complete the first two years of the science curriculum and either transfer to a four-year institution or pass certification exams for career pathways.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF grant Integrated Science Literacy Instruction allowed two biology professors - Karen Huffman and Marirose Ethington, and one nursing professor - Michele McKay at Genesee Community College to work with a literacy consultant (Dolores Perin) from Columbia University Teachers College to develop literacy and reading methods and materials for use by science instructors in the science classroom.   These methods and materials will help to instruct students on how becoming better readers of their textbook and of other science materials such as articles, and to be more cognitive of the purpose of their reading and expected outcomes of reading.  During this study students that received instruction in literacy specific to the sciences did better on their final exams.  There also appears to be a coorrelation between science literacy instruction and an increased rate of program retention and completion by students when compared to peers that did not receive instruction.  Students that received the literacy instruction not only improved in their science knowledge, retention and completion, but they also developed an improved sense and attitude towards working in groups &ndash; a skill required by today?s work force.  As materials are modified and disseminated to other science instructors the hope is that more students will benefit from this instruction and enter the work force better prepared for today?s demands.
