<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2012 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. These fellowships support a research and training plan at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines. The title of the research fellowship awarded to Owen G. Gwilliam is "Construction and mathematical applications of quantum field theories."  The host institution for the fellowship is University of California, Berkeley, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Nicolai Reshetikhin.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thanks to the Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship that I received in 2012, I have had the opportunity to undertake research and pursue collaborations that would have been, at minimum, much more difficult with an ordinary postdoctoral position. Before elaborating on the research itself, let me describe briefly what I did over the  three years of this Fellowship.   Here is the output of the research:  the completion of two 300-page research monographs (the first was published in December 2016) and five papers (~260 pages) from four separate collaborations.   (All are freely available on my website, and the papers are also available at arXiv.org.) Most of the substantive work on these projects was completed during the periods when I did not teach, time provided expressly by the Fellowship.    That flexible time also made it possible for me to organize several conferences and workshops at premier institutions for my research area, such as the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics, the Banff International Research Station, and the Oberwolfach Mathematics Research Institute.
