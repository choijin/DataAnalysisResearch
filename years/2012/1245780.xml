<AbstractNarration>The IDEA-Pen project is using tablet technology to provide a means of helping students perform engineering analysis problems in a classroom environment. Using an electronic pen, students will be able to sketch structural analysis problems. Image analysis software previously written by the investigators is used to pass the sketch to a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) program. The FEA program will then provide analysis of the sketch made by the students. Student learning is expected to increase because they will be able to explore several options for design (increase the design space) since the analysis can be done quickly. By increasing the design space, students will be able to observe the effects that design changes have on the performance of their design. This will increase intuition about system performance and will result in better design skill. This outcome is being monitored by analyzing student performance on exams. It is also expected that the technology will help shift the classroom from a teacher centered to a student centered environment. This expectation is being monitored by analyzing the number and variety of problems attempted that are not assigned by the instructor. Classrooms are expected to become more interactive and certainly more engaging for the students. This expectation is monitored by directly measuring the numbers of problems attempted by students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Widespread dissemination of the project results are expected to occur because the software will be provided in an open source format and could be distributed through popular application downloads centers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The availability of powerful simulation and analysis tools has not had a widespread impact on learning concepts in the classroom because of some critical reasons. First these tools have a steep learning curve. Second the gap between the use of these tools and lack of content to leverage them towards concepts for learning is high. We developed the IDEA-Pen to provide a means to help students perform engineering analysis as an exploration without knowledge of use of complex tools. The instructor authors problems and students can explore these concepts easily within the constraints or they can also sketch concepts and analyze them. IDEA-Pen will then provide analysis of the exlporations made by the students.  Results from the study show that the interface and associated exploratory design task were beneficial for students to discover new concepts and correct previous misconceptions through rapid exploration of the design space. Feedback received from the participants after participating in the study showed that they welcomed the idea of expanding the use of the interface to a classroom setting.  We conducted studies with IDEA-Pen on several students with a pre and post questionnaire, and recorded their explorations as well as all entire analysis process on the computer togehter with their video. All the content was coordinated with analytics tools to fully analyze each of our participants. To get a holistic overview of how each participant proceeded with the design tasks, we plotted the normalized area of the member and normalized maximum stress in each iteration on a 2-sided bar chart. With such a representation, we were able to observe trends in the exploration process. We could see how participants started over in their explorations or changed their exploration strategy by looking at this representation of the data and also at the various recordings (audio, video and screen) we captured during the design task. From this analysis,we were able to identify points of interest (from an analysis point of view) based on trends in the participantsÆ processes. For example, when we noticed a trend of decreasing area across iterations and a sudden increase in the area in the subsequent iteration, we were able to deduce that the participant had changed the exploration strategy at that point and therefore, classified it as a point of interest.

We envision this interface and study setup to lead to an environment that facilitates the integration of engineering analysis and engineering design by allowing users to explore different design options in the early stages of design before any detailed designs are made. Since we developed our interface on a Web browser, it can be expanded to the greater academic community through MOOCs (Massively Open Online Courses) and Web-based modules for online exploration. Finally, our work makes itself more accessible since it is web-based and founded on simple interactions of the user.
