<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award provides Ph.D. students at Rice University with innovative training in neuroengineering, spanning the disciplines of neuroscience, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and bioengineering. In collaboration with Baylor College of Medicine and seven other universities and participating organizations, Rice University trainees are developing the tools to understand, interface with, model, and manipulate the nervous system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Due to improved technologies that enable neuroscientists to interact with brain cells, and due to the increasing types of neuroscientific data collected through electrical and optical methods, the neuroengineers who create and work with these complex data sets require highly specialized training. This program trains students in three specific areas: (1) cellular systems neuroengineering, which studies the nervous system?s signaling processes at the molecular and cellular levels; (2) engineering multi-neuron circuits, which involves collecting and analyzing data from groups of brain cells and devising methods to induce them to produce new functional responses; and (3) translational neuroengineering, which develops systematic approaches to improve clinical devices such as prosthetics and deep brain stimulators. Trainees in this program are learning to be technologically innovative; to be aware of social, cultural, and ethical aspects of neuroengineering; to communicate their work effectively to a wide variety of audiences; and to understand the pathways to commercialize their discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: As this program trains neuroengineers to develop advanced solutions to functional and structural problems in the brain, a new problem-based learning curriculum will result and will be shared with the public through open education resources. By cultivating relationships with biomedical device companies, international researchers, and collaborators within two minority-serving institutions in Texas, students in this program are expanding the applications of their training and increasing participation in their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and leadership  skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to establish new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, and to engage students in understanding the processes by which research is translated into innovations that benefit society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our IGERT grant "Neuroengineering: From Cells to Systems" trained 20 graduate students at the interface of engineering and neuroscience.  These students, through collaborative interactions fostered by the IGERT program, accomplished impactful research in the field of neuroengineering.  The success of our research accomplishments is evidenced by 1) the additional funding (over $30M  from public and private foundations), and  2)the intellectual merit of our graduate students who advanced the fields of cellular systems neuroengineering and nanofabricated electrode arrays embedded in microfluidic devices. These research advances have broad application in basic and translational/rehabilitation neuroengineering research.  Overall, IGERT-sponsored research resulted in publications in leading research journals including Science, Nature Nanotechnology, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Lab on a Chip.  The research advances have the potential to create new ways to diagnose, treat, and even prevent illnesses ranging from neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, epilepsy and Parkinson’s, to disorders such as chronic pain and depression.  The IGERT program had a lasting impact on Rice University in two ways.  Most importantly, it laid the foundation for the Rice Neuroengineering Initiative (RNEI).  The RNEI (https://neuroengineering.rice.edu/) is a $50M investment from Rice University to hire faculty and build laboratory spaces in the 10-story Bioscience Research Collaborative building.  This initiative will have a broad impact on neuroscience and neuroengineering at Rice directly and in the Houston area through fostering collaborations with multiple institutions in the adjacent Texas Medical Center.  Second, funding from IGERT provided a catalyst that aided in the creation of an undergraduate major in Neuroscience at Rice.  Another broad impact was the introduction and revitalization of new graduate courses in Rice Engineering departments that taught material at the interface of neuroscience and engineering.   An evaluation of our IGERT program found IGERT fellows to uniformly be interdisciplinary researchers, have strong course grades, have positive attitudes toward STEM, to be satisfied with the program, and perceive the program to be inclusive.    In 2012, when the IGERT program began, there were only a handful of Neuroengineering researchers at Rice.  Today, more than 25 researchers are associated with the Neuroengineering Initiative.  Overall, the IGERT program is proud to have contributed by integrating expertise from multiple different departments in engineering and the sciences to establish a community of researchers here at Rice in the field of Neuroengineering.  The NSF investment in our IGERT program created a network of interactions and collaborations that have fostered a dynamic research environment at the interface of neuroscience and engineering that is now being sustained through the RNEI.  Thus in addition to the research that has been accomplished during the IGERT training period, a strong foundation for future research has been laid beyond what we could have previously envisioned or hoped.  The initial investment of the NSF will support advances in the field of neuroengineering at Rice University, in the Texas Medical Center, and across the country for years to come as our graduates continue their achievements and acquire  postdoctoral and faculty positions at other prestigious institutions.
