<AbstractNarration>The emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), such as those from terrestrial vegetation, are known to exert significant control on tropospheric composition and the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere through:&lt;br/&gt;(1) their formation of ozone in the presence of reactive nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and sunlight, &lt;br/&gt;(2)  the regulation of hydrogen oxide radicals (HOx = OH + HO2) and&lt;br/&gt;(3) the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) through the transformation of BVOC oxidation products &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field campaigns in forested regions continue to improve our understanding of the role of BVOC emissions on gas-phase tropospheric chemistry, yet large uncertainties remain regarding their detailed role in HOx chemistry and SOA formation. A multi-site synthesis is needed to improve understanding of the key physical and chemical processes needed to account for BVOC reactivity. Using a computationally efficient one-dimensional (1D) model, with the ultimate goal of improving regional- and global-scale representation of of BVOCs, researchers from University of Michigan and Washington State hypothesize that many of the HOx mechanism changes recently developed for tropical forests will not achieve the desired model improvement at mid-latitudes. Observations from some five individual US campaigns are to be synthesized in a comprehensive manner and this meta-synthesis is hoped to clarify the role of forests on tropospheric chemistry in moderately clean to polluted regions such as found in the continental US. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since  BVOC are also important precursors for short-lived climate forcing agents such a ozone and atmospheric aerosols, improved representation of these species is also needed in future climate models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The land surface represents 30% of the Earth?s surface, of which about 30% is covered by either broadleaf or needleleaf forest.  These plants emit large quantities of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) that can have an important impact on tropospheric chemistry by contributing to the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosols (SOA).   However, the potential for BVOC to influence ozone and SOA is highly dependent on the level of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  Observed NOx concentrations have been decreasing over the past decade in the United States, and representing these chemical changes in forested ecosystems has proven challenging. The goal of this project is to understand the role of forest chemistry on the formation of important species such as ozone and aerosols to improve their representation in regional and global models. In this project, we utilized a one-dimensional modeling tool that explicitly accounts for the chemistry and meteorology of the forest canopy.  This tool allows us to understand the physical and chemical processes within the forest canopy to more accurately represent the chemical contributions from the forest to the atmosphere.  We synthesized existing field data from four different sites in the United States to understand the model simulation of BVOC emissions, successive oxidation of these primary emissions, and gas and particle phase transformation.  Our work highlights the importance of chemical mechanism in the fate of BVOC, where two different gas-phase chemical mechanisms simulate the short-lived primary emissions such as isoprene and monoterpenes and their oxidation products.  Under high NOx conditions, the two mechanisms simulate similar concentrations of BVOC and peroxy radicals, yet under low NOx the two mechanisms diverge, producing lower HOx and oxidation rates. We identify peroxy radical and alkyl nitrate chemistry as the key causes of the differences, highlighting the importance of this chemistry in understanding the fate of BVOC.   We also used the model to investigate the underlying mechanisms governing foliage emissions of methanol and acetaldehyde, two short chain oxygenated volatile organic compounds ubiquitous in the troposphere with strong biogenic sources.  Using data from the Harvard Forest site, we found that model could reproduce the magnitude and diurnal profiles of methanol and acetaldehyde fluxes measured at the top of the forest canopy only if light-dependent emissions were introduced to the model. Although we found evidence that stomatal conductance influences methanol fluxes and concentrations at scales beyond the leaf level, we were able to adequately capture ecosystem exchange without the addition of stomatal control to the standard parameterizations of foliage emissions, suggesting that ecosystem fluxes can be well enough represented by the light-dependent emissions models. In addition to probing the chemistry in the canopy, we also explored the role of the physical forest canopy structure and its impact on atmospheric chemistry. Using data from the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS), we found the treatment of vertical structure of the forest canopy can influence the BVOC emitted from a region.  We evaluated a complex, heterogeneous canopy where high-isoprene-emitting foliage is constrained to the upper canopy.  Within the upper canopy, higher sunlight availability increases the light-dependent isoprene emission, leading to 34% more isoprene and its oxidation products as compared to a homogeneous forest canopy. The broader impacts of this work improve the understanding short-lived climate forcing agents such as ozone and aerosols, and improve the representation of BVOC fluxes in climate models and our understanding of the climate system. This work informs the simulation of BVOC emission in air quality models, and noting that the canopy structure and in-canopy chemistry can be an important component of emissions algorithms. This work trained one postdoctoral fellow and supported four undergraduate research projects.  Through this project, the PI has been involved in an international model intercomparison project (the CANopy Exchange Model Intercomparison Project (CANEX-MIP), which is a project supported by the International Land Ecosystem Atmosphere Project (iLEAPS) to compare different canopy exchange models.   In 2016, CANEX-MIP hosted a training workshop on canopy modeling that had over 30 early career attendees.   Model code developed as part of this project has been shared with the community at large.       Last Modified: 06/28/2017       Submitted by: Allison Steiner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
