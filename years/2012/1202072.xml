<AbstractNarration>This award will support the participation of graduate students and postdocs in the "Fifteenth Riviere-Fabes Symposium" that will be held at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities from April 20-22, 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual conference, of which the 2012 meeting will be the fifteenth in the series, celebrates the mathematical legacy of Nestor M. Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial differential equations. The 2012 program will feature two principle speakers (Panagiotis Souganidis and Antonio Cordoba), each of whom will give a two-hour lecture, and a number of one-hour talks delivered primarily by young  mathematicians (Thomas Alazard, Giuseppe Mingione, Gabriella Tarantello, Rachel Ward). The program allows ample time for informal discussion among the participants.</AbstractNarration>

Minnesota was fortunate to hire these brilliant mathematicians and close friends almost simultaneously, Nestor in 1966, and Gene in 1967. After cancer claimed Nestor's life in 1978 at a young age of 38, the annual Riviere Lectures were established in his memory.&nbsp; In 1997, Gene died of a heart attack soon after his 60th birthday.
