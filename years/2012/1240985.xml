<AbstractNarration>The University of California, Santa Barbara proposes to discover low anchor points and develop learning progressions for computational thinking and related computer science concepts. These learning progressions are a necessary step towards the integration of computational thinking and computer science concepts into K-12. The project staff will develop two curricula - one for grades 2-6 and one for grades 4-6. The curricula and learning progressions will iteratively inform one another. Further, the curricula will be a proof of concept that students can develop computational thinking skills in a way that reinforces other academic subjects and their own culture, and provide a practical way for teachers to begin teaching computer science at different entry points within grades 2-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computing has infiltrated almost all corners of life and is an increasingly important part of driving innovation, and the next generation of inventors need to understand how to develop and use software. The ability to analyze and express problems in a way compatible with software solutions, or computational thinking, will become critical in modern society. This work has the potential to revolutionize how computer science is taught in elementary schools by showing how these computational thinking skills can be developed in three or six years while supporting education in the existing curriculum. In addition, the resulting curricular materials will be developed with diverse students as the targets. First, the project staff will explore the prior knowledge that students with different backgrounds have, leading to everyday examples that are more accessible and meaningful to diverse students. Second, the content delivery will use the latest research in teaching diverse students computer science concepts.</AbstractNarration>
