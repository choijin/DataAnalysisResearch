<AbstractNarration>Delaware State University (DSU) in partnership with Delaware's Lake Forest and Red Clay Consolidated School Districts is recruiting 28 new highly-qualified, mathematics and science teachers for Delaware and surrounding states. The Phase I Teacher Scholarship Track program provides up to 3-years in scholarships for four cohorts of 7 DSU juniors and seniors majoring in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).  The scholarships help Noyce scholars complete their BS degrees in STEM disciplines and receive a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT). This program builds on DSU's NCATE-accredited teacher education program and the existing early field experiences partnerships with the Red Clay Consolidated and Lake Forest School Districts.  First year Noyce Scholars are introduced to teaching by pairing them with board-certified veteran mentor teachers for extensive field experiences. The Scholars also participate in Saturday round table meetings, and receive high-quality training in standards driven inquiry- and problem-based teaching, curriculum development, teaching with technology, and reflective practice. Further, Noyce graduates enroll in a First Year Teachers Seminar course at DSU and receive stipends for continued support and professional development during their crucial first year of teaching.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Delaware State University (DSU) Scholarships for Teachers in Mathematics and Science Program was funded by the National Science Foundation in September 2012.  The 5-year program was designed to recruit, mentor, and financially support our largely minority student population to become STEM graduates who are certified teachers in high-needs school districts with strong STEM content knowledge. The program was also designed to provide mentorship and financial support during their first year of in-service teaching. The funding was extended to include a sixth year for this program.  Noyce Scholars were awarded $10,000 in scholarships during their senior year of their STEM undergraduate program, $20,000 in scholarships during their Master?s of Teaching (MAT) program with an additional scholarship up to $2,500 during student teaching, and $2,500 in stipends and teaching supplies during their first year as an in-service teacher.  During each year of the program, Noyce Scholars participated in professional development each month during the Saturday Roundtable sessions.  Sessions were led by certified K-12 STEM teacher and members of the executive committee.  These sessions, in addition graduate coursework, prepared the Noyce Scholars to become STEM teachers by providing them with high-quality training in standards-driven inquiry-based and problem-based teaching, curriculum development, and teaching with technology to expose them to a variety of teaching methods. Noyce Scholars created lesson plans, conducted video analysis of their teaching, and presented their teaching and learning experiences to reflect on and improve upon their teaching practices.  Twenty-three Noyce Scholars were recruited to the program meeting 82% of the recruitment goal. The deactivation of the MAT program during year 4 of funding was a hindrance in reaching the recruitment goal. There were also challenges in retaining Noyce Scholars, such as deterrents that arose from evolving DSU Education Department policies and practices to meet state requirements and to attain accreditation, and passing the Praxis exams to enter the MAT program (Praxis I), or earn a MAT degree (Praxis II) to become a licensed teacher.  We found that students who were admitted to the Noyce program without meeting the GPA requirement had difficulty passing the Praxis II exam in their STEM content area.  Four Noyce Scholars were hindered in their progress in the MAT program by the Praxis II exam despite passing their coursework and receiving program support and extra tutoring for the standardized test. Thus, they were unable to complete the MAT requirement to earn their teaching licensure to become a certified K-12 STEM teacher.   Twelve Noyce Scholars withdrew from the Noyce Program due to challenges meeting entrance requirements to the MAT program, challenges completing coursework, or pursuing a different STEM career.  Six Noyce Scholars (66.6% African American, and 33.3% Caucasian) graduated with a MAT degree. Four of the graduates are employed in a high-needs school district, one is employed in a non-high-needs school district, and one switched to another STEM career path.  One additional Noyce Scholar will graduate with the MAT degree in December 2018.   Although the retention and completion rates were much lower than expected, the project did contribute to the STEM teaching population by training minority students to educate the next generation of mathematicians, scientists, and science-savvy citizens.
