<AbstractNarration>Understanding how neurons build an axon is central to understanding how cell-cell communication is established in the developing nervous system. This project focuses on how neurons coordinate the synthesis of the many structural proteins needed to make an axon with the signals that stimulate axon outgrowth. Whereas this coordination was once thought mainly to occur by regulating the transcription of genes into RNAs, new information indicates that much of it happens afterward by directing the trafficking of these RNAs for translation into proteins. In neurons of newly developing frog (Xenopus laevis) embryos, suppressing expression of the RNA-binding protein, hnRNP K, disrupts this trafficking, leading to the loss of both key axonal structural proteins and the axon itself. Building on preliminary data indicating that hnRNP K initially assembles into protein-RNA complexes within the nucleus as the targeted RNAs are being made, experiments of the first objective use reverse genetic approaches to characterize how this assembly occurs in developing neurons within the intact embryo. Experiments of the remaining two objectives use mutant forms of hnRNP K introduced into frog embryos, along with biochemical and histochemical assays, to characterize the cell-signaling pathways that govern hnRNP K?s activity during axon outgrowth. By providing new information about how neurons coordinate axon outgrowth with synthesis of the necessary structural proteins, this work has the potential to provide fundamentally new insights into how cells in general use RNA-binding proteins to jointly regulate the fates of functionally inter-related RNAs. The broader impacts of this work will be to provide research training for PhD students and undergraduates at a public university with a culturally diverse student body, and spinoffs from this work will impact courses in molecular and developmental biology and in neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>

This understanding has important implications for how the nervous system is wired during development, as well as for how synaptic connections are maintained and modified in adults. This project built on previous NSF-funded work demonstrating that the RNA-binding protein hnRNP K is crucially involved in this control. During both embryonic and regenerative axon outgrowth in the frog, <em>Xenopus laevis</em>, hnRNP K regulates the fates of multiple cytoskeleton-related RNAs whose proteins collectively organize the axonal cytoskeleton for axon outgrowth. The scientific objective of the current project was to test a mechanistic model whereby hnRNP K responds to extracellular signals to control the trafficking of axonal cytoskeletal protein RNAs. This work produced seven publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Goals for achieving broader impacts included the training of graduate and undergraduate students at an institution of higher education with a culturally diverse student body through providing opportunities for them to engage in laboratory research and contributing to courses and laboratory exercises in cellular, molecular, and developmental biology and in neuroscience.<br /><br />First and foremost, this project contributed to our understanding of how neurons coordinately control levels of expression of multiple cytoskeletal proteins in response to extracellular cues encountered by their growing axons. Because each successive stage of neuronal differentiation requires cytoskeletal proteins to emerge in the correct sequence, transcription of their genes into RNAs is typically regulated independently. Once the RNAs are transcribed however, the rate at which each is translated into protein must be continually adjusted to keep the proteins in balance with one another and with the demand for structural proteins to supply the growing axon. Maintaining this balance is crucial to prevent the formation of protein aggregates and for axon outgrowth to proceed normally. This project demonstrated that two kinases (JNK and ERK), long known to influence axon development, play crucial roles in modulating cytoskeletal protein synthesis by coordinately regulating translation of the mRNAs via hnRNP K. Prior to this work, these kinases were known principally as activators of gene transcription and modulators of protein transport. This project was the first to demonstrate that they also regulate translation of the mRNAs of essential cytoskeletal components into protein. This work has helped stimulate work in other labs now exploring the possibility that these kinases may act through hnRNP K to control local protein synthesis in other neuronal processes, including neurodegeneration and long term memory. <br /><br />Second, the project&rsquo;s finding that the stability of hnRNP K in <em>Xenopus</em> embryos is functionally intertwined with both its binding to RNAs and its nuclear import shed new light on the functions of nuclear localization signals in cells. Since the paper was published, this same phenomenon has been reported for other nuclear proteins, and thus is likely to be a general one influencing multiple nuclear proteins. The project&rsquo;s findings of how this works for hnRNP K shed new light on the mechanism behind a decades-old question of why levels of hnRNP K within the nucleus increase with higher levels of gene transcriptional activity. It also provided mechanistic insights into how cells maintain the proper balance between levels of RNA-binding proteins and those of their nucleic acid targets. This balance is increasingly seen as important for understanding the formation of pathogenic protein aggregates. <br /><br />Third, the project&rsquo;s finding that splicing of specific introns is instructive for subsequent trafficking and translation of cytoskeletal RNAs needed for axon outgrowth suggests a new role for intron splicing in neurons. Although introns were known previously to play generalized roles in promoting gene expression, the observation that splicing of a specific intron is essential for directing the subsequent intracellular trafficking of the RNA of an important axonal cytoskeletal protein was novel. This observation has important implications for RNA-binding proteins that both bind introns and later regulate neuronal RNA trafficking, stability, and translation. The results from this work suggests new experiments to test whether binding of proteins to specific introns precedes their binding to other regions of the mRNA to form a kind of code that directs thesubsequent fates of the RNAs within neurons.<br /><br />Fourth, the project&rsquo;s finding that the microtubule-associated-protein tau is required for the assembly <em>in vivo</em> of a specific class of brain microtubules sheds new light on the functions of this important neuronal cytoskeletal protein. <br /><br />In addition to supporting the work that led to these scientific findings, the project supported the development of young scientists, specifically the training of four female Ph.D. students and three undergraduates. Two of the Ph.D. students are now postdocs at CalTech and Columbia University. One of the undergraduates is now a Ph.D. student at Brown University and another is enrolled in medical school after having worked several years as a science teacher in public schools. <br /><br /></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/22/2018<br>      Modified by: Ben&nbsp;G&nbsp;Szaro</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257449/1257449_10248434_1529685382199_AxonalCytoskeleton-RelatedmRNPLifeCycleControlledbyhnRNPK06222018--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257449/1257449_10248434_1529685382199_AxonalCytoskeleton-RelatedmRNPLifeCycleControlledbyhnRNPK06222018--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Control of RNA Trafficking and Translation of Neuronal Cytoskeletal Proteins by hnRNP K"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257449/1257449_10248434_1529685382199_AxonalCytoskeleton-RelatedmRNPLifeCycleControlledbyhnRNPK06222018--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Control of RNA Trafficking and Translation of Neuronal Cytoskeletal Proteins by hnRNP K"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Splicing of specific introns leads to assembly of exported hnRNP K-containing mRNP complexes.
