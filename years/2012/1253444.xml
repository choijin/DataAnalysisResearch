<AbstractNarration>Understanding the fundamental mechanisms that govern polarized plant cell growth is an important unsolved problem in biology that is critical for future development of plants with improved growth characteristics. Polarized plant cell growth is a highly focused type of growth essential for land colonization, sexual reproduction, and water and nutrient uptake. A central player in the regulation of polarized cell growth is the actin cytoskeleton, an evolutionarily conserved assembly of dynamic nano-polymers (actin filaments) and nano-motors (myosins). The actin cytoskeleton is known to participate in the organization of components inside the cell, including endomembranes and secretory vesicles containing materials important for cell growth. The long-term goal of the research is to understand how the actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane compartments interact to generate polarized plant cell growth. Toward accomplishing this goal, the objective of the project is to determine the role of the motor myosin XI in the coordination between actin filaments, endomembranes, and polarized secretion of growth materials. The central hypothesis is that membrane compartments, such as secretory vesicles, function as active centers of organization where actin polymerization and myosin XI-based transport cooperate to produce polarized secretion. The following three specific aims are designed to test the central hypothesis using the moss Physcomitrella patens as a plant model system: 1) identify the membrane compartments associated with myosin XI;  2) identify the receptors that anchor myosin XI to its membrane cargo; and  3) determine how myosin XI, actin polymerization, and endomembranes cooperate to regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton during polarized cell growth. The project will investigate a novel mechanism for polarized secretion based on the cooperation of myosin XI and actin polymerization using unique genetic tools developed to reduce overall myosin XI activity or only its cargo binding activity. The research provides a viable model for cell polarization driven by the concerted action of endomembrane compartments, myosin XI, and a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. In addition to contributing to the basic understanding of biology, the knowledge obtained from this project has the potential to identify strategies to improve plant reproduction, plant fitness, and plant growth. These improvements can impact agricultural science by promoting the development of plants with characteristics necessary for a more sustainable future. From an educational perspective, the project impacts the rapidly advancing field of biology where there is an increasing need for microscopy and imaging education and training. In order to integrate these disciplines within the general biology curriculum, a new microscopy and imaging course will be implemented. The goal of the laboratory and inquiry-based course is to train students to apply microscopy in research both in class and as part of independent research projects. The new course will have a modular format that allows the use of some of its parts for outreach programs.  The project also provides opportunities for improving presentation and networking skills during the postdoctoral experience through the continued development of a social networking tool (LectureBank.org) for postdoctoral scholars with an emphasis on underrepresented minority life scientists.  The tool serves as a peer-to-peer mentoring resource and provides a forum for sharing materials and experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Plants are the primary producers of food, fuels, and a variety of other valuable resources. Increasing our knowledge of plant cell function is essential for selecting and developing plant traits necessary for a more sustainable future.</p> <p><strong><span>Intellectual Merit</span></strong></p> <p>The current work applied a variety of cell biological strategies to further our understanding of how plant cells grow. &nbsp;We investigated the&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;dynamic of endomembrane vesicles in tip growing cells of the model plant, the moss&nbsp;<em>Physcomitrella patens</em>. We measure the diffusion coefficient of these vesicles using a combination of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and computer simulations. Using mathematical modeling, we determined that exocytic vesicle diffusion alone could drive vesicle-dependent growth, but that to attain the faster growth rates observed in moss cells, a vesicle-concentrating mechanism was necessary. We found that the actin cytoskeleton provides this mechanism in combination with the vesicle-associated motor, myosin XI. We determined that the association of myosin XI with vesicles and filamentous actin is fast and transient. We generated a temperature-sensitive allele of myosin XI and used it to uncover a mechanism for the concentration of secretory vesicles, which is dependent on myosin XI clustering vesicles. This mechanism suggests a positive feedback loop in which myosin XI-induced vesicle clustering triggers rapid actin polymerization, resulting in polymerization dependent vesicle transport. We also identified the small GTPase RabE1 as the myosin XI vesicle receptor in plants. Using a combination of protein-protein interaction assays, genetics, and microscopy, we showed that RabE1 is essential for cell growth and that its interaction with myosin XI is vital for polarized cell growth.</p> <p>We also investigated the regulation of the apical cytoskeleton and vesicle secretion by the secondary messenger, cytosolic calcium. We found that&nbsp;<em>P. patens</em>&nbsp;tip growing cells have an apical localized cytosolic calcium, that oscillates rapidly and with a period similar to that of oscillations of actin filaments and apical vesicles. In addition, we found that moss cells have a robust cytosolic calcium response to the fungal elicitor chitin, a molecular derived from fungal cell walls. When moss cells are treated with chitin, the apical cytosolic calcium rapidly dissipates, and slower but more sustained calcium oscillations appear that expand the whole cell. Tip growing stops completely, and the apical F-actin is lost, while cortical F-actin associated with the plasma membrane seems intact. We identified the chitin receptor as the moss homolog of Lyk5 from vascular plants, showing that the calcium response to chitin is evolutionarily conserved in land plants.</p> <p>Other outcomes include the development and analysis of temperature-sensitive mutants for genetics. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified a novel gene (CLoG1), necessary for cell growth and conserved in all plants. CLoG1 protein localizes to both ends of depolymerizing microtubules, which is consistent with its function increasing microtubule dynamics.&nbsp; In the cell, this protein localizes at the growing tip, supporting a link between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in guiding polarized growth.</p> <p>From the tool development perspective, we created a novel selection system for RNAi-based gene silencing. The system allows for the selection of plants that are actively undergoing RNAi. This selection is achieved by fusing, in tandem, sequences that silence the endogenous adenine phosphoribosyltransferase gene, resulting in plants resistant to the chemical 2-Fluroadenine. We showed that this system is amenable to automatic microscopy-based phenotyping, and allows for the direct evaluation of the level of silencing by immunoblotting and quantitative RT-PCR. The method also allows for transient complementation (rescue) and the rapid assessment of mutant phenotypes in only eight days.
