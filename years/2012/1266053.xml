<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "Southeast Analysis Meeting: SEAM 2013" that will be held March 15-16, 2013, on the campus of Virginia Tech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event is the latest in a twenty-eight-year-long series that has hosted conferences covering a wide spectrum of subareas of analysis and that has become the leading venue in the U.S. for function-theoretic operator theory. SEAM 2013 will again span a broad swath of analysis, featuring plenary speakers who will address the following topics: operator theory (Anna Skripka), mathematical physics (Fritz Gesztesy), harmonic analysis on fractals and associated wavelet and multiscale analysis (Palle Jorgensen), free noncommutative analysis (Dmitry Kaliuzhnyi-Verbovetskyi). The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
