<AbstractNarration>Kinetic City After School is a project supported by a prior NSF award that has produced over 80 activities in areas typical of after school activities such as computer games/simulations, hands-on activities, active play, and art and writing. This pathways project, KC Empower, will redesign and test five activities of the 80 activities currently developed by Kinetic City using a new approach to increase the representation of children and youth with disabilities in informal science settings. The project will test how universal design principles can be integrated with new technologies, not available when most after school STEM content was created, to address the needs of students with disabilities. The technologies used in the redesign include advanced mobile platforms and applications; search engines that sift through audio, image and video files; gaming input devices that respond to body movements; and information restructuring that allows multiple representations of content. The project will test how universal design guidelines will work with new technologies, in the short-term providing hands-on activities more accessible to students with disabilities, while increasing access for all students. The project is expected to lead to a full scale development project that will update all modules in Kinetic City After School. The target audience is 3rd - 5th grade students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis of the project is that designing for disability can strengthen activities designed to increase science knowledge.  Rather than making accommodations for persons with disabilities, it is the environment and design that are disabled, and it is better educational practice to rethink the activity from the point of view of all learners, including those with disabilities. Thus the use of universal design will address how best to present material for all users while influenced by the challenges presented by disabled users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes the Coalition for Science After School, the Center for Applied Special Technology and the Afterschool Alliance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[KC Empower: Universal Access to After School STEM Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a framework to provide learning opportunities for all children, regardless of cognitive/behavioral, sensory or motor disabilities. The "Universal" part of UDL means that all learners are given all the options&mdash;there isnÆt one "regular" activity, and an another special version of the activity for the blind kids, and another one for the deaf kids, etc. However, today very few Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning activities are designed using UDL principles. The KC Empower project aimed to see if UDL can make STEM activities more accessible and effective and to provide guidance for activity designers interested in using UDL.

These changes made the activity more accessible to children with disabilities, but it still required a high level of caregiver interaction to keep children engaged.  Finally, Respiration Relay was a physical game in which children model the cardio-respiratory system, playing the roles of several organs and red blood cells that ferry oxygen molecules, in the form of red balls, and CO2 molecules, in the form of blue balls,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
