<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this study is to determine how variation within a single species can influence the transfer of energy and materials in stream food webs.  The proposed research will use a model system for evolutionary studies, the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata), to determine how two phenotypes of a single species can influence ecosystem processes in streams.  Streams on the island of Trinidad occur in parallel watersheds that have similar environmental gradients with locally adapted populations of guppies.  Two phenotypes have been established in previous studies: guppies from streams with predators, and guppies from streams without predators.  These two guppy phenotypes are likely to influence the ecosystem in unique ways because of differences in how they feed and what they eat.    This study uses a replicated experiment to examine how both guppy phenotype and resource availability influence ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of how within-species variation affects ecological processes will provide additional insight into interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes, which may be widespread and significant.  Many people are familiar with guppies because of their prominent role in the aquarium trade, making them an accessible system to communicate scientific research about evolutionary ecology.  This work will also inform studies of how land use change alters stream ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this project was to examine how sunlight availability influences stream food webs.  Rates of primary production in small, forested streams are often very low and limited by light availability, so we expected that carbon sources in the form of plant tissue from surrounding terrestrial systems would be an important resource for consumers (e.g., insects and fish) in small streams.  In mid-size streams, we expected that more open canopies and higher light availability would increase primary production and make algae a more important food source for consumers.  During the first year of this project, we conducted an experiment in artificial stream channels with varying light availability and fish phenotypes, but unexpectedly rainy weather conditions in the dry season led to low algal growth and prevented us from evaluating the influence of light on food webs.  During the second year, we switched to a comparative approach and collected samples of resources (stream algae and terrestrial leaf inputs) and consumers from nine streams in the Northern Range of Trinidad, Trinidad and Tobago.  Analyzing hydrogen stable isotopes of the samples allowed us to determine how much energy the consumers assimilated from terrestrial versus aquatic food resources.   We also evaluated how flexible the diets of a range of consumer species are by comparing the type of energy they used in streams with different extents of canopy cover.   Consistent with expectations, the importance of terrestrial subsidies was positively correlated with canopy cover, with animals from small, shaded streams having a larger terrestrial component of their diets than did animals from larger streams with more open canopies.  Hydrogen stable isotopes were effective for this research because we were able to find clear differences in the signal of terrestrial versus aquatic food resources.  These results demonstrate that consumers in freshwater systems can be very flexible in the source of the energy-containing food they assimilate, and that some individual species can vary between assimilating entirely terrestrial to entirely aquatic food sources.  While terrestrial energy subsidies are often important in stream food webs, environmental conditions (e.g., canopy cover, light availability) are important drivers of food web pathways. Reductions in canopy cover are often associated with changes in the land use of watersheds surrounding streams, so our results suggest that anthropogenic changes in watersheds may have strong effects of food web pathways in streams.   This award supported the PhD research of one graduate student and provided training for five field interns with BS degrees and four undergraduate lab assistants.
