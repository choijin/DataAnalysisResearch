<AbstractNarration>This project is a workshop gathering together scholars with expertise in resource governance.  It will focus on deployment of alternative property rights regimes, addressing how different practices allocate resources.  As a result of a sharp rise in demand for agricultural commodities,essential resources are increasingly considered scarce and subjected to commercial pressures: worldwide, they are seen as valuable economic assets. This is leading to the commodification of these resources and, in turn, the land on which they are found, all for managing scarce resources that are essential to livelihood. Such essential resources include water, food, and forests (the latter because of their role as carbon sinks). Access to these goods will depend for the foreseeable future directly or indirectly on control over the land that harbors them. How to manage land to ensure broad access to scarce, essential resources is therefore a critical issue, yet one for which we lack good answers. In order to develop effective governance regimes for scarce, essential resources, it is vital to develop dynamic models that (1) focus on access and sustainability, not exclusion and growth; and (2) account for a wide and varying range of stakeholder interests. The goal of this project is to develop a framework of such regimes.&lt;br/&gt;Contributions to the workshop will be framed as a dialogue between theoreticians and practitioners and allow for full-length papers as well as comments. The output of the workshop will be published in an edited book.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project "Governing Access to Essential Resources" was designed to reconceptualize the use of property rights and the market mechanism in the allocation of drinking water and other "essential resources". These resources are indispensable for the survival of every human being. The major challenge we face is how to ensure that essential resources are made avaiable to everyone irrespective of status or purchasing power without opening the flood gates to the depletion of scarce resources on which all of us depend.  There are no obvious simple solutions to such dilemma. However, a detailed comparison of governance approaches in different countries and settings (i.e. both rural and urban) suggests that balances can be struck and solutions are not completely beyond reach.   At the heart of this project was a 2 day conference that brought together senior and junior researchers with extensive field work experience from the arid West of the US to Indonesia, Nepal to Kenya, and theoretical grounding in fields including law, economics, sociology and anthropology. The core findings of the project can be summarized as follows:  Every governance regime has the tendency to exclude, i.e. to draw the line between those who benefit from a regime and those who don't Exclusion is and can be modified through institutional intervention that is allows for selective inclusion Inclusion is a core feature even of property rights regimes in modern market economies (including the common law), which rely extensively on the right to exclude How exclusive or inclusive a governance regime is, is not simply a question of instituional design, but of political economy: of existing power relations and their institutional manifestations Governance solutions that offer inclusion require two ingredients: voice and reflexivity, where voice stands for the ability of all with a claim to essential resources to express their preferences, and reflexivity for the willingness of those with stronger access rights to respect these rights and modify their access rights accordingly.   These insights are now used to develop research projects in different countries with local researchers to develop a deeper understanding of the "tragedy of exclusion."
