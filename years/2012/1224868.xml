<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on nationwide improvement of student learning in undergraduate biochemistry courses through design, implementation and evaluation of classroom activities and materials which target threshold concepts, by a group of over 50 faculty experts from diverse backgrounds. Threshold concepts are concepts that, when mastered, represent a transformed and integrative understanding of a discipline, without which the learner cannot progress. The project goals follow a cycle that uses assessment data and community input in a feedback loop to improve student learning. Materials will be disseminated through a project web site and at regional and national conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The molecular life sciences, including biochemistry, touch many aspects of life in broader society including medical care, pharmaceuticals, food technologies, and alternative energy technologies.  As a result, it is essential for society to have scientific and medical personnel who have a deep understanding of biochemical concepts as well as proficiency with a number of transferrable skills including problem solving and critical thinking. The aim of this project is to stimulate changes in biochemistry teaching nationwide with the goal of improving undergraduate biochemistry learning. Improving the quality of undergraduate education in biochemistry is anticipated to have a positive impact on society by improving the quality of medical and scientific professionals.  Threshold concepts are concepts that, when mastered, represent a transformed understanding of a discipline, and without which the learner cannot progress. They are therefore crucial in learning in a discipline. As a discipline, biochemistry has a set of concepts that biochemists agree are essential for undergraduates studying biochemistry to master. Yet we know from classroom experience that many students fail to master these concepts. By focusing on student understanding of threshold concepts in biochemistry, instructors can maximize the impact of classroom instruction toward learning achievement.  The goal of this project was to use a systematic approach to improve student learning in undergraduate biochemistry courses nationwide.  Working together with a community of biochemists, biologists and chemists, we accomplished the following:  Identified threshold concepts that are critical for learning in biochemistry (Image 1)  Designed classroom activities to target these concepts Measured changes in student learning Disseminated classroom activities and assessment tools Developed a sustained community of educators committed to continual improvement in teaching and learning in undergraduate biochemistry nationwide (Image 2)   Throughout its lifespan, the project followed a cycle that uses assessment data and community input in a feedback loop to improve student learning.
