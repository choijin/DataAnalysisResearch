<AbstractNarration>The Lawrence Hall of Science and the Department of Geography and Center for Atmospheric Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), in collaboration with Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and the University of Washington's (UW) Department of Atmospheric Sciences, are working to improve public climate literacy by designing and developing sessions for a new college course that includes an outreach practicum at a local informal science education institutions (ISEI), such as a museum, science center or aquarium. This course provides undergraduate and graduate students - future scientists - with cross-disciplinary knowledge of public climate literacy, how people learn, and how to engage in effective interactions with non-scientists. Students practice and apply their knowledge in a local ISEI, which serves to both increase the public's understanding of climate change and reinforce the student's understanding of climate science. The goals of this project are to: 1) develop the science communication skills of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty, at UCB, SIO, and UW; 2) advance the public's climate literacy, including their understanding of climate change science, its social, political and economic contexts, and its impacts on their local environment and community, through the outreach efforts of the students in this course; and 3) serve as a model to improve cross-disciplinary dialog about climate change and climate literacy within universities, and develop partnerships between universities and their local ISEIs. This 18-month project includes collaborative development of multi-disciplinary college course sessions for a new course, Promoting Climate Literacy, which will be piloted by science faculty at the three collaborating universities and serve as a model for future dissemination efforts.</AbstractNarration>

Students taking Promoting Climate Literacy learn key climate science concepts relevant to understanding climate change; how people learn, behave, and make decisions; and how to use climate science and social science knowledge to practice communicating climate change to the public. The course was designed by the team that developed Communicating Ocean Sciences, offered in ~25 institutions across the country. This new course is important because one of the biggest challenges in climate change is how to communicate it effectively to the public.  College students have the opportunity to deepen their understanding of science concepts in profound ways through carefully crafted experiences to learn climate science alongside learning how learning happens, and through opportunities to grapple with explaining climate science concepts to the public.

Promoting Climate Literacy materials include learning research based on how people learn and make decisions; climate science that revisits and reinforces studentsÆ knowledge of relevant science ideas; opportunities for students to make connections and reflect on and relate to their own understanding, experiences, assumptions, and biases; and interactive activities for students to practice communicating climate science with their peers and the public. Specifically the course includes:  1)    12 fully described sessions which contain background information for the instructor about the learning, social and cognitive sciences addressed in the sessions; at-a-glance descriptions; timeframe; materials; student handouts; and a fully detailed session description with step-by-step instructions for the instructor on how to implement.  2)    Two types of slide presentations including science briefings focused on climate science topics designed with embedded active learning strategies; and session slides which follow the session write-ups and include discussion prompts, suggested homework, instructions for student activities etc.  3)    Climate science and climate change activities designed based on research about how people learn, for students to use for outreach.  UC Berkeley hosted a 2-day InstructorÆs Workshop February 23-24, 2015 for participants from 20 different institutions with plans to teach the course or include sessions into their existing courses. The InstructorÆs Workshop provided faculty from multiple institutions around the country with the course curriculum and supporting instructional materials,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
