<AbstractNarration>Under this grant, the PI will work on problems regarding the geometry and topology of groups generated by involutions.   The first  problem involves a new geometric criterion for when a Coxeter group is a Kleinian group. Specifically, if the defining graph of a right-angled Coxeter group can be realized as the 1-skeleton of an acute triangulation of the 2-sphere, is the Coxeter group hyperbolic?  This relates the techniques of geometric group theory and classical 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to combinatorial problems concerning triangulations. As part of this study, the PI will investigate the moduli space of an acute triangulation of the 2-sphere.  In particular, is this space connected?  A second question asks when a group generated by reflections in hyperbolic 3-space contains a knot group.   This is deeply related to understanding commensurability of knot complements. More broadly, the PI seeks to address the conjecture that there are at most three hyperbolic knot complements in any given commensurability class.  Boileau, Boyer, Cebanu, and the PI have made significant progress on the conjecture in recent work, and this project aims to address the remaining case.  In a third project, the PI seeks a CAT(0) space for the group of outer automorphisms of the free product of four copies of the integers mod 2.  This group of outer automorphisms is particularly pleasing and related to the proposal as it is generated by involutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups generated by involutions have long been guiding examples in furthering the understanding of the geometry of groups.  They are inherently geometric and relevant to the modern theory of orbifolds. These groups have been studied in various ways by Coxeter, Thurston, Davis, and Moussong, as well as by many other celebrated mathematicians, and they continue to inform current research. Imposing some condition, such as the presence of a reflection, allows one to gain traction on a difficult problem and eventually see the whole picture.   The projects proposed here have potential impact in other fields.  For example, the study of triangulations, particularly acute triangulations, is important in computer-aided design and scientific computing.</AbstractNarration>

Walsh, "The bumping set and the characteristic submanifold". Algebraic and Geometric Topology Vol 14 (2014) 283--297.   I will describe two of these here.  In "Knot complements, hidden symmetries, and reflection orbifolds" (4) we work with the complements of knots in the three-sphere.  The three-sphere can be obtained by starting with R^3, and adding a "point at infinity".  A knot complement is obtained after you remove a knot (a string with its ends identified) from the three-sphere.  This is actually a somewhat complicated process where the knot goes to infinity.  Sometimes these knot complements can be made from polyhedra, where all of the polyhedra are isometric and one is obtained from the next via reflection.  In this case we say that the knot complement is commensurable with a reflection orbifold. This occurs very rarely; exactly three cases are known amongst hyperbolic knot complements.   These exact three knot complements are only ones known to admit "hidden symmetries": roughly, an excess of symmetries in some cover. This paper postulates that these two phenomena occur for exactly the same knot complements and proves this in special cases.      In "Right-angled Coxeter groups, hyperbolic cubes, and acute triangulations", we apply the study of reflection groups to the problem of understanding acute triangulations of the sphere.  Acute triangulations are important in part because certain algorithms run more efficiently with acute triangulations of data sets.  Here we classify triangulations of the sphere which can be realized as acute triangulations.   A geodesic triangulation is acute if all the dihedral angles are less than 90 degrees.  We show that a combinatorial triangulation of the two-sphere can be realized as an acute triangulation exactly when the associated reflection group (Right angled Coxeter group defined by the one-skeleton of the triangulation) is hyperbolic and one-ended.  This can also be characterized combinatorially: the triangulation of the 2-sphere is flag no-square.   The proof of this combinatorial characterization is proven using geometric group theory and hyperbolic geometry.      Broader Impacts:  I am happy to co-organize the weekly Geometric Group Theory and Topology seminar at Tufts, which draws mathematicians from the local area.  I am also the faculty sponsor for the Tufts Chapter of the Association of Women in Math.  I regularly give talks at seminars and in other venues about my work.   Two organizing activities should be highlighted: in Fall 2013, I was a co-organizer for a semester program at ICERM (the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, in Providence) which included three conferences, numerous semester visitors and a weekly seminar.  More recently, I was a co-organizer for a workshop at AIM (the American Institute of Mathematics, in San Jose), where approximately 30 mathematicians gathered to teach each other and work on current problems.  Several research projects have arisen from the workshop.        Last Modified: 10/18/2016       Submitted by: Genevieve S Walsh]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
