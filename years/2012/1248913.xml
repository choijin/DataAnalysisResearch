<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of the growth of coilable single-crystal fibers of doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) of sufficient quality to improve the performance of high-power fiber lasers. Single crystal fibers are an intermediate between laser crystals and doped glass fibers.  They can combine the advantages of both by guiding laser light and matching the efficiencies found in bulk crystals, making them ideal candidates for high-power laser and fiber laser applications.  The technical challenge is to synthesize a cladded flexible fiber with a core of dopant (Er, Nd, Yb, etc.) that will exhibit good waveguiding properties. To achieve this, the Phase I technical objectives will be centered around the execution of various types of experiments to grow cladded YAG out of various feedstocks, followed by the characterization of each grown crystal and finally, the demonstration of lasing effects in cladded Nd:YAG.  Successful completion of this project will culminate in the demonstration of flexible doped YAG fibers 200 mm in length, with doped cores 20 microns in diameter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is an improvement in the performance of fiber lasers for industrial applications. The worldwide market for lasers in 2011 was $7.5 billion.  Technology areas which will be primarily impacted by this material innovation are material processing, medical, scientific/military, and instrumentation/sensors.  The market for material processing lasers is $2.8 billion, and $1.2 billion for the other listed areas.  The proposed work would enable laser manufacturers to commercialize higher-power, more efficient lasers.  The market share of crystal fiber lasers is expected to grow to at least 10%, because of their performance capabilities.  In the most conservative scenario, the cost of a crystal fiber component is estimated to be 2% of the selling price of the laser; therefore, the total addressable market for the crystal fibers themselves will be $2 million.  By adding in associated gain modules and subsystems, the revenue potential of this product line increases to over $10 million.  Further growth will be possible by enabling new applications with the unique properties of crystal fiber lasers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[I.A Identification and Significance of the Innovation  Shasta Crystals is developing coilable doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) fibers to serve as laser gain media. The proposed work will exert a transformative impact on laser technology by lowering the cost of ownership for high-power lasers.   Market for Fiber Lasers: The worldwide market for fiber lasers grew to $637M in 2011. Materials processing applications such as cutting, welding, drilling, and marking metal accounted for more than half of fiber laser sales. To maximize the penetration of fiber lasers in these and other market segments, it will be necessary to increase their output power.  Power Limitations of Conventional Fiber Lasers: Conventional fiber lasers in which the gain medium consists of a single fused silica fiber can emit only about 1.2 kW of power. This limit stems from the physical properties of rare-earth-doped silica fibers, such as their low thermal conductivity, low stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) threshold, and low thermal damage thresholds.  The Potential of High-Power Fiber Lasers with Single-Crystal YAG Gain Media: Single-crystal fibers of yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG, Y3Al5O12) provide a potential pathway to fiber lasers with higher output power. Compared with amorphous silica fibers, single-crystal YAG fibers offer higher thermal conductivity, higher SBS threshold, higher melting temperature, and higher doping concentrations, as well as excellent environmental stability.  Fiber lasers with amorphous silica gain media already represent the fastest-growing laser technology. Single-crystal YAG gain media will accelerate the market penetration of fiber lasers by enabling them to displace CO2 lasers in high-power applications. The higher thermal conductivity of YAG fibers will enable fibers lasers to operate with higher efficiency. The higher efficiency will translate into both lower capital costs (fewer diode lasers to supply pumping power) and lower operating costs (for cooling). I.B Technical Approach  To fabricate single-crystal YAG fibers as laser gain media, the technical challenge is to synthesize a cladded flexible fiber with a core of dopant (such as Er, Nd, or Yb), that will exhibit good waveguiding properties. Laser Heated Pedestal Growth (LHPG) offers a competitive advantage over other techniques for growing single-crystals fibers for this application.The growing crystal spontaneously assembles itself into the configuration necessary for a fiber laser gain medium: a flexible fiber with a highly doped core and an undoped cladding region. I.C Phase I Achievements  Dr. Maxwell Grew Single-Crystal Nd:YAG Fibers with a Doped Core and an Undoped YAG Cladding:  During Phase I, we grew single-crystal YAG fibers up to 300 mm in length. These fibers consisted of a doped core 20 microns in diameter surrounded by an undoped YAG cladding with an outer diameter of 70 to 100 microns.  EDS Measurements Revealed the Neodymium-Doped Core.  LHPG Apparently Cannot Concentrate Er, Yb, and Ho Dopants in the Center of the Fibers.  Dr. Maxwell Invented a New Process to Clad Doped Single-Crystal YAG Fibers with Polycrystalline YAG: To provide a cladding for LHPG-grown YAG fibers doped with ions such as Er, Yb, and Ho, which do not spontaneously congregate at the core, Dr. Maxwell developed a new sol-gel process to coat the as-grown fibers with polycrystalline YAG. She chose yttrium oxide (Y2O3) as the yttrium source and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3 . 9H2O) as the aluminum source. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed that this novel procedure yielded single-phase cubic face YAG. To our knowledge, we are the first team to fabricate a transparent, crack-free YAG fiber cladding.  The Fibers Exhibit Excellent Scattering Results:  We found that we could reduce scattering loss by annealing fibers at 1100?C for 12 hours and/or by cladding them with pure YAG made by sol-gel.
