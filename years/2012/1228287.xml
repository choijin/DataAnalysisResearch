<AbstractNarration>University of Washington proposes to support technical services on R/V Thompson, a 274? general purpose, global class research vessel, and R/V Barnes, a 66-foot coastal research vessel, both operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The proposal requests support for basic services.  They will provide at least two shipboard technicians on each cruise of R/V Thompson to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  As part of the basic services, they will maintain and operate the multibeam sonar systems on R/V Thompson.  For R/V Barnes, a technician is available to sail if desired by the chief scientists, though (s)he will often not sail due to space limitations. The technician will provide shared-use instrumentation for use by the scientists, and provide remote support as needed if a technician does not sail.  The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

Activities included characterization of the water column hydrography, near-bottom currents, microbial biogeochemical activity, and sediment transport near a river mouth, as well as student instruction and research activities.     Contributions within Discipline:     Provision of these sea-going research and educational facilities enabled marine scientists and investigators from the University of Washington and other institutions nationwide to study natural phenomena, and to instruct the future scientists and stewards of our marine ecosystems while they are embarked aboard state-of-the-art oceanographic research vessels that are well equipped with laboratories, sensors, analytical equipment, communications links to shore-side scientists and educators, and computational and data processing systems.

R/V Thomas G.

The end of 2017 also marked the last full year of science cruises on the Barnes.  In early 2018, the new replacement coastal vessel, R/V Rachel Carson, began to conduct research cruises in Puget Sound.
