<AbstractNarration>When a single fertilized cell develops into an intricately patterned organism with multiple organs (such as the heart and liver), those organs grow to predetermined sizes; when problems occur that cause injury, growth retardation, or increased growth, organs still reach and then stop at their predetermined sizes. This is because of a process called the "organ size checkpoint". Despite years of study, how the organ size checkpoint works remains an important, fundamental question in biology. Utilizing the powerful genetic system of the fruit fly, several research teams discovered that a group of genes called the Hippo pathway work together as a "foreperson" or "overseer" of the organ size checkpoint. The Hippo pathway coordinates when cells in an organ grow, divide, or die by delegating other genes to carry out these tasks by turning these other genes on or off. The proposed studies will use cultured cells, biochemistry, and fruit fly genetics to identify these important other genes controlled by the Hippo pathway. Identifying these genes will advance our understanding of the fundamental regulation of cell division, cell growth, and cell death during development and will shed tremendous light on how organs grow to and are maintained at the appropriate size. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide high school, undergraduate, and graduate students with experiences catered to their diverse backgrounds and experience levels: younger students will learn to work and think independently while collaborating with advanced students who engage in detailed, hypothesis-driven experiments. Working and communicating as a team will give younger students a valuable foundation for a career in science and will help graduate students develop mentoring skills; therefore, this work will have a broader impact of training young scientists and instilling leadership skills they need to drive the next generation of scientific breakthroughs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Project outcomes from the three years of this NSF Award include significant advances to science in the field of the Hippo Pathway and signal transduction and also include the training and advancement of students at the high school, college, and graduate levels according to research and education objectives of the three aims proposed. Scientifically, we extended our characterization of multiple targets of the Hippo Pathway, a signaling pathway important in cell division, developmental patterning, and establishing organ size. This funding allowed us to identify and confirm dozens of new targets of the Hippo Pathway on which we made initial observations and initiated characterization (as described in Aims 1 and 2) which will lead to significant findings in the years to come. This funding also supported in-depth characterization of novel Hippo Pathway target Rae1 (as described in Aim 3) whose downregulation by the core cassette of the Hippo Pathway mediates, in part, the role of the pathway in restricting proliferation, reducing the levels of the mitotic cyclins, and restricting organ size. Moreover, this work revealed a novel feedback circuit by which Rae1 promotes the stabilization and activation of upstream components of the Hippo Pathway including Mer, Hpo, and Wts. Research observations from our lab during the three years of NSF support on these and related projects are included in five research articles published or in press in the journals PLoS One, JoVE, Journal of Cell Science, and PLoS Genetics. This work was also presented at international conferences with poster presentations and talks. Our findings from this support also comprise additional preliminary studies that will contribute to multiple research articles in the coming years. This project saw the completion of graduate training for two PhD students and made possible the lab training and in-depth research participation of more than a dozen high school, undergraduate, and post-bac students. High school interns achieved milestones including competing and participation in science fairs, paper co-authorship and acceptance to college; undergraduate interns achieved milestones including paper co-authorship and acceptance to medical or graduate school; and graduate students achieved milestones including authorship of papers and writing and successfully defending their dissertations. These students have remained in STEM fields or medical fields and have now moved on to study at the college, graduate, post-graduate, medical, and post-doctoral levels.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/29/2016<br>      Modified by: Cathie&nbsp;Pfleger</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
