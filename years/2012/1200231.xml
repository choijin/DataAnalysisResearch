<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is the development of physics-based crack evolution models in polycrystalline metallic materials for use in crystal plasticity finite element models.  The unified deformation-fracture models will be developed by upscaling variables from atomic-scale, molecular dynamics simulations with explicit depiction of the atomic structure and deformation mechanisms.  Upscaling will provide a framework for cohesive laws and associated evolution laws for deformation variables along specific slip systems.  A systematic approach will be undertaken, encompassing the following tasks: (i) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 3D crystalline lattice systems to simulate the evolution of ductile and brittle crack evolution under a variety of force fields, (ii) development of accelerated MD methods to simulate longer time scales consistent with experiments, (iii) characterization and identification of crack tip deformation mechanisms, followed by quantification of the local atomic structure and evolution, and (iv) development of energy-based laws governing crack growth in the process zone by partitioning the total energy corresponding to different physical mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefits to the scientific community will be accomplished through the establishment of novel crack evolution models of critical importance in analysis and design of materials for better fracture toughness and ductility.  Advancement in accelerated molecular dynamics modeling will allow modeling at strain rates of realistic experiments.  Collaboration with Sandia and Brown Deer Technology will enable technology transfer of deliverables for broader utilization.  Students will have strong interactions with eminent researchers at Sandia National Laboratories and a small-scale development company to see the direct impact of their work.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Predicting crack propagation, leading to failure of crystalline metals and alloys, is an important objective for determining material and structural life and reliability. However, it is a daunting task, since the progression of cracks in these materials inherently involve coupling of various deformation and failure mechanisms at multiple length and time scales, including atomic-scale bond-breaking, sub-micron scale defects and dislocation activities, micron-scale intra- and transgranular cracks in grains and grain boundaries, etc. A significant bottleneck is due to the fact that the crack growth phenomenon in crystalline alloys is not adequately characterized in the form of constitutive and crack models. There is a high demand for creating physics-based (as opposed to empirical models from experiments) robust models of crack evolution and growth in crystalline metallic materials that can be used in continuum level simulation methods such as crystal plasticity finite element models. Such developments necessitate the development of a rigorous coupled framework for concurrent simulations of continuum and atomistic models with well-defined interfaces for scale-bridging.</p> <p>Intellectual merit: To achieve the above objectives, this research has pursued a multi-pronged approach coupling molecular dynamics-based atomistic and crystal plasticity-based continuum models in a concurrent setting. The various thrust areas include:</p> <p>1. Molecular dynamics based study and characterization of deformation mechanisms near a crack in a crystalline material. The MD simulations are followed by characterization of atomic-level crack and deformation mechanisms, quantification of atomic-level deformation mechanisms and crack, and response analysis.</p> <p>2, Strain-boost hyperdynamics accelerated MD: To enable coupling MD simulations with continuum simulations, a strain-boost hyperdynamics based accelerated MD algorithm is developed that can achieve a strain rate of &sim; 10<sup>4</sup> which is significantly smaller than that of conventional MD i.e. ~10<sup>7</sup>.</p> <p>3. A self-consistent concurrent atomistic continuum coupled model with a hand-shake region is developed with finite temperature conditions. An efficient iterative solving algorithm finds the equilibrium configuration with reduced stress fluctuation. Non-linearity and non-locality of the material properties are investigated to ensure that the atomistic and continuum model have self-consistent description on the constitutive relation. The coupled model is efficiently implemented in parallel by using a finite element program combined with LAMMPS.</p> <p>4. Extracting crack propagation laws from the coupled model and application to higher scale continuum simulations. A crack propagation model is developed for single crystal nickel under mode I loading. It is observed that for critical loading, the crack propagates by bond cleavage, and the propagation speed accelerates until dislocations starting to nucleate. The initial brittle crack propagation regime, where elasticity governs, is investigated the crack propagation rate, energy release rate and stress distribution. The coupled model simulation results provide quantitative relation between propagation rate and applied stress intensity factor for brittle crack propagation. As the result of crack propagation, the degradation of the stiffness is captured by damage model in which the damage parameter is related to the crack length. A continuum finite element model using the crack propagation law extracted from coupled simulations.</p> <p>In summary, this work has systematically developed a robust multi-scale computational framework coupling atomistic-continuum models to explicitly model the physical process of crack propagation and associated deformation mechanisms with atomic resolution which can be used to extract the physics based crack propagation law.

This research has educated and trained 2 Ph.D. students.
