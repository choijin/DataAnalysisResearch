<AbstractNarration>This project will perform and analyze numerical magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the terrestrial magnetosphere with the aim to investigate the causes of large-scale, low-frequency turbulence in the plasma sheet and its implications for convection, transport, and the energy budget. With respect to potential causes of turbulence, the relative roles of turbulence in the upstream solar wind, reconnection, and other internal processes will be investigated. In addition, the role of coupling to the ionosphere will be examined.  A well-documented and successfully validated MHD model will be run on state-of-the-art NASA and NSF XSEDE supercomputer systems to perform a well planned set of high resolution idealized simulation runs as well as case studies driven by solar wind observations for real events.  For the latter, the results will be further analyzed and verified by comparison with magnetosphere observations from the THEMIS spacecraft. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turbulence is a phenomenon that occurs widely in fluid systems and turbulent processes are abundant in space plasmas. The Earth's magnetosphere is a natural laboratory for studying such processes, where both simulations and direct observations are possible. Results from this project therefore will have impact on a broad variety of research areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In fluids, large flows drive vortices which break up into a series of successively smaller ones.  At small scales fluid flow energy is dissipated. The equations of fluid dynamics predict the energy of the flow is partitioned among vortices of different sizes in a particular way.  At large scales, forces drive the largest vortices.  The vortices cascade to smaller scales in the intermediate inertial range and are dissipated at the smallest scales. In a plasma, an electrically conducting fluid, the situation is more complex but can be described by the equations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD). By solving these equations on a computer we can reproduce many features of a plasma system.       In this project, we investigated turbulence in the Earth?s magnetosphere, the region of space where the Earth?s magnetic field interacts with magnetic fields and particles from the Sun (the solar wind). In the direction opposite to the Sun, the magnetosphere is stretched out a long way, often extending beyond the orbit of the Moon, in a region known as the magnetotail.  Magnetic energy is supplied to the magnetotail from the solar wind and is released during disturbances called magnetic substorms.  During substorms, the magnetic energy is released in a process called magnetic reconnection that drives the large scale flows that cause turbulence.  We performed this study by performing global MHD simulations of the magnetosphere.  The simulations were for the most part driven by observed solar wind conditions and could be verified by using spacecraft observations in the magnetosphere.      Our simulations exhibited turbulence that has the properties seen in theory as well as in the spacecraft observations.  We studied the detailed causes of turbulence in the Earth?s magnetotail and its close relationship to the reconnection process. Turbulence has major consequences for transport.  Localized reconnection drives much of the magnetotail turbulence and its effects are manifested in fast flow channels that pile up the magnetic field in structures called dipolarizations that move earthward.  An important consequence of this large scale turbulent flow pattern is the generation of Pi2 pulsations, compressional fluctuations that are associated with substorms.      Here we show sample results from a simulation of a substorm on February 7, 2009 (see figure). The MHD simulation results show that the evolution of the magnetosphere during this substorm was complex.  The results were compared to time series of THEMIS spacecraft observations in the magnetotail; the simulation showed the formation of dipolarizations and strong flows at locations and times close to what the spacecraft observed and these had properties similar to the observations. The turbulent frequency spectra were comparable to the observations.  The three expected ranges: driving, inertial and dissipative, were seen. Notable features of the event include a large dipolarization growing by accreting smaller earthward-moving dipolarizations.  The dipolarizations were associated with a strong channel of earthward flow and a large vortex.  In the MHD simulation results, which are supported by the observations, strong narrow flow channels are a clear and persistent feature of magnetotail convection which exist at the driving scales for the turbulent spectra. Several dipolarization fronts were seen in the simulation.  The flows in these channels, combined with lower velocity return flows, form several large vortices in the plasma sheet at the center of the magnetotail where plasma pressure is maximum.  Nested vortices on multiple scales were seen in the simulation (see figure).  In MHD energy is dissipated through resistivity.
