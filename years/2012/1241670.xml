<AbstractNarration>This is a Collaborative Project consisting of two awards: NSF Award No. 1241651 to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and NSF Award No. 1241670 to Tuskegee University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The security of mobile computing is vital to the growing army of mobile device users. Educational materials and curricula focusing on mobile security are still sparse. In this project, four universities--the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Tuskegee University, Southern Polytechnic State University, and the University of Cincinnati--are collaboratively building research and education capacity in mobile security through curriculum development, curriculum enhancement, faculty professional development, and partnership development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are developing a course on mobile security, including teaching materials and hands-on labs and learning exercises; developing transferable modules that cover key topics in mobile security (secure coding, cryptography, security architecture, network security, web security, and security policy and management) and contain hands-on labs; integrating the modules into existing computer science and information assurance courses such as Operating Systems and Network Security; and hosting workshops to disseminate the curriculum materials to faculty at other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through these efforts, the project aims to build and strengthen curricula, student learning, and faculty collaboration and partnerships. The modular nature of the developed materials will aid their wide dissemination and usage, and all of the materials can be adopted in multiple disciplines, such as computer science, software engineering, information technology, and business.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project addressed the needs for national security in cyberspace through building capacity in mobile security with effective, engaging and investigative approaches. The project built capacity in mobile security in curriculum, faculty, and workforce development. This project developed lecture topics on mobile security such as mobile operating system security model comparison, threats and vulnerabilities in mobile application, secure development in mobile computing, using cryptography in mobile computing, security policy and governance, and etc. A collection of hands-on labs has been developed on mobile security such as mobile malware and defense, mobile authentication, injection and security, using cryptography is secure software development, and etc. Six modules on Cryptography, Secure Coding, Security Architecture, Network Security, Web Security, Security Policy and Management were developed and integrated into curricula in the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Tuskegee University, and Kennesaw State University, which built institutional capacity in participating institutions. Positive feedback from students demonstrated improved learning and increased interests through using developed pedagogical materials. This project sponsored two summer faculty development workshops to build faculty expertise on mobile security, and a two-half-day workshop at Tuskegee University for faculty members from Tuskegee to provide them with sufficient training so that they could go back and infuse mobile security concepts in their respective teaching areas.

The project also inspired multidisciplinary applied research and student research in cybersecurity, healthcare, and protection of critical infrastructure.
