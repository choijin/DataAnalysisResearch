<AbstractNarration>This project will provide scholarships for students with academic merit and unmet financial need pursuing Associates of Science (AS) and Associates of Engineering Science (AES) degrees and transfer opportunities with a concentration in STEM disciplines including Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Mathematics, Computer Science, and Engineering as well as their related fields at the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC). Over the course of three years, 45 - 60 STEM Scholars will be chosen and will benefit from the academic and financial support needed to persist in their endeavors while at CCC, and successfully transfer to a four-year institution. The scholarship program supports students in the second year of studies, covers expenses related to enrollment for their Fall, Spring and Summer semesters, and provides support for enrollment in a class at a Chicago area four-year institution (their transfer destination) during the scholarship period. As STEM Scholars, participants will have access to a wide range of academic and student support services as well as leadership development and community service opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide CCC with opportunities to continue to develop and expand these agreements with four-year institutions on behalf of all CCC STEM students. It will document effective practices for promoting success among a high-need, diverse, urban student population pursuing STEM degrees and serve as a model for other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Demographics:  It was our goal to mirror the overall diversity of the City Colleges of Chicago in this project.  According to CCC Fiscal Year 2016: Statistical Digest, 58% of the college credit students were female.  Our cohorts consisted of 54% females and 46% males. Additionally, 31% are self-identify as African American, 44% as Hispanic, 14% as Caucasian, 7% as Asian, 4% as Multi-racial Non-Hispanic, and 3% chose not to specify a race or ethnicity. We are proud to report that we have been able to work with a group of students whose diversity reflects that of the City Colleges of Chicago.  Financial Need:  Applicants in the program are required to complete a FAFSA to demonstrate their financial need.  99% of the total STEM scholar cohort (112/113) met all of the academic and financial requirements to keep their scholarship for each of the semesters during which they were enrolled in the program. Completion: The STEM Scholars program moves students towards degree completion and transfer to a four-year institution.  Degree completion information is posted in the CCC system in late May.  Based on degree audits, 93 student scholars, of the 113 enrolled in the program, completed their associate degrees (82%).  An additional 16 students (14%) transferred to 4-year institutions without earning their associate degrees. Students who have transferred before completing a degree will have the opportunity to transfer their credits back to CCC to complete the requirements of their associate degrees, and we continue to be in touch with them. The remaining 4 students (4%) neither transferred nor completed their associate degrees yet. Transfer:  The STEM Scholar award supports transfer to four-year institution with a scholarship of up to $3,000.  This information comes from periodic data updates provided by the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC), which reflects only enrollment reported by participating institutions and may not reflect all enrollments in all institutions. We also rely on direct communications with transferring student Scholars.  According to the NSC, there have been 101 students of all STEM Scholarship awardees (113 in total) who are enrolled in bachelor?s programs, 10 of whom have already graduated with a bachelor?s degree.  Summer Research Programs:  STEM Scholars are strongly encouraged to apply for Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU)/internships, for summer semesters.  This activity is seen as beneficial for students who are on a path to graduate with a bachelor?s degree in STEM fields. 24 of the total STEM Scholars cohort who are placed in summer REU/Internship programare listed in the following table: The volunteering took many forms, such as volunteering as a judge for the Chicago area science fair competition, and tutoring and mentoring students at the k-12 Chicago private as well as public schools.  Several of our students participated as judges for the annual Science Olympiad competition, and others worked as volunteers for the You Be the Chemist regional competition. Other STEM Scholars volunteered as math and science tutors for the refugee students in World Relief Chicago.  Furthermore, the STEM Scholars went on a trip to the Field Museum.  This is a large museum in Chicago that focuses on natural history. Which encouraged many of them to volunteer and earn internships with the museum. Seminars: The other core component of the course was attendance at two professional seminars.  Chicago, having multiple colleges, universities, and professional societies, gives our STEM scholars numerous opportunities to learn about the activities of professional scientists and engineers.  Many of our scholars went to public presentations of the Chicago Council on Science and Technology.  By attending seminars like these and others at universities, students were encouraged to go a little beyond their comfort level to learn more about what professionals do.  During our meetings, many of them remarked on their interest in both the topics, and the people they met. Mentoring: Through the same one credit course, INTDSP 299, students received mentoring by a STEM faculty member at their respective Colleges. STEM Scholars are to meet with their faculty mentor for one hour every week. During these meetings, students are not only directed to opportunities for community service and professional activities but also advised with their academic direction, career goals, personal statements and filling transfer applications. Graduation: Among the 113 student awardees, there are 80 students graduated with and associate in science (AS), 7 with associate in general studies (AGS), 3 with associate in engineering science (AES), 1 with associate in general studies-chemistry, 1 with associate in applied science-computer information systems (AAS), 1 with associates in arts (AA), 7 with associate in general studies (AGS), 16 scholars did not earn an associate degree but transferred to 4-year institutions, and 4 scholars neither graduated nor transferred to 4-year institutions yet. Earned 4-Year Degrees: Among the STEM student scholars, there have been 10 students who earned bachelor?s degrees.
