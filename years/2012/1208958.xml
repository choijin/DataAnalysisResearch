<AbstractNarration>This award supports a specialty conference entitled Biogenic Hydrocarbons and the Atmosphere to be held in June 2012, in Lewiston, Maine.  The conference will be convened under the auspices of the Gordon Research Conferences.  The focus will be on biogenic hydrocarbons and the atmosphere and will specifically target discussion of emerging findings on hydrocarbon biosynthesis in plants, the ecological role of hydrocarbons, and the range of hydrocarbon impacts on atmospheric processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include advancing our understanding of the influences of biogenic hydrocarbons on atmospheric composition, radiative transfer and climate.  In addition, the workshop will bring together established researchers and early career scientists, providing invaluable opportunities for professional interactions in a focused and productive forum.  The award will assist with covering the costs of travel and/or conference fees for 20 to 30 junior scientists.  In support of the conference theme, several sessions will include junior scientists as oral and poster presenters.</AbstractNarration>

There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.         Thank you for your support of this Conference.
