<AbstractNarration>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) proposes to support technical services on two global class research vessels, both operated as part of the U.S. Academic Fleet which is scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).  Ships to be supported are R/V Atlantis, a 274? general purpose research vessel and R/V Knorr, a 279? vessel of the same class.  R/V Oceanus, a 177? intermediate class vessel, changed from a ship operated by WHOI to a vessel operated by Oregon State University.  Support is requested for the period of transition in 2012, roughly 28 days.  As part of their basic operations WHOI will provide two technicians on each seagoing research project, and will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation, including use of the multibeam bathymetric sonars on Atlantis and Knorr. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHOI also proposes to provide several elements of specialized support for investigators, with separate charges. Specialized support requested for 2012 include &lt;br/&gt;1) Support for Sea Education Association (SEA) &lt;br/&gt;2) Tech Pool Pilot Program &lt;br/&gt;3) Support for the Vertical Plankton Recorded (VPR). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

It is only with the properly equipped and staffed sea-going platforms described in this proposal that new and transformative results in science can be achieved. The knowledge to be gained and the discoveries to be made as a consequence of this effort will enhance our understanding of ocean-earth phenomena and their impact on the Earth?s geological, biological, chemical, physical and climate processes.     The research vessels and technical support personnel represented by this award provide the at-sea laboratories and support infrastructure that will effectively and safely take the oceanographic research community to sea.  This scientific community includes a broad spectrum of ocean and earth researchers from a wide range of academic institutions throughout the US, post-doctoral and doctoral students, and undergraduate students as well as engineers, technicians, and teachers.  The research findings resulting from these cruises advance our understanding of the world?s oceans, its physical properties and ecosystems and from many tectonic and geographic environments that are studied to gain knowledge about the seafloor and earth history.  Several of the cruises will have informational web sites that will broadcast real-time images and live conversations about the research being conducted into educational classrooms.     The WHOI SSSG community continues to expand the impact of our funding with both large and small outreach initiatives. Throughout the year, when the ships are at Woods Hole (and at times when they are in other ports for extensive stops), we provide open ship tours of the vessels, manned and unmanned submersibles, and tours of institution facilities that are key to the development of new research tools and methods used by scientists using WHOI facilities. These tours range from "Open Ship" opportunities that are available to the general public, to highly organized groups of school children from area public schools. WHOI prides itself on reaching out to students with disabilities by participating in programs coordinated with the Perkins School for the Blind. These and other outreach program tours allow WHOI to take advantage of the research vessels when they are not actively working at sea, thereby increasing the utilization of these assets for the advancement of science.
