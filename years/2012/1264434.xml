<AbstractNarration>1264434&lt;br/&gt;Rothschild&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will involve three laboratories at the BU Photonics Center (Rothschild, Erramilli and Han) and utilize advanced spectroscopic and biophysical/bioengineering techniques along with collaborators at UC Davis Center for Biophotonics, MIT, Harvard University, and University of Texas. A central feature of the research will be the use of time-resolved FTIR difference spectroscopic, ultra-fast laser spectroscopy and confocal near-IR Raman techniques to measure molecular changes in optogenetic rhodopsins upon light excitation on a time-scale of seconds to femtoseconds. Preliminary work has demonstrated that a variety of optogenetic rhodopsins can be reconstituted into proteolipid membranes including nanolipidparticles and studied using advanced spectroscopic methods to obtain detailed molecular information about their function. In addition, spectroscopic studies have been extended to living cells allowing these proteins to be studied in their native environment in order to determine molecule effects of such factors as membrane potential. Collaborators on this project include: Dr. Ed Boyden at MIT, widely recognized as one of the co-founders of optogenetics and a leading developer of new neurophotonic technology; Dr. Matt Coleman at UCD, who has developed methods of expressing rhodopsins into nanolipidparticles (NLPs) and forming microcrystals suitable for coherent x-ray diffraction imaging (CXDI), Dr. John Spudich, at the U. Texas Med. School, a pioneer in the field of microbial rhodopsins and co-discoverer of channelrhodopsins and Dr. Adam Cohen, whose laboratory at Harvard University has recently demonstrated that rhodopsins can be used to monitor transmembrane voltage in living nerves.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project has been the spectroscopic characterization of native and mutant forms of channelrhodopsins (ChRs).  The aim is to use this knowledge to bioengineer customized forms of ChRs in a variety of research and biotechnological applications including understanding the basis for brain function and treating neurodegenerative diseases.  For this purpose, we have used a variety of advanced biophysical techniques, some of which were developed in our laboratory and first applied to light-absorbing membrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin. These methods provide a dynamic picture at the molecular level of the structural change which these proteins undergo once they absorb a photon of light.   Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are a type of microbial rhodopsin (Type 1 rhodopsin) found in algae which serve as   the primary photoreceptor for phototaxis.  Since their initial discovery in 2002  and subsequent expression in neurons to produce optogenetic control in 2005 by Boyden and Deisseroth, ChRs have revolutionized neuroscience and hold great promise in other biological and biomedical areas. Significant progress was achieved towards the goals of this project, the highlights of which are summarize below:  1)              Probing retinal structure in a red-shifted channelrhodopsin:  In this study, near-infrared confocal resonance Raman spectroscopy along with hydrogen-deuterium exchange and site-directed mutagenesis were used to study the structure of the retinal chromophore in a red-shifted ChR from Chlamydomonas augustae (CaChR1). ChRs with red-shifted absorptions are of great interest for optogenetic control of neurons since long-wavelength light can penetrate more easily through tissue such as in the brain.  Our studies revealed major differences for CaChR1 compared with the most commonly used and extensively studied optogenetic ChR, channelrhodopsin-2 from the unicellular algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrChR2).  For example, in contrast to CrChR2 which contain a mixture of all-trans and 13-cis retinal, we found that CaChR1 has only an all-trans retinal structure like the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR).   2)             Probing the ionization state of the residues located nearby the Schiff Base (SB):  In this set of studies, which involved both near-infrared confocal resonance Raman and FTIR-difference spectroscopy, the ionization state of key residues located near the SB in red-shifted CaChR1 was investigated.  We found that that at pH 7 Glu169 exists in a protonated form (i.e. neutral state), whereas Asp299 exists in an ionized form and serves as the predominant counterion for the protonated SB.  In a subsequent study, we discovered the existence of an unusual proton relay mechanism involving Glu169 and Asp299.  One interesting aspect of this model is the existence of an unusual charge neutrality of the residues in a position to serve as the Schiff base counterions in the P2380 channel conducting state suggesting that these residues may function as part of a cation selective filter in the open channel state of CaChR1 as well as other ChRs. 3)             Probing the Structure and Conformational Changes of an Anion Conduction Channelrhodopsin: Recently, a new class of natural ChRs, termed anion channel rhodopsins (ACRs), has been discovered. ACRs exhibit faster kinetics and less than 1/1000th of the light intensity required for neuronal silencing by the most efficient currently available optogenetic proteins. In this study, confocal near-infrared resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS) along with hydrogen/deuterium exchange, retinal analogue substitution, and site-directed mutagenesis were used to study the retinal structure as well as its interactions with the protein in the unphotolyzed state of an ACR from Guillardia theta (GtACR1). These results suggest that Glu68 and Asp234 located near the SB exist in a neutral state in unphotolyzed GtACR1 and indicate that other unidentified negative charge(s) stabilize the protonated state of the GtACR1 SB.  In a second study, we found that in contrast to BR and other microbial rhodopsins, which form only a stable red-shifted K intermediate at 80 K, GtACR1 forms both stable K and L-like intermediates.
