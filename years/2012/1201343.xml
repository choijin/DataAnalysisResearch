<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the workshops "Workshop in Analysis and Probability" that will be held on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University during the period, July 2 - August 10, 2012, and the summers of 2013 and 2014. The ongoing Workshop in  Analysis and Probability at Texas A&amp;M University brings together senior and junior  researchers and graduate students in several areas of analysis and probability as well as  researchers in other fields (such as geometry and theoretical computer science) in order to broaden the education of the younger participants and to promote interaction among researchers in various fields.  The Workshop also sponsors  three day  conferences (SUMIRFAS-Informal Regional Functional Analysis Seminar), Concentration Weeks, and mini-conferences.  These conferences include introductory lectures designed to acquaint junior researchers and non experts with the basics of an area as well as advanced lectures for experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop activities have a wide impact by providing intellectual stimulation for all participants as well as giving an opportunity to a diverse group of junior participants to increase the breadth and depth of knowledge and to interact with senior researchers in several areas of mathematics. There is also significant outreach to  applied mathematics and  computer science. Indeed, a very important aspect of the Workshop is to promote cooperation among researchers in different fields, and every Concentration Week involves participants from experts in two or more research areas.</AbstractNarration>

The Workshop featured the Concentration Weeks "Recent Advances in Harmonic Analysis and Spectral Theory" (2012), "Frame Theory and Maps Between Operator Algebras" (2012), "Dynamics, Geometry, and Operator Algebras" (2013), "Free Probability" (2013), "Groups, Groupoids, and Dynamics" (2013), and "From Commutators to BCP Operators" (2015), along with yearly installments of the three-day conference SUMIRFAS (Summer Informal Regional Functional Analysis Seminar) and around ten individual seminar talks each summer. The Concentration Weeks included introductory lectures designed to acquaint junior researchers and non-experts with the basics of a discipline as well as advanced lectures for experts. The Concentration Week "Recent advances in Harmonic Analysis and Spectral Theory" gathered two groups of experts, those specializing in complex and harmonic analysis and those working in the spectral theory of differential operators and mathematical physics, with the aim of studying new relationships and widening further participation in these areas in the United States.
