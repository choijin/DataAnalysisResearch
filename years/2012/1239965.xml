<AbstractNarration>The project "Teaching Pathways Opening Doors to STEM (TPOD STEM)" at Montgomery College is a project to build the college's capacity for preparing highly qualified secondary teachers in STEM disciplines.  Collaborating with the Montgomery County (Maryland) Public Schools and the major universities to which these community-college students transfer, the departments of mathematics, science, engineering, and education are engaged in a two-year planning process to recruit, prepare, and support students, both undergraduates in the Associate of Arts in Teaching program and career-changing STEM professionals seeking alternative certification.  The capacity of the existing secondary school alternative certification program is being expanded.  A new middle-school mathematics/science alternative certification program is being designed and approved by the state.  A recruiting model for both levels of future teachers is under development, along with support networks (both physical and virtual) to ensure their success, an important feature of this three-campus institution.  With the solid grounding in STEM courses provided by the AAT program, students are well positioned to transfer to STEM majors at baccalaureate institutions while continuing their teacher preparation.  Mechanisms for their ongoing support as Noyce Scholars are planned.  It is expected that this model can be emulated by other community colleges across the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The single primary goal for this grant project was to increase the number and diversity of highly qualified science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) teachers going into the classroom, by designing, developing and supporting coordinated pathways into K-12 mathematics and science teaching careers for current Montgomery College students and the large population of skilled mathematics and science professionals in the community who may desire to enter the teaching field.    Key results from the grant work included the following:  Adapted from the      nationally-recognized Learning Assistant (LA) program at the University of      Colorado at Boulder, the Montgomery College program has shown great      promise in several areas which impact STEM teacher recruitment and      development. Students in this program have the chance to "try on      teaching" and provide benefit to the students enrolled in the courses      they serve as well as learning from their mentor teachers.  Growing from the fall 2013 semester,      with 18 students in 10 different courses ranging from developmental      mathematics to advanced computer applications, this program during the      spring 2015 semester involved 36 students in 15 different courses across      all fields of STEM and all three campuses of Montgomery College.  At least two of these LAs have      transferred on to four year schools with a focus on becoming STEM teachers,      a change from their career goals before their LA experience.  More such students are in the pipeline      now.    Faculty mentors for the Learning      Assistant program learned to value the importance of recruiting and      encouraging future STEM teachers as they mentored their assigned LAs and      interacted with students in their classes and during advising sessions. Awareness      of STEM teaching as a career option is growing through the exposure      received from this program.   An      advanced learning community connecting      physics and chemistry first courses was developed with funding support      from this grant.  This learning      community, titled "Curie-us Interactions,"  was planned to provide a follow-up      course pair for students who enroll in first semester calculus and are      considering a variety of STEM focused careers, including teacher      education.  Teachers, students, LAs      and course activities were utilized to emphasize the pedagogy involved in      science education as well as the course content.    The STEM-Education Community Club      provided the opportunity for students to be an active part of the      community surrounding Montgomery College by volunteering at a variety of      science and mathematics outreach events and camps, such as Frontiers in      Science and Medicine and Adventures in Science. The work of this      organization supported the research showing that participating in      activities which "make a difference" can encourage entry into      teaching careers.    Montgomery College, in partnership with Montgomery County Public Schools, offers a Maryland Approved Alternative Preparation Program with a focus on recruiting and preparing teachers in high need areas such as STEM.  As a result of this grant, the program now includes two new areas, middle school mathematics and middle school science, with particular focus on teaching grades four to nine: the first cohort to include this certification area will have their own classrooms for the first year in 2015-16, and assessment of the student impact will be ongoing.   As part of efforts to diversify the teaching workforce in Montgomery County, the grant supported the development and offering of a "Teaching as a Profession" course, designed to provide potential career-changers an introduction to the demands and joys of teaching as well as serve as a recruiting tool.     The overall result of the various grant-related efforts was to produce a 39% increase in the number of STEM education majors a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
