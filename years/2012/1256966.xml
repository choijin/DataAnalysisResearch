<AbstractNarration>This is a study of historical study of a new form of listening that evolved in the twentieth century, threshold listening, which grew out of turn-of-the century field and laboratory studies in Europe and the United States on the physical and emotional effects of music. This study will explore how this new understanding of the bodily effects of listening despite inattention fueled the development of new consumer products and has come to be one of the main processes by which we navigate our daily environments.  Research methods include archival research on internal memoranda, correspondence, and advertising development in the William Maxwell Files of the Edison Papers at the Edison National Historic Park and interviews with musicologists, composers, and recording company executives that were involved in the development of background music products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background music is a ubiquitous part of our lives that is, by design, given little attention by those who passively consume it. Yet, those who study, design and produce it understand the ways can affect people?s moods and behavior, for example, increasing work place efficiency or stimulating consumption.  This research will provide new knowledge and understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;central role that science played in the development of  background music and the ways in which music consumption and emotions are intertwined.</AbstractNarration>

It is a study of the co-development of background music (or elevator music or Muzak) and the specific type of listening required to process background music. What the project terms &ldquo;threshold listening&rdquo; is a form of listening that is neither strictly active nor strictly passive. Threshold listeners may not be fully aware of the sounds their bodies process, yet they respond physically and emotionally. Threshold listening was actively cultivated in the twentieth century, first by psychologists, then by the corporate music industry. The scientific understanding and application of threshold listening was intertwined with the growth and spread of background music in both public and private spaces. This project investigates how music became a technology of mediation, redefining relationships between individuals and the space around them; how consumers were made into threshold listeners and when and why consumers protested, demanding aural autonomy; and how background music became increasingly prevalent while simultaneously increasingly synonymous for artlessness, even torture or mind-control.

The funding for this award covered the costs of archival research as well as the release time (from teaching obligations) to do said research and write.  In the twelve months covered by this grant, I have been able to gather archival materials from eleven archives (I originally proposed seven).  I have also conducted a series of interviews with several composers, some of which are ongoing.  I have begun the process of compiling and analyzing my archival findings and interviews and presented some of this material at a conference and three workshops.  I have also published some of these materials in peer-reviewed journals (Culture Unbound, Endeavor, and Historische Anthropologie) and contributed to three edited collections of essays (Sounds of Modern History: Auditory Cultures in 19th- and 20th-Century Europe, Ecomusicology: A Field Guide, and The Art of Listening, all forthcoming).

Related, the broader impact of this study promised to substantially alter the understanding of the way in which new listening practices come into existence, their role in the development of entirely new sounds, and ultimately, how scientific knowledge fundamentally changes the soundscape.
