<AbstractNarration>Understanding how teachers learn to notice and respond to students? scientific sense-making is necessary to improve beginning teacher practice and support student science learning. Without this understanding, effective science instruction called for by the Next Generation Science Standards may rarely occur, and we will not be able to meet the challenge of improving STEM education for all students. Our objective for this research is to document and define a range of beginning elementary teacher practices for noticing and responding to students? scientific sense-making and the contextual factors that impact their practice over a range of several years to determine how these practices develop over time. Contextual factors include aspects such as curriculum materials, professional community, prior experiences, and professional vision. Knowing more about how and why teachers learn to notice and respond to students? science sense-making can enable more effective design of educational programs, instructional supports, and tools helping teachers ensure that all of their students have opportunities to learn meaningful science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers from Michigan State University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison will use longitudinal comparative case-study methodology to analyze and describe how beginning elementary teachers notice and respond to students? scientific sense-making in multiple science topic areas across several years in urban school settings. Data will be collected from 32 beginning 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade elementary science teachers and six expert teachers across the upper Midwest (e.g., Chicago, IL, Lansing, MI, and Madison, WI). Data includes two teacher-generated sense-making portfolios a year containing: classroom video of science teaching, teacher analysis of student work, and teacher interviews about noticing and responding. Data analysis will be based on 4 dimensions of teacher performance and reflection: the nature and type of opportunities for student sense-making, noticing, interpreting/reasoning, and responding to students? scientific sense-making. We will use a constant comparative approach to analyze data ? examining and sorting case study data against aspects of teaching contexts and personal resources to look for patterns over time. Advisory board members will evaluate this project with respect to research design, tools, and outcomes. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The final products of our study will include (1) empirically-based descriptions of 32 beginning teacher practices across several years and six expert teachers to illustrate different types of teacher noticing and responding as well as different pathways, trajectories, and approaches of beginning teacher noticing and responding (2) a set of tested and revised data collection measures and analytical tools for documenting and describing teacher noticing, and (3) a model of beginning teacher noticing that can explain how noticing and responding to students? sense-making is mediated by personal resources and professional contexts. This research will positively affect participating teachers and their students, as well as the larger teacher education research community by transforming theories of elementary science teacher education and beginning teacher practice. The research will contribute knowledge about the influences of contexts on teacher practice and outline potential pathways for teacher development. Research products promise to contribute to the development of a highly qualified science teachers using high-leverage practices in diverse urban contexts.</AbstractNarration>

To accomplish this goal, we conducted research to understand and work with teachers around their responses and interactions with students as those students were making sense of science. Responsiveness is critical for successful student learning because teachers are often guiding opportunities for, noticing, interpreting and then responding to multiple students' ideas and ways of knowing, and then deciding how to respond to students.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To better understand and work towards supporting teachers' equitable and disciplinary responsiveness, researchers from Michigan State University and the University of Colorado at Boulder collected and analyzed classroom videos from and interviews with nine beginning 2nd-6th grade teachers (interns and first-year teachers) and nine experienced elementary teachers from across the upper Midwest (Lansing, MI and Madison, WI) including longitudinal data from five of those participating teachers across multiple years. We used qualitative case-study methodology to identify segments of interaction called sense-making 'moments' and composite moments or 'episodes' to analyze and describe how elementary teachers notice and respond to students' scientific sense-making in multiple science topic areas within their school settings.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Our research and analysis generated theoretical and empirical findings. First, we generated a model for sense-making moments and episodes that described how these interactions take place over time (see attached figure). This recursive model highlights the resources that teachers and students are drawing from as they engage in sense-making interactions in addition to consequential external factors. Our model provides a place to unpack the multiple interactions that might happen in a moment or episode as well as the potential outcomes for students and the teacher that fold back into future interactions.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Secondly, we developed and wrote about cases of how some beginning teachers make space for sense-making in class discussions by trying different responses to clarify student ideas or waiting before responding to figure out next steps. These moves expanded opportunities for shared epistemic authority, but novice teachers often didn't recognize these moments as productive for sense-making.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Third, we wrote about our use of sense-making episodes in three exemplar cases helped better understand how noticing and responding episodes unfolded in order to determine how these episodes open-up, maintained, or shut down students' sense-making. One case of a sense-making episode illustrates how the intern and her mentor teacher perceived the classroom conversation as messy and chaotic (and therefore important to avoid in the future) though students showed evidence of actively making sense of ideas. In contrast, the other two cases illustrate how experienced teachers with welcoming interactions did not recognize that merely sharing ideas did not enable students to make progress on making sense of those ideas. Further, a teacher's marginalized of students' ideas, without fully considering their merits, shut down scientific sense-making opportunities for the entire class. These cases provided useful exemplars for our elementary science methods courses to help pre-service teachers notice and develop some strategies for equitable, disciplinary responsive teaching.</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Fourth, in partnership with two beginning and three more experienced teachers, we studied and supported equitable and disciplinary responsiveness. We found that coaching interactions and tools supported teachers to expand sense-making and improved their responsiveness. These cases indicated that teachers can robustly support disciplinary sense-making, but often do so in non-equitable ways. This suggests that future efforts must combine equity and disciplinary constructs when working with teachers. For example, our data indicated that an important dimension of teachers' equitable responsiveness entails sustaining caring relationships with students but is a lower priority among science educators who focus on disciplinary rather than relational goals; finding ways to interweave these priorities will be an essential next step.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Fifth, further analysis of classroom science teaching videos has found that orchestrating student contributions and organizing those contributions toward goals of expanding science sense-making happens only in fleeting moments in current elementary school settings. Sustaining longer periods of expansive sense-making in science classrooms in ways that have potential for long-lasting transformation of students' science education experiences may be constrained by structures and norms of schooling that inhibit truly responsive science teaching. This finding illuminates possible explanations for why it can be so difficult for individual teachers and teacher educators to engage students in equitable and disciplinary responsiveness that expands students' sense-making. It suggests that a next step is to work with whole schools and systems to create new norms and structures for supporting equitable and transformative sense-making in science classrooms. </span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/06/2019<br>      Modified by: Christina&nbsp;Schwarz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1252439/1252439_10278412_1575658234348_NRSSSense-MakingMomentsModel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1252439/1252439_10278412_1575658234348_NRSSSense-MakingMomentsModel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sense-making moments model"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1252439/1252439_10278412_1575658234348_NRSSSense-MakingMomentsModel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sense-making moments model"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This model captures how sense-making moments unfold in a classroom.
