<AbstractNarration>Tip-based nanomanufacturing (TBN) is a promising and scalable platform for fabricating nanostructures en masse with high precision. All TBN processes hinge on the availability of nanoscale atomic force microscope (AFM) tips that can survive the long-lasting and harsh conditions of TBN processes without substantial changes in composition or geometry. However, the scientific understanding of nanoscale wear, particularly under the extreme conditions encountered as TBN processes are scaled up, is lacking. This grant provides funding to rigorously develop the fundamental science of nanoscale wear that is needed to realize robust probes for high-performance, high-rate TBN processes. The integrated, interdisciplinary research plan consists of advanced atomistic simulations integrated with continuum models, and innovative experiments that include in-situ wear studies combining AFM with electron microscopy. The research will focus on understanding the performance of ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) AFM probes manufactured by the industrial partner, Advanced Diamond Technologies (ADT), as well as conventional commercial probes based on silicon.  Interactions with additional industrial collaborators pursuing commercial TBN processes will be leveraged to select relevant conditions for the studies, and to optimize the design of scalable TBN processes and probes based on the research findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will transform a broad range of TBN methods from bench-top prototype processes to commercially-viable applications. This will be achieved by realizing new approaches to minimize tip wear in scaled-up TBN processes.  The understanding of wear that is developed will apply to the design and fabrication of reliable probes for a broad range of TBN methods. Tangible outcomes will include the deployment of UNCD probes for high performance TBN, and the establishment of operating conditions for achieving improved performance in commercially-viable TBN. The education and outreach activities will lead to a new short-course on TBN aimed at industry audiences, research experiences for high school science teachers, and the advanced training of students.</AbstractNarration>
