<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to support student travel to the  IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM 2012) that will be hosted in Trento, Italy in Sept 2012. This is an international conference and a top venue for topics related to software development lifecycle.   The conference is an educational opportunity for the students and will help build the next generation of researchers in this field.  The international experience has the additional broader impact of building a global workforce for science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for "Student Travel Support for the 28th and 29th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance"     This NSF grant assisted students in attending the 28th and 29th IEEE International Conferences on Software Maintenance (ICSM 2012 and ICSM 2013).  ICSM provided a premier international (world wide) venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the area of software maintenance and evolution.  ICSM conference is a vital venue for the community of researchers and practitioners to publish, present, and debate the latest results advancing state of the art in software maintenance and evolution.  The grant was used to support and broaden student participation in ICSM 2012 and ICSM 2013 by subsidizing the travel for participants who might not otherwise travel to attend the conference.  The funds were used solely to provide travel support for students from the U.S. based institutions.     This proposal notably augmented both the training and development of graduate students working in the area of software maintenance and evolution by attending these conferences.  The students receiving travel support personally benefited from the chance to engage in the important technical professional and social opportunities that ICSM 2012 and ICSM 2013 fostered.  Moreover, the conferences were indirectly strengthened as a result of the greater attendance that this travel support provided.  Finally, the funds from this grant were used solely for students from U.S. based universities and colleges, with preferences given to the U.S. citizens and underrepresented groups of students.
