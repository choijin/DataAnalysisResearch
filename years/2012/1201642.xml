<AbstractNarration>This collaboration between the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL), the American Meteorological Society (AMS), James Madison University (JMU), and Los Angeles Valley College (LAVC) is convening a four-day planning workshop to explore novel approaches to broadening participation in the geosciences (and climate science in particular), through leveraging of paleoclimate data obtained by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).  The workshop will engage 25 faculty from minority-serving institutions (MSIs), education and assessment professionals, and subject matter experts.  The ultimate goal of the workshop is to plan additional programs that use hands-on approaches to educate MSI faculty about ocean drilling-based paleoclimate research and guide integration of this research into curricula used at such institutions at a large scale. The project seeks to integrate effective educational strategies developed through the COL Deep Earth Academy School of Rock program, the JMU Building Core Knowledge curriculum, and MSI faculty networks developed by the AMS during implementation of their professional development course on climate science.</AbstractNarration>
