<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to address significant information technology (IT) workforce needs by determining why so few underrepresented students are enrolling in IT career programs at the college; to create, adapt, and deploy tools to recruit a more diverse IT student body, and to retain and support those students. It also provides teacher training and curriculum revisions and leverages industry partnerships to create new opportunities for students.  The student body at the college is very diverse, being composed of 86% underrepresented students. Conversely, IT programs at the college are much less diverse than the general student population, in fact the programs are remarkable for their lack of diversity in terms of ethnicity and gender. Because the college has a history of recruiting, supporting, and graduating students from underrepresented groups, once it is determined why so few students are entering IT career programs, outreach efforts are being modified to recruit underrepresented students into IT programs, and additional support mechanisms are being developed to improve the chances of students of successfully completing their program.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: A hallmark of this project is the degree to which it builds on existing initiatives and partnerships. From design to implementation, from evaluation to dissemination, this project builds on the work of other ATE projects and centers. Significant support from business and secondary school partners is creating a collaborative project team. Industry partners are committed to providing resources to facilitate effective and cost efficient communication; to sponsor and participate in career awareness events; to provide access to modern instrumentation and new technologies presently unavailable to many students; to help integrate current industry standards and 21st century workplace competencies into the curriculum; to provide speakers and facilitate information sessions designed to engage underrepresented students; and to facilitate field trips and industry tours. This project is improving student learning by providing secondary school teacher training; leveraging business partnerships to provide students with 21st century workplace experiences and cutting-edge instrumentation; and by aligning curricula with industry standards. This project is designed to be institutionalized upon completion of the proposed activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: At the core of this project is the promotion of a diverse technical workforce capable of addressing significant IT workforce needs. This project fosters and builds upon collaborative relationships to achieve the goal of diversity, and the results of the project are likely to be widely adaptable at other institutions. The project results are being disseminated using a digital project portfolio that is accessible on the World Wide Web.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF grant-funded work under "Addressing Information Technology Workforce Needs in an Urban Setting" at Inver Hills Community College sought to determine why so few underrepresented students enter information technology (IT) career programs at community colleges in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area.  From this research, the college planned to:  1. Create, adapt, and implement tools to recruit students from underrepresented groups into IT careers, and support them through graduation;  2. Provide middle school and high school teachers with training regarding the most current IT technologies and curricula that will spark new interest in IT careers among secondary school students; and  3. Leverage industry partners to facilitate work-based experiences for underrepresented students, obtain modern technologies and IT instrumentation, and create expanded student support services such as mentoring, tutoring, and career guidance.  Through a survey of 751 metro-area high school students over a 6-month period, 64% of students of color felt finances were a barrier to attending college and pursuing a degree in IT, other STEM fields, or any other degree; 38% of white students reported finances as a similar barrier.  Support outside of the classroom was also a hindrance as 82% of all students surveyed indicated a lack of support and understanding at home of IT as a career pathway.  Lack of support in the high schools was also highlighted with 73% of all students surveyed indicating a lack of an educational professional in the high school to discuss career goals and aspirations.  Finally, 55% of students surveyed reported a lack of information on college IT programs available within the high schools. Using this these survey results in completing this 3-year project, the findings and outcomes led to new focus and work at Inver Hills Community College.  1. New marketing and recruiting tools were adapted or created based on the initial analysis of the survey results and focus group data  Materials were created and designed by a professional marketing team using grant funds (STEM program brochures, IHCC STEM-focused folders) Materials were designed to appeal to students of color, low income students, and/or females Social media accounts for the collegeÆs STEM Division were created&mdash;specifically, Facebook and Twitter&mdash;and professionally managed using grant funds   2. A 2-day summer high school IT teacher camp was provided with new training material  Training focused on current IT technologies and curricula to spark new interest in IT careers among secondary school students Leveraged the collegeÆs reputation and position as a Cisco Instructor Training Center and Academy Support Center to create or renew relationships with 10 area Cisco Networking Academies at the high school and college levels Trained 10 area high school IT instructors   3. The college leveraged industry and community partnerships to advance the focus of the grant and facilitate work-based experiences for underrepresented students, obtain modern technologies and IT instrumentation, and create expanded student support services  Newly assigned academic advisor dedicated solely to STEM degree programs at the college Increased work-based experiences through the collegeÆs Center for Experiential Learning Work with ISD 196 and Apple Valley High School on the "Women in STEM" initiative Lead academic division at the college supporting the annual "Expanding Your Horizons" conference   As Inver Hills Community College moves into the future with a more informed focus on connecting underrepresented students to careers in IT, findings and outcomes from this grant work will inform our direction.  The following activities will be pursued with college funds and/or new grant opportunities:  1. "Women in STEM" initiative &ndash; faculty release credit to continue the study of underrepresented students in IT and other STEM career programs, make recommendations for change or enh...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
