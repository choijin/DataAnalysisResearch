<AbstractNarration>Doctoral Dissertation Research: Welfare System Transformation in Turkey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This research argues that government response to changes in grassroots politics has been the critical force driving the shift from employment-based to income-based policies in the Turkish welfare system over the last four decades. There are three specific hypotheses: (i) welfare institutions contain and mobilize grassroots groups, (ii) the center of Turkish grassroots politics has shifted from the formal to informal proletariat, and ethnically from Turks to Kurds, (iii) the shift from employment-based to income-based policies is a political response to the shift in grassroots politics. &lt;br/&gt;The research will create a database of grassroots political events in Turkey since the 1970s using newspaper archives; perform regression analyses of large sample surveys; conduct grassroots interviews; survey official documents, reports, and parliament proceedings; and interview office-holders and welfare officials. This study will contribute to literature on recent welfare system changes, discussing the under-examined effect of social movements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This study will help explain a global trend in welfare policies through detailed investigation of the Turkish case. It will increase understanding of political and structural causes of welfare policies and examine the informal proletariat?s ability to shape government policies. Additionally, this research will investigate bases of popular support for the Islamic government in Turkey and illuminate strategies which this pro-globalization government has pursued vis-Ã -vis domestic political and social challenges.</AbstractNarration>

Outcomes: The research has shown that, as opposed to the common belief among scholars and the public, grassroots politics in Turkey has continued to strongly influence state policies in the neoliberal era. while the grassroots political activities of the formal proletariat and ethnic Turks have decreased, those of the informal proletariat and Kurds have increased.   The shift in Turkish welfare policies has been a political response to this shift in grassroots politics. Governments have increasingly prioritized income-based policies for politically containing and mobilizing the informal proletariat and the poor Kurds. structural changes do not lead to welfare system changes when structural changes produce grassroots groups with new social needs. Rather, welfare changes occur when new grassroots groups and their social needs are politicized by contending political actors. In other words, structural changes generate grassroots groups and shape their material conditions, yet, this does not automatically drive the state authorities to expand or contract welfare provision for grassroots groups. The extent to which state authorities expand or contract welfare provision depends on the extent to which grassroots groups become politicized.  The co-PI has shown that the informal proletariat, created by the neoliberal structural conditions, have been politically radicalized by the Islamists and Kurds after the 1990s and government have increased income-based social assistance policies to contain this threat.  The co-PI has substantiated this using an innovative methodology, the use of local newspaper archives to quantify grassroots political activism.
