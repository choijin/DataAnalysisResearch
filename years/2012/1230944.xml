<AbstractNarration>Program Director's Recommendation &lt;br/&gt;Center for Resource, Recovery and Recycling (CR3) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal # 1230675 &amp; 1230944 &lt;br/&gt;Apelian and Mishra &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Resource, Recovery and Recycling (CR3) located at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (lead site) and the Colorado School of Mines. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rechargeable secondary Lithium ion (Li-ion) battery is expected to grow to more than $6.3 billion by 2012 from ~$4.6 billion in 2006. With the development of personnel electronics, hybrid and electric vehicles, Li-ion batteries will be more in demand. However, Li-ion batteries are not widely recycled because it is not economically justifiable (in contrast, at present more than 97% Lead acid batteries are recycled). So far, no commercial methods are available to recycle Li-ion batteries economically and efficiently because of the complex chemistry of Li-ion batteries. Considering the limited resources, environmental impact, and national security, Li-ion batteries must be recycled. The proposed project, therefore, will build fundamental understanding on handling and recycling Li-ion batteries. Material separation and deposition will be established for the complex Li-ion battery system. Critical processes to synthesize the cathode materials using recycled materials will be developed. These findings will add a new chapter to Li-ion battery recycling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is expected to have a significant impact on the Li-ion battery industry. Inorganic materials are not renewable; Li-ion batteries contain expensive elements such as Co, Ni, among others. It is critically important that these materials are recovered and recycled. Having a recycling infrastructure in place will ease concerns that the adoption of vehicles that use Li-ion batteries could lead to a shortage of lithium carbonate and a dependence on countries such as Chile, Russia and Bolivia, which control the bulk of global lithium reserves. A comprehensive education plan will also be integrated with the research plan. The three key elements being: 1) Develop a K-12 outreach and research program with an emphasis on reaching out to minorities, 2) Help undergraduate and graduate students develop skills outside their immediate field, 3) Develop an online resource of Li-ion battery recycling to provide free and open educational resources for self-learners around the world.</AbstractNarration>
