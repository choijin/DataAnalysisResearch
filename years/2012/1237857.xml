<AbstractNarration>This NSF Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project will translate and further develop a new generation of crosslinked aromatic polymer membranes for removing carbon dioxide from natural gas, separating oxygen (O2) and (N2) from air, and for hydrogen (H2) purification.  The technology is based on the discovery that select examples of these membranes have unprecedented combinations of permeation, gas selectivity and resistance to performance degradation, particularly during separations of condensable gases such as carbon dioxide.  Existing membranes are largely amorphous, glassy engineering thermoplastics that lack durability to organic contaminants in the gas streams.  The AIR innovation provides a means to fabricate membranes into hollow fiber platforms in solution, but also the membranes can be post-modified to develop both the needed durability as well as very good transport and mechanical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The economical separation of air into O2 and N2 will enable inert N2 atmospheres to transport food globally and also will be applied to aircraft fuel tanks to minimize fires/explosions. Economical generation of purified H2 will play a critical role in developing a hydrogen economy for fuel cell systems for transportation, stationary (home) power, and portable electronics.</AbstractNarration>
