<AbstractNarration>Scientists from Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences and the University of California, Santa Barbara, plan to collect samples during the 2013 GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect cruise and analyze them for dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and total alkalinity.  The resultant data will be highly precise and accurate to allow calculation of pH and seawater carbonate chemistry (e.g., hydroxide, carbonate ion, saturation sate for calcium carbonate minerals).  Given the influence of pH on redox chemistry, speciation, and ligand-particle-trace metal/isotope interactions, the transect from Peru to Tahiti with its range of marine seawater carbonate chemistry will provide an opportunity to test the hypotheses that (1) pH is a critical constraint for controlling distributions of trace elements and their isotopes (TEIs) and their dynamics within the water column, and; (2) DOC interacts with TEIs providing a spectrum of binding ligands that influence trace element solubility, complexation, and speciation. Also, because the cruise track will pass over the East Pacific Rise, the scientists plan to evaluate DOC variability within the hydrothermal plume and determine the partitioning of organic matter between DOC and particulate organic carbon.  In collaboration with other GEOTRACES researchers, the data will be used to assess the speciation of iron, copper, cobalt and mercury, as well as determine the removal rate of DOC from the surface ocean with the help of chlorofluorocarbon data obtained by a collaborator from the University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As regards broader impacts, this project would result in a high quality data set that would benefit not only the GEOTRACES community to help them interpret their trace metal and isotope measurements but other scientists involved in organic/inorganic carbon cycle research as well.  One graduate student from the University of California, Santa Barbara would be supported and trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>

Due to the influence of pH on ocean chemistry, this region provides a large range of marine seawater carbonate chemistry that influences the ocean cycling of trace elements and isotopes.  On the cruise we sampled for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), with subsequent laboratory analyses of these samples. Highly precise and accurate measurements of DIC, TA and DOC were made to meet the high-bar criteria of quality that has been set for the CLIVAR-Repeat hydrography program and U.S. time series efforts (i.e., BATS and HOT).  Across the Peru-Tahiti section, very large horizontal gradients in surface/mixed layer dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) from the nutrient-rich, low-oxygen coastal upwelling region adjacent to Peru to the oligotrophic central Pacific. Near the coast of Peru, upwelling of CO2 rich waters from the oxygen deficient zone (ODV) impinged at the surface with very high partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2; &gt;800-1,200 &micro;atm), and low pH (7.55 to 7.8). These waters were also undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a common calcium carbonate (CaCO3) mineral. These chemical conditions indicate that the shelf calcareous sediments are vulnerable to CaCO3 dissolution, and to the future impacts of ocean acidification. A comparison to earlier data collected from 1991 to 1994 suggests that surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pCO2 have increased by as much as 3% and 20%, respectively, while pH and saturation state for aragonite have decreased by as much as 0.063 and 0.54, respectively. In intermediate waters (~200-500 m), dissolved oxygen has decreased (loss of up to 15%) and nitrate increased (gain of up to 30% ) over the past twenty years and this likely reflects the westward expansion of the oxygen deficient zone across the central Eastern South Pacific Ocean.
