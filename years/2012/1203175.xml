<AbstractNarration>The Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium (TAGS) is an annual conference that is hosted on a rotating basis by Rice University, Texas A&amp;M University, and the University of Texas at Austin. TAGS 2012 will take place on April 27 - 29, at Texas A&amp;M University, in College Station, TX. TAGS provides an opportunity for local researchers to meet and interact, as well as learn the latest advances in Algebraic Geometry, interpreted in its broadest sense. There will be a Special Lecture aimed at graduate students. In addition, young mathematicians (graduate students and postdocs) will have the opportunity to present their work in a Poster Session. More information about this meeting is available at: http://www.math.tamu.edu/~laura/TAGS2012/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many phenomena in Nature can be modeled using systems of polynomial equations. The study of such systems is an important area of Mathematics, called Algebraic Geometry. This grant will fund a conference in this area, where investigators from Texas and the neighboring states may learn the newest developments in this field from distinguished invited speakers. This conference is also an important opportunity for local researchers, especially graduate students and postdocs, to meet and interact, gaining exposure for their work and potentially establishing new collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium (TAGS) is an annual conference that rotates among Rice University, Texas A&amp;M University, and the University of Texas at Austin. In 2012, TAGS took place at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas on April 27-29. At that meeting, there were eight invited talks with two directed at graduate students, and twelve posters presented. A total of 75 mathematicians attended.   The meeting was held just after an IMA PI conference on "Questions in geometry arising in applications" and the TAMU Maxson lectures by Joe Harris. This grant supported TAGS 2012. It also supported Texas A&amp;M graduate students who participated in TAGS 2013, which took place at UT Austin on April 6-7 2013.  Intellectual Merit:  This conference series brings distinguished Algebraic Geometers to Texas, who share with a local audience the latest developments in their field. TAGS is widely announced, and draws participants from Texas, neighboring states, and institutions further away.  Broader Impacts:  A major goal of this conference series is to expose young researchers (graduate students and postdoctoral researchers) to the most exciting new developments in Algebraic Geometry. Special lectures aimed at this audience are planned, and poster sessions encourage interaction between the younger researchers and more senior participants, as well as the distinguished plenary lecturers.
