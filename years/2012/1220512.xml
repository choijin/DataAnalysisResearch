<AbstractNarration>This project explores how students learn from 3D animated and/or interactive visualizations and aims to understand which design choices are most effective in fostering learning of complex, dynamic events. The focus of the study is to 1) gain a better understanding of how animation/interactivity design choices can impact learning in undergraduate molecular biology and 2) how to effectively engage and impact the communities most directly involved in either producing or consuming this kind of media. The work is based on a pilot study that explored the role of visual complexity in helping students understand concepts such as diffusion, conformational change, and molecular crowding. Although increasing the level of visual complexity of the animations was effective in conveying the dynamic nature of the molecular world, students still had difficulty understanding the random nature of molecular events and tended to anthropomorphize the motion of molecules shown in the animations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This study is uncovering key visual and auditory variables that significantly impact undergraduate students' understanding of abstract molecular concepts (e.g. the effects of temperature and molecular crowding on protein conformational flexibility and diffusion). A strength of the project is that the team includes content experts to ensure content accuracy and to validate student learning outcomes, animation experts to translate findings into visual materials, and experts in assessment to help design the tools and processes for informing the content, graphic design and visualization experts. The implications of this work are potentially transformative in that the study offers insight into the role visualizations play in learning complex concepts, and provides broadly applicable guidelines to help both educators and media designers in the design and use of complex 3D visualizations in ways that maximize their pedagogical value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The design principles and the visualizations themselves are being widely disseminated to an audience of students, educators, and media designers through a combination of web-based channels and hands-on workshops. Broader impacts are expected on multiple levels: 1) instructors who make better choices in the selection and use of media in the classroom (as well as during their involvement in developing educational tools), 2) media developers and animators who design more pedagogically impactful visualizations, and 3) students who become better consumers of educational media with the aid of appropriate classroom discussion activities that promote a more critical appraisal of visualization materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our insight into human biology and disease is dependent on our ability to understand complex, dynamic processes that range from the macroscopic, to the molecular.  Although visualization is a powerful medium through which to communicate our knowledge of these mechanisms, it is critical to design such educational materials in ways that align aesthetics with learning objectives.  In addition, the use of interactivity and the nature of assessments must also properly leverage visualization to maximize learning and student engagement. The primary goals of our project were to 1) better understand the visualization design parameters that affect learning when teaching students about molecular environments, 2)  investigate the role of student-driven interactivity in learning (including game technologies) and 3) to disseminate these findings in a way that both informs the learning sciences research community and also supports the practical design and production of scientific visualizations for education.  Taken together, these goals were intended to illuminate the role of visualization in learning complex concepts, especially ones occurring at spatial and temporal scales beyond the realm of the humans senses (such as molecular phenomena) - in short, to begin the development of a 'visual language' for optimal teaching of challenging molecular concepts.? Our research endeavors have been fruitful along a number of avenues.  Firstly, we have improved our understanding of the specific design features that help students gain an intuition for molecular interactions.  Through a combination of qualitative approaches (such as focus groups) and carefully controlled quantitative studies, we continue to observe how visual complexity can foster a greater understanding of molecular events - in this area, simplicity does not always equate clarity!  Second, our interest in understanding interactivity and how best to leverage it in both instructional and assessment contexts resulted in the creation of a web-based adaptive assessment tree.  This approach yielded interesting findings that confirmed the nature of the most common student misconceptions (such as the idea that molecules have agency - i.e. 'they know where they are going" inside cells).   We continue to investigate whether and how visualization can be used to remedy these misconceptions.  Finally, we have developed a practical guide of 'Molecular Visualization Principles' intended for animators/multimedia developers who are responsible for the design and production of educational media.  Inspired by Disney's famous 'principles of animation', this series of principles - each  visualized using a comparative set of 'paired' visualizations - is meant as a  practical production guide (in contrast to the typical dissemination of research studies through academic publications and conference presentations).  We hope that these new findings and design methodologies foster improved production and dissemination of educational materials in the life sciences.
