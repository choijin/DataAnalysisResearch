<AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for a conference on the evolution of massive stars.  The conference will concentrate on the problem of eruptive events in these stars, which often appear in surveys for supernovae even though they do not represent the explosive end phase of a massive star.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together astronomers, theorists and observers, studying the final stages of massive star evolution, their instabilities, supernovae and their progenitors, and the outcomes of the final eruptions.  The meeting will be structured to encourage discussion and communication among the participants and to stimulate theoretical work and new observations that will address many of these questions. For broader dissemination, the organizers will post the review talks, posters and a transcription of the discussion on the workshop web pages.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Massive stars end their brief lives  as supernovae, but many of the  most massive  may have dramatic eruptions before their terminal explosions. For example, eta Carinae shed ten or twenty times the mass of the Sun in a few years, for reasons that are still not understood.  The final stages of these most massive stars are obviously important for a valid picture of stellar astrophysics, and they are  increasingly significant in cosmology. For example, they are the likely  progenitors of Gamma Ray Bursters used as cosmological probes, and the first stars in the universe are thought to have been very  massive.  The current transient surveys are finding a number objects in nearby galaxies which are not true supernovae, i.e. the ``supernova impostors'', which may be extreme events like eta Carinae or  possibly related to the Luminous Blue Variables. Two true supernovae had lesser eruptions prior to the terminal explosion and the most luminous observed supernovae are believed to be explosions into extensive debris from previous high mass loss events. These recent developments  demonstrate the importance of the instabilities and high mass loss  in the final stages of the most massive stars, but the origin of the instabilies is not known. Are they surface or interior instabilities?  Recent studies also show that the progenitors of the classical Type II suepernovae are relative low mass. So there are questions about how the most massive stars end their lives. Do they just collapse to black holes?  Many of the ourstanding questions about the final stages of massive star evolution and their terminal explosions are primarily theoretical, but observations are also lacking, especially of the progenitor class of unstable massive stars. NSF provided support for a small topical workshop  to bring together  astronomers, theorists and observers, studying the final stages of massive star evolution, their instabilities, SNe and their progenitors, and the outcomes of the final eruptions.
