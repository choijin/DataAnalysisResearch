<AbstractNarration>Noncommutative algebraic geometry generalizes certain aspects of the correspondence between commutative rings and schemes to the setting of noncommutative rings.  In particular, noncommutative projective geometry uses a localization of the category of graded modules over a  noncommutative graded ring as a substitute for a category of coherent sheaves.  A major goal of this project is to advance the classification of noncommutative projective surfaces.  We continue to study surfaces in the birational classes of noncommutative projective planes, especially those of Sklyanin type. Calabi-Yau algebras are an important class of noncommutative algebras with good homological properties, which are related to commutative Calabi-Yau varieties.  For example, in certain cases they can be seen as providing noncommutative resolutions of singular varieties.  In this project, we also propose to study certain classes of graded Calabi-Yau algebras which are closely connected to noncommutative projective geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set of all functions from a geometric space to the real numbers has a natural addition and multiplication.  A set with an addition and multiplication is called a ring, and the example above is called the coordinate ring of the space. Its algebraic properties often reflect and give information about the underlying geometry of the space. The goal of noncommutative geometry, which is the subject of this project, is to generalize to rings which do not directly arise as coordinate rings of spaces, because the product of two elements in these rings depends on the order you multiply them. Though there is no underlying space, the algebra of these rings can have deep structure that allows one to still study them in a geometric way.  As an example, certain noncommutative rings can be thought of as giving a noncommutative resolution of a singular commutative space (the space is not smooth but has sharp points, and the resolution smooths it out).  Our main project concerns the classification of noncommutative surfaces (2-dimensional spaces) and the structure of Calabi-Yau algebras, which are noncommutative rings motivated originally by string theory in theoretical physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many operations in nature do not commute--- that is, it matters what order you do them.  A manifestation of this principle is the Heisenberg uncertainly principle in physics, which in one formulation can be described by saying position and momentum operators do not commute.  Algebraic geometry is the area of mathematics that studies geometric spaces defined by polynomials.  While the functions defined in algebraic geometry usually commute, in recent years, it has become clear that extensions of algebraic geometry to the noncommutative case are interesting and important.  In this project, we studied various questions in the theory of noncommutative projective geometry.  With Sierra and Stafford, we produced several papers about surfaces birational to the Sklyanin projective plane, including further developing the theory of blowing up and blowing down---operations that allow one to move from one surface to another.  With Reyes and Zhang, we studied the theory of skew Calabi-Yau algebras (which are related to string theory in physics), including developing formulas for the Nakayama automorphism and relating it to the Serre functor of a corresponding derived category.  With Bell, we studied the structure of simple rings with a grading by the integers.  The fundamental questions we studied in these publications have advanced knowledge in noncommutative algebra.   As part of the project, we trained several graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in this subject, to help them become researchers in this field.   We also wrote a book chapter on noncommutative projective geometry which should help to introduce the subject to graduate students and researchers more broadly.
