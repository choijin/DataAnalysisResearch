<AbstractNarration>This award will fund the first of five years of operation under a renewal of the NSF Cooperative Agreement, OCE- 0505385. Ship awards will be renegotiated each year and is based on the number of days of ship time in support of NSF funded research programs. R/V Pt. Sur, a NSF-owned research vessel, is operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet by Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. In 2012, Pt. Sur anticipates operating 102 days, of which 72 days will be in direct support of NSF peer-reviewed sea-going work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R/V Point Sur has been successfully operated by Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) since 1986. MLML is located in Central California on the Monterey Bay at the head of the deep undersea Monterey canyon and has unique proximity to a wide variety of coastal, canyon and offshore study sites along the Central CA coast The R/V Point Sur continues to serve scientists from institutions around the world as well as institutions associated with the Monterey Bay Crescent Ocean Research Consortium (MBCORC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During 2012 the R/V Point Sur will provide ship time for several research and marine science educational programs funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), the Army Corps of Engineers, MLML and consortium campuses of the California State University system. This proposal requests the funding necessary to support the NSF portion of our operation that amounts to 63 days out of a total schedule of 95 days at sea. These NSF days encompass 4 discrete cruises. Two of these cruises are repeat users of the vessel (Bishop and McPhee-Shaw) while the remaining cruises will be new. The first of these cruises will take the ship off the coast of Oregon for CTD and mid-water trawling operations. The second cruise represents a transit from the vessels homeport to Punta Arenas, Chile. This transit is part of a larger project that involves science support at Palmer Station, Antarctica. This represents one of the longest and most logistically challenging cruises the vessel has ever undertaken. Funds have been included in the current proposal to help prepare the vessel for this work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The Moss Landing Marine Laboratories continues to be successful in advancing the California State University's Center for Integrative Coastal Observation, Research and Education program (CI-CORE, http://www.mlml.calstate.edu/cicore/) and the Alliance for Coastal Technologies program (ACT, http://www.actonline.ws/). As a key partner in both these efforts MLML has been funded (at no cost to NSF) to provide instrumentation for the underway measurement of surface water parameters (temperature, salinity, fluorescence, oxygen, and turbidity) from a number of our vessels. As part of the CI-CORE program these data will be formatted and made available on our web site for educators, scientists, policy makers and the public. &lt;br/&gt;Various other Federal, State and private supported work is also included in the schedule. The MBARI maintains several moored arrays near the mouth of the Monterey Bay and offshore that will be serviced using the R/V Point Sur. MLML will use approximately 10 days of ship time in support of class cruises and thesis work for the California State Universities (CSU) providing graduate and undergraduate students valuable field time to gather data for class projects. These classes include physical, chemical and biological oceanography, geology, ichthyology, benthic ecology and marine mammal behavior. Several CSU instructors have taken advantage of these class cruises by using them to help educate junior college and high school students as well. In the past weve also opened the R/V Point Sur to local middle school students and their parents for dockside tours and informal talks about the local ocean environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: Under this Cooperative Agreement, the Research Vessel Point Sur successfully completed her final three operational years as an NSF owned vessel of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet, which is coordinated through the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).  From March of 1986 until December of 2014 the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories operated the Point Sur as a UNOLS vessel supporting a wide range of research and educational programs in all major disciplines of the ocean sciences.  Point Sur is a 135 foot Regional Class research vessel capable of supporting up to 12 scientists at sea for as long as three weeks at a time.  With a range of 6,800 nautical miles at a speed of 10 knots, she is capable of operations anywhere in the Eastern Pacific ocean.  In fact during these past few years Point Sur has traveled from Moss Landing, CA to Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula and to Attu Island in the western Aleutian Islands supporting primarily NSF funded researchers.  Point Sur supported researchers looking at the effects of ocean acidification on kelp forests in the Aleutians, the recovery of Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) as part of a post seismic event study off the coast of Chile, Physical Oceanographic observations around the Baja Peninsula and in the Gulf of Alaska, Whale population studies in the Antarctic, studies of Mercury transported in coastal fog, the recovery of optical telemetry instruments from a seafloor borehole observatory and a study of waves and currents at the mouth of the Columbia river, just to name some of the many research projects made possible.  These and other peer reviewed and funded research projects made possible with support by the Research Vessel Point Sur for the basis for the Intellectual Merit of this project.  A summary of the operational days supported during the final three years of operation is shown in the following table.          Agency/Year    2012    2013    2014    Total      NSF    67    136    79    282      NAVY    17    29    4    50      NOAA    1    17    11    29      ACOE    0    8    0    8      MBARI    3    1    0    4      MLML    10    5    13    28      Total    98    196    107    401         Broader Impacts:  As part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet the R/V Point Sur was a shared use asset available to any qualifying researcher or educator with a funded project.  Access to state of the art research facilities is fundamental to a successful U.S. ocean sciences research enterprise. Through the support of the National Science Foundation and other Federal Agencies and the coordination provided by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) the operation of vessels such as the Point Sur is made possible.  The National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research provide the capital investment with the construction and ownership of the majority of the vessels in the fleet.  UNOLS Operators such as Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) provide the expertise and management to effectively support research and education funded by the Federal Agencies and by the institutions themselves.  In the case of the Point Sur educational programs were a very high priority supporting the development of oceanographers and marine scientists of the future.  Class cruises for graduate students at MLML and at the Naval Postgraduate School made up about 10% of the annual operations.  In the final year, a program for early career scientists that provided training in how to serve as a research cruise Chief Scientist was supported with funding by NSF, ONR and MLML with three short cruises and classroom activities.  With the retirement of the Point Sur a valuable asset for research and education on the Central California Coast has been lost. However with the sale of the vessel to the University of Southern Mississippi the vessel continues to support research and educational programs in the Gulf of Mexico.
