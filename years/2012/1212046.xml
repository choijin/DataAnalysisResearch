<AbstractNarration>Liquid Crystals (LCs) are orientationally ordered fluids. In a broader sense, LCs can be thought of as soft matter with orientational order, an emerging class of complex fluids. There are many experiments which show interesting flow phenomena in liquid crystals.  We focus on two of these, where vorticity, driven by external sources, creates material flow.  In the Janossy effect, dye molecules under photoexcitation in a liquid crystal host act as rotors of molecular motors, and generate vorticity and subsequent flow. In the Yokoyama-Tabe experiment, chiral molecules in a Langmuir monolayer are caused, by a transverse current of water vapor, to rotate and give rise to flow. This award will support work aimed at understanding such phenomena, where local torques, acting essentially as point sources of vorticity, give rise to macroscropic translation and flow.  The work will be carried out through an interdisciplinary collaboration involving applied mathematics and physics, with the goal of developing a sound mathematical model which is capable of predicting the dynamical behavior of orientationally ordered systems where flow plays an essential role; and building robust computational tools that will capture the essential features of the interplay between flow and microstructure. The mathematical model we propose has two important components. First, it is the use of the full orientational probability density function, rather than a few of its moments to characterize orientational order.  Second, the flow dynamics is included in the model. It is known that inhomogeneous flows play important roles in forming transient microstructures, thus the orientational state must be coupled with the macroscopic flow field. This will lay the framework for the study and design of other complex soft matter systems where flow and local vorticity play important roles. A novel aspect is the exploration of the effectiveness of peer mentoring by graduate students from applied mathematics and physics collaborating on this project.   &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;In the rapidly advancing field of materials science, complex fluids are emerging as an increasingly important class of materials.  They are capable of exhibiting a remarkably broad range of behavior in response to excitations, leading to a wide variety of applications.  This rich responsivity originates in physical processes which are made possible by complex internal structure.  Complex fluids range today from liquid crystals to micro- and nanocolloids, virus suspensions and active biofluids. A key component of many of these systems is orientational order of the constituents. Remarkable and unexpected behavior can result from the coupling between orientational order and translation; this includes rubber lasers and light driven plastic motors. This award will support work aimed at understanding such phenomena, with the goal of building computational tools to describe and to help to understand and utilize the responsible mechanisms. The broader impacts of the proposed work are the usefulness of the developed tools to the larger community in the design of photo-responsive soft matter, metamaterials for transformation optics and strategies for biological transport.  They include contributions to science and mathematics education at the graduate level. The two graduate students, one in applied mathematics and one in chemical physics, participating in this project will gain expertise in various aspects of this multifaceted work and will benefit from interactions with more senior members of the research team and each other. A vigorous effort will be made to encourage the participation of women and members of underrepresented groups in this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Liquid crystals are materials which are both solid- and liquid-like; this dual aspect is responsible for their many fascinating properties.  In addition to display applications, they are also important in biology; cell membranes are liquid crystals.  Although a great deal is known about liquid crystals, their mechanical properties are incompletely understood.  We know how they respond to forces, which cause translation, but there are questions about how they react to certain torques, which cause rotation.    In this work, we asked what happens if point torques &ndash; rotlets &ndash; are applied to nematic liquid crystals.   Although rotlets seem fanciful and abstract, they can be realized in a variety of ways &ndash; by using light (optical tweezers), chemistry (rotating nanoparticles) and combinations of these (molecular motors).   A rotlet in an ordinary fluid (such as water) will cause the water to circulate (with shear flow) near it, but have very little effect far away.   If the water freezes, however, then there is no shear, and the entire body undergoes uniform rotation.   A liquid crystal, whose rod-like molecules are oriented by the flow, behaves solid-like in some areas, and liquid-like in others.  To understand the behavior, we have solved (coupled partial differential) equations which describe both the translational and rotational motion of the liquid crystal in response to the externally applied rotlets. Due to their complexity, numerical techniques were devised to allow numerical solution of the equations on computers. Describing the response requires not only specifying the local velocity, but also information about the statistics of orientation of elongated molecules.  The model describes the flow of angular momentum current (the spreading out of the influence of the rotlet) and gives insight into how this effect changes from causing rotation near the rotlet to translation far from it.  Results of this research may be useful in designing better liquid crystal displays and tunable lasers, as well as sensors and actuators and perhaps even novel drug delivery strategies. In addition, numerical methods were developed which will be useful in solving different problems with similar model equations.   Finally, the graduate student and the post-doctoral fellow working with us on this project have gained valuable skills in applied mathematics and physics, preparing them for success in their future scientific careers.
