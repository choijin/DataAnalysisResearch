<AbstractNarration>The Lesser Sunda Archipelago occurs as a double arc of islands extending between Java and Bali in the west and New Guinea in the east. This is one of the most geologically active and tectonically complex regions in the world. The Lesser Sundas may act as "stepping stones" between the Sunda Shelf (Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, Java, and Bali) and Sahul Shelf (New Guinea, Australia), thereby forming a two-way filter for organisms dispersing between two of the world's great biogeographical realms, Asia and Australo-Papua. This study investigates speciation and biogeography of this region by applying phylogenetic and biogeographic methodologies, along with coalescent-based population genetic approaches. The study is comparative, investigating 12 amphibian and reptile species complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel to this program is the development of 200 nuclear DNA loci for each focal taxon using a bait-capture approach that harnesses the power of Next-Gen DNA sequencing. Loci will be analyzed using phylogenetic and population genetic methods to evaluate broad biogeographic patterns across SE Asia, patterns of diversification thoughout the Lesser Sundas, gene flow at lineage boundaries, and to estimate divergence times for speciation events within the archipelago. Results will inform Indonesian agencies tasked with protecting areas of endemism in this Global Conservation hotspot.</AbstractNarration>

To the west, Bali and the other Greater Sunda Islands become periodically land bridged with Asia during glacial maxima forming the Sunda Shelf, while New Guinea becomes periodically land bridged to Australia forming the Sahul Shelf. Given their current orientation between these two shelves, the Lesser Sundas may act as &lsquo;stepping stones&rsquo; for fauna dispersing into the archipelago and may act as a two-way filter. The reptiles and amphibians of the Lesser Sundas represent a particularly interesting group of vertebrates from a biogeographical standpoint because they appear to show distributional patterns that are most consistent with a stepping-stone model of island colonization. In this study, we investigated the possibility that six focal taxa (flying lizards, forest skinks, emerald skinks, bent-toed geckos, paddy frogs, and fanged frogs) have colonized the archipelago in a stepping-stone manner. This was tested using sequence data from mtDNA and hundreds of nuclear loci, whereby the relationships among island-specific lineages was used to infer the timing and sequence of island colonization.</p> <p>Flying lizards (<em>Draco boschmai </em>and <em>D. timoriensis</em>)&nbsp;form a monophyletic group that colonized the western Inner Arc islands of Lombok or Sumbawa from the Sunda Shelf around 10 million years ago when Lombok and Sumbawa first became land-positive.&nbsp;<em>Draco&nbsp;</em>continued expanding eastward through the Inner Arc until they reached Lembata, while a series of dispersal events from Flores south to Sumba, east to Timor, north to Wetar, west to Alor, and finally west to Pantar (the island immediately east of Lembata).

But rather than reaching Alor from neighboring Pantar,&nbsp;<em>Sphenomorphus&nbsp;</em>dispersed from Flores south to Sumba, then east to Timor, Alor, and Wetar. There are multiple non-sister lineages of&nbsp;<em>Sphenomorphus&nbsp;</em>on Lombok, Flores, and Sumba, and estimates of migration between lineages within each island suggest that these lineages are not interbreeding.</p> <p>Emerald skinks (<em>Lamprolepis smaragdina</em>) came from Peleng Island to the north, which lies just east of Sulawesi.
