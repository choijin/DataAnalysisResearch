<AbstractNarration>The National Partnership for Environmental Technology Education (PETE) is assisting Tribal and Pacific Rim Colleges in improving their Environmental Technology programs by providing educational resources and professional development to build an informed and up-to-date environmental 'green' workforce. Under the guidance of a Tribal and Pacific Rim College Steering Committee the project provides 1) one-on-one technical assistance to Tribal and Pacific Rim Colleges, 2) an Indigenous Environmental Fellows Institute each summer for Tribal and Pacific Rim College faculty, as well as a limited number of high schools serving indigenous populations 3) mini-grants to assist with the implementation of curricular projects resulting from the Institutes, and 4) webinars highlighting Fellows' successes. Project outcomes are available to all 35 Tribal Colleges and 3 institutions in the Pacific Rim (U.S. Territories).  This project is increasing the STEM skill sets of Tribal and Pacific Rim students by improving STEM faculty skills and enhancing college programs. The project also encourages high school graduates and non-traditional indigenous students to enroll in environmental technology and related natural resource programs to better serve the needs of their local communities. Project activities are evaluated through a culturally sensitive, logic model driven approach.  Results are disseminated through an interactive website.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Partnership for Environmental Technology Education (PETE) and the NSF ATE Advanced Technology Environmental and Energy Center (ATEEC), supported by an active Project Steering Committee, identified specific needs of Tribal and Pacific Rim colleges who were developing environmental technology programs. PETE and ATEEC have experience assisting colleges in developing STEM programming that meets economic development and employment needs on indigenous lands. This project helped Tribal and Pacific Rim college faculty develop skills and curricula to support environmental management and technology programs that are consistent with their institution&rsquo;s culture and heritage and support economic development and employment in their local indigenous communities.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impact:</strong> There are 565 federally recognized Tribes in the United States and roughly 4.9 million Tribal individuals. There are 35 Tribal Colleges serving this population of individuals. Tribal colleges are often the only postsecondary institutions within some of the Nation&rsquo;s poorest rural areas. They serve roughly 30,000 full- and part-time students and provide crucial services to communities that suffer high rates of poverty and unemployment. On the other hand, the colleges in the Pacific Rim are often the only option many indigenous students have of obtaining secondary education due to their remote locations. At the time of project award, local population on Guam and throughout the Pacific Rim was expected to boom as the military relocation to Guam from Japan occurred. This new population of people was expected to create a heavy burden on the infrastructure and increase the demand for social amenities, including education. This project was designed to increase STEM skill sets of Tribal and Pacific Rim students by improving STEM faculty skills and college programs and by encouraging high school graduates and non-traditional indigenous students to enroll in environmental technology and management programs that serve the needs of their communities.</p> <p><strong>Accomplishments</strong>: To support the project goals, there were three facets of the project that were completed.</p> <p><strong>Fellows Institutes</strong>: Three week-long Fellows Institutes were held for Tribal and Pacific Rim high school and community college faculty, each focusing on a specific environmental issue. Participants learned case studies, teaching strategies, and gained background in Indigenous Pedagogy at each. A total of 29 instructors participated in the three Institutes, representing two Tribal high schools, 13 of 32 Bureau of Indian Education Colleges, five Pacific Rim Colleges, and two Pacific Rim high schools. Instructors learned about:</p> <ul> <li>2013 Indigenous Fellows Institute was hosted by Guam Community College and instruction focused on natural resource management.</li> <li>2014 Indigenous Fellows Institute was hosted by Fort Berthold Community College and instruction focused on the impacts of energy resource development (the host school is located in the midst of the Bakken Shale energy extraction in northern North Dakota).</li> <li>2015 Indigenous Fellows Institute was hosted by Honolulu Community College and instruction focused on climate change and its effects on Indigenous populations. </li> </ul> <p>Instructors were eligible to apply for funds to help implement the instructional materials developed in response to the Institutes (since Tribal and Pacific Rim schools are known to lack financial resources for classroom instruction); 43 awards were granted to individuals. The instructional materials that were created by participants are openly available to instructors on the project website, as are recorded professional development webinars relating to the Institutes (www.nationalpete.org/nsf-indigenous-education/).</p> <p><strong>Technical Assistance</strong>: Ten Tribal and Pacific Rim colleges received one-on-one assistance in program assessment and/or program development. These colleges were awarded services through a competitive application process. The reports generated through this process are available on the project website.</p> <p><strong>Further Project Outcomes Dissemination</strong>: &nbsp;Four individuals were granted funds to attend a professional development conference to help further their curricular developments beyond the Fellows Institutes.
