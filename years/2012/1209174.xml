<AbstractNarration>The unique collaboration between the University of Massachusetts Lowell and the University of Massachusetts Medical School has as its primary focus to quantify microinequities that affect the recruitment, retention and advancement of women in the STEM disciplines.  Many advances have been made in addressing the most visible barriers to increased participation of women in STEM fields. However, to date, the focus on microinequities has relied on qualitative analysis of the subtle biases that prevent women STEM faculty from achieving their full potential.  To date, little to no evidence has been provided on the creation or development of quantifiable metrics and tools for the assessment of subtle gender biases and other roots of microinequities in an effort to eliminate these subtle discriminations and, ultimately, make them negligible.  A scientific understanding of and metrics for microinequities are expected to be relevant in refining existing techniques and designing new methods for addressing gender biases in the academy.  This project, because of the nature of the partnership between these institutions, is expected to impact not only the campuses involved, but also multiple campuses within the Massachusetts public higher education system.  The products that result from this project are also expected to benefit not only women, but also male faculty in all fields; and they will provide the foundation for addressing similar subtle biases in non-academic and/or international environments.  Ultimately, with a robust dissemination plan, this project will transform the study of microinequities and how their impact on all underrepresented groups, both within and outside of academic arenas, is determined.</AbstractNarration>

In the past, the &ldquo;glass ceiling&rdquo; had been created and maintained by men who explicitly expressed sexist attitudes. Even with the social disdain that society holds for overt sexism, the glass ceiling is still maintained in the U.S. today. This project posited that the glass ceiling that women face within the academic workplace is caused by subtle gender biases. It is because subtle gender biases indirectly impacts women&rsquo;s promotion and tenure that it is more difficult to pinpoint the social conditions that make it difficult for women to meet tenure and promotion standards and requirements (e.g., more published research, more grant funding). Subtle gender biases are not just annoyances or uncomfortable interactions; they cause real harm to women&rsquo;s career advancement.
