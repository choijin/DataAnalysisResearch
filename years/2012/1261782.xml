<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the development of numerical tools and nanomanufacturing processes for characterizing the structure-process-performance relationships of nanosphere coatings on silicon thin films. These coatings have the potential to not only enhance solar efficiencies without introducing additional surface recombination, but also reduce manufacturing processes and costs. The developed numerical tools will determine optimal structures for enhanced efficiencies while considering both ordered and disordered structures. Detailed simulations will be performed on optimal structures to determine the role of scattering and whispering gallery modes as well as to determine the angular performance of coated solar cells and evaluate transport characteristics. Scalable, inexpensive spin coating methods will be used to understand how nanosphere coatings may be assembled onto silicon thin film photovoltaics.  Manufactured samples will be characterized structurally, optically, and electronically to validate simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will lead to improvements in the design of next-generation solar cells. This could also have a profound impact on other nanophotonic applications that make use of whispering gallery modes such as optical filters and biosensors. A broad impact is envisioned in the areas of solar cells, topology optimization, and nanomanufacturing.  This project will also educate and outreach to next-generation engineers through open source software development, the introduction of various education modules, and involvement with the Pitt Office of Diversity's INVESTING NOW summer program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching objective of this project is to investigate and develop novel processing methods that can manufacture a large quantity of novel hydrogen storage materials (LiBH<sub>4</sub> + MgH<sub>2</sub>) with control at atomic or low-nanometer length scales. The LiBH<sub>4 </sub>+ MgH<sub>2</sub> system has attracted worldwide attention in the last several years because of its potential to store and release hydrogen at relatively low temperatures with a theoretical capacity of 11.6 wt.% H<sub>2. </sub>Thermodynamically, hydrogen release of the 2LiBH<sub>4 </sub>+ MgH<sub>2</sub> mixture at temperature below 200 <sup>o</sup>C would be possible. However, the 2LiBH<sub>4</sub> + MgH<sub>2</sub> system has significant kinetic barriers. As a result, significant hydrogen release will not occur until temperature is higher than 300 <sup>o</sup>C. In this project, we have focused on investigation of a transformative manufacturing method, termed as Ball Milling with Aerosol Spraying (BMAS), to obtain nanoscale LiBH<sub>4</sub>+MgH<sub>2</sub> mixtures, thereby overcoming kinetic barriers and releasing H<sub>2</sub> below 200 <sup>o</sup>C.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit:</span></strong><strong> </strong>We have conceived, designed and established the BMAS process (Figure 1) and used this novel manufacturing method to synthesize nanoscale LiBH<sub>4</sub> + MgH<sub>2</sub> mixtures. In this process, aerosol droplets of LiBH<sub>4</sub> solution are sprayed into the air-tight canister of an attritor, while ball milling of MgH<sub>2</sub> powder is taking place. Aerosol liquid droplets will become solid nanoparticles when the droplets impinge on the surface of MgH<sub>2</sub> particles and balls where the local temperature can be high (~200 <sup>o</sup>C) due to the high speed collision of balls. As a result, LiBH<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles will coat on the surface of MgH<sub>2</sub> particles and be occluded into MgH<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles later as ball milling continues because of repeated fracture and cold-welding of MgH<sub>2</sub> particles during ball milling. We have shown that nanoscale LiBH<sub>4</sub> and MgH<sub>2</sub> can react to form MgB<sub>2</sub> and LiH with release of H<sub>2</sub> if ball milling is performed without water cooling. This is the first time that nanoscale LiBH<sub>4</sub> and MgH<sub>2 </sub>are proven to react near room temperature to release hydrogen gas &ndash; a goal long pursued by many investigators but not able to accomplish it. The hydrogen release from the LiBH<sub>4</sub>+MgH<sub>2</sub> mixture near the ambient temperature becomes possible because nanoparticles have low kinetic barriers. In fact, a new reaction pathway, as predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, has been taken by the BMAS-processed nanoscale LiBH<sub>4</sub>+MgH<sub>2</sub> mixture. In contrast, micrometer-sized LiBH<sub>4</sub>+MgH<sub>2</sub> mixtures cannot take this reaction pathway because of their significant kinetic barriers. We have also discovered that by ball milling MgH<sub>2</sub> alone first and then infiltrating nanoscale LiHB<sub>4</sub> into the ball milled MgH<sub>2</sub> powder can result in significant release of H<sub>2</sub> from MgH<sub>2</sub> at 150 <sup>o</sup>C (Figure 2). Such an important result has never been achieved before by any other means unless the tactics leading to irreversible reactions is used. The significant release of H<sub>2</sub> from MgH<sub>2</sub> at 150 <sup>o</sup>C becomes possible because of the new reaction pathway enabled by nanoscale LiBH<sub>4</sub>.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts: </span></strong>The novel discoveries and advancements made in this project provide new directions to make the LiBH<sub>4 </sub>+ MgH<sub>2</sub> mixture as a viable system for reversible hydrogen storage applications near 150 <sup>o</sup>C in the near future. The principle established in this project has also opened up a new direction for investigating and improving the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation properties of many other systems containing multiple hydride components that have favorable thermodynamic properties for reversible hydrogen storage, but with limited kinetics.
