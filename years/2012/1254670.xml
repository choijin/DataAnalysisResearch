<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant provides funding for advancing a new sheet metal forming process, referred to as "hot blank-cold die," which is particularly suited for manufacturing components out of lightweight materials, such as magnesium and aluminium alloys. A coupled thermo-mechanical numerical tool will be developed to simulate the process and capture the non-isothermal material deformation. The numerical tool will incorporate analytical material models that take both anisotropy and changes in the microstructure into account. Uniaxial and biaxial tensile tests will be carried out over a wide range of conditions (temperatures and strain rates), in order to fully characterize material behaviour and calibrate the material models. Overall validation of the numerical tool will be performed by comparing predictions to experimental hot blank-cold die forming runs under various process conditions. The latter will be performed progressively, starting from small-scale lab experiments, to full-scale forming runs of automotive components. Material properties in the formed parts will be evaluated and post-process maps will be constructed, paving the way for future process optimization work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed process has the potential to enable the manufacture of these hard-to-form alloys at lower cost and higher throughput than is currently achieved with hot forming operations. The research outcomes could enable product design for these limited-use materials, especially for light weighting of automobiles. The project has educational and outreach components that will foster undergraduate research activities in a graduate-only institution, integrate education and research within a recently-established automotive engineering program, and will enrich educational and outreach activities at the only Children's Museum in the upstate region of South Carolina. The project will also contribute to developing an Educational Television Program that aims at promoting awareness of grand long-term issues (energy conservation, sustainability, etc.), and inspiring the younger generations on how engineering and innovation help tackle such issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lightweight materials (particularly advanced aluminium and magnesium alloys) have been considered the key to achieving lower fuel consumption vehicles; yet the persistent problem is how to incorporate such materials into the highly cost and production rate sensitive "automotive sector"?  The research component of this CAREER award focused on developing a new manufacturing process, referred to it as "Hot-Blank Cold-Die" or simply "HB-CD", for forming low-density lightweight materials (aluminium and magnesium alloy sheets) into automotive body components. The main attractive attribute of HB-CD is its "simplicity" compared to warm and hot forming processes. Nevertheless, HB-CD involves complex material deformation characteristics that have not been adequately studied before, and thus they are not fully understood. This research project tackled these issues through a systematic approach that covered the following:  Comprehensive mechanical testing at different temperatures and speeds to capture material deformation characteristics Microstructural examination to evaluate the microstructure of the material and its changes at different process conditions Aging characterization for heat treatable alloys to capture strengthening and softening  Evaluation of other thermal process parameters related to heat loss during transfer and thermal conduction to forming dies Developing constitutive models that can accurately capture the deformation behaviour of the material during the forming process Feeding the constitutive models into commercial finite element solvers (ABAQUS and LS-DYNA) through user-defined subroutines Comparisons between finite element simulation results and experimental results for validation of the developments of this project.      The approach was applied to different magnesium and aluminium alloys, including heat treatable AA7xxx alloy sheets. The overall tools developed in this project enable optimum manufacturing of aluminium and magnesium parts at production rates similar to those of conventional steel stamping.     In addition to the technical outcomes, this project included a wide variety of educational and outreach activities that aimed at educating and exciting young children about advanced materials and manufacturing. For several years, the faculty and students at Clemson University-International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR) working on this project hosted elementary, middle and high school visits, and hosted several intensive summer camps for high school students from around the country to learn about automotive materials, manufacturing and design.
