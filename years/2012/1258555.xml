<AbstractNarration>PI: Gonzalez, Roger V.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0966398&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fundamental motivation of this study is to develop two complementary computational assessment tools, based on finite element and multi-body dynamic simulation theory based on established musculoskeletal and parametric modeling techniques. We believe these computational tools will amend how knee stability is currently assessed and thus allow for potentially transformative changes in the current preventative and rehabilitative practices prescribed for ACL injuries. Currently, insufficient and inadequately corroborated quantitative measures exist of in-vivo knee stability and menisci/tibal plateau loads and displacements during intense dynamic activities. Ability to maintain kinematic stability is imperative in everyday tasks such as standing or rising from a chair and is especially critical during intense dynamic activities such as running or climbing stairs. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and its involvement in knee stability and adverse intersegmental loading is an important and significant topic within biomechanics. Knee ligaments play a secondary role to muscles, which are the primary knee stabilizers. Nevertheless, the absence of ligaments makes stability more difficult, especially when muscle coordination is impaired or when loads are applied more quickly than neuromuscular response time allows. Thus, considerable interest has been given to knee stability and intersegmental forces, especially when associated with ligament failure. Our focus is to quantify knee [in]stability in ACL-Deficient (ACLD) subjects and the role that this [in]stability plays in increasing intersegmental forces including how variations in knee geometry contribute to changes in such measures. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit and Engineering Principles Applied: The project will (1) further develop a detailed finite element (FE) and anatomical musculoskeletal computer model to quantify knee ligament strain, anterior tibial translation (ATT), and intersegmental forces (ISF), (2) develop an improved load-generating knee specimen experimental apparatus used to verify and evaluate the computational models, (3) statistically assess the deviation between unimpaired and ACL-impaired knee stability parameters with emphasis on intersegmental forces and altered neuromuscular patterns, and (4) improve and extend our pilot FE models of the human knee to a high-fidelity parametric FE model using statistical shape modeling techniques. The improved load-generating cadaver experiment is a significant improvement to current knee studies as it accounts for time-varying muscle forces from multiple muscles in synchrony with joint position. Muscle activation and motion data will be obtained from healthy subjects (ACL-intact) and "coper" subjects (ACLD and functional). Ligament strain will be measured in eight knee ligament bundles of cadaver knee specimens during artificial time-varying multiple-muscle loading conditions derived from human trials. The FE and computational models will perform dynamic simulations to estimate ligament strain, and the results will be compared with data from the load-generating cadaver experiments. The computational model will also be refined to replicate the key characteristics of ligament strain, ATT, and ISF as measured in the experiment, as well as implement proven techniques of validation and verification within parametric probabilistic modeling. As a result, this research is to develop two complementary computational assessment tools (FE and multi-body dynamic simulations) that will change the way we are able to assess knee stability and ISF, and allow for potentially transformative changes in the current preventative and rehabilitative practices prescribed for ACL injuries. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research project is performed primarily by undergraduate students for academic credit and through research assistantships at LeTourneau University under the direction of the PI and in consultation with Dr. Dan Nicolella at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). To enhance the research experience provided to these undergraduate students, half of the summer interns will spend the entire summer at the biomechanics and materials laboratory at SwRI, co-mentored by Dr. Nicolella and his professional staff as they work on the computational knee models and perform additional experiments. This project blends learning, discovery, and research into a unique undergraduate experience that will provide students with comprehensive preparation for future graduate studies in engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  During the course of this grant, undergraduate students at LeTourneau University were exposed to cutting edge biomedical engineering research for the first time, and a state-of-the-art biomechanics laboratory was established at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). At this lab, a multidisciplinary team of researchers have coordinated their efforts to produce novel methods of investigating human musculoskeletal biomechanics. Our goal is to quantify the internal knee loading for a variety of medical conditions during daily and sport-related activities and to determine the consequences towards the onset and development of degenerative joint diseases like osteoarthritis, which has become a major public health issue.   Our project focuses on the development of (1) a novel cadaveric joint simulator to collect internal joint loading conditions during quasi-static and highly-dynamic motions, (2) feedback mechanisms, and (3) experimentally-validated computational musculoskeletal models to simulate various medical conditions and motions and to determine which combinations of kinematics and kinetics loadings are more likely to cause osteoarthritis onset. As the knowledge of what causes joint injury increases, the ability to prevent injury also increases. With more preventative medicine, more efficient rehabilitation techniques, and more reliable joint replacement options, there will be fewer occurrences of degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis, so that society can experience a better quality of life.  This grant has provided research skills for undergraduate and graduate students in several scientific areas, including mechanical engineering, biomechanics, computational modeling, robotic control systems, and statistical analysis. We give public and private tours of our research laboratory and our students regularly guide elementary and high-school students through the research they perform. Many of these students are minority students from the local area. In addition, we participate in national and international scientific conferences and started to systematically publish our findings. This past year, four abstracts have been presented at national and international conferences, one research paper has been published, one research paper has been submitted, and one short communication, one technical note, and one research paper will be submitted in the next 3 months.  Data collection methods for cadaveric studies:  We designed and built the UTEP Joint Load Simulator (UTJLS) to replicate real-time joint kinematics in synchrony with ground reaction forces (GRFs) and muscle forces. Being the first design of its kind, this simulator offers a variety of unique opportunities to support advancement in musculoskeletal research and an improved understanding of joint disease and injury. We designed a more reliable knee pressure sensor to ensure reliable and accurate in vitro data collection. Specimen mounting in the UTJLS is assisted by a custom fixture using line lasers to guide alignment and complex casting molds that accommodate a large range of bone sizes without intersecting muscle paths.  Data collection from human subjects and squat training methods:  We acquired a motion analysis system and have utilized it for two studies with living subjects and the development of input data for a related cadaver study. The first study with living subjects investigated the efficacy of an auditory feedback training program developed in our lab. Participants using auditory feedback simultaneously achieved target knee flexion angles and foot center of pressure during body-weight squats. Trained subjects retained the given targets one week after training, which demonstrates the effectiveness of a training program that uses concurrent and terminal feedback. This study is a stepping stone to promote auditory feedback for use outside the laboratory, where individuals can correct their form and reduce their risk of injury.    The second study with living subjects investigated changes in neuromuscular control during a highly dynamic maneuver following squat technique training. Results from this study indicate that such training did not improve performance during dynamic activity for recreationally active males. We further hypothesize that simple motion training does not affect control within tasks of complex motion. Strength, power, and balance training must be implemented to improve plyometric motions.  Joint load simulation of heel and toe squat maneuvers:  Tibiofemoral contact forces, anterior tibial translation, and ligament strain were quantified during real-time, in vitro simulations of heel and toe squat maneuvers. Results from this study indicate that a proper heel squat technique generate an even medio-lateral loading distribution on the tibial plateau, which reduces the risk of occurrence of high pressure areas and in turn minimizes the risk of mid-to-long-term joint degeneration such as osteoarthritis.  Computational modeling:  We developed and automated the creation process of three types of model: (1) a musculoskeletal model of the leg using in vivo motion analysis data to compute joint kinematic and muscle forces, and thus provide inputs for the in vitro joint simulator, (2) a novel rigid-body model of the knee to simulate menisci deformation and compute cartilage pressure, without having to rely on a finite element model that is usually much more computationally expensive, and (3) a FEA model of the knee.
