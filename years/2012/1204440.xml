<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI used this award to fund a postdoctal position at U.C. Berkeley under the guidance of Prof. Bernd Sturmfels.  The PI contiued his research in moduli spaces, a broad and active topic in algebraic geometry, culminating with a disproof of the so-called Castravet-Tevelev hypertree conjecture.  Of theoretic interest, this conjecture inspired much work at the interface of algebraic geometry and combinatorics which continues to flourish.  The PI used the decreased teaching load provided by this NSF grant to learn field of tropical geometry, of which Prof Sturmfels is one of the founders and leaders, and the PI wrote under the auspices of this grant one of the foundational papers on the topic which introduces an algebraic and scheme-theoretic framewore for tropicalization.  This work provides a new perspective on this exciting recent topic and looks to expand on applications (ranging from pure math to phylogenetics to economics) in the near future.  In terms of broader impacts, under this grant the PI: designed and taught a freshman seminar on math and law to help expand mathematical literacy; led a graduate research course on tropical geometry; led an undergraduate research course on topoligcal data analysis; mentored numerous undergraduate and graduate students; and engaged in professional development centering on diversity and inclusion.  The PI successful used this postdoctoral fellowship to transition to a tenure-track position and is continuing and expanding upon both the research and the broader impacts stimulated by this grant.
