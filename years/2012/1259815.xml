<AbstractNarration>This project is to award 30 scholarships annually to financially needy, academically talented students for five years in Biotechnology, Computer Information Systems, Pre-Engineering, and Natural Resources at Mount Wachusett Community College (MWCC).  Programs and services designed to enhance student learning, academic performance, retention to graduation, and career or higher education placement in the project include: 1) support and mentoring of students by faculty and other professionals; 2) academic support services such as tutoring, study-groups, or supplemental instruction; 3) industry experiences, internship opportunities, and research opportunities; 4) community building and support among S-STEM scholars within the institution; 5) local or regional professional, industrial or scientific meetings and conferences; 6) career counseling and job placement services;  and 7) adaptation of existing support services to meet objectives of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful results of the project and lessons learned will be shared with other faculty, staff, students, colleagues, and agencies in north central Massachusetts through the MWCC monthly newsletter, its website, presentations, and discussions of the program by staff across the region and at professional meetings. Similarly, results will be shared with student aid professionals by MWCC staff at national conferences such as the National Association for Student Financial Aid Administrators and the Massachusetts branch. The project has the potential to inform the larger STEM education community about the best practices for student success.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Mount Wachusett Community College (MWCC) was awarded a National Science Foundation STEM SET (Science Technology Engineering Math; Students Embracing Talents) S-STEM grant. The purpose of this scholarship program was to support full-time biology, chemistry, computer information systems, Earth science, engineering, and math students in order to increase retention, graduation, and transfer rates. 128 STEM majors with unmet financial need were recruited to the S-STEM program over six years. They were given wraparound support including scholarship funding, a dedicated faculty mentor in their field of study, monthly enrichment and networking activities including invited speakers and industry field trips, as well as additional tutoring opportunities outside those offered to all MWCC students. Scholarship students had an average retention rate of 71% between Fall 2013 and Fall 2018, while their non-scholarship full-time STEM major peers had a retention rate of only 51% in the same time period. Using the federal definition of first time full-time students, 32% of S-STEM scholarship recipients graduated with an Associate degree and transferred to four-year Baccalaureate institutions between Fall 2013 and Fall 2017 start years compared to only 10% of their non-scholarship full-time colleagues during the same time. Completion rates were also compared between STEM SET and non-scholarship STEM students. An average of 83% of S-STEM funded students completed their courses with a grade of C or better as compared to 71% of STEM majors outside the STEM SET program. Interestingly, the course failure rate was 6% for S-STEM students versus 14% for their non-funded STEM major peers. While tutoring was a mostly unused benefit of our program, 23% of our S-STEM students increased their cumulative grade point average (GPA) by an average of 17% during their time in the program. In the 2018-2019 reporting year, 68% of STEM SET students reported they interacted with their mentor often or very often, which is up from 47% and 56% over the last two reporting periods. 87% of this year's cohort reported that their mentor introduced them to new career options in their STEM field, and 58% of students reported that their knowledge and confidence in their chosen field had increased during their time in the STEM SET program. 88% of year six students reported being very or extremely satisfied with the STEM enrichment series which provided monthly speakers or field trips throughout the funding period. This is an increase from 65% in the previous funding year. We believe that our mentoring relationships and cohort building enrichment activities were crucial elements of the S-STEM program that had a significant impact on students' retention, graduation and transfer rates compared to their non-S-STEM counterparts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/26/2019<br>      Modified by: Carrie&nbsp;Reindeau-Arnold</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
