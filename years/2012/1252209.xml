<AbstractNarration>What drives ethical treatment of others?  Do we learn ethical values/behavior only as children or can ethics be taught effectively later and, if so, how can ethics best be taught in the high-tech age?  Can computer games successfully pose moral dilemmas ranging from personal choices to ones specific to certain professions such as medicine, law, computer science, and engineering?  Can we develop games that are culturally and contextually-rich yet universal enough to have broad appeal while not privileging one set of values or ethical system?  The PI's goal in this exploratory research is to tackle questions such as these, as Stage 1 of the Ethical Games Project to include a summer internship program, an undergraduate class, and a graduate seminar testing the importance of an empathy-inducing intervention on students' ethical action and ethical self-examination, as measured by a variety of psychometric and ethnographic tests.  Pre- and post-tests of ethics will be administered to 40-50 students participating in journal writing and conducting/analyzing narrative interviews with someone "different" (an elder) as well as with a moral exemplar (a philanthropist or someone who has saved another person's life).  The "intervention" will consist of the students putting themselves in the place of another via the narrative interviews, and will ask about the impact of such empathetic intervention on students' ethical action and ethical self-examination.  The project thus will focus on two foundational conceptualizations of ethics: ethics as behavior that furthers human well-being, and ethics as thinking reflectively about the consequences of one's action.  The project will ask about both the reliability of such tests and the relationship between empathy and ethics, by comparing results of different measures on subject and control groups.  By these means the PI hopes to understand how best to conceptualize, operationalize and measure ethical self-reflection, ethical action and empathy, and also the possible relationships existing among empathic involvement and the diverse measures of these ethical phenomena.  In particular, she will attempt to determine how the different measurements relate to each other, whether and how the substantive relationship detected between empathy and ethics is affected by the different measures employed, and whether certain measures privilege particular values (justice vs. compassion, deliberative vs. non-reasoning) or groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  If successful, project outcomes will lay the groundwork for future work on socio-cultural variations and will elucidate the value-structures latent in psychometric and ethnographic tests and ethical games, which in turn will form the basis for a larger project that will develop a game for computers, tablets, and mobile phones, thus utilizing 21st century technology to test one of the oldest ideas in ethics, namely that empathic involvement with another fosters and encourages more compassionate and ethical treatment of that person or group.  Such a game could provide a cost-effective way to teach ethics and reach audiences now left untouched by traditional teaching methods.</AbstractNarration>
