<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;09 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1219288&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;PI:   W. Byam&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI:  [None]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment item for the University of Delaware for the R/V HUGH R. SHARP; namely control system up-grades for the existing CTD Handling System.  This award represents Phase I of a multi-year project award that will eventually support similar system up-grades on the University of Hawaii's KILO MOANA.  This project will greatly enhance safety and science support capabilities on both vessels.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit:  The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed equipment specifically for the R/V HUGH R. SHARP.  The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit.  During operations, these vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Specifically, College of Marine and Earth Studies participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events (Coast Day), participation the MATE program, and educational cruises.  The College also hosts the UNOLS East Coast Van Pool.  The R/V HUGH R. SHARP is scheduled to support over 90 NSF-funded days in CY 2012.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award provided upgrades and refurbishment to a key scientific equipment handling system aboard the Research Vessel HUGH R SHARP.  Phase one consisted of the redesign and upgrade of the control system of the Conductivity Temperature and Density (CTD) handling system on the ship.  The second phase of the project involved refurbishment of the physical arm system and foundation, as well as procurement of long lead time spare parts so they are on-hand in case of system failure.  The CTD overboarding system is used on nearly every scientific cruise.  The CTD provides water column and water sample data key to numerous oceanographic research applications. The system aboard the SHARP has been operational for ten years, so failure of components due to normal wear and tear was more probable.  Failure of the system to function would severely impact scientific capability required by ship users  Intellectual Merit:   The equipment upgraded by this award will help support scientific operations and data collection in the mid-Atlantic region.  The intellectual merit of these individual projects is determined by peer review at NSF.  The scientific questions posed must be meritorious enough to warrant funding by NSF.    Broader Impacts:  The number of missions supported by the HUGH R SHARP typically exceeds twenty per year, with 180-210 days at sea.  The HUGH R SHARP is truly a shared-use science support facility utilized by numerous agencies and institutions.  Funding for the science support equipment helps provide the research community with the most reliable, modern and capable platform possible.  Without regard to the discipline of science on each cruise, almost every scientific station the vessels complete involves a water column profile utilizing the CTD rosette which can weigh up to 1,400 pounds.  The HUGH R SHARP performs hundreds of CTD casts each year.          Last Modified: 10/12/2016       Submitted by: Jon Swallow]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
