<AbstractNarration>This research will explore the role of the bacterial protein SeqA in genome stability.  This important but poorly understood protein appears to be involved in protecting cellular DNA during replication from deleterious recombination events. Themes established here can be extrapolated to other organisms and potentially lead to the development of genome manipulation procedures in important and diverse bacterial systems.  This work will also help explain how a large and important family of mobile DNA elements or "jumping" genes that can move between sites in the DNA are capable of disseminating genetic information across vastly different types of bacteria using a protein called TnsE.  This work also indicates features that are conserved across the most distantly related organisms on earth while highlighting a feature that allows a parasite to adapt to specific types of bacteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research will be disseminated widely at multiple venues including national and regional meetings. Tn7 is an important tool for modifying the genetic content of a broad variety of bacteria for basic science and industrial applications.  The work will continue to facilitate such efforts.  In addition to training a graduate student, the work will also involve multiple undergraduates in meaningful research experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding from this two year award lead to a number of advancements.  We are interested in determining the molecular mechanisms that organisms use to protect their genome from attack by mobile DNA elements.  Our work indicates that while duplicate copies of DNA information are being made it becomes vulnerable to the entry of parasitic elements that can then live inside the genome of the organism.  This work helps us understand how evolution occurs by the transfer of DNA information between organisms.  We work in a bacterial system, but the same systems are found in all life forms including humans.   We work with a DNA element that moves within bacteria that allows them to acquire extra genetic information called a transposon.  Virtually all antibiotic resistance in bacteria is attributed to these elements.  The element we work with (called Tn7) is particularly good at moving around without hurting its host; it can insert into a single conserved site found in all bacteria, but also recognize other DNA elements that are capable of transporting it to new bacteria.  This drastically increases the ability of Tn7 to spread (along with the information it encodes). Our work has been published in peer reviewed journals to advance our understanding of the process.  In one of these published works we characterize a new mechanism that allows a transposon to recognize DNA replication using a toggling mechanism that does not perturb the DNA replication process using a "loose grip" that does not engage until a very specific structure is recognized.  We analyzed this process in detail by learning what the molecule looks like at the atomic level, but were able to relate this structure to how the protein functions alone in the test tube and in living cells.  Specific mutants in this protein allow us to be confident in our results.  In multiple other published works we synthesize results from our lab and the work in many other labs in a series of review articles and instructional pieces.  We also distributed information broadly at scientific meetings.  Multiple undergraduates, graduate students, and Postdoctoral associates were also trained.  We also gained considerable preliminary information that indicates important areas for future research.  We are organizing these exciting findings for submission.  In particular, we have identified a specific bacterial host protein that appears to protect DNA while it is replicating. We can show that Tn7 can recognize this protective protein physically and functionally.  This work strongly suggests that Tn7 has the "key" to allow the element access to the host DNA while DNA replication is occurring.  Following up with these findings should reveal more about how evolution occurs and how we can apply this information to modifying bacteria and other organisms for research and commercial applications.
