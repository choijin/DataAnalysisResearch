<AbstractNarration>1266159 Iowa State University; David Grewell &lt;br/&gt;1266249 University of Massachusetts Lowell; Margaret SobkowiczKline &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the proposed center are: to improve the basic understanding of the synthesis, processing, properties, and compounding of bioplastic and biocomposite materials; to develop reliable material characteristics data for industrial partners; and to support large-scale implementation of renewable magterials. Iowa State University and the University of Massachusetts Lowell are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with Iowa State University as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in the creation of transformative new materials and processing technologies and the necessary reliable, comparable material data to allow efficient and profitable industrial use of biorenewable alternative materials. This will reduce dependence on petroleum and the release of harmful greenhouse gases. The team of researchers includes experts from the fields of polymer processing, polymer chemistry, materials science, and crop utilization. It combines a wide breadth of experience and expertise allowing a well-rounded interdisciplinary approach. The proposed center's vision is to develop the knowledge that will allow the production of an array of high-value products, including plastics, coatings, adhesives, and composites, from agricultural feedstocks that are compatible with current manufacturing systems at attractive scales and thereby promote rural-based economic development and sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will have positive impacts on the environment and the economy. The knowledge generated through research at the center will accelerate the demand for bioplastics, promoting a substantial, sustainable workforce that is less likely to be outsourced. Because much of the research will be conducted by undergraduate/graduate students and postdoctoral research associates, this center will train and educate future scientists and engineers. The center will also prepare web-based videos targeted at K-12 teachers that will provide instructions on how to make simple and easy off-the-shelf bioplastics in the classrooms. By leveraging existing activities on the various campuses, the center will strive to achieve 50% recruitment of under-represented students. In addition, by working with the same organizations and using a similar approach, the center will strive to retain 90% of these students.</AbstractNarration>

Kessler attended the annual meeting for I/UCRC Directors and the associated Boot Camp January 8-10, 2013.     Dissemination of Results:   (1)   Prepared and maintained a website (linked to the highly ranked ISU BBRT website) detailing CB2Æs work and partnerships, benefits of center membership, and how to join. The webpage includes:  details about membership, news releases, announcements, intellectual property activities, and activities such as workshops and tradeshow participation.   (2)   Placing advertisements, news releases, and expert articles in trade publications and websites as well as the popular press. This included an ad in Bioplastics Magazine, the only international trade journal focused on bioplastics  (3)   Regularly visiting key companies onsite and hosting them at the proposed center location to encourage collaboration and membership. This included but was not limited to visits to P&amp;G, Ford Motor Company, Hyundai, NatureWorks, and Boeing.  (4)   Hosting a webinar detailing the proposed Center, July 29 2013 that was attended by 30 potential industry partners.  (5)   Conducting a workshop at UML on the benefits of Center on November 11 2013 that was attended by ten potential industry members.  (6)    Booths were presented at two tradeshows highlighting the proposed center:  ANTEC: Annual Technical Conference of the Society of Plastics Engineers, annual international event, 800?1,000 attendees, April 22-25, 2013; and  K-Show International Trade Fair, triennial international event, over 200,000 attendees, October 11-...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
