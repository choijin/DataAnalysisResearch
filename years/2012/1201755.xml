<AbstractNarration>Abstract (Proposal No.1201755)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication between integrated circuits, such as the CPU and peripheral blocks, occurs over a high-speed bus, which requires physical wire traces on a printed circuit board.  In most mobile computing and communication platforms, such as a smart phone or tablet, the form factor is constrained by the requirement to connect to this bus.  We propose a sub-THz (~300 GHz) wireless bus that eliminates this constraint, allowing integrated circuits to be placed anywhere inside of the device with communication links established wirelessly and automatically.  New circuit, antenna, and system architectures will be explored to enable an energy efficient realization of the key components of such a system.  Two prototypes at 240 GHz and 360 GHz will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The described technology could have tremendous impact on the design of a new generation of ultra thin and small devices, allowing chips to be placed in the most optimal positions, either to increase the aesthetics of the design or enable better engineering.  The link is established using the sub-THz frequency spectrum (~300 GHz) using on-chip electronics and antennas in standard CMOS technology.  To be competitive with the wired links, the link must be extremely energy efficient and must not occupy a bigger footprint on the silicon die than existing systems.  Antennas at sub-THz frequencies are in fact extremely small and can be comparable in size to traditional bonding pads, which are used to connect to the physical traces.  Moreover, due to the large carrier frequency, only modest fractional bandwidth is needed to support high throughputs using simple modulation schemes.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Wireless communication is a rapidly growing field and its importance to the national economy cannot be overstated. While in the previous decades the semiconductor industry was driven largely by the digital microprocessor market, today the combination of high performance computation on a portable device combined with voice and data communication is the major driver.  This research is intended to advance the state of ?smart? phones, tablets, and ultra-portable laptops.  A wireless chip-to-chip communication channel, or a wireless bus, will enable integrated circuits to be minimized (by removing IO pads/pins), allow the board real-estate to be used with increased flexibility, reducing the number of planes in the printed circuit board and reduce the required amount of  waste.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Wireless communication has become ubiquitous as most of us have come to rely on our mobile phones, tablets, and laptops for daily work, communication, and entertainment.  Several key technologies have enabled this wireless connectivity, including well known "WiFi" radios and "Bluetooth" radios, both of which operate in the 2.4 GHz frequency band.  Other technologies, such as LTE or the fourth generation ("4G") radios, operate from 500 MHz up to 4 GHz and also provide wireless connectivity at a much larger scale.  Due to the wide proliferation of wireless devices, there is a scarcity in spectrum that has lead to much research and policy in the past few years.  This research effort is one of them and it addresses the spectrum scarcity by exploring completely new frequency bands, above 100 GHz, to understand the limits in performance and the feasibility of operating at such high frequencies.  This research will impact the next generation of wireless communication, "5G" or perhaps "6G", by enabling very high data rate communication using conventional inexpensive technology.     One of the problems with working at such high frequencies is that itÆs difficult to even get electronics to work beyond 100 GHz, as transistors, the basic building blocks of electronics, cannot turn on and off fast enough to generate such signals.  While many groups around the world have demonstrated that some key building blocks can be built above 100 GHz, using new techniques that take advantage of high harmonics generated by transistors, no one to date had actually built a complete working system.  We tackled this task by exploring very short range wireless communication to potentially displace todayÆs wired chip-to-chip links.  Chip-to-chip links are ubiquitous and used to carry information from say a microprocessor to memory and back.  These links today are very fast and relatively short range, say a few centimeters in length.  By making these links wireless, one could potentially enable new form factor devices or eliminate cables / wires for convenience or ease of use.      The reason that we tackled this system design problem is several-fold.  First, high speed links are used in virtually every system in existence, and many would benefit from a wireless link.  Second, these links should run as fast as possible, and operating over 100 GHz is probably the only way to enable links that can run fast enough to make the overall system efficient.  We targeted operation at 240 GHz and a data rate as fast as 20 billion bits per second.  To understand the speed of this link, consider that a typical WiFi link runs at 50 million bits per second, or about 400 times slower.  While in principle it is possible to make a fast link with a lower carrier frequency, it would require extremely complex modulation and coding schemes whereas operating at a high carrier frequency allows the modulation scheme to be very simple.  Moreover, another benefit of moving to high frequency is that the wavelength gets smaller, which means that the antennas needed for wireless communication get smaller.  Consider the antenna inside of a mobile phone operating at 2 GHz.  Typically, these antennas are a fraction of the wavelength, with dimensions roughly of 10 centimeters on a side.  By working at 240 GHz, our antennas shrink to a size of only half a millimeter on a side.  This is small enough that we can move these antennas onto the chip itself, making it possible to design a complete radio system inside of the chip.  This is why we say that we are making wireless chip-to-chip communication possible, because the signals actually radiate from inside of the chip.     One of the major outcomes of this research has been the demonstration of a fully functional wireless link from one chip to another using a 240 GHz carrier frequency and integration of the entire system onto a CMOS chip.  CMOS technology is the workhorse of the electronics industry and it forms the core of tablets, mobile phon...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
