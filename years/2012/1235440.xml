<AbstractNarration>Infrastructure systems include many embankments for highways and railroads.  In seismically sensitive areas west of the Rocky Mountains and over broad areas of the eastern and central US - estimated to cover as much as 40% of the continental US, earthquake engineering for these facilities is very important.   A key design issue for such facilities is whether or not liquefaction - or the loss of shear strength of saturated sands - will occur during an earthquake.  If such a possibility exists, then one must either relocate the embankment or improve the potentially liquefiable soil to the point where the improved soil will not liquefy under the expected earthquake.  Loose sands are the soils most susceptible to liquefaction.  Two questions arise during design: (i) will liquefaction occur under a given earthquake loading, and (ii) what are the consequences of liquefaction? The most egregious effect is a flow failure of the embankment through the liquefied soil.  Because highway and railroad embankments traverse large areas, the costs of mitigating the effects of the liquefiable soils are large, as are costs related to realignment, if this option is followed in design.  To improve the ground over large areas, densification of loose sands by controlled blasting is an economical approach.  Blast densification consists of placing charges within the loose sand layer requiring treatment.  The charges are detonated with multiple delays to generate cyclic loads, similar to an earthquake.  Large amounts of gas also are released in the ground with each explosion.  The "design" usually relies on historic or previous contractor experience, as there is no rigorous theory that accounts for the parameters that influence the densification process.  Case studies have shown that loose sands compress almost immediately after blasting, but when common penetration tests are conducted to verify the increase in density, these results provide erratic and, at times, rather counterintuitive results.  If taken soon after the blast, the penetration resistance may decrease, and at times never increases to levels above the pre-blast level.  At the same time, the ground surface settles almost immediately after blasting, implying that loose sands in the subsurface have increased density.  However, the lack of increase in penetration resistance suggests that the strength and stiffness of the soil apparently does not.   This leads to questions about future performance.  Have the loose sands really been improved to the point where liquefaction is not a possibility?  Furthermore, how the released gas affects the soil behavior is ignored in design and verification, e.g., what form does the gas take in the ground, how does it dissipate and how does it affect the behavior of the sands in response to subsequent static and cyclic stresses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this GOALI research are to develop (i) a methodology to quantify the amount of densification required to make the soil resistant to liquefaction and flow in the presence of shear stresses with explicit evaluation of the effects of gasses released during blasting, and (ii) a means of reliable in situ verification of the ground improvement.  To achieve the first objective, a laboratory experimental program will be conducted to define the constitutive response of reconstituted "gassy"  sand specimens.  The laboratory program will account for in situ stresses and gas concentrations and include both monotonic and cyclic tests.  To achieve the second objective, a field verification program will monitor the soil and pore fluid responses before, during, and after densification at a production blast test section at a municipal waste disposal facility near Charleston, SC.   Blasting has been used at the site for more than a decade to densify loose sands, and Geosyntec Consultants is the engineer of record for this project.  The field studies will include pore pressure measurements, surface settlements, in situ testing, pore fluid sampling, pore fluid pressure measurements, and in situ gas concentration and composition measurements.  Combining the field and laboratory studies to evaluate the effects of the released gas during blasting provides a unique opportunity to remove the empiricism in design and the contradictory results obtained during verification testing.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to application to municipal waste fills, the results of this research will have direct application to infrastructure systems including many embankments for highways and railroads.  Also defining the behavior of moderately dense gassy sands will provide valuable data that currently does not exist which can have an impact in offshore applications, tailing dams and other conditions where gassy soils exist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Blasting is used to densify loose, saturated sandy soils,  When explosives are placed within a loose layer, the stress waves caused by the blast increase the pore water pressure until the sand reaches a liquefied state.  As the blast-induced pore pressure dissipates, the sands reconsolidate into a denser configuration.  Experience suggests that the technique can be effective in that the ground surface always settles, implying that the loose sand densified as a result of the blasting.  However post-blasting penetration tests do not always indicate that the targeted loose sand has increased density.  Furthermore, "design" of such projects relies upon historic or contractor experience, as there is no rigorous theory that accounts for all the parameters that influence the densification process.  A major uncertainty prior to this research was how the gas released from the blast affects the soil response, e.g., what form does it take in the ground, how does it dissipate and how does it affect the mechanical behavior of the gassy sands.        This project was a collaborative effort between Northwestern University and Geosyntec Consultants, Inc.  To develop a reliable means to verify the ground improvement, a field verification program was conducted to monitor the soil response during and after blasts at a test section near Charleston, SC.  Ground surface settlements and pore water pressures were measured, penetration and geophysical testing conducted, and pore fluid sampled and tested.  To understand the mechanical responses of gassy sand to monotonic and cyclic loading, a detailed laboratory experimental program was conducted.  Numerical simulations of the blasting at the test section were conducted to understand the ground response.          Blasting releases significantly quantities of carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas.  The measured concentrations of carbon dioxide at the top and middle of the targeted sand layer indicated that gas was diffusing over time towards the ground surface, but was trapped by a layer of silty clay.  Carbon dioxide contributes less than 1 percent towards the degree of water-gas saturation because of its high solubility in water.  Nitrogen significantly contributed toward the degree of water-gas saturation because of its relatively low solubility.  Water-gas saturation, mainly a result of high nitrogen concentrations, increased above 100 percent, lowering the degree of saturation below 100 percent and created occluded bubbles within the otherwise saturated sands.  The presence of the occluded gas changed the mechanical behavior of the sand and thus the responses of the sand to penetration testing such that the expected increase in resistance caused by the increase in density caused by blasting did not occur.  Therefore, ground improvement cannot be verified with measured penetration resistance after blasting if gas remains trapped in the target layer.   These results are supported by reexamination of published case studies that indicated that gas released during blasting will reduce post-blasting penetration resistance if a relatively impervious stratum overlies the loose sand layer or if the loose layer contains significant amounts of fines.  Otherwise, penetration results will reflect the increased density induced by blasting.           Based on the results of the laboratory and field experimentation, an in situ testing protocol has been developed to assess ground improvement after blast densification.        The fundamental knowledge developed during this work can be applied to tailings materials that contain gas as well as to moderately dense gassy soils commonly found offshore.  Both these soil types have been shown to be unstable in the presence of shear.  The results of this work can be applied to the waste disposal industry wherein gas from municipal waste landfills can migrate and affect the mechanical behavior of the impacted soil.  The results also suggest that merely injecting air into a s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
