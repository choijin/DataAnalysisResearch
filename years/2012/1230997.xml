<AbstractNarration>The thirty second Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE) will be held at Wake Forest University, on October 19-20, 2012. The conference website is http://www.math.wfu.edu/SEARCDE2012. This conference has met annually since 1981. It was initiated by members of the Department of Mathematics at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and has since then rotated among the research institutions in the southeast. The location chosen for this year event is the Wake Forest University campus, which is centrally located in the southeast and has hosted many well-attended meetings in the past, including two previous SEARCDE conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference brings together many researchers under the broad umbrella of Differential Equations. Both theoretical and applied approaches are well represented. Distinguished plenary speakers are invited from both within and without the region. The conference also provides a supportive environment where students and new PhDs can present their research and interact with more seasoned experts. Supporting the development of new researchers is one of the central goals of SEARCDE.</AbstractNarration>
