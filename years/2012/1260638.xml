<AbstractNarration>Dr. Rahul Oka and Dr. Nitesh Chawla of the University of Notre Dame will investigate the causes, consequences, and complexities of trader behaviors and the effects of external forces (political stability, trade friendliness, and business opportunity) on trader network transformations in India, Kenya, and South Sudan. Using ethnography, oral history, and Social Network Analysis, they will develop anthropological research tools that are sensitive to temporal and spatial specificities but which are scalable, transferable, and predictive. The result will be a cross-culturally valid model of the effects of political connectivity and social networks on human behavior in economic exchange relationships that can be used to understand how different types of trader networks affect local and regional economies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will collect data on trader and political networks for a sample of 60 traders in India, Kenya, and South Sudan. Two methods will be used to collect and analyze the data: a) qualitative ethnography and oral history of individual traders and their relationships, and b) quantitative network analyses of these networks over 20 years.  The combined analyses will enable a better understanding of how traders differentially placed politically maintain or develop their commercial activities and how these affect larger trader networks and economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this research will improve theoretical understanding of the scope and impact of trader-politician alliances and their outcomes. It will also provide valuable tools for development efforts, specifically in assessing potential responses to external interventions in local and regional economies. This research will enable theory building within both anthropology and network science on the underlying causes and consequences of trade and its impact on societies. The project also will provide research experience for American undergraduate and graduate student through fieldwork, inter-disciplinary analyses, and professional presentations/publications, and establish a cross-disciplinary collaboratory between American and international scholars.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary goal of this research was to investigate how political stability and regulations affect the way that people conduct business. Most theories on regulation maintain that if governments lower regulation and control corruption, everyone would benefit. Many international loans and aid are dependent on recipient countries lowering business regulations. But our previous research suggested that in reality, some might benefit from lowered regulation, but others might not. Our data suggested that in conditions of greater INSTABILITY and/or higher or even predatory (bribery, fiat) regulations on business, business people take fewer risks, cooperate with each other, and share resources and information while still competing with each other in more equal networks. Hence the economy might grow, but slowly. Conversely, in conditions of greater STABILITY and lowered regulations on business, some business people take higher risks, and compete more with each other in more unequal networks, sometimes using predatory behaviors such as market domination, and monopolies, and use their friendships with politicians and officials to protect themselves.</p> <p>Hence, we decided to test our previous findings on larger networks of traders who were experiencing changes in political stability and regulations based in three countries, Kenya, India, and South Sudan. These countries have active trading communities, but with differing regulatory and stability conditions: India- stable, high/predatory regulation; Kenya- unstable, high/predatory regulations, and South Sudan: volatile, predatory regulations. We used two methods to collect data: (1) Ethnography: spending time with traders as they conduct business, conducting intensive repeated interviews and observing real trading behaviors, and (2) Social Network Analysis, in which we asked traders to report their relationships with other traders and political actors going back 10-20 years. Our methods allowed us to build trust and hence observe and record &lsquo;real behaviors&rsquo; and get data that would not be shared with outsiders. Fieldwork was conducted in India and Kenya. Due to the political violence in South Sudan, South Sudan-based traders were interviewed in Kenya. The ethnographic data showed how local processes affected trader behaviors in each of the countries AND identify behaviors and structures that are common across these societies.&nbsp;The network data helped us to understand how these common structures emerge despite cultural and geographical differences. We collected trader and political alliance network data for 196 traders active in India, Kenya, and South Sudan through 15 field seasons between 2013 and 2018.</p> <p>Our key finding was that regulations and stability were the primary drivers of trader behaviors and trader/trader-political networks, as suggested by our previous data. Specifically, instability and high regulation are correlated with more equal networks/cooperation, while stability and low regulation are correlated with more unequal networks/greater competition. However, we found that type of business also determined the difference between cooperation and competition. Businesses that were more socially controlled (clothing, jewelry, grain, groceries, petroleum, vegetables) tended to show more cooperation. Businesses that were not socially censured: service sector (IT, real estate) and luxury comestibles (tobacco, betel nut) showed remarkable competition. We also found that every successful trader network regardless of stability/regulatory conditions demonstrated the presence of political influencers who arranged for informal meetings in social settings between stakeholders, to minimize disruptions and to provide access to political actors. Although few in number and their services are not cheap, influencers are potential stabilizers/destabilizers and can ensure durable relationships even in highly volatile areas such as South Sudan. We have also gathered data to reexamine theories on the role of weak ties and inadvertent relationships as traders seek to build, maintain, and grow their businesses. However, our most significant finding in terms of both its intellectual merit and broader social impact is that in both India and Kenya, there were numerous business reforms between 2013 and 2018 aimed at more competitive and efficient business processes, especially for small individual traders. According to The World Bank Ease of Doing Business Rankings, Kenya went from the rank of 129 in 2013 to 61 in 2018, and India from 132 in 2016 to 77 in 2018.
