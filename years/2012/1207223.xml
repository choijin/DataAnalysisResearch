<AbstractNarration>The proposed collaborative project from Lafayette College and California Polytechnic State University is rooted in the theory of intersectionality as it relates to gender and race/ethnicity.  The project has three major objectives that include assessing the attentiveness of recent ADVANCE programs to issues germane to women of color, examining the rationale of those strategies utilized in addressing the underrepresentation of women of color and identifying successful practices and strategies that have been successfully implemented in the ADVANCE program.  This project, which represents the first systematic exploration of the ADVANCE program and its focus on women of color will combine a pilot study, funded proposal content analysis and interviews with funded ADVANCE project personnel.  It is expected that the outcomes of this effort will support the ADVANCE program in promoting inclusiveness as it relates to gender equity.</AbstractNarration>

Focusing on the persistent lag faced by underrepresented minority (URM) women in US academic science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields, this project had two specific over-arching goals: 1) to contribute to current research on enabling URM women in academic STEM fields and 2) to advance broader current discussions concerning how intersectional approaches might be applied to shape institutional transformation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Because intersectional analysis offers an approach that simultaneously addresses multiple forms of subordinate identities, we began with the premise that intersectionality could offer new insights into the seemingly intractable institutional dynamics that have stymied the progress of many URM women in STEM fields.&nbsp; Our project tracked the efforts of the 3rd and 4th cohorts of institutions awarded NSF ADVANCE Institutional Transformation (IT) grants.
