<AbstractNarration>Proteins are the molecular machines that are responsible for a vast array of functions that are necessary for life.  Understanding how they work is critical to both a better scientific understanding of the fundamental processes of life, and to modifying or improving their function.  Despite the fact that proteins are physically 3-dimensional structures of cooperating parts, the current state of the art for representing and studying proteins uses a description that is simply a sequential list of the parts used in their assembly.  This sequential-list style of description has biased the development of tools for protein analysis to accentuate the sequential properties of these molecules, and to ignore the fact that the parts must work together in unison for the protein to function.  This project will adapt a recently-developed statistical technique, the Conditional Random Field (CRF), that can quantitatively represent densely-connected networks of features, and a recently-developed visualization tool that enables interactive exploration of these networks, for the task of describing proteins.  Structurally, Conditional Random Fields appear to recapitulate the process by which evolution has selected for parts that cooperate in proteins, and protein descriptions based on CRFs will be able to predict whether a change to a protein - a mutation - would have been tolerated by evolution, or selected against as non-functional.  This information will aid in predicting the effect of a mutation, or multiple mutations to a protein, using much more of the available information, than is currently utilized by state-of-the-art tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will broadly impact the study of proteins, improving a range of activities from basic scientific studies of function, to endeavors in protein engineering. In addition, the "change in protein sequence to change in protein function" problem is a "model organism" for many other types of biological and non-biological systems where rich interactions between parts of the system demand a sophisticated statistical approach.  To-date, in most of these fields, models that are similarly limited to those currently used in proteins are the de-facto standard.  Developing the tools necessary for applying CRFs to protein data, and methods of establishing testable ground-truth in this system, will enhance the application of CRFs to many other domains where they may provide a significant advantage over current methods.   The products of this project will be made freely available to the research community as online tools, and the methods will be incorporated in coursework, first in the Biophysics Graduate Program at The Ohio State University, and as the teachable component matures, made available as lesson-plan material appropriate for both primary and secondary education.  By developing a tool that makes interdependencies between features visually explorable and modifications of these dependencies quantifiably predictable, we will promote more thorough consideration of the true complexity of data and systems in many domains.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The goals of this project are to investigate and demonstrate the parallels between a Conditional Random Field (CRF), and the way that "Biology" calculates the fitness of a protein. The foundational hypothesis is that "Biology" calculates the acceptability of a particular elemental residue in a particular position in a protein performing a particular function, through a process that is highly analogous to the calculations involved in a CRF. To stress, Conditional Random Fields are considered to be a significantly superior way to model "family membership" for protein and nucleic-acid sequences. An appropriately-trained CRF will be able to answer the question "is this protein a good member of protein family X" - where "good member" is defined as having a native-like catalytic (or other fitness-required functional) activity, in contrast to today's alignment/comparison algorithms that can only say "this protein is evolutionarily related to the family".  Unfortunately, currently successful demonstrations of CRFs  are mostly either "toy" demonstrations, or where the data and data-relationship structure are well-behaved. CRFs cannot currently be applied to any but the simplest realistically complex problems, due to a "chicken and egg" training problem, wherein most CRFs cannot be trained with realistic computational resources without prior knowledge of an optimal network of computable interactions.  Through the course of this project we will build upon our in-house visual-analytics software suite (StickWRLD) that enables construction of, and computation on the "biological conditional random field" of proteins, to make its capabilities available to the general research end-user, and perform biological validation of its efficacy in predicting protein functional response to sequence changes.  Our StickWRLD visual analytics approach enables users to collaborate with the machine to develop computable interaction networks, facilitating the discovery of "residue relationships" that could not have been discovered. By coupling the visual interface of StickWRLD  with a powerful data mining engine new unknown families can be discovered. The following are the outcomes of this project:   Developed analytically-enhanced, visually reactive and  useful (to biologists) version of StickWRLD.   Developed a significant understanding of the biological reality of the impact of one collaborating group of residues in Adenylate Kinase, with additional groups that were tested for recently.   Analyzed families of protein alignments and pairwise evolution statistics for  Adenylate Kinase, to identify significant groups of residues that appear to cooperate.  Wet-bench was conducted to determine which criteria are biologically relevant.   Trained a post-doctoral candidate, six graduate students and at least 4 high-schoolers. This cohort of trainees were exposed to highly interdisciplinary research in both computer science and biology.   Going forward, other families of proteins will be examined for functionally compatible residue pairs. In the long-term, this project  will have profound impact on domains ranging from basic understanding of the sequence determinants of function, through protein engineering, to a better understanding of how genotype affects phenotype.
