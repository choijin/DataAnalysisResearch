<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aggressive syndromes, in which some individuals are consistently more aggressive than others over a range of contexts, have been documented in multiple species. Although the expression of aggressiveness should be favored in male competition, such behaviors may be disadvantageous in interactions with predators, offspring or mates, creating evolutionary trade-offs. Understanding the physiological mechanisms that influence aggressive interactions may help us understand why some individuals express aggression in inappropriate contexts in ways that are detrimental to survival and reproduction. Stalk-eyed flies provide an ideal model system to investigate both the physiological mechanisms and the reproductive and survival fitness consequences of aggressive syndromes because males in many species use their exaggerated head morphology in dramatic, ritualized aggressive displays in different contexts, including male competition, reproductive display, and predator-prey interactions. The proposed research uses behavioral and pharmacological approaches to test whether the maintenance of aggression levels displayed by male stalk-eyed flies across these contexts is mediated through changes in the function of two key neurotransmitters, serotonin and octopamine.  Students ranging from pre-college to graduate levels in Colorado and South Dakota will participate in these studies, providing them with meaningful and valuable research experiences. These experiences are important to encourage students to pursue careers in science. Because children are often first exposed to the formal process of science and discovery in public schools, an effective scientific educational program must include outreach to both children and teachers. The investigators will help train the next generation of Colorado science teachers by exposing them to the process of scientific discovery through immersion in project-based internships. Exposure to project-based laboratory experiences will better prepare these teachers to inspire the next generation, affecting potentially thousands of children. The investigators will also develop and deliver hands-on laboratory exercises for students attending science camps in South Dakota. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data will be made available for free access following publication of results. Data will be available via ResearchGate (ResearchGate.net) and linked with published articles.</AbstractNarration>
