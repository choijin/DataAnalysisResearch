<AbstractNarration>This project supports a workshop  entitled `` DATA-DRIVEN ENERGY SYSTEMS:  From Data Collection to Information Technology  for  Sustainable Services?? to be held at Carnegie Mellon University on March 12-14, 2012.  It is a part of the 8th Carnegie Mellon University Electricity Conference that provides  a venue for  structured brainstorming  by the thought leaders in multiple communities. One of the key premises in this workshop is that IT-enabled flexible utilization of assets is key to sustainable energy services.  However, the challenge is enormous as the industry paradigm shifts from the predictive, worst-case centralized data management to highly distributed interactive data and resource management.   Invited talks by the academic, industry and government participants will be presented to pose these problems more formally, to assess state-of-the-art, and to investigate new approaches. The conference proceedings will provide a point of reference for future research and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This project supported a workshop concerning ``Data-Driven Sustainable Energy Systems". The March 12-14, 2013 workshop was co?organized by Marija Ilic from Carnegie Mellon University and Richard Schuler from Cornell University. The workshop was the main part of the 8th CMU Electricity Conference; its record can be found in http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~electricityconference/2012/. One of the key objectives was to bring together leading researchers from across key disciplines, such as electric power systems, computer science and economic public policy, all working toward defining rapidly emerging use of data in physical infrastructures such as energy systems.  Intellectual Merit: One of the major messages to take out of the workshop was that it is not sufficient to design the best optimization tools without understanding the structure of dynamic processes (temporal spatial, contextual) in the domain application such as energy systems. This, in turn, requires taking a step back and revisiting currently used models and encouraging R&amp;D efforts needed to enhance models for the evolving architectures. In short, one of the major workshop conclusions was that we are dealing with very complex network systems and that there are at present no well?established and accepted modeling, monitoring, communications nor decision making frameworks which are necessary to transform todayÃ†s grid into an enabler of sustainable energy services.     On the other hand, several academic views were presented concerning possible frameworks. It was clear from many presentations at the workshop that specific modeling and decision?making methods are proposed and that progress is being made, but there is major void regarding end?to?end valuation of these methods within the complex electric energy system. Another way of raising this issue is to think about the challenge of posing the use of many data?driven recent technologies, referred to a smart grid technologies (such as ``smart meters", synchrophasors, storage, power electronically?controlled delivery equipment &ndash;Flexible AC Transmission Systems?, just to name a few discussed in the Workshop) need to be deployed and utilized with clear understanding of the customersÃ† needs.

All layers can make decisions using their own data gathering, processing and assuming/learning through interactions the important effects of the rest of the system on the outcomes in the distributed layers.     Broader impact: Today the community is keenly aware of the need to view smart grid and electricity market design as a truly multi?disciplinary problem. The 8th CMU Electricity Conference in its ``Data?Driven Sustainable Energy Systems" had several industry people point out that ``things are not working": the engineering and economic policy signals are not aligned contextually, spatially nor temporally. As more intermittent resources get deployed into the existing electric power grids, there will be more hard?to?predict uncertainties, and it will become critical to have data?driven methods for predicting what can be predicted and for designing economic incentives to manage these uncertainties. Similarly, spatial effects of imbalances in one control area (subsystem) are not negligible in the neighbo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
