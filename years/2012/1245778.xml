<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to engage all of the introductory biology students at Gonzaga University (n=350) in a transformative research-based lab course during their freshman year.  The project goals are to 1) increase the science competencies of students at all three developmental levels (beginners, intermediate, and advanced), 2) increase the retention rate of underrepresented minorities in the sciences by engaging students early on in research, and 3) inspire other institutions to implement authentic discovery-based research on a large scale in introductory laboratory courses.&lt;br/&gt;Because of the growing recognition that research experience in the first year is a critical influence on retention in science, many programs are now offering an alternative introductory lab sequence based on discovering new mycobacteriophages and annotating their genomes) in a two-semester course, the HHMI (Howard Hughes Medical Institute) SEA-PHAGES (Science Education Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science) program. Based on the assumption that the gains observed among this select group of students are the kinds of gains all students could experience, the project team has devised several strategies to effectively scale up SEA-PHAGES and make it the  introductory biology lab course for 350 students per year.  The strategies involve 1) introducing a one-semester Gonzaga Phage Discovery Lab course for all students in the introductory biology class, 2) implementing a Phage Genomics module embedded within the 200-level Genetics Lab course, 3) offering a third course, Advanced Phage Research Lab, for upper division students, and 4) teaching the Phage Discovery Lab course for non-science majors, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  With this number of students engaged each year, this project is obtaining strong measures of the effectiveness of the one-semester Phage Discovery lab as a research experience for a wide variety of beginning science and non-science majors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The outcomes of this project, can increase the science education community's understanding of how best to increase the scientific literacy of all undergraduates.  The project is also producing teaching and learning materials adaptable by other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We live in a science-based society, yet, especially in the United States, there is a lack of basic understanding, and appreciation, of science. Including all first-year biology students in authentic research is one step toward transformation to a society that embraces science. Authentic research experiences are valuable components of effective undergraduate education. Research experiences during the first years of college are especially critical to increase persistence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. Research-based courses have been developed to provide such experiences to students in a classroom setting. A course called SEA-PHAGES, for example, engages students in discovering and characterizing a new virus from the soil that infects bacteria. The DNA genome of one of the viruses is decoded, and students use state-of-the-art analysis tools to study the new genome and share their findings with the scientific community. It is well-documented that this course has high impact, but it is usually only available to a limited number of students in schools that offer the course. We were interested in expanding the scale of this course at our institution so that every student who takes Introductory Biology would be able to experience authentic research. We modified the course and integrated it into our biology program so that all first-year biology students (350/yr) participate in the Phage Discovery Lab course, and all biology majors (125/yr) participate in genomic analysis of novel virus genomes in the Genetics Lab course. We added a third course for students who were interested in continuing virus research in a more independent setting. We found that our students increased their understanding and appreciation of science. Many understood for the first time that discovering something that was previously unknown, and sharing it with the world, is an exciting and important activity to be involved in. We published the outcomes of this project in the journal CBE-Life Sciences Education (Staub et al., 2016) so that our experiences would be disseminated widely in the college science education community. Our hope is that this project would inspire other institutions to offer more students course-based research experiences. With increasing numbers of people who get to experience scientific discovery for themselves, society may begin to move closer towards embracing the science that civilization so dearly depends upon.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/09/2016<br>      Modified by: Kirk&nbsp;R&nbsp;Anders</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
