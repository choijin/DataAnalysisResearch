<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this effort is to support the delivery of the I-Corps curriculum for the Q1FY13 cohorts; approximately 45 teams in total. The cornerstone of the NSF I-Corps program is an intense immersion in a curriculum founded on customer development and business model discovery platforms. Together these represent a customer-centric process based on a hypothesis-driven approach to identify and establish the viability of commercial opportunity. The I-Corps program seeks to empower the I-Corps teams consisting of PIs, Mentors and Entrepreneurial Leads with this knowledge through a 3-day workshop to be followed by 5 weeks of online curriculum. At the end of the course, the teams will reconvene at a single location for a lessons learned workshop. Through application of this grant, NCIIA will coordinate and support the curriculum including but not limited to all up-front logistics, registration, respondent questionnaires and online activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of an I-Corps project is to determine the commercial feasibility of the technology derived from research that has been supported by NSF. The I-Corps teams will learn how to evaluate commercial feasibility using a hypothesis-testing approach akin to the scientific method to which they are accustomed. Education is the primary component; participants will leave the program with an expanded skill set that will serve them as they continue to pursue their careers. In some cases, the teams will identify technology applications that have the potential to make significant commercial impact and may start new enterprises to pursue these opportunities. If the teams can successfully commercialize their technologies, they will create value and contribute to the economic prosperity of our nation. The effort described in this proposal will go toward supporting the curriculum throughout the process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview: The United States faces significant challenges in bringing the best science and engineering innovations to the global market. While we remain world leaders in scientific and engineering research and education, we can do much more to commercialize our best discoveries &ndash; particularly those emerging from university laboratories. For university research to achieve greater impact, academic researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) need more formal preparation in evaluating whether their discoveries can be readily translated into practical applications and eventual commercialization. For this reason, the National Science Foundation established the Innovation Corps (I-Corps&trade;) training program to support NSF-funded researchers in assessing the readiness of emerging technology and scientific research for commercial potential.  I-Corps participants exit the program with the tools to evaluate and translate their research into applications and products that can be launched as profitable businesses that strengthen and grow the U.S. economy  Summary of Activities: Under the scope of this grant, the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA) managed the delivery of three eight-week courses taught by seven newly trained I-Corps faculty. Over 200 scientists, engineers, and mentors representing 70 teams from universities across the country participated in these courses.  As part of completing this project, NCIIA developed a program overview video (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5v43xfIqO0) as well as the course syllabus for program participants; an I-Corps Faculty Development Program Workbook; an I-Corps Course Administration Handbook; and the I-Corps Teaching Manual.  To inform future offerings and monitor course quality, NCIIA developed a suite of course evaluation surveys, collected data from participants, and shared results with instructors, program staff and the I-Corps curriculum committee.  Project Outcomes: The course curriculum developed under this grant provides a scalable model for training additional instructors to implement National I-Corps courses and reach the widest possible network of university researchers across STEM disciplines. Many teams who completed the I-Corps course in 2011 and 2012 continue to pursue the commercialization of their products and technologies through founding startups, seeking licensing agreements, and raising funding and investment, with the goal of realizing future economic, social and environmental benefits. Specific outcomes:  70 NSF-funded teams carefully evaluated their      scientific discoveries for commercialization readiness by testing business      model hypotheses with potential customers; Over 200 scientists, engineers and mentors      developed new professional skills that will prepare them to extend the      impact of their work; Seven new instructors completed an I-Corps      instructor training program that prepared them to independently deliver      National I-Corps courses, thereby expanding the number of individuals and      teams that can participate in the program; A blueprint for replicating, evaluating, and      scaling a model of instruction at multiple sites across the country has      been developed; and A curriculum and model that can be adapted to      other programs that work across multiple locations and STEM disciplines      has been created.   As of August 2014, over a thousand scientists from 138 U.S. universities and their industry mentors have participated in the NSFÆs I-Corps program to pursue commercial applications for their research. Already, 174 teams have founded new companies.  In spring 2014, a survey of 2011 and 2012 I-Corps participants (279 individuals representing 134 teams) revealed that 78% of teams (105) received additional funding or investment to commercialize their projects. In addition, most non-industry mentor participants reported that I-Corps positively influenced their ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
