<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE Research Award is co-funded by the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB) and the Mechanics of Materials (MoM) Programs in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI), and the Biophotonics Program in the Division of Chemical, Biological, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET), both in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG).  In the United States alone, almost half a million people die each year as a result of heart rhythm disorders. Despite its invasive nature, electrical stimulation remains the gold standard treatment for rhythm disturbances in the heart. This project challenges the conventional wisdom of how to manipulate electrical signals in the human heart. The long-term goal is to establish a novel technology to control heart rhythm disorders, safely, precisely, and remotely, simply by means of light using a new concept known as optogenetics. The objective of this research is to create a biological pacemaker of genetically engineered cells that will allow us to decipher the basic mechanisms by which optogenetics can regulate the pump function of the heart. The research approach is a systematic theoretical, experimental, and computational characterization of photostimulation across four biological scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is highly innovative, since it adopts optogenetics, for the first time, to control human heart cells and tissue. It combines concepts, methods, and recent developments in optics, genetics, stem cell biology, electrophysiology, mechanobiology, biomechanics, mathematical modeling, and computer simulation. Its unusual interdisciplinary nature has the potential to reveal fundamental mechanisms of the photoelectrochemistry and mechanics of living systems. This knowledge gain will stimulate discovery in optogenetics and initiate new technologies to manipulate excitable cells. The transformative potential of the work is that it may open new avenues to support the design of novel therapies for various types of neuronal, musculoskeletal, pancreatic, and cardiac disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, paralysis, diabetes, pain syndromes, and cardiac arrhythmias.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the award period of this INSPIRE award Optogenetic Control of the Human Heart: Turning Light into Force, one clinical instructor, Oscar Abilez; four postdoctoral researchers, Husnu Dal, Pablo Saez, Martin Genet, and Johannes Weickenmeier; four Ph.D. students, Jonathan Wong, Manuel Rausch, Adrian Buganza Tepole, and Alexander Zollner; two graduate students Katrina Wisdom and Maria Holland; and four undergraduates, Tim Kosmata, Tyler O'Brien Shultz, Jaqi Poq, Nickolas Forsch, Nithya Vijayakumar, and Maytee Vipavayangku were involved in this project with financial support through this award and personal fellowships. Through this project, five of them have been prepared for an academic career: Husnu Dal is now an assistant professor at the Middle East Technical University of Ankara in Turkey; Pablo Saez is an assistant professor at the Univeristat Politecnica de Catalunya in Spain; Martin Genet is an assistant professor at the Ecole Polytechnique by Paris in France; Adrian Buganza Tepole is an assistant professor at Purdue University in Indiana; and Manuel Rausch is an assistant professor at the University of Austin in Texas.</p> <p>Altogether they have published 1 book, 1 special issue of the European Journal of Mechanics A/Solids, 35 peer-reviewed journal articles, 29 of these with Dr. Kuhl as senior author. These publications address expanding and differentiating pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes [Myers et al. 2013], isolating human pluripotent stem cells through high-throughput technologies [Abilez et al. 2013], characterizing cardiomyocyte co-cultures [Chen et al. 2013], characterizing force generation [Buganza et al. 2014, Buganza et al. 2014a, Goktepe et al. 2014, Wisdom et al. 2015, Zollner et al. 2012, Zollner et al. 2015] modeling the living human heart [Baillargeon et al. 2014, Baillargeon et al. 2015, Bothe et al. 2012, Genet et al. 2015, Hurtado et al. 2014, Kuhl 2014, Lee et al. 2015, Rausch et al. 2012, Rausch et al. 2013, Rausch et&nbsp; al. 2013a, Rausch et al. 2013b, Saez et al. 2013], and creating efficient multiscale, multiphysics algorithms for cardiac electrophysiology [Dal et al. 2013, Wong et al. 2013, Wong et al. 2014] and cardiac optogenetics [Zhuge et al. 2014].</p> <p>In May 2013, our group has started a close collaboration with the largest commercial finite element company, Abaqus/Dassault Systemes, towards implementing our core algorithms into the Abaqus infrastructure. Together with the Living Heart team at Dassault Systemes, we have established the first four-chamber cardiac simulator for human heart function [Baillargeon et al. 2014]. The Living Heart project was officially launched in May 2014 and keeps receiving broad media attention, see <a href="http://www.3ds.com/heart">http://www.3ds.com/heart</a>; <a href="http://www.3ds.com/heart">http://www.3ds.com/heart</a>; <a href="http://www.3ds.com/heart">http://www.3ds.com/heart</a>. To date, the Living Heart ecosystem has grown to 50 contributing member organizations with more than 150 cardiovascular specialists who have free access to our heart simulator to test and accelerate the development of the Living Heart via crowdsourcing. The Living Heart project unites leading cardiovascular researchers, medical device manufacturers, regulatory agencies, and practicing cardiologists on the shared mission to develop and validate personalized digital human heart models and establish a unified foundation for in silico cardiovascular medicine. Our computational models, which form the core of these efforts, are documented in various peer-reviewed journal articles [Baillargeon et al. 2014, Baillargeon et al. 2015, Genet et al. 2016, Goktepe et al. 2009, Goktepe et al. 09a, Sahli et al. 2016, Wong et al. 2014] and featured as the cover story [Brown 2015] of the April 2015 ASME Mechanical Engineering Magazine.</p> <p>As part of this project, Dr. Kuhl has co-organized the Euromech Colloquium 545: Frontiers in Finite-Deformation Electromechanics in Dortmund, Germany in spring 2013 to establish an active research community and foster scientific exchange. To highlight the results of this colloquium, selected speakers were invited to contribute to the special issue Frontiers in Finite-Deformation Electromechanics, which was guest-edited by Dr. Serdar Goktepe, Dr. Andreas Menzel, and Dr. Ellen Kuhl and published as Volume 48 of the European Journal of Mechanics A/Solids in 2014.</p> <p>To highlight research activities in the field of multiscale modeling of biological systems, which feature a core of this NSF project, Dr. Kuhl edited a Springer book on Multiscale Modeling in Biomechanics and Mechanobiology jointly with Dr. Suvranu De and Wonmuk Hwang in 2015.</p> <p>Taken together, this project has generated a close collaboration, strong synergies, and a sustainable research program between scientists in engineering, physics, stem cell biology, medicine, and cardiac surgery. Our group will continue to collaborate through various different platforms, including the Living Heart Project, which was build around several modules of algorithmic infrastructure developed by our group.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/08/2016<br>      Modified by: Ellen&nbsp;Kuhl</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1233054/1233054_10201033_1473390655310_fig01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1233054/1233054_10201033_1473390655310_fig01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The Living Heart model."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1233054/1233054_10201033_1473390655310_fig01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The Living Heart model."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Anatomic model created from magnetic resonance images.
