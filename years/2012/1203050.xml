<AbstractNarration>An award is made to use computing technology developed in connection with previous NSF support to collaboratively geospatially reference, a.k.a. georeference, (i.e., determine latitude and longitude coordinates for) the estimated two million ungeoreferenced fish species occurrence records currently in the now greatly enhanced and soon to be expanded Fishnet2 network of fish collection databases (http://www.fishnet2.net/).  The records will be georeferenced using the Community Georeferencing System of the GEOLocate software platform based at Tulane University (http://www.museum.tulane.edu/geolocate/). Each coordinate determination will include a new polygon method for describing uncertainty, which will be compared to the more traditional point-radius-based uncertainties currently in wide use to inform best practices in future georeferencing projects. Experiments in crowd sourcing will also be performed on subset of the georeferenced work at Tulane as an education and outreach activity involving local high school students and Tulane undergraduates. &lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;Georeferencing natural history collection data is a critical step in a process of mobilizing biodiversity data that starts with digitizing collection records, continues through databasing and networking, and ultimately gives researchers remote access to the vast specimen and data resources of natural history museums.  Having access to georeferenced specimen occurrence data allows researchers to address important scientific and societal questions in areas such as endangered species conservation, environmental restoration, and preparing for global climate change. The resource of georeferenced locality records provided by this project will serve several purposes, beyond its usefulness to the fish collection community. It can be used for georeferencing data for other groups of organisms, especially aquatic organisms, which were likely sampled at many of the same access points (e.g., in rivers near bridge crossings) or at the same time as many of the fish specimens. This project will reult in a compiled gazetteer of all georeferenced localities that is available to other collection digitization projects, including projects in the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections (ADBC) program. The resource of georeferenced collection localities created through this project will also serve the fish collection and broader natural history collection community as a resource for cleaning taxonomic data, thanks to the map visualization of data it supports.  Mapping specimen occurrences makes it easier for taxonomic experts to detect errors in specimen identity and distribution, resulting in more accurate taxonomic and geographic data. The education and outreach activities of this project will specifically target underrepresented minorities from New Orleans area schools in an effort to increase minority participation in natural history collection based research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ FishNet2 (www.fishnet2.net) is a global network of fish collection databases that gives researchers access to  data on roughly 4 million fish species lots, representing over 30 million specimens. In 2012 a collaboration involving investigators and staff associated with fish collections at 12 institutions - Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, California Academy of Sciences, Cornell University, Field Museum, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, Tulane University, University of Florida, Illinois Natural History Survey (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), University of Kansas, University of Michigan, University of New Mexico, University of Texas at Austin - was funded to improve the state of geospatial referencing of data within the network.  The specific goals of the project were to georeference (determine latitude and longitude coordinates for) all sampling locality descriptions lacking these data and repatriate the results back to the institutions that provided the data.  Before the project began, only about two-thirds of the records in Fishnet2 were georeferenced.  Investigators at Tulane University began work on the project by harvesting all records within Fishnet2 lacking geographic coordinates and building 12 geographically delimited datasets (regions of the world pre-assigned to each of the collaborating institutions for georeferencing).  Records in need of georeferencing came from 58 Fishnet2 provider institutions, including fish collections at the 12 collaborating institutions. The Collaborative Georeferencing Client (CoGe) of the GEOLocate Platform was used to evaluate the roughly 250,000 localities in FishNet2 lacking coordinates. Each of the twelve collaborating institutions hired a full-time georeferencing technician who, after a brief training period, worked 18 months verifying or correcting the CoGe generated geographic coordinates for localities assigned to his or her institution.  At the completion of the georeferencing phase of the project, 282,221 localities (equivalent to 1.4 million specimen lots) were evaluated and 247,501, localities (equivalent to 1.2 million specimen lots) were assigned coordinates and estimates of uncertainty. We are now in the data repatriation phase of the project, wherein the map coordinates generated in the project are being written to the 58 provider databases.  At the conclusion of the project, it will be possible to map 1.2 million additional specimen occurrences (1/3 of the data in Fishnet2) with a fairly high degree of accuracy.  We also conducted experiments of how well unpaid and minimally trained student volunteers were able to georeference localities compared to experienced project technicians.  The results of the volunteer experiments suggest that minimally trained volunteers are able to georeference specimen localities, within acceptable error distances of results of experienced technicians, high percentages of the time.  The volunteer experiments are especially encouraging considering the very high volume of specimen collection localities in need of georeferencing in U.S. natural history collections.
