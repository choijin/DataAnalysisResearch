<AbstractNarration>This action funds Anne Cathleen Kwiatt of the University of Texas at San Antonio to conduct a research project, entitled "Analyzing garbage raiding patterns and diet of urban monkeys in Singapore," during the summer of 2012 at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, Singapore. The host scientist is Michael D. Gumert, Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to examine human impact on nonhuman primate behavior and ecology; particularly examining how urban environments impact male and female monkey dietary and behavioral strategies differently. The research examines the degree to which variation in diet, social behaviors, and activity budgets of long-tailed macaque monkeys is affected by urban modified-human environments and explores the ecological constraints placed on these behaviors using both behavioral data collection and stable isotope analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Results of the research are expected to contribute to primate conservation and management plans. By better understanding dietary variation and the ecological conditions that may promote flexible behavior such as raiding, more effective management plans may be created for urban human-sympatric monkeys in Singapore, as well as throughout Southeast Asia. Additionally, results can contribute to modern conservation and evolutionarily sustainable approaches that increasingly look not only at species on the edge of extinction, but at species succeeding on the edge of human societies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Human-driven environmental change, particularly since the introduction of agriculture, has had a profound impact on human and nonhuman primate ecology and evolution. As anthropogenic forest disturbance creates more forest edge and urban areas directly abut nature reserves, primates are being forced into closer contact with human populations, especially in urban environments, which provide alternative food sources in the form of provisioning and discarded foods in rubbish bins and dumpsters. Urban-dwelling monkeys are often drawn to these  sources, which may lead to lower dependency on natural foods as well as alter behavioral patterns and social group structure.  The long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) is considered one of the most widespread nonhuman primate species in the world and is notable for its resilience as well as its ability to thrive around humans, including in urban environments.  As more forests are converted for urban use,  this ecological change may have a profound effect on monkey behavior and ecology as well as  have the potential to inform theory on the evolution of human adaptability. Furthermore, because of similarities in habitat choices, social adaptability, and flexible diets, long-tailed macaques have recently been promoted as a model for reconstructing the behavior and evolution of early human ancesotros and understanding the way they are able to adapt and change to different environments may inform us of our own evolutionary history as a species.  My research examined human impact on nonhuman primate  behavior and ecology of long-tailed macaques that occupy and use both forest and urban environments and resources in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Singapore. In particular I examined the behavior, ranging patterns, and diet of a single social group of monkeys to assess the contribution of human derived food sources, mainly raided from dumpsters or stolen from humans at the site, to their diet, as well as the potential impact on group structure using behavioral observations as well as fecal sampling for future stable isotope analysis.    Behavioral and ecological flexibility is a cornerstone to understanding primate evolution, yet we have a limited understanding of the evolutionary and ecological conditions that promote selection for flexibility.  All over the world, urban populations of animals live in close proximity with humans that occupy their same environment, sharing not just space but also food and water resources..  By examining urban populations of monkeys that are able to use a variety of environments and food resources, we may be able to transform our understanding of the behavioral flexibility of long-tailed macaques, and ultimately, humans.  Additionally, this research contributes to modern conservation and evolutionarily sustainable approaches that increasingly look not only at species on the edge of extinction but at species succeeding on the edge of human societies.   As a broader impact, this research fulfills the National Science FoundationÆs goal of inclusion of underrepresented groups in scientific research at a number of levels. The project increased the participation of women in the fields of science and anthropology as well as increased the research presence of a minority-serving institution, the University of Texas at San Antonio. This research also established and increased research connections between the University of Texas at San Antonio, the United States, and the country of Singapore, as well as provided ground work for to establish field research opportunities for both US and Singaporean undergraduate students.  This research will also have the broader impact of contributing to long-tailed macaque conservation and management plans.  By better understanding age/sex class differences and the ecological conditions that may promote flexible behavior such as raiding, more effective management plans may be created for urban monkeys in Singapore, as well as throughout Southe...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
