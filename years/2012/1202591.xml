<AbstractNarration>Objective: This project is an integrated approach for design and development of plasmonically-enhanced photodetectors (PEPDs). A unique 3D plasmonic grating self-aligned to a patterned III-V nanopillar array enables enhanced efficiency along with speed appropriate for high-bandwidth transceiver integration on a Si CMOS platform.  Expected device performance includes quantum efficiencies &gt; 70 % and modulation rates &gt; 50 GHz.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The innovative component is the unique three-dimensional geometry enabled by the vertical nanopillar-based format to circumvent two major limitations of planar plasmonics and nanostructures. This plasmonic grating provides significantly increased optical coupling efficiency resulting from tightly-confined photonic hot-spots compared to the conventional planar configuration.  In addition, these hot spots can be physically placed to overlap the carrier absorbing region rather than the lossy metal grating.  A holistic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research project offers substantial opportunities for student participation at all levels including high-school, undergraduate and graduate/postdoctoral education and research experience.  The project is linked to K-12 projects such as Technology Road Show which takes nano- and clean-energy experiments developed by graduate students into local high school science classes.  A related program brings high school teachers on UCLA campus monthly to develop nano-related course work. Under represented minority students participate in these UCLA laboratories through targeted campus support of undergraduate and graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>
