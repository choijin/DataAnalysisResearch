<AbstractNarration>This proposal includes two, back-to-back workshops.  The first will focus on the history of work on the science of learning over the last ten years, including but not limited to work conducted within the six Science of Learning Centers.  The second will focus on how work on the science of learning might best be conducted over the next ten years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first workshop, The Science of Learning: History, will review what has been achieved scientifically and in terms of infrastructure and facilities, and what has not been achieved within the science of learning, dealing with strengths and weaknesses.  The second workshop, The Science of Learning: Prospects, will attend to where the opportunities are for the future, where the threats lie, and how the science should best be conducted and nourished in terms of the research opportunities and the organizational structures to support the research (centers, awards to individual investigators, synthesis centers, post-doc fellowships, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to explore general strategies for the future of the science of learning, and to connect the knowledge to societal challenges, including educational, technological and workforce challenges.  Discussions from the workshops will help to formulate attainable objectives and methods of assessment.  Reports will be written of both workshops, to be made available to science of learning research communities and funding communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the grant was to run two workshops, one surveying developments in the wide-ranging, interdisciplinary science of learning over the last decade or so, the other considering prospects for the next decade, where productive investments might be made.  The Steering Committee was constituted as a Subcommittee of SBE/AC and the reports were to be written for the SBE Advisory Committee, making recommendations to NSF.  The first of these workshops was held on 4-5 October 2012.  It was found that much interesting work had been done both by the six NSF-funded Science of Learning centers and at other institutions and it was recommended that NSF continue to invest in the science of learning.  The report is attached below, SciOfLearningWorkshopReport.pdf, and the rich appendices likewise, SciOfLearningWorkshopAppendices.pdf.   The second workshop was held on 28 February- 1 March 2013 and the report is attached, SLWorkshopReport2Prospects.pdf.  The report concluded:  There have been considerable advances in the science of learning, many facilitated by work at the SLCÃ†s. We recommend that NSF continue to support work in the science of learning at least at the level of recent years, and indeed at higher levels when possible. However, the time is ripe now for different forms of support than in the previous program, elevating support to a broad and widely distributed national level, thus providing funding for many researchers at many research institutions.  This funding should emphasize the interdisciplinarity that has characterized work on the science of learning, encouraging crossing boundaries of geography, technologies, and disciplines, and coordinated with funding provided by other NSF directorates and programs, other governmental agencies, foundations, public-private partnerships, and agencies in other countries. Among other things, NSF should encourage the building of national infrastructure and look for opportunities for translation to other areas of societal importance: health, national security, equity, justice, and more.  This makes good sense, we believe, particularly at a time when support for work in cognitive and neuroscience is being enhanced at NSF, because we stand to learn about aspects of cognition and their neurological basis through a better understanding of how they develop and change under external influence through learning.  We also recommend that funding for the new science of learning program/division begin in 2014, so that new work can begin immediately as the funding for the first cohort of SLCs is terminated.
