<AbstractNarration>The goals of the MagIC (Magnetics Information Consortium) project have been to develop an open community digital data archive for rock and paleomagnetic data with web portals that allow users free access to archive, search and download data in a broad range of formats.  Part of the project has involved the transition of existing databases developed under the auspices of the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) to the new archive.  This award provides funds for the continued development and maintenance of the MagIC facility and for continued integration of the PI?s efforts to operate with other online databases.  The PIs believe that access to all magnetic data in a single online data-base and the capacity to link up with data from other disciplines, will radically change the way rock and paleomagnetic data contribute to Earth sciences today.  In this funding period the PIs will implement enhanced interoperability with GPlates and IODP and also with initiatives like EarthChem and Geochron, to provide seamless access to complementary geochemistry information and radiometric ages on the sample data stored in MagIC.  All this will be accomplished through the use of unique IGSN sample numbers.</AbstractNarration>
