<AbstractNarration>Steering Committee: James Elser, Rimjhim Aggarwal, and Helen Rowe at Arizona State University;&lt;br/&gt;Tauhidur Rahman, University of Arizona; David Vaccari, Stephens Institute of Technology; Anita&lt;br/&gt;Street, US Department of Energy; Robert Mikkelsen, International Plant Nutrition Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Phosphorus (P) is an essential element to life and, with few exceptions, a necessary&lt;br/&gt;fertilizer for high agricultural yield. Because P cannot be manufactured and global supply is limited,&lt;br/&gt;this chemical element poses a unique, double-sided threat to sustainability. P scarcity leads to&lt;br/&gt;high prices and poverty for poor farmers in developing countries, but in industrialized nations, excess&lt;br/&gt;P from farms and in urban waste streams degrades downstream water quality. The issues surrounding&lt;br/&gt;P sustainability are deeply complex and involve diverse geological, biogeochemical, economic, and&lt;br/&gt;geopolitical dimensions that are currently unconsolidated. Environmental degradation due to nutrient&lt;br/&gt;runoff and potential threats to global food security urgently call for an end to this disjointed approach&lt;br/&gt;to phosphorus. The goal of the P Sustainability Research Coordination Network (RCN) is to spark an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary synthesis of data, perspectives, and understanding about phosphorus to identify and&lt;br/&gt;implement solutions for P sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RCN theme, objectives, and initial topics build upon broad agreement on key P sustainability&lt;br/&gt;challenges reached at a recent Sustainable P Summit (SPS) led by  James Elser and colleague Dan Childers.&lt;br/&gt;The RCN will involve two phases centered on three Challenge Areas. Phase I groups will work&lt;br/&gt;on two Challenges: (1) Improving P efficiency in food production; (2) Developing robust pathways&lt;br/&gt;of P recycling. At the Kick-off Workshop, identified Core Members will develop Working Groups&lt;br/&gt;centered around these challenge areas. These Groups will be further populated with At-Large Members&lt;br/&gt;recruited through a widely advertised application process that will allow us to target qualified&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, postdocs, and members of under-represented groups. In Year 3, a Synthesis Workshop&lt;br/&gt;will report on the science and solution outcomes from Phase I and develop new Phase II Working&lt;br/&gt;Groups focused on Challenge 3: Integrating efficiency and recycling to create a sustainable food system.&lt;br/&gt;A Wrap-up Workshop, held early in Year 5, will be held to report on science and solution outcomes&lt;br/&gt;from Phase II and provide the push to finalize outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Central to the P Sustainability RCN will be recruitment of a diverse network of&lt;br/&gt;participants of different professions, ranks, genders, races, ethnicities, and nationalities. The Steering&lt;br/&gt;Committee will reflect this diversity, including three students in ex officio capacity, giving them invaluable&lt;br/&gt;experience in leadership, networking, collaborative science, and policy. To communicate key&lt;br/&gt;aspects of RCN work, we will produce two dynamic, high-quality videos to reach targeted audiences of&lt;br/&gt;farmers, educators, fertilizer industry, and policy makers. The three RCN Workshops will be held in&lt;br/&gt;Washington DC in order to facilitate participation by policy makers, government officials, representatives&lt;br/&gt;of agriculture and the fertilizer industry, and urban planners with the aim of developing research priorities&lt;br/&gt;for the RCN, presenting outcomes and planning implementation of sustainability solutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Phosphorus (P) is a chemical element and is essential to all forms of life.  Supplies of this element are frequently limiting to growth of organisms, including crops.  As a result, humanity has mobilized large amounts of P to produce chemical fertilizers that contribute much to global agricultural productivity.  Unfortunately, much P from the food system enters aquatic ecosystems (lakes, rivers, coastal oceans) from sources such as farms, livestock rearing facilities, and dairies as well as from human waste. Furthermore, prices of phosphate rock for fertilizer production have fluctuated markedly in recent years and reserves of rock are finite and held in just a few countries, raising concerns about their long-term availability and affordability.  In light of these complex sustainability challenges, the goals of the P Sustainability Research Coordination Network (RCN) were to:  Coordinate      and integrate disconnected geological, agronomic, biogeochemical,      economic, and &#8232;sociological data and perspectives related to P      sustainability;  Design      and assess institutional, commercial, technological, and psychological      solutions in &#8232;conservation, recycling, and equitable distribution      to establish P sustainability;  Engage      policy makers throughout the process to bridge the gap between      understanding and enacting solutions.   The RCN ran for six years (2013-2018) and brought together scientists, engineers, policy makers, and leaders from the private sector to discuss these issues, identify knowledge gaps and priority research areas, and to produce a set of publications aimed at those topics.  The primary physical activity involved an annual meeting (held either in Washington DC or in Arizona at Arizona State University), although participants interacted intensively over the Internet as they completed projects.  A key component of the DC meetings was involvement of representatives from key stakeholder groups, including agricultural growers, livestock producers, mining companies, water companies, and various government agencies and NGOs.  Over the course of the RCN, at least 174 individuals from at least 11 countries participated in these working groups. This included ten graduate students and six postdoctoral scholars who experienced unique training and networking opportunities during their participation. The group was highly productive, publishing a total of 50 peer-reviewed research articles, 12 book chapters, and 10 white papers while presenting at least 113 talks on RCN results.  RCN participants collaborated to write 19 funded research proposals.  Finally, a tangible lasting outcome of the RCN was the establishment of the Sustainable Phosphorus Alliance, (SPA) a member organization that convenes and engages companies and organizations involved in the food and water sectors that are advancing P sustainability solutions in North America.  SPA currently has 10 active members, including the world?s largest phosphate rock mining company (OCP), one of North America?s first commercially viable producers of recycled fertilizers (Ostara), and a key water quality NGO (The Water Research Foundation).
