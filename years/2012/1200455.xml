<AbstractNarration>Nonlinear dispersive wave equations,in particular the nonlinear Schrodinger, nonlinear Klein-Gordon, and Korteweg-de Vries equations, can exhibit coherent and stable solutions called solitons, as well as solutions that experience blow-up in finite time. The principal investigator will prove rigorous results that give quantitative descriptions of solutions to these equations in a number of scientifically relevant contexts. Among these are results describing the effect of a small random external field on the dynamics of solitons or blow-up solutions, the effect of interaction forces between multiple solitons on their dynamics, the stabilizing influence of a rapidly oscillating nonlinear coefficient on a soliton, and the extent to which a strong confining external field can reduce the effective dimension of the dynamics. The principal investigator has previously developed new techniques based on symplectic projection, and its relation to the Hamiltonian structure of these equations, to study related problems. He will continue to refine and extend his methods to address these more sophisticated problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The equations studied in this project arise as important physical models. Solitons appear as well-localized stable structures, while blow-up is associated with a sharp focusing of a wave and ultimate break-down of the physical model. For example, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation is the wave function for a collection of ultracold atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Since its Nobel-prize-winning realization in the laboratory in 1995, further experiments have produced solitons and finite-time blow-up, and there is now a large body of physics literature motivating many of the problems this project will consider. This work brings together pure mathematics, numerical analysis, and physics. The principal investigator collaborates with faculty at several institutions in the U.S. and overseas and supervises several graduate students on work related to the project. Certain aspects of the project can be adapted to be accessible to undergraduates, especially those components involving computer simulation and the production of web demonstrations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The PI produced five publications with Xuwen Chen, who at the time, held a Tamarkin postdoctoral position at Brown, on the topic of the mean-field limit of a quantum many-body system in the Gross Pitaevskii regime, giving a rigorous proof of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation.  A system of N bosons with pairwise interaction is described by a symmetric N-particle linear Schroedinger equation.  Under a certain assumption on the scaling for N large (the Gross-Pitaevskii regime), we show that the one-particle marginal state is described by the nonlinear Schroedinger equation, as N is pushed to infinity.  In comparison to other works on the topic, the focus of our research is on (1) dimensional reduction and (2) the treatment of attractive interactions.  Dimensional reduction refers to the assumption that a strong confining potential is imposed in one or two directions, with increasing strength for N large, so that, in the N to infinity limit, those directions are removed and the limiting system is effectively lower dimensional.  Attractive interactions lead to the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, but have special mathematical difficulties stemming from a failure of postive definiteness in the energy estimates.  Nevertheless, attractive pairwise particle interactions do arise in Bose-Einstein condensation experiments and our work supports these experimental findings.    Broader Impacts:   The grant provided PhD thesis topics for three graduate students (Younghun Hong, Chang Liu, Numann Malik), RA funds for these students to complete their work, and funds to travel to conferences.  The PI taught a topics course in Fall 2015 on Dynamics of Solitary Waves, which provided an introduction to this research area to the Brown graduate students plus two visitors.  The PI has previously, and will continue, to broadly disseminate his results in major venues.  For example, he spoke at the NSF/CBMS Regional Conference at Kansas State University (2013), the C.E. Kenig 60th birthday conference at U. Chicago (2014) and at IAPCM in Beijing (2014) with an invitation from Changxing Miao.   He gave a six-hour minicourse on singularity formation for the nonlinear Schroedinger equation at IMPA, Brazil (2013) and a three-hour mini course at the "DC summer school in PDE", George Washington University.  The PI was Graduate Director 2012--2016, and in this position, oversaw 45 graduate students in the Mathematics Department at Brown, and was broadly committed to improving the operations and quality of program.
