<AbstractNarration>This research seeks to identify atmospheric structures and physical features for which uncertainties associated with initial and bottom boundary conditions are likely to limit the 0-24 h forecast predictability of convective weather phenomena over and east of the Rockies during the Mesoscale Predictability Experiment (MPEX) to be held in late spring and early summer 2013. MPEX will incorporate special datasets into high-resolution convection-allowing mesoscale models to test ways to reduce convective storm forecast uncertainty in the 0-24 h range. Specific atmospheric structures and physical features to be targeted include: 1) upper-tropospheric subsynoptic/mesoscale disturbances, 2) upper- and lower-level jets, 3) three-dimensional moisture plumes, 4) boundary layer moisture tongues, 5) lower and middle troposphere shear profiles, 6) atmospheric stability as manifest by the steepness of midlevel lapse rates, 7) low-level thermal and moisture boundaries, and low-level relative vorticity strips, and 8) soil moisture content and land use characteristics. The PI will be active in the forecasting component of MPEX will seek to identify potential atmospheric structures and physical features that can be targeted for extra dropsonde observations and Microwave Temperature Profiling data coverage needed for atmospheric predictability studies. A primary research focus will be the preparation of synoptic and mesoscale analyses of a variety of selected convective weather systems during MPEX to help assess the feedbacks between deep convective storms and their environment, given that the bulk upscale effects of organized deep convection are known to modify the downstream upper-level flow (e.g., jet/ridge structures). These physically based storm analyses will be used to help assess model predictability in collaboration with other MPEX principal investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance our understanding of the dynamical and thermodynamical processes that conspire to limit the atmospheric predictability a subset of convective weather phenomena that occur over complex terrain and are inherently difficult to predict. The results from this project should help to establish bounds on error growth rates for convective weather phenomena. The project will also provide an opportunity for collaborate research efforts between observationalists and modelers to assess to what extent subjectively derived feature-based uncertainty estimates can be employed in atmospheric predictability studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The results from this study will have applications to the forecast community and the general public.  Significant gaps in our core knowledge exist about how convective weather systems develop, organize, mature, and dissipate over complex terrain of the Rockies and the High Plains. Enhanced datasets obtained during the field phase of this study should allow researchers to gain a greater scientific understanding of convective storm phenomena. The results from this study will be disseminated widely to the research and operational communities. Graduate students will be trained in mesoscale analyses, convective storm dynamics, and atmospheric predictability studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported research on how convective storms originate over and east of the Rocky Mountains.  These convective storms, once formed, can often intensify, grow upscale (get bigger), and move eastward onto the High Plains where they often become associated with severe weather.   In this project, we focused on a particular type of severe convective storm called a progressive derecho.  Progressive derechos typically occur during the warm season (May&ndash;August).  Progressive derechos are characterized by the sudden onset of a damaging "wall-of-wind" in which peak wind speeds can reach 60&ndash;80 mph (with some gusts to 100 mph).  Large hail and a few tornadoes may accompany progressive derechos.  Progressive derechos are noteworthy for lasting up to 12 hours and for producing a damaging swath of wind over a distance of approximately 1000 kilometers (a little more than 600 miles). They are notoriously challenging to predict.   We constructed the first operational radar-based progressive derecho climatology from 258 events identified over an 18-year period.  We found a corridor of maximum progressive derecho activity that stretched from southern Minnesota to Ohio-West Virginia with a maximum centered in northern Illinois near Chicago.  We also found a link between progressive derecho formation and low-level easterly upslope flow to the north of a lee cyclone located to the east of the Rockies.  We also constructed composite analyses of progressive derechos and found that they form in moisture-rich environments beneath an upper-level jet stream.  We also conducted case studies of the intense derecho of 12&ndash;13 June 2012 that crossed the Appalachians and produced widespread damage in the Washington, DC, area and another derecho on 29&ndash;30 June 2013 that failed to cross the Appalachians.  Most derechos fail to cross the Appalachians.  We found that a distinguishing feature of Appalachian-crossing derechos may be the strength of the surface cold pool (a measure of how much the surface pressure rises in response to strong cooling due to rain-chilled air).   We also investigated other types of severe convective storms that can form over the High Plains in response to upper-level disturbances that cross the Rocky Mountains.  We focused on combined severe weather and flash flood-producing convective storms east of the Rockies.  These storms maximized over the central U.S. and were least common over the Southeast, High Plains, and Northern Plains.  Results from composite analyses indicated that relatively high levels of atmospheric instability, vertical wind shear, and moisture levels characterized these events.  Storm risk was highest when winds in the lower troposphere were aligned with quasi-stationary frontal boundaries, a situating favorable for training radar echoes.
