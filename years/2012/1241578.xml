<AbstractNarration>To increase the number of faculty teaching cybersecurity content, the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas Tech University in partnership with the Center of Security Studies and Criminal Justice at Angelo State University are offering a professional development program in cybersecurity to community college faculty scholars across West Texas. Thirty faculty scholars from  community and private colleges across West Texas are participating in a cyber-security education workshop and are mentored in the establishment of cybersecurity associate degrees and certification programs in their home institutions.  The project provides a holistic approach to cybersecurity education by integrating the science and engineering aspects of cybersecurity issues with the management, ethical, and practical aspects as they relate to national defense and homeland security. It also introduces recent advances in cybersecurity research to improve cyber security education and explores various technical research and educational challenges. The project is increasing the number of educators knowledgeable in cybersecurity, resulting in a multiplying effect to students including minority groups that contribute to the workforce in the region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Building Cybersecurity Education: What Works  James Phelps, Ph.D. (P.I.)  Angelo State University, ASU: Center for Security Studies  Department of Security Studies and Criminal Justice  In conjunction with: Texas Tech University, Department of Computer Science  NSF Grant: 1241756, SFS: Capacity Building: Collaborative Project: Cyber-Security Education for Community College Faculty in Texas  The Principle Investigators and Co-PIs wish to thank the National Science Foundation and the people of the United States of America for their generous support of this research.  Summary: 2012-2014  Funding associated with the grant spanned a two year period, ending in August 2014.  During this period three workshops were held during summer months teaching cybersecurity principles to community college faculty, &amp; developing assistance and ongoing mentoring programs for those faculty.  It should be noted those who attended the second summer session at Texas Tech University are still being mentored as this year progresses.  August 2013 Workshop consisted of 16 participants representing 11 institutions.  The participant demographics indicate we reached 9 men, 7 women, with specific ethnicity broken down into 4 African Americans (all female), 1 African (female), 3 Hispanic/Latino (1 female), and 8 White/Non-Hispanic (2 female).  July 2014 Workshop consisted of 16 participants representing 14 institutions.  The participant demographics indicate we reached 9 men, 7 women, with specific ethnicity broken down into 2 African Americans (1 female), 1 Asian (female), 2 Indian (sub-continent) (1 female), 1 Hispanic/Latino, and 10 White/Non-Hispanic (4 female).  August 2014 Workshop was a request weeklong presentation at Amarillo College.  Attendees included faculty, staff, administrators, students, and local law enforcement.  These workshop attendees included 29 attendees (4 female), 6 Latino, and 1 Native American (female).  These workshops built cyber security education capacity by reaching out to two and four year higher education institutions across western Texas.  The 20 schools reached with the program include:  Abilene Christian University  Alamo College  Amarillo College  Angelo State University (two faculty from the Computer Science department)  Austin Community College  El Paso Community College  Hardin-Simmons College  Houston Community College  Lone Star College  Lubbock Christian University  Lubbock Institute of Technology  Luna Community College  McMurry University  Ranger College  South Plains College  Southwest Texas Junior College  Texas A&amp;M - Central Texas  Texas State Technical College  Texas Southern University  Vernon College  2013 Workshop Subjects  Cybersecurity Fundamentals  Information and Data Security  Network Security  Software Security  Smart Grid Security  Cyber Evidence and Forensics  Software Security Education  After a year of mentoring, assessment and evaluation we made some revisions to the 2014 schedule.  The changed topics for 2014 included: Increased TTU Graduate Student participation in 2014 through direct research presentations and offered "hands on" components.  2014 Workshop Subjects  Network Security  Web Security  Secure and Resilient Software Development  Smart Grid Security  Cyber evidence and forensics  Fundamentals of cybersecurity  Capacity Building  Texas Southern University: Planning on offering Cyber Security and administration of justice as new programs and incorporated information from the workshop by implementing security awareness in their software development degree. They have created a new course ITSY-1300 Fundamentals of Information Security.  Texas State Technical College implemented more security awareness in their software development degree and their security degree is offering a new class on scripting. They also enhanced current lecture and lab content related to encryption, during Cyber-Security month they conducted digital security demonstrations, and provided handouts related to c...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
