<AbstractNarration>Gravitational waves are a straightforward but profound prediction of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.  They have never been directly measured, but the ripples in space time produced by distant violent astrophysical events will soon be detectable by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), with detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington. LIGO's detectors use precision laser interferometry to measure the relative motion of exquisitely isolated test mass mirrors due to the extremely small fluctuations in the difference of the 4km-arm lengths. Louisiana State University (LSU) is located approximately 40 km from LIGO Livingston (LLO) and  has a long-term collaborative relationship with LIGO as a member of the LIGO Scientific  Collaboration (LSC), an international group of hundreds of scientists researching the technology for gravitational wave detectors and analyzing the data taken with LIGO detectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the LSU group will be used to allow the PI to fulfill her duties as the elected spokesperson of the LSC; to characterize data from the subsystems of Advanced LIGO detectors as they are installed, allowing the improvement of the data quality and astrophysical reach of the detectors; and to research ways to improve the calibration methods used for the Advanced LIGO detectors. In addition to advancing the science reach of Advanced LIGO detectors, the award will develop scientific human resources (graduate students and postdocs). Moreover, the members of the LSU group supported by this award will disseminate the results of their research to the general public and work to increase the participation of under-represented minorities in scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded activities that improved the sensitivity of LIGO gravitational-wave detectors and helped separating gravitational wave signals from false alarms in the data; it also supported the activities of Gabriela Gonzalez, the PI of this award, as the spokesperson of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.  This work (together with that of many others) allowed the first detection of gravitational waves from the merger of black holes that happened a billion years ago, with the wave traveling through Earth leaving a clear signal in the detectors on September 14, 2015. The presentation of this detection in a press conference on February 11, 2016, with the participation of the PI representing the LIGO Collaboration, had a very large and broad impact in the general public and generated great interest in learning about astrophysics and detection instruments.  More signals from merging black holes were found on December 26 2015, and January 4, June 8, and August 14 2017, the last one jointly with the Virgo detector in Europe, allowing much better localization due to triangulation.  The award supported the work at LSU of a diverse group of graduate students and postdoctoral scientsts who are all now part of the US STEM workforce, in academia and industry.
