<AbstractNarration>This action funds Benjamin William Krueger of the University of Washington to conduct a research project, entitled "Controlling conduction at the interface of transparent thin films," during the summer of 2012 at the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) in Tsukuba, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Toyohiro Chikyow, principal investigator of the Nano-Electronics Materials Unit at NIMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this research project is twofold: first, to understand the role of aluminum and indium dopants on the electrical, structural and optical properties of gallium oxide, a transparent semiconductor that exhibits marked n-type conductivity, in order to create custom-tailored semiconducting thin films with tunable band gap energy and conductivity; and second, to study conduction and electron accumulation at the interface between two dissimilar gallium oxide films as the doping level is varied. This research promises to enable the successful design of transparent high-electron mobility transistors (HEMT), to complement the commercially successful aluminum gallium arsenide HEMTs ubiquitous in modern high-frequency devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of Japan; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Gallium oxide is a transparent semiconductor that holds significant promise for technological application due to its strong n-type conductivity. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a versatile thin film growth technique that allows for precise control of impurities, and is ideally suited to study the role of extrinsic defects on conduction and other physical properties. In addition, the combinatorial growth technique pioneered by Dr. Chikyow at my host institution has proven to be a convenient way to explore physical trends with doping in a single sample. The goal of this project was to use PLD to create combinatorial thin films whose composition varies smoothly from 100% Ga2O3 on one side to 100% Al2O3 on the other, in order to study physical trends in &beta;-Ga2O3 with Al concentration, in particular the crystallinity and increasing size of the band gap. The ability to tune the band gap by alloying with aluminum will open up new avenues for transparent electronics and tunable ultraviolet photodetectors, much as combining AlAs with GaAs has resulted in widespread adoption of GaAs-based electronics and optoelectronics in the infrared.     This summer we developed a recipe for the growth of high-quality Ga2O3 thin films using PLD, and have successfully grown combinatorial (GaxAl1-x)2O3 thin films on two different substrates and characterized their crystal properties as a function of Al concentration, in particular showing that the lattice constant does not change significantly when alloying with aluminum, which may make it possible to create epitaxial Ga2O3-(GaxAl1-x)2O3 heterojunctions with minimal lattice strain. We also have preliminary data showing a widening band gap, as we expect. Work on this project continues both at NIMS and the University of Washington, Seattle.
