<AbstractNarration>This proposal's goal is to save West Virginia's primary natural history collection which includes over 21,000 mammals, amphibians, and reptiles amassed over 70 years. Almost every species that has been described in West Virginia is included, even federally endangered species. This collection is larger than in any other museum nationally and as so is a unique resource and should be developed for training the next generation of biologists who can then study, maintain, and protect Appalachia's animals. However, it is in urgent need of new equipment and curation to ensure its survival. Additionally, once the database is developed it will be possible to make this collection nationally/globally accessible via the Web.&lt;br/&gt; Marshall University is a primarily undergraduate teaching institution in southwestern West Virginia. This collection has tremendous impact on its students and the local Appalachian community. It is used to train students in biology courses and students actively use the collections for research, presentations, and publications. The collections are also used for K-12 outreach focusing on local diversity and conservation ecology. Education outreach and early exposure to science is crucial for the development of a scientifically literate population in West Virginia, an educationally and socioeconomically challenged state.</AbstractNarration>

We have replaced the old metal shelving system by modernizing it with a mobile shelf system that increases the collectionÃ†s available space and optimizes specimen accessibility.  We have also installed new cabinetry fixtures that meet natural history collection guidelines for safe storage of specimens.

This allows for more efficient use of the museum for both curation procedures and the study of each specimen. Also new paint and flooring were added to the room.  The WVBSM now has a digital presence, with the creation of a website that includes basic information on all the Mammals of West Virginia, Fun Facts, and color photographs.  The website introduces the WVBSM to the community and the world, and provides a unique opportunity for anyone to find out more about the mammals in the collection.
