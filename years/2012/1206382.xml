<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research Digitization TCN: Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN): A Model for Collections Digitization to Promote Taxonomic and Ecological Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN) brings together 10 diverse arthropod collections at universities and museums throughout the Southwest to create a virtual network of ground dwelling arthropods which are notably responsive to temporal and spatial environmental changes. These 10 collections document much of the Southwest's biodiversity, but currently the data associated with millions of arthropod specimens are not easily accessible. To overcome this, SCAN will develop methods for integrating existing databases, catalogue-image specimens, develop new electronic identification techniques, and produce a virtual library of ground-dwelling arthropods (beetles, grasshoppers, spiders, ants). In addition the project will work with the existing project Filtered Push to increase the capacity of experts to provide remote identifications and annotations of data that can be sent throughout the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comprehensive SCAN online library and expert information will be available to the public as well as professionals in taxonomy, ecology, and climate change science. Smaller institutions will be provided increased access to large data sets for promoting research. The SCAN datasets will support a number of ongoing projects examining the effects of environmental and land-use change on individual arthropod species. By increasing access to this information, SCAN will stimulate new research and increased awareness in biodiversity conservation throughout the region. Over 50 undergraduates also will be trained in cyberinfrastructure, systematics, and ecology. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource, iDigBio.org.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN) project brings together arthropod collections at universities and museums from the Southwest and beyond to create a virtual information network of arthropod occurrences. During this 3 year project, the University of Arizona Insect Collection aimed to digitize 87,075 specimens of ground dwelling arthropods.&nbsp;Undergraduate students assigned unique specimen numbers and captured specimen-level data from 96,000 specimens of ground-dwelling arthropods and added these records to the SCAN database. These specimens represented over 3500 species mostly from Coleoptera (Carabidae, Scarabaeidae, Tenebrionidae, Curculionidae, Oedemeridae, and Nitidullidae), Hymenoptera (Formicidae), and Blattodea (Rhinotermitidae). We digitized approximately 9000 more insect specimens than we proposed. Data from all 96,000 + insect specimens and photos of the specimens and the labels are all available to other researchers and to the public through the SCAN data data. As a result of this project the UA Insect Collection now has 4 digitization stations, equipped with a computer, camera, led lighting, and a standardized digitization tray with built-in scale bar. Even though this grant is now over, our volunteers continue to digitize UAIC specimens.&nbsp; More information on this project is available in the UA Insect Collection website.&nbsp; It is also featured every year at the UA Insect Collection booth at the Arizona Insect Festival which reaches 5000-6000 visitors annually. Our efforts on this project will be continually featured in talks and informational posters to the community and to researchers, including at the Entomological Collections Network annual meetings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/06/2017<br>      Modified by: Wendy&nbsp;Moore Brusca</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
