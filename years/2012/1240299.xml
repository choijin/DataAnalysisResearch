<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant brings together an interdisciplinary group of engineering and education researchers to conduct mixed-method study of how formal and informal interactions with engineering faculty and professionals influence the attitudes and intentions of under-represented students.  The study will utilize a social capital theoretical framework to explore decision points in students' progression through an engineering degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises from the focus on students traditionally under-represented in engineering as well as the ability of the project to inform how mentoring and advising can be structured to improve retention or other outcomes in engineering degree programs.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most significant challenges facing engineering education in the United States is the persistent problem of inclusion and retention of certain racial and ethnic groups. Our project employed a case study approach, using traditional and critical theoretical frameworks on persistence in college, to study how formal and informal interactions with engineering agents (professionals and faculty) influence attitudes and intentions of underrepresented minority (URM) engineering students for enrollment and persistence in engineering in two key phases &ndash; initial enrollment and persistence to advanced program stages. We collected quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus group) data at a Predominantly White Institution in the Southeastern US, and our focus was specifically on African American and Latina/o engineering students due to the demographic makeup of the engineering college at the site. The project includes four studies, whose outcomes illustrate different facets of URM engineering persistence at entry and later stages.  1. Differences in pre-college interactions, early expectations, and perceived barriers for engineering students from underrepresented groups  In this exploratory quantitative study, we looked at data from the new entrants? questionnaire to investigate how engineering-related interactions prior to college, perceived barriers during engineering studies, and early expectations of interactions with faculty may differ among engineering students related to membership in an underrepresented group. By conducting pairwise comparisons based on gender, parental education, and race/ethnicity, membership in an underrepresented group was associated with significantly greater perceived likelihood of financial barriers (women, first-generation), lack of support from family (first-generation, students of color) and negative attitudes from faculty (first-generation).  2. Engineering-related interactions, perceived barriers, and early expectations of African American and Latina/o new entrants to engineering  In this qualitative case study of African American and Latina/o students entering into engineering, we explored the question: What are the engineering-related interactions prior to college, perceived barriers during engineering studies, and early expectations of interactions with faculty for first year African American and Latina/o engineering students?  Analysis of these data revealed three important themes: pre-college interactions with educators (particularly calculus teachers); limited early interactions with engineering faculty; factors that affect student-faculty interaction and faculty perceptions of students; desire and expectations for faculty to provide links to opportunities; and unique factors and barriers related to the nature and culture of engineering.  3. Forms of capital and self-efficacy for African American and Latina/o persisters  In this exploratory quantitative study of African American and Latina/o persisters (junior and senior) in engineering, we focused on understanding the relationship between perceived relations with faculty and other forms of capital to engineering self-efficacy. Descriptive quantitative data indicate that persisters view their relationships with engineering faculty as positive and supportive, and they employ several types of capital, particularly aspirational capital (ability to maintain hopes and dreams for the future) and linguistic capital (having the ability to switch communication styles or language).  All sources of capital (relationships with faculty and the six CCW forms) were positively related to engineering self-efficacy, with most correlations being statistically significant. Notably strong correlations were found between engineering self-efficacy and four forms of capital: aspirational, familial, social capital-peers, and social capital-faculty.  4. How African American and Latina/o students draw on forms of capital to successfully persist in engineering  The purpose of this case study was to describe how African American and Latina/o engineering persisters use different forms of cultural wealth to achieve their goal of obtaining an engineering degree. Descriptive quantitative data indicate that persisters employ several types of capital, with aspirational, linguistic, familial, and peer social capital being the most prevalent. Focus group discussions revealed how persisters remain focused on their goal to become engineers despite barriers and challenges, use family as a source of support and motivation, and find support from faculty in the competitive culture of engineering.
