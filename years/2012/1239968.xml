<AbstractNarration>The University of Kentucky New Opportunities Yielding Classroom Excellence (UK-NOYCE) Mathematics and Science Fellows Program Phase II is designed to attract thirty (30) additional senior class students and practicing professionals, especially in underrepresented populations (women, minorities, and students with disabilities) in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to become credentialed secondary mathematics and science teachers through a collaborative effort by the College of Education, College of Engineering, and College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Kentucky, and four local school districts--Fayette County Public Schools, Scott County Public Schools, Jessamine County Public Schools, and Woodford County Public Schools.  The project involves Noyce scholars in a Masters of Arts in Education with Initial Certification program, an early classroom experience of 7-weeks duration, and a summer institute.  The latter involves 41 Noyce scholars from the Phase I project, as well as Noyce recipients from three other projects in Kentucky.  A product of this Phase II project will be a training manual for replication of the UK-Noyce program by others.  The Phase II evaluation activities move beyond the required tracking of recipients to include indicators of the effectiveness of the program in attracting STEM majors to teaching, the impact of the program on departments and the institution, and the effectiveness of the NOYCE Scholars as measured by their performance in the classroom and their impact on student learning.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The University of Kentucky New Opportunities Yielding Classroom Excellence (UK-NOYCE) Mathematics and Science Fellows Program Phase II recruited and trained thirty (30) additional senior class students and practicing professionals, especially in underrepresented populations (women, minorities, and students with disabilities) in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to become credentialed secondary mathematics and science teachers through a collaborative effort by the College of Education, College of Engineering, and College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Kentucky, and Fayette County Public Schools, Scott County Public Schools, Jessamine County Public Schools, and Woodford County Public Schools.&nbsp; Of the thirty Phase II Noyce Fellows, 16.7% were students of color and 39.3% were first generation students. The project involved Noyce scholars in a Masters of Arts in Education with Initial Certification program, an early classroom experience of 7-weeks duration, and a summer institute. The latter involves Noyce scholars from the Phase I project, as well as Noyce recipients from three other projects in Kentucky. During their first year of teaching, fellows participated in the state-wide teacher induction program, the Kentucky Teacher Internship Program. During this experience, fellows received the support of a mentor teacher, mentor administrator, and mentor teacher educator.&nbsp;</p> <p>Summer workshops served as a major activity to continue cultivating the community that was built in their programs. Each summer, a STEM workshop was held at a Kentucky State Park where the fellows were immersed in place-based STEM experiences that they could take back to their classrooms and implement. Workshop activities focused on the central theme for that particular location. Lessons and materials were developed with an integrated focus so they could either implement in their mathematics or science class or work with a mathematics or science colleague to do a collaborative lesson at their school. All participants were exposed to a variety of topics and careers relevant to secondary mathematics and science. A heavy focus was placed on using the practices to teach core content - modeling it for them and explicit conversations around what it would look like in their own classrooms.</p> <p>The Phase II evaluation activities move beyond the required tracking of recipients to include indicators of the effectiveness of the program in attracting STEM majors to teaching, the impact of the program on departments and the institution, and the effectiveness of the NOYCE Scholars as measured by their performance in the classroom and their impact on student learning. Through a longitudinal data set which compared Noyce Fellows vs. non-Noyce Teachers from our past 2 Noyce grants, we did not find a statistically significant difference in impact on student achievement in the classroom. We defined student achievement as the scores students received on the end of course assessment for their subject area (i.e., Biology, Algebra 2) as that was the most consistent data we had that captured the most teachers in our data set. While we were a little disappointed the Noyce fellows did not out-perform their fellow classmates, we were encouraged that there was not a negative effect of Noyce fellows on student achievement on the end of course assessments. We realize that using standardized test scores is limiting as not all of our fellows teach in end of course assessment courses and standardized test scores are questionable in determining student achievement.</p> <p>Overall, we are pleased to report that at the end of the project, 63% have completed their teaching obligation and nine more are on track to complete. We are on track for a 93% completion rate; only 2 not completing their obligation. Of the 30 fellows, 76.7% are currently teaching in a high needs school district, 1 is teaching in a private school and 1 is teaching internationally. Of the 30 fellows, 66.7% are still in their original high needs school that they started in. This means, they were not transient, but rather have persisted in their current public, high needs school setting. In comparison to the central Kentucky region, the retention rate of teachers, across all subjects, after their second year of teaching is only 68%.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/24/2019<br>      Modified by: Margaret&nbsp;J&nbsp;Mohr-Schroeder</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1239968/1239968_10200041_1558721644462_IMG_7708--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1239968/1239968_10200041_1558721644462_IMG_7708--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hydroelectric Building"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1239968/1239968_10200041_1558721644462_IMG_7708--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hydroelectric Building"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We studied hydroelectric power and how it works since we were at Lake Cumberland State Park.
