<AbstractNarration>To meet the challenges brought by the increasingly amount of high-throughput data generated in many fields, especially in the area of plant genome research, a one-day session entitled "Interactions Between Omics and Statistics: Analyzing High Dimensional Data" will be held as part of the 8th International Purdue Symposium on Statistics June 20 - 24, 2012. The theme of the overall symposium is "Diversity in the Statistical Sciences for the 21st Century" and the session will be organized as an interactive frontier for prestigious researchers within plant biology and statistics, to bridge the gap between plant biologists and statisticians, and provide new insight into addressing the issues associated with high-dimensional data analysis. The topics of presentations include, but are not limited to, an overall introduction of high dimensional omics data, the special statistical challenges of these data, and the newly developed statistical methods to analyze these high dimensional data. In addition, future directions will be discussed to further improve the analysis of such high dimensional omics data. A companion workshop featured in the symposium entitled "iPlant Data Store and iPlant Discovery Environment" will be organized and presented by the iPlant Collaborative. NSF funds will in part defray the costs of participation of graduate students and postdocs to attend the symposium, session and workshop as part of their training in the highly interdisciplinary field of statistical genomics.</AbstractNarration>
