<AbstractNarration>Quantum optomechanics is rapidly developing into a major area of research, with several groups having now achieved cooling of the center-of-mass motion of micromechanical systems close to the quantum mechanical ground state, where the effects of thermal noise become negligible. Building on these developments, hybrid systems that consist of mechanical systems operating in the quantum regime and are coupled to atoms, molecules, or artificial atoms, are likely to provide an important testing ground to address a broad spectrum of questions ranging from fundamental physics to the development of novel sensors. Within this broad context this project studies theoretically systems at the boundary between atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) science and mesoscopic physics. A central aspect is the transfer of single-mode and multimode quantum states between micromechanical structures and atomic matter-wave fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential to impact a number of areas in fundamental and applied science: They include the quantum control of atomic and mechanical systems, the study of the quantum behavior of objects of increasingly macroscopic size and the quantum/classical interface, fundamental studies of decoherence in macroscopic quantum systems, as well as applications that span a variety of topics in quantum detection and sensing. In the past, many new ideas and concepts have been first discussed and tested in an AMO context before diffusing to a broad range of other fields. This project fits squarely with this description. Because AMO science is in the rather unique and privileged position of being both a fundamental branch of physics, as well as an enabling science, it also provides an outstanding training ground for students, who find themselves naturally exposed a broad range of physics problems and areas. This training may lead students to careers in ultracoldscience, nanoscience, quantum information, quantum control, metrology, and nanoscience, both in academia and in industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The emerging and rapidly growing field of cavity optomechanics is a result of recent developments from two converging directions: the ultra-sensitive micromechanical and nanomechanical detectors that have become available utilizing the advanced materials and processing techniques of the semiconductor industry and nanoscience; and the understanding, gained largely from quantum optics and atomic physics, of the fundamental limits and mechanical effects of light when interacting with matter, how quantum mechanics limits the ultimate sensitivity of measurements through an effect called quantum back-action.  Cavity optomechanics exploits the best of these two worlds to achieve the resonant enhancement of the mechanical effect of light on mechanical objects, through an engineered resonant structure. This could be for example an optical resonator with a series of narrow resonances, or an electromagnetic resonator such as a superconducting LC circuit. This fusion is providing a new generation of mechanical systems that operate in a regime where no significant thermal or technical noise remaining to perturb measurements and the only noise left is fundamental quantum noise. As a result, it has the potential to lead to the development of sensors that provide extraordinary sensitivity, precision, and accuracy in the measurement of feeble forces and fields.  Cavity optomechanics encompasses a wide spectrum of systems, from nanometer-sized devices, comprising as little as perhaps a billion atoms, to nano- and micromechanical structures and to the centimeter-sized mirrors used in gravitational wave detectors, weighing up to several kilograms. Importantly, these systems can be functionalized by coupling them e.g. to photons, spins, electric charges, atoms or molecules. These hybrid systems significantly widen the range of potential applications of quantum optomechanics.  In addition to providing motion and force detection of extraordinary sensitivity, optomechanical systems also pave the way to new tests of the foundation of physics, including tests of quantum theory at unprecedented size and mass scales. For instance, they can be used to probe the transition from quantum to classical behavior: It is widely accepted that quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory of nature, yet in everyday life we don't observe the remarkable quantum effects that we can achieved with small ensembles of atoms or with photons under exquisitely controlled conditions. In the famous example introduced by Schr&ouml;dinger, we cannot have a cat that is both alive and dead at the same time. This is puzzling, because if the quantum mechanical description of nature is more fundamental than its classical description, then quantum mechanics should govern not just the microscopic world, but the macroscopic world as well.

Within this broad context the cornerstone of this project was the study of hybrid optomechanical systems, with an emphasis on the coupling between mechanical oscillators and ultracold atoms. Our main objectives have been to achieve a better understanding of the dynamics of nanoscale systems operating deep in the quantum regime; to understand the optomechanical features of ultracold atomic systems; and to combine these two components in hybrid optomechanical systems, with a focus both on potential applications in metrology, and in a better fundamental understanding of the quantum/classical interface.   On the more "applied" side of this project, we have proposed and analyzed in detail systems where the impact of quantum noise on measurements is completely eliminated, using in particular a recently proposed approach called "coherent quantum noise cancellation" to isolate quantum mechanics-free subsystemsthat do not suffer the effects of quantum noise. One example is a dual cavity hybrid system where a mechanical oscillator used for force sensing is coupled to a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
