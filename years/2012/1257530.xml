<AbstractNarration>The mechanisms that influence variation in the morphological, physiological, and behavioral characteristics of animals are important because they determine how organisms cope with environmental challenges, and because these responses can affect behavior in later stages of life. Recent evidence suggests that so-called epigenetic mechanisms can affect how animals respond to environmental change. Epigenetic mechanisms are heritable changes in gene expression that are not encoded in the DNA sequence.  When epigenetic changes occur early in life, there can be long-term consequences for physiology and behavior. For example, increased DNA methylation (a form of epigenetic control) in the machinery that controls the receptor for stress hormone during development can impair an adult's physiological response to stress. Because coping with stress represents a central way in which both humans and non-humans respond to environment change, it will be important to determine if and how developmental stressors might negatively affect organisms throughout their lives. Using a long-term study of superb starlings (Lamprotornis superbus) in Kenya this project will (1) explore the developmental effects of environmental stressors on DNA methylation in the stress hormone receptor machinery, as well as in the entire genome, and subsequently (2) determine how DNA methylation during development affects adult stress physiology, reproductive behavior, and fitness using a long-term DNA collection, stress hormone samples, and experimental manipulations. This work will create new avenues of research using epigenetic tools in non-model organisms, where the lessons learned can be applied back to other model systems including humans. This study will train American and Kenyan students through field courses, workshops, and research projects in the field and lab. Researchers will also work closely with a grassroots conservation organization in Kenya to educate rural school children about conservation and wildlife of threatened organisms and ecosystems and about climate change.</AbstractNarration>

When early life conditions are poor, individuals may be at a developmental disadvantage unless mothers can adaptively program their offspring to give them an advantage. For organisms living in unpredictable environments in which conditions vary greatly from year to year, it remains unclear how these annual climatic differences influence offspring physiology and behavior, and if mothers can help their young overcome poor conditions. One way that environmental factors might influence offspring physiology and behavior is through epigenetic changes in the genome that include chemical modifications to the DNA bases (called DNA methylation), which influence gene expression. Using a long-term study of superb starlings living in the unpredictable savannas of East Africa, we explored how environmental uncertainty influences offspring behavior and fitness later in life, and whether epigenetic changes might be involved. Superb starlings are cooperative breeders that live in complex social groups where some individuals breed, while others forego reproduction to help raise the breeders&rsquo; offspring. We studied not only how environmental conditions might affect levels of DNA methylation in offspring, but also how those changes might impact the adoption of different reproductive roles in adulthood.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We began by sequencing the superb starling genome and developing new tools that will enable researchers to study DNA methylation at specific genes, as well as globally across the entire genome. By targeting key genes related to the vertebrate stress response, we first showed that DNA methylation in the regulatory region of the primary stress hormone receptor varies predictably in males born in wet versus dry years, which in turns influences the likelihood of those males becoming successful breeders later in life. Since chicks born in dry years had lower DNA methylation and were more likely to breed than those born in wet years, it appears that mothers may be able to adaptively program offspring born in poor years to give them an advantage later in life. Moreover, although DNA methylation levels in chicks did not predict an individual&rsquo;s stress response in adulthood, DNA methylation levels did correlate with their stress response soon after hatching such that those with lower DNA methylation had a more pronounced stress response. However, there were no such effects on behavior or stress physiology in females, suggesting that epigenetic modification of the stress axis can act in a sex-specific manner. Such sex-specific effects of how early life conditions influence development have also been reported recently in other animals, including in humans. Thus, these results suggest that the epigenetic effects of early life stress may differentially impact males and females of many animal species, and that in some cases mothers may be able to adaptively program the offspring of one sex born in poor years to give them a reproductive advantage later in life.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After focusing on one key gene in the vertebrate stress axis, we then expanded our study to a global analysis of the entire genome, identifying a number of regions that are differentially methylated in birds born in wet and dry years. Key genes in these differentially methylated regions included those related to reproduction, social behavior, metabolic function, cardiac function, immune function, and brain and cognitive function. The direction of change was similar for the majority of the genes, such that birds had higher methylation in drier, which should translate in reduced gene expression for birds born under poor environmental conditions. Thus, early life stress may have consistent, negative global effects on DNA methylation, which could impair individuals throughout their lives. As we showed with our study on a single candidate gene in the stress axis, mothers may be able to adaptively program offspring to overcome some of these challenges, but which genes can be programmed and how this might be done mechanistically requires further research. Ultimately, this work suggests that the environmental conditions that animals experience early in life can profoundly affect the genome and have carryover effects on behavior, physiology, and fitness in later life stages.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, this study helped train a number of female high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in Kenya and USA. The work was presented to high school students in rural Kenya, to the public across New York City, and to the scientific community in the USA and across the world. We worked closely with a grassroots conservation organization, the Northern Kenya Conservation Clubs, to educate rural school children about conservation and wildlife through a series of teaching modules about how environmental variation influences African organisms and ecosystems. Moreover, during each year of the project, we took American university students to Kenya to study tropical biology and sustainable development for a semester.
