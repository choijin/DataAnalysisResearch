<AbstractNarration>This work will provide the first continental-scale sample of taxonomic, genetic and&lt;br/&gt;functional diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi from pine ecosystems. These fungi form symbiotic relationships with the roots of dominant forest plants, and provide them with nutrients and water in exchange for photosynthetically-fixed carbon. Despite the importance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in global nutrient cycles, little is known about large-scale patterns of fungal community structure relative to plants, animals, or even bacteria. This project will establish patterns of gene flow and selection for multiple ectomycorrhizal fungi across North America, use a hierarchical phylogenetic sampling design to measure variation in functional enzyme production across individuals, populations and species, and use RNA based metagenomics to measure functional trait expression on mycorrhizal root tips. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a large, open access database of taxonomic barcode and functional genes that can be used by researchers to generate predictive models of fungal ecosystems. It will include training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in cutting-edge techniques in an understudied field, will result in outreach activities targeted toward the general public, and will include activities for K-12 students and educators designed to foster early student interests in fungi.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There is a growing awareness that beneficial interactions with a diverse community of microbial organisms - the &ldquo;microbiome&rdquo; &ndash; play an important role in the health of most plants and animals, including humans.
