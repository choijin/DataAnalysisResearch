<AbstractNarration>The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has established the UNC Charlotte 49er Teach Noyce Scholars Program to prepare 12 high-school chemistry and physics teachers with content expertise.  Through a strong partnership among the Departments of Physics and Chemistry, the College of Education, and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, this high-quality teacher preparation program uses the Learning Coach model to engage the best chemistry and physics students in peer instruction, supported by faculty mentors.  Those selected to become Noyce Scholars enroll in pedagogy courses, attend seminars enriching their knowledge of both science and pedagogy, attend state and national meetings on science education, have summer internship opportunities, and are supported by a three-person team of mentors, one each from the science faculty, the education faculty, and a classroom teacher.  Having completed the certification program, new teachers continue to be mentored and supported during their first three induction years. This project's success rests on its seamless collaborations among disparate disciplines, strong administrative support, and the well-developed Learning Coach model.  It addresses a key need for well-trained high school chemistry and physics teachers, particularly in underserved areas such as rural North Carolina.</AbstractNarration>
