<AbstractNarration>This award will fund a research group at the University of Miami to continue a consensus reference material (CRM) program that was first developed in 1999 in support of consistent, high-quality measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seawater by the international ocean chemistry community. With continued strong international efforts to investigate the marine carbon cycle, the existing CRM program provides the necessary benchmark for globally comparable marine DOC measurements. Marine dissolved organic carbon measurements are made regularly at more than 50 laboratories in the United States, and at a greater number of laboratories in the rest of the world. Until this CRM program began distribution of reference materials, analyses made in these many laboratories were not linked by a common reference material and were, therefore, not comparable. Because there had not been an independent and common standard available, against which calibrations of individual analyses could be checked, there was little agreement amongst the majority of the laboratories making the measurements. Since the beginning of the program, ca. 110,000 ampoules of deep seawater and ca. 70,000 ampoules of low carbon water ampoules have been produced and distributed to 230 US and international laboratories in 36 nations. With renewal of the reference material program for a fifth 3-year period of support, deep ocean water containing ca. 40 umol C/kg of biologically refractory dissolved organic carbon and low carbon reference water will continue to be distributed to the marine biogeochemistry community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: With continuation of this work the US and international communities will confidently produce consistent measurements of a major marine carbon reservoir, thereby advancing society's ability to assess changes in the marine carbon cycle and the role of the ocean in climate change.  The principal investigator maintains a website that provides direct and convenient links to a growing number of DOM data collected from the global ocean (http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/biogeochem/Data.html). As the CRM program has matured, a growing number of international laboratories are now able to provide high quality data to this repository.  The principal investigator intends to pursue those data over the next 3 years, making them publicly available to the carbon community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When a chemist wants to ensure that their analyses are returning data that are reliable, such as the concentrations of chemicals dissolved in water, they find great value in testing their analytical skills on materials of a similar nature and that have already been confirmed as to concentrations.  Carbon dissolved in ocean water is one such variable that has taken on great scientific importance over the past few decades.  Carbon, as a component of carbon dioxide, is central to Earth's changing climate, and the ocean is an important reservoir for the carbon being liberated to the atmosphere with the burning of fossil fuels.  A large part of that anthropogenic carbon dissolves into seawater, where it can lower the pH of the water (acidification), and where it can affect the normal functioning of the cycling of carbon by ocean biology.  One product of the carbon cycle in seawater is organic matter released as dissolved material, such as sugars, fats, humics, and proteins.  These materials accumulate in the ocean (see figure), with a final inventory of carbon held in the ocean as organic matter of about 700 billion tons.  While this is indeed a big number, the ocean is vast, so these tons are greatly diluted.  The concentrations of this organic matter dissolved in seawater ends up being tiny, and thus hard to analytically determine with confidence.  This project, funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, supported the production of analytical reference materials that were sent to the international community of ocean chemists who require confidence that their analyses are good, or who require corrections in their techniques if their methods are not yet well developed.  Here, water was collected from the deep ocean, holding low concentrations of organic matter; expert laboratories assessed the concentrations of the carbon, and then distributed that water along with the expertly determined characterizations.  The receiving laboratories worked on their analytical techniques, using the expert's values as their guide for analytical skill.  Once that skill was improved and confirmed, the international community was ready to make measurements throughout the global ocean, and deliver high quality data to their international colleagues, in which we could have high confidence, making everyone's work intercomparable and broadly useful.  In the end, after years of analyses with high skill, this large community generated data from around the world ocean that allow us to characterize the role of the ocean in the cycling of carbon globally. This project distributed 10's of thousands of these reference waters over the course of the program; the international community of ocean scientists who used the reference materials have improved their analytical skills, and thus making their data increasingly useful and valuable to the wider community of ocean scientists who depend on these data for their own work.
