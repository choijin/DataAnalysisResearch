<AbstractNarration>The Institute of Systems Biology is awarded a grant to apply principles of systems biology and the power of parallel computing to the advancement of computational and experimental methods that can very rapidly delineate the gene networks in any organism. By integrating genome sequence analysis with the analysis of large amounts of genome-wide ("high-throughput") experimental data, the computational methods being developed as part of this project will reverse engineer the network models. These models will be predictive and will have extraordinary detail (down to the level of biomolecular mechanisms) that could drive rational improvements in the gene networks, with predictable outcomes. It will also uncover fundamental principles underlying the ability of even the simplest microbes to deal with complex environmental changes. While the work will be performed on two organisms - E. coli, a well-known, widely studied bacterium, and Halobacterium salinarum, an extremophile that thrives in high salt environments, it is readily applicable to all sequenced bacteria, algae, and other organisms that are of huge industrial, agricultural, and medical importance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to training a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student in the methodology of systems modeling, this project will develop inquiry-driven, standards-based, high school (HS) educational materials. These education materials will incorporate concepts and methods for inferring and mathematically representing (modeling) a system as a network of interacting parts, which will help students understand and critically assess complex and important phenomena, e.g. how climate change can reach a tipping point to have cascading effects throughout an ecosystem. The education materials will incorporate a systems approach, and will be developed together with local science educators. While the goal of the module will be to educate students in various methods for statistical modeling and model inference, it will also attempt to reinforce the notion that computers do not always have the right answer, that models are only as good as the data they are based upon, and that statistical confidence of predictions must be rigorously assessed to avoid wrong conclusions. The scientists funded by this project will participate in development of educational materials through direct interactions with HS students and educators.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A foremost challenge in Systems Biology is to understand how even the simplest organism with just a few transcription factors (TFs) is able to deal with complex, combinatorial environmental changes. To tackle this challenge, we need to understand transcriptional control at multiple scales in order to link detailed regulatory mechanisms to the environment-dependent modular states of a transcriptional regulatory network (TRN). Incorporating detailed mechanisms into a system scale predictive model will make it possible to predict specific genetic manipulations for generating a desired systems level response&mdash;from synthetic biology applications to rational systems re-engineering&mdash;and further predict the mechanistic basis of a perturbed biological system.</p> <p>We proposed to leverage and extend the use of computational tools (cMonkey and Inferelator) developed in previously funded NSF projects that resulted in the construction of the first predictive model of a free-living organism. This environment and gene regulatory influence network (EGRIN) model can predict transcriptional responses to new environments based on measured levels of TFs and environmental factors that were discovered to be putatively responsible for regulation of system-wide gene expression changes.</p> <p>In this project, we have developed significant advancements to both cMonkey and Inferelator into an ensemble modeling framework to overcome uncertainties of gene regulatory associations by sampling hundreds to thousands of high quality EGRIN models. Using this ensemble approach, we have demonstrated at single nucleotide resolution, how genome-wide distributions of gene regulatory elements, their spatial organization within promoters, and their environment-dependent activities (i.e. interactions with TFs) dynamically reorganizes a TRN into physiologically meaningful modular states (Fig 1). We applied our new methods to specific questions regarding environmental responses of multiple organisms of the 3 domains of life, from <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> to the Archaeon <em>Halobacterium salinarum</em> and Eukaryotes like <em>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</em> and ultimately, human. These results prove that our method is generalizable and able to reveal fundamentally new biological insights in disparate, even understudied organisms.</p> <p>Selected publications highlight significant achievements of this project. We published a system-level model for prokaryotic gene regulatory networks that goes well beyond existing paradigms of gene regulation (Fig. 2) [1]. We have further extended this capability to a NIH-funded project on tuberculosis where we developed a high-resolution network model for global gene regulation in <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> [2], which predicted drug combinations with antagonistic interactions, accelerating the discovery of new effective combination drug regimens (Fig. 3) [3]. We also built a comprehensive mechanistic model of <em>C. reinhardtii</em> TRN uncovering a beautiful pattern of transcriptional waves responding to nitrogen starvation and transitioning into the concomitant lipid accumulation phenotype (Fig. 4) [4]. Finally, we leveraged our modeling approach to building a human TRN including TFs and miRNAs (Fig. 5) [5].</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts</strong></p> <p>We developed a user-friendly set of inquiry-driven, standards-based educational materials to teach high school educators and students the concepts of dynamic network modeling and inference in the context of real world issues. These activities allow users to understand how a complex system can be modeled as a network of interacting parts. They guide students to apply learned patterns and relationships that lead to predictive modeling of biological problems and phenomena. We learned that using systems dynamics tools and processes works best for novice computational modelers and offers an effective point-of-entry for both students and teachers.&nbsp; We directly trained over 500 teachers to use these resources and provided immersive internship experiences for 15 teachers, 20 graduate, 10 undergraduate and 17 high school students.
