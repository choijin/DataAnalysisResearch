<AbstractNarration>Researchers at University of Wisconsin-River Falls and at Henry Sibley High School in Mendota Heights, MN, are creating new high-quality and resource-rich videos for physics instruction, substantially adding to an existing library, so that the entire introductory mechanics curriculum is covered.  The team is also creating detailed and ready-to-use curricular materials to support the videos so that other instructors will be able to easily incorporate our videos into their classes, expanding a web resource that hosts the video library, curricular materials and pedagogical support, and rigorously measuring the extent to which students who use these sets of abstracted and applied videos are able to apply their knowledge to new situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One particularly compelling aspect of these videos is the pairing between two types of videos: abstract  and applied, the former referring to videos that show physics concepts at their most elemental level using traditional physics lab equipment, while the latter show real-world phenomena exhibiting in a similar concept but in a more complicated setting. This pairing allows the instructor and the students to spiral back over material for better retention and learning transfer. The project has strong potential for broader impact in the physics community and beyond because of the ease of dissemination via vetted and oft-used digital library collections such as SERC and ComPADRE, which have millions of visitors each year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcomes:  The goal of this project was to produce video-based learning activities for high-school and college physics students.  The videos are not similar to lectures (where an expert explains concepts) rather they are ultra-clear, high-resolution, slow-motion videos of interesting events that students can analyze for themselves. Our videos include cars skidding on ice, roller coasters, hockey slap shots, wiggling springs, swinging pendulums, and flying balls.  It?s interesting to see how the scope, nature, and philosophy of the project has changed over the three-year lifetime of this award.  Our free library of videos can be found here:  http://serc.carleton.edu/dmvideos/videos.html  Tools: Initially the measurement tools (used by the student to characterize the event shown in the video) were embedded in the video.  That meant that the person who edited the video (and NOT the student) was the one making the decisions about the measurement: where, for example, the zero for the ruler should be, and when the stopwatch should be set to zero. Now we have the technical ability to make the tools interactive, so that it?s the students who are making those decisions. Being able to make smart choices about measurements is a valuable laboratory skill.           Parameter swap: In the past year we have developed the ability to let students change what is happening in the video!  We do that by recording multiple versions of the same scenario with slightly different parameters.  All the videos come together to form a multi-dimensional matrix of videos that students can use to learn about the world.      For example our "Wave Properties" shows waves moving down a large spring.  From a single video students can measure frequency, wavelength, period, amplitude, and wave speed.  That?s neat, but then students can go further and start to ask other questions, like, "Will the wave speed-up if the frequency increases?" or "Will the wave slow down if the amplitude drops?" or, "What?s the relationship between frequency and wavelength?"  In fact, different students in the same class could ask different questions and then design an experiment (using the videos) to answer their own questions.  They could then collect data, analyze it, and find the answer.  In short they could go through the whole scientific process using real data from the real events depicted in the videos.   Purpose: The innovations described above have lead us to reconceive how the video resources should be used.  Initially we envisioned them as being more-engaging replacements for written homework problems.  While they still offer that functionality, we now see that they can be much more than that.  The realism and flexibility that they offer make them ideal platforms for authentic science investigations.        Partners:  One of the outcomes from this award is how it has facilitated partnerships with several leaders in science education including MIT, Boston University, Rice University, as well as major commercial players in the educational technology space. Users:  Our free online library of videos is attracting more and more users.  This past week alone we had 6637 user sessions (please note that groups of students often share a computer in class so the number of individual students may be even higher.)   Research:  As part of this award we have conducted two studies.  During the fall of 2014 we conducted a pilot study to compare the efficacy of our video products with physical apparatus.  No significant difference was found. The results have not been submitted for publication.  In the fall of 2015 we conducted an A/B study to see if our resources helped students learn model-making and model-breaking skills.  In both instances we found that the answer was yes.  We submitted an article to Physical Review PER this summer.  We are currently revising it for resubmission.   Additional Support:  The NSF-TUES award has been instrumental in our ability to attract other funding.  Since the award we have received additional funding and support from the American Institute of Physics (Meggers Award), the Milken-PennGSE (ACT Award), the Wisconsin System (Applied Research Grant Award), the National Science Foundation (Innovation Corp, aka I-Corp Award), Henry Sibley High School, the University of Wisconsin River Falls, as well as a variety of commercial endeavors.  New Company:  This spring two of the PI?s from the TUES award founded a company, PIVOT INTERACTIVES SBC, with the goal of making the project self-supporting in the long term.  The company is currently in contract negotiations with major players in the field of science education.   Intense customer discovery:  Both the I-Corp and the Ideadvance Awards that we received provided financial support, but they also provided an entrepreneurship class based on "Lean Start-up" principles.  A major part of Steve Blank?s Lean Start-up approach is intense customer discover by way of interviews with customers and potential customers.  Through that process we learned a lot about what instructors are looking for.          Last Modified: 09/26/2016       Submitted by: Matthew T Vonk]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
