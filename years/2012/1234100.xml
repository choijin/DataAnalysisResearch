<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the development of analytical and computational tools for determining the sensitivity to system parameters of both transient and steady-state performance measures in queueing networks.  Standard numerical methods to calculate sensitivity of performance measures with a high level of accuracy are usually computationally prohibitive because they involve a two-step approach of first obtaining numerical approximations of expectations of performance measures at different parameter values and then numerical differentiation of these approximate expectations.  This work aims to provide a more tractable analytical characterization of the sensitivity in terms of a single expectation, and to then use this characterization to develop efficient one-step algorithms for the computation of sensitivities.  In particular, this extends approaches that have been used in finance and other domains to queueing networks, where the issue is far more subtle due to the presence of boundaries.  This award also supports research in the study of many-server queues, with the goal of obtaining tractable   approximations for transient and steady-state performance measures associated with many-server queues.  New tools will be developed for the analysis of stability in such systems and obtaining tractable approximations of steady state and transient performance measures and applied for optimal system design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to uncertainty in parameters, computation of sensitivities are very important for design and capacity allocation in queueing networks.  The development of efficient computational tools would greatly enhance the planning capabilities of companies with manufacturing processes governed by queueing networks.   Many-server queues arise in diverse applications such as call centers, health-care and data centers.  In applications, knowledge of steady state and transient performance measures are required for staffing and decisions, the efficiency of which can have significant economic and social impact.  In addition, this research will also develop new mathematical tools that will be applicable in a broader setting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Many physical systems evolve in a random fashion and are constrained to lie  in a certain subset (for example, when the state of the system is represented by nonnegative quantities). Such systems arise in queueing networks, mathematical finance and biology.  In addition, the values of the parameters that govern their random evolution are often not precisely known.   In such situations, an important goal is to be able to quantify the sensitivity of performance measures, which are often expressed as expectations of functionals of the state, or the history of the state, either at a fixed time or at equilibrium, to the system parameters.  We developed a mathematical framework for the study of sensitivities of constrained (random or deterministic) dynamical systems to the parameters that govern them.  A key challenge was to develop an approach that could deal with state constraints, especially when the state space is non-smooth.  Our results also suggest new numerical methods for computing sensitivites of both transient and equilibrium performance measures for a large class of systems constrained  in convex polyhedral domains.    Many real-world systems can be modelled as particles or agents that interact with each other.  Furthermore, in many cases this interaction is weak or mean-field, in the sense that the interaction depends only on the number of particles in each state.   An important question in the design of random physical systems is the study of their stability properties and  their equilibrium behavior.  We study two classes of mean-field systems, the first is finite-dimensional, while the latter is infinite-dimensional.  In the first case, we study so-called Lyapunov functions, which are a useful tool for  establishing stability of systems.  Specifically, a Lyapunov  function, which is a non-positive function that decreases (on average, when the system is random) along the trajectories of the system.  In many cases, the construction of Lyapunov functions is somewhat of an art.  We provide a systematic method to construct Lyapunov functions for finite-dimensional mean-field interacting particle systems, and identify a new class of particle systems, which we call locally Gibbs systems, for which we can explicitly identify the Lyapunov functions.  This class includes models that arise in physics, communication networks and operations research.    The second class of mean-field systems includes the many-server queue,  which arises as models of call centers and in health care.  The goal in these  systems is to determine how to staff the systems so that certain ``quality of  service'' objectives (such as the probability a customer is made to wait) are  met.  However, since the exact calculation of the many-server queue under realistic assumptions on the system parameters (such as the distribution of the service time of a customer)  is often not feasible, one instead resorts to obtaining asymptotic approximations to the equilibrium queue length.  In this work, we develop mathematical techniques for establishing such approximations, and show how they are relevant for the design of the network.  In particular, we introduce certain convenient infinite-dimensional representations of the system that make such an analysis tractable.  The techniques we introduce are likely to be useful for the study of a broader class of networks of interest.       Last Modified: 04/04/2016       Submitted by: Kavita Ramanan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
