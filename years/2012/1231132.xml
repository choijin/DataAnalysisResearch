<AbstractNarration>Scalable kinship inference in wild populations across years and generations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cornerstone of research in molecular ecology is the reconstruction of family groups (kinship analysis).&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how individuals in free-living populations are related to each other provides the best&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to study many important biological processes, ranging from sexual selection to patterns&lt;br/&gt;of dispersal and recruitment. Recent advances in molecular DNA technologies and computational&lt;br/&gt;methods have made these studies possible. However, many conceptual and computational challenges&lt;br/&gt;remain and need to be addressed in order to advance these studies. To date, existing research work&lt;br/&gt;on kinship analysis has primarily focused on computational methods that address a single relationship, such as parentage assignment or reconstruction of full sib groups. Inclusion of multiple objectives, such as half-sib reconstruction with minimum parentage assignment, or hierarchy over multiple generations, makes formulation of the underlying computational problem extremely challenging, and simple extensions of previous  methods do not address in a practical, scalable, and robust manner the problem of kinship reconstruction for data sets that include multiple generations of species or involve multiple optimization functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research is to design robust, parsimonious, and versatile computational&lt;br/&gt;approaches for inferring multi-generation kinship relationships in wild populations from multiallelic&lt;br/&gt;markers. Parsimony assumption is fundamental to these approaches as it requires no prior knowledge,&lt;br/&gt;assumptions about sampling methodology, or existence of models, which is the case for most free-living&lt;br/&gt;populations. The diverse tasks of this project include formulating computational kinship inference&lt;br/&gt;problems based on existing biological studies, analyzing computational complexity of and providing&lt;br/&gt;solutions to the resulting combinatorial optimization problems, and designing robust, scalable and&lt;br/&gt;efficient high performance implementations. The resulting computational methods will be evaluated&lt;br/&gt;on datasets collected from existing biological studies and will be deployed to the biological community&lt;br/&gt;through the Kinalyzer web-based service, currently actively used for sibship inference only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed in this project will greatly impact diverse application areas including funda-&lt;br/&gt;mental research in combinatorial optimization and data mining, and within biology, areas as diverse as&lt;br/&gt;behavioral ecology, evolutionary genetics, conservation, forensics, and epidemiology. The multidisci-&lt;br/&gt;plinary nature of the project and the research team will enhance curriculum design of related areas and&lt;br/&gt;introduce new cross-disciplinary courses. This cohesive, multidisciplinary project will provide training&lt;br/&gt;opportunities in biology, operation research, algorithms analysis, bioinformatics and high performance&lt;br/&gt;computing, within a single application framework. The project will leverage the diverse scientific ex-&lt;br/&gt;pertise and extensive mentoring experience of the team to foster a true interdisciplinary collaboration&lt;br/&gt;and to provide a thriving environment for a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists.</AbstractNarration>
