<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to create fundamental knowledge and methods for engineering design that enable engineers to better create products that satisfy the needs of persons with disabilities. Specifically, this research will create product design methodologies focused on what is common and what is different between typical and inclusive products. The proposed work creates quantitative knowledge that links the function of a product to the limitations of a user. Additionally, this research will create a modular multiplatform product family design method specifically constructed to support inclusive design. Thus, the products designed will offer usability, functionality, and value to the user while simultaneously offering profitability to the producer. The proposed research extends the functional lexicon of engineering design and World Health Organizations International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) to formally relate product function and user functional limitation thus integrating engineering and health communities in the context of product design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will transform engineering design practice by creating knowledge and methods that will fundamentally shift the philosophical context of inclusive design. Rather than attempt to design an entire product for a typical, fully able user, a user with a disability, or both, it will intelligently identify the base platform that satisfies all users? needed functionality and the differentiating modules that address specific needs. Core integrated research activities include working directly with persons with disabilities to design new products. These activities include undergraduate students as well, thus these students will gain exposure to the ?human quality of life improvement? aspect of engineering often not emphasized in the typical undergraduate curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Millions of persons with physical disabilities are currently not well served by existing products on the market.  Additionally, roughly 10,000 ?baby boomers? are retiring each day. This portends the largest increase in an aged population that the US has seen in its history and the aging generation will either need services and products or assistive care that insures a high quality of life.  Taken together, there is a large population that needs products and services that are designed for individuals with a variety of disabilities (from mild to more severe).  The overall motivation of this research is to mature the concept of inclusive design methodology to address this need.  Key outcomes of this project include an approach that designers can follow to better understand the needs of persons with disabilities.  Central to this is the creation of a 'disability simulation suit' that allows designers or other users to experience restrictions in their mobility that mimics a variety of disabilities in one's upper body.  Designers now can have a personal understanding of a customer that must interact with products in a way that is different than that of a person without disabilities.    Additionally, an approach is outlined that will allow designers to create products that serve persons with disabilities and persons without disabilities at the same time.  This approach enables inclusive products to be made more economically for all users &ndash; a key benefit for persons with disabilities who typically paid a premium for products that were specialized for their need.
