<AbstractNarration>This mathematics research project by Michael Lacey is in the general area of harmonic analysis. The Shannon Sampling Theorem asserts that a function in the Paley-Wiener class can be recovered by its values at the integers. This foundational fact has many quantifications, and extensions.  Among the most delicate is to what extent the integers can be replaced by other discrete sets: For which other sets is sampling also well behaved. In the square-integrable case, this is just one instance of the profound two-weight inequality for the Hilbert transform. It asks for a real-variable characterization of those pairs of measures on the real line for which the Hilbert transform is bounded between the Hilbert spaces associated with the pair of measures (weights). Lacey has recently solved this problem, in complete generality. This and a family of related extensions will be under investigation by Lacey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematics research project by Michael Lacey is in the field of harmonic analysis, which has deep applications to other fields such as engineering, for instance to signal transmission. The hallmark of transmission of information is rapid and regular sampling of a signal, followed by a synthesis of the samples into, for instance, a voice conversation over a cell phone. The system is robust, with small perturbations of the sampling not affecting the synthesis, in part because the most obvious problems with the sampling are all accounted for. The abstraction of this sampling leads to fascinating mathematical problems:  A dramatic oversampling of the signal increases the observed energy. How bad can the oversampling become, while preserving the energy of the signal? Just how degenerate of a sampling is permitted before the signal is lost? Lacey has provided a mathematical solution to the first problem, an advance that will open the door to a range of related questions. These techniques, disseminated across fields of science and engineering, will impact the underlying theories of sampling and information. Some of the problems in this project will be studied by Ph.D. students under Lacey's direction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The subject of one bit sensing is a fascinating topic in compressive signal processing. The typical model of signal analysis in the compressive setting, one takes some data, like an image, and takes a small number of random measurements of the signal. These measurements are made in a linear way, though the actual measurement is linear in nature.  The method of recovery of the signal in this model is very common and well understood.     In one bit sensing, one does not keep the full linear measurement, but only the sign of the measurement. For instance, in Image 1, the signal would be &Chi;.  Choose some vector Y which defines an `northern hemisphere' relative to y. The one bit measurement reports if X in the northern hemisphere, or not. In this case, X is in the `northern hemisphere.'     This very severe restriction is motivated by two important examples.  As has become quite common, measurements can be `quantized'.  For instance, liking a post on Facebook is a quantized measurement on that post.  But, important in technological developments, if measurements can be similarly quantized, it turns out that one can make many more measurements.  The understanding of how to use quantized measurements to reconstruct signals is a engaging and important question.  Also, one bit measurements are the key example of a non-linearity in measurements of signals.     The PI with Dmitriy Bilyk and graduate student Scott Spencer, devised a comprehensive and sharp analysis of one aspect of this question in the one bit framework.  A surprising aspect of this analysis is that one bit measurements can be just as effective as their linear counterparts.  Indeed, an undergraduate research project established a very sharp version of this principle in the setting of the One Bit Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma.  Another surprising aspect of the non-linearity is that if one has one-bit measurements in the presence of noise, the noise never averages out in the classical sense.  There is instead a distortion in the information that can be recovered.  The magnitude of the distortion can be reduced by increasing  the number of measurements.     Another topic that we investigated is the recent notation of a sparse bound for  bilinear forms.  These bounds give a control of an form in terms of a simple sum of positive, localized norms of the input functions.  A central defining element is a family of sparse cubes, see image 2, with a root, and generations of descendants. Importantly, the descendants at each generation can only occupy a small fraction of the parent cube.     It is surprising that certain kind of bilinear forms, which have well-known non-local behaviors, admit such control in terms of sparse forms. Moreover, this control delivers as an easy consequence, other weighted bounds. These are very easy to establish, and frequently deliver very precise  estimates, which previously were not accessible.     The reach and scope of the established results has lead to a host of new weighted bounds, and much simpler proofs of established bounds. It is a significant simplification of the theory.  It has applications to a number of settings where one might not think the sparse approach works.  The PI and his research team are continuing to explore the implications of these observations.         Last Modified: 06/07/2017       Submitted by: Michael T Lacey]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
