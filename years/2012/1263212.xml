<AbstractNarration>Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs) are natural laboratories for investigating Earth surface processes mediated by fresh water in the zone extending from the top of the vegetation canopy to the base of groundwater, i.e. the Critical Zone. This award supports the participation of undergraduate students and teachers in research at two Critical Zone Observatories, the Susquehanna-Shale Hills Observatory (SSHO) in central Pennsylvania and the Christina River Basin (CRB) CZO in southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware. Pennsylvania State University is the lead institution of the SSHO and would collaborate with the Stroud Water Research Center (SWRC), a partner in the CRB CZO. The collaborative project will fund a total of 12 undergraduate students and 4 teachers at these sites per year, providing research experiences for undergraduates primarily interested in Earth Science careers and K-12 teachers who want to increase their content knowledge and resources for the classroom. At the CRB, participants will be involved in research investigating aspects of the impact of three centuries of human habitation on the carbon and water cycles. At the SSHO, participants will be involved in research to quantitatively predict the creation, evolution and structure of regolith as a function of the geochemical, hydrologic, biologic, and geomorphological processes operating in the temperate, forested landscape. After the summer experience, participants will prepare and give presentations at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union.  CZOs offer a unique opportunity for training undergraduate students and teachers via research experiences because of the broad array of environmental landscapes represented by the observatories and the interdisciplinary science achieved through the observatory framework.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary goals of this REU/RET Site project, Introducing Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) Science to Students and Teachers, were to 1) continue to develop a new cadre of interdisciplinary scientists and educators with understanding and expertise in critical zone science and the CZOs; 2) establish a collaborative research and education initiative between the Shale Hills CZO and the emeritus CZO in the Christina River Basin; and, 3) play one small role in the greater national CZO program goal of more broadly introducing the term &ldquo;critical zone&rdquo; into the lexicon of our society, here through the development of 1) above and their subsequent dissemination activities.</p> <p>Each summer from 2014-16, nine participants, typically seven undergraduates and two teachers displaying a broad mix in geography, ethnic heritage, gender and university/college type, were mentored through the rigors of developing a research project from the beginning, to completing related field, laboratory, data management and interpretation activities, to presenting the results as a poster at a professional meeting. This process exposed the students in a short amount of time to some of the experiences (and stress) they will encounter in graduate school, or within any government or private sector job in science.&nbsp;</p> <p>The project was a success as proposed. The project leadership learned a lot about introducing the concept of critical zone science to early career scientists and those otherwise lacking knowledge of the term and related concepts, and were able to develop and evolve an effective approach through the course of the project. This success has carried through in the submission of an in-review proposal to NSF for another REU/RET Site project to be run collaboratively between the Shale Hills and Calhoun Forest CZOs; and, in the planning and development of an international CZO school to be held in Italy during summer 2018.</p> <p>The energy generated by the participants led to greater accomplishments than we had imagined. Those achievements include: multiple teacher workshops and related formal professional development units for attending teachers; and, representation and exposure of critical zone science at diverse disciplinary science meetings, through the participation of our teachers and students at professional meetings during their summer experience, but also through follow-on presentations by them and their mentors. Most importantly is the decision by at least four of our undergraduate participants to attend graduate school to work in CZ science within the CZO network, and that our teachers have since incorporated related lessons into their classrooms.</p> <p>It is our contention that society will more easily achieve environmental sustainability if our citizenry understands the concepts of interconnectedness between physical, biological and chemical processes and functions in the critical zone.
