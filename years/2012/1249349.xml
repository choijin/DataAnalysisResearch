<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is pleaserd to announce the selection of MIT's Scott Aaronson, an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, to receive its 2012 Alan T. Waterman Award.  Dr. Aaronson works with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT's largest interdepartmental lab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Waterman Award is the National Science Foundation's (NSF) highest honor. The annual award recognizes outstanding researchers under the age of 35 in any field of science or engineering NSF supports. This is the first year that two awardees have been selected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a medal, each of this year's awardees will receive a $1 million grant---twice the amount of last year's award---over a five-year period for further advanced study in his field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Aaronson, a theoretical computational scientist, pursues research interests that focus on the limitations of quantum computers and computational complexity theory more generally.  His research addresses a variety of topics, including the information content of quantum states, the physical resources needed for quantum computers to surpass classical computers, and the barriers to solving computer science's vexing P versus NP question, that is, whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer.</AbstractNarration>

A major focus was so-called "quantum supremacy," or solving some problem with quantum computers of the near future that we can have confidence is classically hard.  The PI and his student Alex Arkhipov had previously introduced BosonSampling, which is a sampling task solvable by rudimentary optical quantum computers, and proved that the task is hard for classical computers under plausible assumptions.  In this project, they carried the study of BosonSampling much further, to address verification of BosonSampling devices as well as BosonSampling in the presence of realistic experimental noise.  A second focus of the project was the largest possible speedups achievable by a quantum computer in various models.  Along with Andris Ambainis, the PI proposed a problem called "Forrelation," which is solvable using only 1 query using a quantum computer, and proved that it requires almost order sqrt(N) queries by any classical probabilistic algorithm.
