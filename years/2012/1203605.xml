<AbstractNarration>This project will produce digital images of about 12,000 type specimens in the mollusk collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP), which is part of Drexel University. Type specimens are the original specimens that scientists used when naming a new species, so they are the standards of reference for identifying species and doing comparative research in systematic biology. The mollusk collection at ANSP is the oldest in North America, dating from the early 1800s, and holds type specimens named by more than 600 scientists. Project images will be served online and made available to websites that consolidate information about biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mollusks have the highest extinction rate of any major group of animals, accounting for more than 40% of species extinctions in recorded history, with freshwater and terrestrial mollusks being most strongly impacted. Only 3% of mollusk species have had their conservation status assessed, so many extinctions have likely been overlooked. The availability of project images online will help scientists identify mollusk species and assess their conservation status, which is urgently needed throughout the world. The project will train undergraduates from Drexel University in molluscan systematics, taxonomy, and curatorial techniques and in working with electronic databases and imaging equipment.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project evaluated more than 16,000 mollusk samples in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP), confirming 15,500 as type material. Type specimens are the standards of reference for identification species as they are the original samples from when the species (or subspecies) was named. These samples represent more than 9,000 names. The best representative specimen was chosen for each name for high resolution imaging, using macrophotography or scanning electronic microscopy depending on the size of the specimen. Protocols developed during the project will help in  refining rules for determining the type status of specimens under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, and in providing standardizing procedures and orientations for imaging molluscan specimens.</p> <p>Through 2017, 30,000 images of specimens and their labels were online through the project website at ANSP (http://clade.ansp.org/malacology/collections/), and through iDigBio (www.idigbio.org), a portal that consolidates information from natural history collections and makes it publicly available. In addition, data on 480,000 samples of mollusks at ANSP were made searchable through iDigBio during the project. More than 100,000 of these have latitude and longitude information, which allows automated distribution mapping through iDigBio.</p> <p>The project images represent about 6000 mollusk species and so will be a substantial resource for biologists and ecologists in determining and reevaluating identities of species. Three scientific papers were published with support from the grant, and one U.S. patent issued. One of the papers demonstrated that the known diversity of the Recent Mollusca is about 75,000 species, which is substantially lower than previous estimates of more than 100,000. The patent (#<strong class="style-scope family-viewer" style="font-weight: 500; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #fafafa; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">9810972) </strong>is for a robot specimen photography mount, a prototype of which was developed during the project by undergraduate engineering students at Drexel University. It uses vacuum to hold specimens in place and rotates them in three dimensions to take images without the need to reposition the specimen. This system has anticipated uses in forensics, where it is important to avoid contaminating samples with residues from mounting media or damaging them through excessive handling. Similarly, the availability of high resolution images of the type specimens online safeguards the specimens by reducing the need for handling.</p> <p>The most important project images are those of endangered and extinct species, which are now available&nbsp; for conservation managers to better assess identities of species. Project images now online show the type specimens of 205 endangered species. This represents 17.5% of endangered species of mollusks on the IUCN Red List. It has also provided images of type specimens of 104 extinct species (33% of all extinct mollusks on the Red List), which might also aid conservation efforts, since supposedly extinct invertebrate species are not infrequently rediscovered living.</p> <p>Over the course of the project, 9 undergraduate students from Drexel University received training in digital imaging, database management, collection curation and zoological nomenclature. They have worked closely with professional staff at ANSP as mentors, increasing their information literacy and learning about opportunities for careers in the natural sciences.
