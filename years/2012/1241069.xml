<AbstractNarration>Microorganisms are abundant in the atmosphere and play an important role in controlling cloud development, cloud chemistry and ultimately weather patterns. They do this primarily by producing enzymes that catalyze the formation (nucleation) of ice crystals at significantly warmer temperatures than would normally be required for ice formation (-2 C vs. -36 C). Despite the atmosphere?s fundamental role in their dispersal, the abundance, diversity and flux of microorganisms in the atmosphere remain largely unknown. The potential of ice-nucleating microorganisms to significantly impact meteorology and promote microbial dispersal during precipitation events motivates this research.  The RAINS project will sample rain, snow and air samples at ground level, and in the lower atmosphere using remote-controlled aircraft.  The project will: (1) characterize microbial taxonomic diversity, including in precipitation that occurred between 1794 AD and present, and which is preserved in glacial ice; (2) determine the genetic diversity of microbial assemblages and of individual ice nucleating bacteria and (3) examine the functional diversity with respect to the role of precipitation and biological ice nucleation on patterns of microbial distribution.  The work will also determine which microbes carried to the Earth?s surface via precipitation present possible inoculum sources for diseases that impact humans, domestic animals, and plants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RAINS project will increase understanding of biodiversity in the planetary boundary layer of the atmosphere, where important meteorological phenomena such as precipitation occur.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommended developing a better understanding of the effect of aerosols and atmospheric ice formation in order to improve climate models and forecast the impact of rising global temperature. The proposed study will increase knowledge on the nature of the most active ice nucleators in the atmosphere. Microbial ice nucleation may also allow microorganisms and certain plant pathogens to efficiently cycle between the atmosphere and surface habitats, and RAINS will contribute to ongoing efforts to assess the movement of ice nucleating microorganisms across geographical scales. Outreach efforts will take these advances into high school and college classrooms in the form of hands-on research experiences for students at both levels and will serve as the basis for high school educators to develop unique classroom activities. In addition, an international network of scientists collecting field data on the relationship between biological ice nucleator abundance, cropping patterns and precipitation in dry land regions will be established. RAINS will sponsor an international conference that brings together 10 young career scientists in the network to highlight the advances of these investigations and identify the outstanding scientific questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Airborne ice nucleating (IN) microbes possess enzymatic or morphological traits that allow them to transform liquid water to ice at relatively high atmospheric temperatures.  Phase transition from liquid water and vapor to ice in clouds may trigger localized precipitation events.  In fact, this mechanism is used in commercial cloud seeding (via non-biological IN agents).  The subsidiary project (NSF DEB 1241069) -- funded from 6/1/2013 to 12/31/2017, and headquartered at Idaho State University (ISU) -- comprised a key component of the collaborative multi-university Research on Airborne Ice Nucleating Species (RAINS) project.  In the original NSF proposal NSF DEB 1241069 was slated to accomplish five tasks.   1. Collect precipitation samples in Virginia, Louisiana and Idaho for a large number of storm events to characterize the regional and seasonal patterns of microbial (fungal and bacterial) assemblages deposited in precipitation.   2. Characterize microbial populations collected from precipitation events.      3. Quantify the concentration and nature of cells and warm temperature ice nucleators.   4.  Identify variations of genes allowing IN in environmental samples and in bacteria cultured from the same samples.    5.  Establish an extensive education and outreach program that highlights the importance of biological ice nucleators in the environment.    Our project has successfully addressed these goals, and under these auspices has made a number of important scientific contributions.  Further, the project has strengthened the potential STEM workforce in the US through the development of undergraduate and graduate researchers and supplementary projects.     1. A large number of precipitation samples were collected for both  standalone regional (Virginia, Louisiana and Idaho) summaries and joint studies of these locations.  One joint summary, currently being prepared for publication, considers 71 precipitation events across at all three sites across all four seasons.  Regional RAINS projects considering other samples have been broadly disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and public symposia.   2. Microbial populations from precipitation events have been characterized using laboratory and analytical protocols developed specifically for the project.  This work has led to eight peer-reviewed publications, and at least ten posters and presentations.  Other findings are currently being prepared for peer review and dissemination.   3. and 4. Much of the work considering quantification of IN concentrations in precipitation has been conducted at participating RAINS institutions (Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Florida State and Louisiana State University).  ISU, however, has reported several major associated findings, including the ability of moss (Polytrichum commune) spores to nucleate ice. See: Weber, C. F.  2016.  Polytrichum commune spores nucleate ice and associated microorganisms increase the temperature of ice nucleation activity onset.  Aerobiologia 32: 353-361.   5. We established an extensive IN education and outreach program.  In part this involved collaborations with an NSF-funded project, AMOEBA (Authentic Mentoring Of Engaged Biologists Alliance; NSF DUE 1140286), at ISU.  We have also developed specific approaches and pedagogic tools for presenting IN materials.   This work has resulted in a large number of student led presentations at regional and national meetings and publications in peer-reviewed journals. For instance, see: Weber, C.F. and J.T.
