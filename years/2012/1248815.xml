<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to establish the foundation for developing a computation-assisted redistricting product. Redistricting or zoning is the process of dividing space into districts or zones while optimizing a set of criteria under various spatial constraints. Redistricting is an extremely challenging task that is commonly needed in many real-world problems, such as political/school redistricting, emergency zone design, service management, and business planning. Existing redistricting tools in the commercial market all employ a manual approach, which relies on the user to optimize various criteria in a trial-and-error manner. These manual tools are ineffective and extremely time-consuming to use. This project will build a prototype redistricting product based on a newly developed redistricting optimization algorithm and visual controls, which is much faster and more superior in optimization quality than existing algorithms, and for the first time offers the potential to meet end user requirements in an automated or semi-automated manner. The proposed project will (1) design a flexible architecture to systematically integrate a variety of optimization criteria in the new algorithm to address different needs; (2) significantly improve the computational scalability for handling large data set; and (3) evaluate the prototype product with real-world applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it could fundamentally change the way redistricting is performed in practice. Existing automated redistricting methods reported in academia do not meet practical needs, which is the reason that there is no product in the market that employs automated methods. With existing commercial tools, which are based on a manual approach, completing a redistricting task usually requires one or more full-time technicians working for months at a time. With the product being created from this project, even a non-technical user may generate a professional plan within minutes. Potential clients include governments (cities and counties), school districts, consulting firms who provide redistricting services, private businesses that need to optimize service delivery, and even general citizens who are interested in participating in redistricting decision making. The product targets the U.S. and international market, including both public and private sectors.</AbstractNarration>

Major outcomes of the project include:  Designed a flexible and open architecture to integrate a variety of redistricting criteria and constraints in the optimization algorithm and system. This design enables the product to meet various needs in different markets and reach the broadest customer base while minimizing the cost in maintaining product lines.  Improved the computational scalability of the redistricting optimization algorithm to handle large datasets. Developed a prototype service-oriented redistricting API (Application Programming Interface) and tested it on a cloud-based platform, aiming to provide a cloud-based SaaS (Software as a Service) in the future.  Integrated site selection algorithm in the redistricting system to facilitate decision making in adding new sites or closing existing sites, such as opening new schools or closing an existing school for a school redistricting project. Evaluated the prototype products with real-world applications and gained in-depth understanding of several niche markets.   The research results, developed prototype products, and preliminary commercialization success in the Phase I project have shown strong evidence that the proposed innovation and products are technically feasible and commercially viable.
