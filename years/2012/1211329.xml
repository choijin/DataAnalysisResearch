<AbstractNarration>Dr. Eisner and his team plan to use the Large Binocular Telescope to do mid-infrared narrow-band imaging and low-resolution spectroscopy of planetary systems in their early stages of formation. They will train two graduate students and do public outreach with two demographic groups: children and older residents. Planet formation is of fundamental importance to astrophysics and imaging infant planets and obtaining basic spectral information provides critical constraints on the early stages of planet formation and evolution. The location, brightness, and physical parameters derived from these observations will inform models of planetary formation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Understanding planet formation can inform theories of the origins of our own planetary system and the many, varied, exoplanetary systems that have been recently discovered.  In this program, our primary goal was to develop techniques that capitalize on the capabilities of the largest telescopes available to astronomers, to image planet formation in action.  In addition, we aimed to learn more about the propeties of planets by characterizing basic physical parameters of objects we discovered.  We began the work for this program by characterizing the observing system we intended to use: non-redundant masking interferometry.  We used this technique at both the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) and Magellan.  Our team first used Magellan data to investigate a proposed young protoplanet, and we ruled out the existence of a planet in this case.  We then used the LBT to study the LkCa 15 system, and discovered a system of three orbiting exoplanets.  The luminosites of these objects, and a direct signature of accretion seen in one, indicate these are still forming.  While following up this system, refining the orbits and monitoring for varaibility, we also observed a number of other young stars and planetary-mass objects.  Two graduate students were trained duing this program.  Stephanie Sallum, who led many of the scientific papers, graduated from the University of Arizona in 2017.  Jordan Stone, who led a study to characterize the atmospheric properties of planetary-mass objects, graduated in 2015.  Both used the skills they acquired during this work to move into independent postdoctoral positions.  The research results were incorporated into educational activities at the university level, and for younger, elementary-school students.  In addition, results were publicized widely in scientific publications and in the popular press.         Last Modified: 03/02/2018       Submitted by: Joshua A Eisner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
