<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to develop analytical and computational decision support tools to effectively manage the maintenance activities of wind energy systems.  Degradation-based reliability models, based on specialized diffusion processes, will be developed to explicitly account for the influence of randomly-varying environment conditions on critical wind turbine components, condition-monitoring systems, and time- or weather-constrained maintenance scheduling. Subsequently, stochastic optimization models will be developed to minimize operating and maintenance costs over the life cycle of a wind turbine by adaptively scheduling maintenance activities under uncertain conditions.  The analytical tools will:  (1) determine the optimal timing of inspections, repairs or replacements; (2) prioritize service activities during scheduled outages; (3) determine which spare parts to order and when; and (4) decide how operating and environmental data should be used to assess the current and future health of critical wind turbine components.  Specialized Markov decision process (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) models with mixed (discrete and continuous) state spaces will be developed along with their associated solution techniques.  The developed degradation-based reliability models will be validated using real wind turbine operating data, and the long-run average maintenance costs obtained using the optimization models will be compared with those of a computer simulation model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the operation and maintenance of wind energy systems that will soon supply a significant portion of electric power in the United States. A large fraction of the cost of producing wind energy is directly attributable to operating and maintenance costs stemming from scheduled and unscheduled maintenance activities.  The primary goal of this work is to provide techniques that better manage environmental and wind turbine data to make cost-effective decisions about maintenance activities.  Reducing the cost of wind energy will accelerate the design, analysis and installation of new land-based and offshore wind turbines.  Increasing the share of electricity generated by wind resources will help stabilize energy prices, mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases and substantially reduce the nation's dependence on foreign natural resources.  Furthermore, the development of a viable wind energy market will help stimulate the U.S. economy by creating jobs directly related to wind energy including turbine manufacturing and installation, as well as permanent jobs for wind turbine operators and maintenance workers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary outcomes of this project are analytical and computational decision support tools to effectively manage the maintenance activities of wind energy systems.  These tools were created to reduce the long-run operating and maintenance costs of wind turbines -- the primary contributors to the total cost of wind energy.  Developed were novel degradation-based reliability models that explicitly account for the influence of randomly varying environment conditions on critical wind turbine components.  These data-driven models include switching diffusion models, as well as those that incorporate damage-inducing shocks.  Subsequently, stochastic optimization models were developed to minimize operating and maintenance costs over the life cycle of a wind turbine by adaptively scheduling critical component replacements.  These models determine the optimal timing of replacements and decide how operational and environmental data should be used to assess the current and future health of critical wind turbine components.  Specialized Markov decision process (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) models with mixed (discrete and continuous) state spaces were developed along with computationally efficient solution techniques.  Many of these models, and their expected cost savings, were illustrated using real wind turbine operating data.  Finally, more advanced models were devised to examine wind farms in which the turbines operate in close proximity to one another and are influenced by a shared exogenous environment.  Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) techniques were developed to analyze these models, which revealed insightful structured replacement policies that exploit economies of scale to reduce maintenance costs.   The outcomes of this project can be used immediately to reduce maintenance costs for wind energy systems.  It is well known that a large portion of the cost of producing wind energy is directly attributable to operating and maintenance costs stemming from scheduled and unscheduled maintenance activities.  This project provides techniques that better manage environmental and wind turbine data to make cost-effective decisions related to maintenance activities.  Reducing the cost of wind energy will likely accelerate the installation of new land-based and offshore wind farms.  Increasing the share of electricity generated by wind resources will help stabilize energy prices, mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases and substantially reduce the nation's dependence on foreign natural resources.  Furthermore, the development of a viable wind energy market will help stimulate the U.S. economy by creating jobs directly related to wind energy, including turbine manufacturing and installation, as well as permanent jobs for wind turbine operators and maintenance workers.
