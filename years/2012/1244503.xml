<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Materials Education Symposium to be held at the 2012 Materials Research Society (MRS) Fall Meeting in Boston, MA, November 26-30, 2012.  Topics covered typically include advancing knowledge and understanding on crosscutting issues critical to all levels of materials education audiences (K-12 students, undergraduate students, graduate students, teachers/professors, informal/public audiences). This year?s symposium will also included an emphasis on communicating social relevancy of materials focused research and education activities to the general public. Participants will include academicians, scientists, students, journalists and media personnel.</AbstractNarration>
