<AbstractNarration>Remarkable things can be achieved by harnessing power of the masses. By breaking down tasks and distributing to users, "crowdsourcing" systems can accomplish complex tasks such as translating books or creating 3D photo tours.  Unfortunately, the opposite also holds: misuse of these systems creates powerful tools that can compromise the security of online communities, since today's security mechanisms focus on defending against automated scripts and fake accounts, but not real users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a malicious crowdsourcing system, customers initiate campaigns, and workers are paid for tasks such as creating Facebook accounts, posting fake Yelp reviews, or starting rumors on Twitter, with results indistinguishable from those of normal users. This type of malicious activity is called crowdturfing, because of its similarity to both crowd-sourcing systems and "astroturfing." The PIs have already found example sites today, and early measurements show some that generate over $1Million in annual revenue, while growing exponentially in users and revenue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies crowdturfing systems in detail via measurements and experiments, and use those results to develop robust defenses against them. Measurements and interviews will be used to study their support structure and incentives; develop endhost-based techniques to mark their results and economic solutions that reduce incentives for customers and workers; and build effective detection systems that identify crowdturfing in different domains using per-user behavioral models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work can change the way we view security in online communities, and its results can guide the deployment of new protection mechanisms that target crowdsourced fake user accounts and activities.</AbstractNarration>

Crowdturfing occurs when an attacker pays a group of Internet users to carry out malicious campaigns. Because tasks are performed by intelligent individuals, these attacks are undetectable by normal measures designed to block automated software, such as CAPTCHAs. The results of these tasks, including fake blogs, slanderous reviews, fake social network accounts, are often indistinguishable from the real thing. The project was organized around measuring, disrupting, and detecting output of crowdturfing systems.</span>&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The result of our study greatly exceeded our initial goals.&nbsp;</span>First, we performed an empirical study on the performance of machine learning in detecting malicious crowdsourcing activity. We extract records of 20,416 crowdturfing campaigns (1,012,923 tasks) published on confirmed crowdturfing sites over the last 3 years. We then extract a 28,947 Sina Weibo accounts belonging to crowdturfing workers. We analyze distinguishing features of these accounts, and build detectors using multiple ML models. We show that traditional ML techniques are accurate (95%&ndash;99%) in detection but can be highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, including simple evasion attacks (workers modify their behavior) and powerful poisoning attacks (where administrators tamper with the training set). This work was one of the first to look at adversarial ML attacks at scale, and was published at 23rd USENIX Security Symposium. It was featured by media sites such as MIT Technology Review Magazine.&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Second, we studied the potential of attacks involving automated software scripts masquerading as mobile devices. We identify general techniques whereby an attacker can eavesdrop on the service APIs used between a mobile app and its server, and use that knowledge to build lightweight scripts that fully emulate that app running on a mobile device. The result is that the attacker can create a highly scalable army of &ldquo;Sybil devices&rdquo; with which they can control and manipulate the app&rsquo;s user community for their gain. We use as our case study Waze, a real-time crowdsourced map subsidiary of Google that provides timely updates on traffic, congestion, accidents and points of interest.&nbsp; We demonstrate how software-based Sybil devices allow a single attacker with limited resources to create fake traffic events, as well as track the precise GPS-level real-time locations of thousands of users without detection. This was published at the ACM Mobisys 2016, and received significant coverage by more than 50 newspapers, TV channels and magazines around the world. Following the paper, we worked directly with Wave/Google to modify their app to improve their security and defense against these attacks.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Third, we extend our analysis on crowdsourcing systems to crowdsourced investment services. Specifically, we study the problem of evaluating and identifying experts in the context of SeekingAlpha and StockTwits, crowdsourced investment services. We sought to understand the quality and impact of collaborative investment platforms by empirically analyzing complete datasets of SeekingAlpha articles (9 years) and StockTwits messages (4 years). We show that in aggregate, SeekingAlpha articles and StockTwits messages provide minimal correlation to stock performance, but a small subset of experts contribute more valuable (predictive) content. We show that these authors can be easily identified by user interactions, and investments using their analysis significantly outperform broader markets. This was published at ACM conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) 2015.</span></p> <p class="p2">Fourth,&nbsp; we extended our analysis on crowdsourcing systems to Anonymous Social Networks, a new wave of privacy-preserving communication and social networking tools. Our analysis focuses on Whisper, a popular anonymous social network with more than 3 billion page views per month.&nbsp; We use a complete 3-month trace of Whisper covering 24 million whispers written by more than 1 million users. We seek to understand how anonymity and the lack of social links affect user behavior. We analyze structure of user interactions in absence of persistent social links, user engagement and network stickiness over time, and content moderation in network with minimal user accountability. This was published at SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC).&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, in collaboration with Whisper, we performed a detailed analysis on the statistical behavior of Whisper users. We built an unsupervised system to capture dominating user behaviors from clickstream data (traces of users' click events), and visualize the detected behaviors in an intuitive manner. Our system identifies ``clusters'' of similar users by partitioning a similarity graph (nodes are users; edges are weighted by clickstream similarity). The partitioning process leverages iterative feature pruning to capture the natural hierarchy within user clusters and produce intuitive features for visualizing and understanding user behaviors. Our system effectively identifies previously unknown behaviors, and showed people can easily interpret identified behaviors using our visualization tool. This was published as a full paper at the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), the premier conference in human and computer interaction.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/02/2017<br>      Modified by: Ben&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Zhao</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224100/1224100_10206971_1486029673280_user-model--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224100/1224100_10206971_1486029673280_user-model--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hierarchical User Behavior Model from Whisper"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224100/1224100_10206971_1486029673280_user-model--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hierarchical User Behavior Model from Whisper"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Visualization of hierarchical clusters of users classified by behavioral similarity, using clickstream data from Whisper.</div> <div class="imageCredit">UCSB SAND Lab</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ben&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Zhao</div> <div class="imageTitle">Hierarchical User Behavior Model from Whisper</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224100/1224100_10206971_1486029281042_waze-tracking--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224100/1224100_10206971_1486029281042_waze-tracking--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tracking a Waze user in LA"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224100/1224100_10206971_1486029281042_waze-tracking--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tracking a Waze user in LA"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Results of our attack tracking one  of the paper coauthors through high density traffic on freeways in Los Angeles.</div> <div class="imageCredit">UCSB SAND Lab</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ben&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Zhao</div> <div class="imageTitle">Tracking a Waze user in LA</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224100/1224100_10206971_1486029561356_seekingalpha-stock--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224100/1224100_10206971_1486029561356_seekingalpha-stock--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Indirect Crowdsourced Trading Strategy vs S&amp;P 500"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224100/1224100_10206971_1486029561356_seekingalpha-stock--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Indirect Crowdsourced Trading Strategy vs S&amp;P 500"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Our indirect wisdom of the crowds trading strategy significantly outperforming the S&P 500 market index over 8 years.</div> <div class="imageCredit">UCSB SAND Lab</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ben&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Zhao</div> <div class="imageTitle">Indirect Crowdsourced Trading Strategy vs S&P 500</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224100/1224100_10206971_1486029120910_waze-redirect--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224100/1224100_10206971_1486029120910_waze-redirect--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Redirecting Waze Traffic"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224100/1224100_10206971_1486029120910_waze-redirect--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Redirecting Waze Traffic"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Impact of fake congestion redirecting Waze user routes.</div> <div class="imageCredit">UCSB SAND Lab</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ben&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Zhao</div> <div class="imageTitle">Redirecting Waze Traffic</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
