<AbstractNarration>The proposed research, involving stochastic differential equation models, aims at the analysis of ultra high-frequency data (UHF), which are marked point process (MPP) observations. It has an array of applications in finance, and stochastic control and filtering. With harnessing newly available Graphics Processing Units (GPU) supercomputing power in mind and targeting benchmark stochastic volatility and Levy models, the first objective is to develop new uniformly consistent recursive algorithms via Bayesian Inference via Filtering Equations (BIFE) for propagating and updating joint conditional measures such as joint posterior distributions. The new recursive algorithms, which numerically solve the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), are suitable for GPU computing, because the algorithms can not only be parallelized for computation, but also be partitioned for memory storage in each CPU. Moreover, the new algorithms provide additional many-fold increase in computing power due to the advantage of implicit methods over explicit methods. Combining GPU computing and gains from advances in numerical algorithms, this project carries out real-time tracking of stochastic volatility and real-time Bayesian model selections over sophisticated benchmark financial models for streaming UHF data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronic trading in all major world financial markets has routinely generated streams of UHF data. UHF data have spurred interest in empirical market microstructure and present new and interesting challenges that are essential to comprehend market microstructure, to monitor and regulate markets, and to conduct risk management. Theoretical, computational, and implementation issues for the estimation and applications of these models will be investigated. This project trains interdisciplinary Ph.D students with co-disciplines in Economics, develops a new graduate course, and produces a research monograph on this topic. The PI works closely with both undergraduate and graduate students, creates illustrative and research data sets, and develops publicly available software.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the year in which I was the PI on this grant, I submitted one article on approximating drift and minorization coefficients for a particular Markov chain, as well as another article on Bayesian approaches to detecting disease markers along the genome.  The article on Markov chains gives an approach to approximating the mixing time that does not require the use of output-based convergence diagnostic methods.  This method was shown to work well for several common types of Markov processes, and it is clear how this approach can be extended to other situations that rely on the use of Markov processes.  As an application, I showed the effectiveness of this approach in situations involving detection of quantitative trait loci along the human genome.  The methods I developed to do this rely heavily on the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and as a result, it is important to have a sense of how long those algorithms take to approach their stationary distribution.  The method of bounding mixing times for Markov processes is widely applicable, and can be used to examine convergence of partially observed Markov processes.  This is a valuable contribution to statistics as the output-based methods of convergence assessment can rely heavily on initial values.  The developed method avoids this issue.  Furthermore, I was able to support a PhD student at the University of Missouri--Kansas City who is doing similar work to what I do, specifically in the biological sciences.  She is preparing to submit two manuscripts related to her work in this area, and she has also presented her results at the Joint Statistical Meetings 2018 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
