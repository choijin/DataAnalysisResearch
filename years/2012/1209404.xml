<AbstractNarration>The Weather Ready Nation Workshop is a 3-day workshop to be held in Norman, OK&lt;br/&gt;December 13-15, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit &lt;br/&gt;This effort is pertinent to maximization of two-way learning and knowledge sharing that is cross-disciplinary across the weather enterprise and stakeholder community.  This includes input from the emergency management community, educators, health and safety experts, engineers, physical and social scientists, planners and responders, government agencies and officials at the Federal, state and local levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will promote science to meet the needs of society and our nation for predicting, mitigating, and preventing severe storm and tornado hazards.  The expected outcomes are:&lt;br/&gt;1) Identifying, prioritizing, and setting in motion actions to improve the nation's resiliency against tornadoes and other severe weather&lt;br/&gt;2) Identifying advancements in longer term outlooks and forecasts and their links to preparedness&lt;br/&gt;3) Identifying advancements in short-term forecasts, watches and warnings and their links to responses&lt;br/&gt;4) Outlining and initiating end-to-end pilot projects within the stakeholder communities to improve the nation's resiliency to tornadoes and other severe weather.  Ensuring these activities are mapped into the existing approved National Weather Service pilot projects.&lt;br/&gt;5) Identifying scientific and technological opportunities and promoting innovation to advance the end-to-end process from observations and severe storm detection, to storm scale predictive modeling, to collaborative interactions with users in preparedness, the provisions of warnings and forecasts, and response and recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UCAR's (University Corporation For Atmospheric Research) Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS) will use funding provided by the National Science Foundation for support of the workshop to provide full travel support for approximately 15 attendees.</AbstractNarration>

The over arching goal of this dialog was to identify, prioritize, and set in motion actions to enhance our nationÆs preparedness and resilience for severe weather, especially tornadoes, so that fewer American lives are lost and the nationÆs economy made more secure. This said, a Weather Ready Nation needs to be ready for weather in all of its forms.  Participants were first grouped into "Communities" of expertise: communications, emergency decision makers, operations, physical scientists, policy specialists, risk management and community resiliency, and senior management.

The diversity of participation within the Cross Cut sessions produced a set of themes which were used to inform the community groups as they reconvened during the final sessions of the symposium.  The following themes emerged from the Cross Cut Sessions:  Strongly integrate social and physical science into the future end?to?end weather forecast and warning process &ndash; from research to operations. All breakout groups indicated public understanding of warnings and their perceptions of risk are important gaps, and recommended early and more effective integration of social science in warning policy, plans, and programs. The issue of perception of risk may be especially important.  Carefully review warning false alarms to determine physical science improvements and other strategies that can be used to reduce false alarms without decreasing threat detection and warning lead?time. Breakout groups expressed concern that public responsiveness is negatively affected by a perception that too many warnings are false alarms.  Assess and update warning dissemination strategies. New wireless technologies afford a great opportunity to improve the speed and effectiveness of severe weather warnings.
