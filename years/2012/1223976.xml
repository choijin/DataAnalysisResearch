<AbstractNarration>Technical description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Redox reactions are the driving force behind the mobilization and geochemical (and biogeochemical) cycling of As, Cr, and Se at the Earth's surface. The kinetics of these reactions are known to be catalyzed by sulfide and oxide mineral surfaces based on the development of empirically derived rate laws from macroscale experiments, but the actual reaction mechanisms (occurring at the nanoscale) are far from being understood. Previous studies by the Principle Investigators have demonstrated the importance of processes such as proximity effects, spintransitions, and oxygen dissociation to control the rate of redox reactions. This project will attempt to quantify these atomic scale processes in the context of the known rate laws, thereby  linking the macroscale observables with the nanoscale processes that may be rate limiting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strength of the U. of M. and Dartmouth College approach is their unique combination of molecular simulations (quantum mechanical to account for charge and electron spin transfer), electrochemical methods, and surface probe techniques to describe surface-mediated redox mechanisms and to resolve individual rate-determining steps. Molecular simulations will predict possible activated states that can occur between co-adsorbates on the surface and give insight into the reaction mechanism itself, especially steps that may be rate limiting, such as spin transfer, ligand reorganization, bond breaking, or mass transport (to name a few). Microelectrode techniques that have not traditionally been applied to study environmental reactions will be used to rapidly evaluate surface-specific mechanisms and kinetics in multivariable space. Finally, redox-dependent scanning probe microscopy will allow to observe these processes in situ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is a necessary "transition state" for the development of more comprehensive kinetic redox models in the future that will include bacterially-mediated redox processes, biomineralization, and the role of sulfide and oxide mineral surfaces as templates for the formation of complex organic molecules (i.e., precursors for origin of life).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader significance and importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Answering the aforementioned questions has profound implications for understanding the geochemical cycling of toxic elements and, maybe most importantly in this regard, provides a necessary foundation for future investigations on microbe-mineral interfaces. The results of this study will be important to the engineer developing permeable reactive barriers to immobilize toxic elements or to the geoscientist developing predictive models to describe the mobility of these species in the near-surface environment. The potential implications for technology development are widespread, including heterogeneous catalysts, chemical sensors, anti-corrosion processes, and photovoltaics, to name a few.</AbstractNarration>

In the aqueous environments, As exists as both arsenate (As(V))  and arsenite (As(III)) species. However, these two forms exhibit different toxicity levels, and As(V) is typically considered to be more toxic than the As(III) species. There are several processes which release As into the environment.

Although semi-conducting minerals, for instance, pyrite and mackinawite surfaces were reported to reduce the surface adsorbed As(V) species into As(III), the work supported by this grant has helped to identify the reduction mechanism at a molecular level. As one project of this grant, adsorption of As(OH)3 on iron sulfide mineral surfaces (pyrite, mackinawite; while pyrite, aka "foolÆs gold" forms decent crystals that can be found in mineral shops and museums, the layered mackinawite only forms microscopic crystals, often responsible for the dark color of reducing sediments and highly important in controlling redox reactions) was studied using quantum-mechanical calculations. Adsorption of environmentally important arsenic compounds, for instance, dimethylarsinic acid and arsenate ion onto hydrated iron-oxide mineral surfaces was studied using quantum-mechanical approaches. The second toxic element considered in this grant, Cr(VI) (also known as hexavalent chromium; see the movie "Erin Brokovich") exists as a chromate (CrO4)2&ndash; anion and is considered as a severe carcinogenic agent; in contrast, the other most common oxidation state of Cr is +3, which is not toxic and much less mobile. The reduction process of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is a complicated and it involves several intermediates and different one or two-electron reduction sub-processes.

Here, we study the interaction of Se(VI), the most stable oxidation state, in this oxidation state, Se(VI) exists as an anionic oxo species, SeO42&ndash;. So far, we have mainly employed electrochemical methods to study the redox behavior and interaction of selenium with mineral surfaces. Understanding the redox behavior, precipitation, and degradation mechanisms of toxic species, for instance, As(V), Cr(VI), and Se(VI), on environmentally abundant mineral surfaces such as iron-sulfide minerals (pyrite and mackinawite), helps us to take necessary precautionary actions to prevent the mobility of these hazardous species into geosphere and environmental effects are essentially minimized.
