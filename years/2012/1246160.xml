<AbstractNarration>Mesoscale processes (~ length scales of up to 100km) are an essential ingredient of the coupling between the waters of the Antarctic margins and the greater Southern Ocean, yet there is a paucity of observations at these space and time scales. The tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is a unique and dynamic environment, and it is of interest to understand how the interaction of large currents with local topographic features and the coupling between physical and biogeochemical processes lead to the transformation of low productivity Antarctic Surface Water (ASW) to high productivity ASW in this region, following admixture with Weddell Sea eddies. By combining high resolution in situ ocean glider observations with remotely-sensed properties of the surface flow, as well as long-term historical data sets, these investigators will infer long-term changes in the frontal structure and mixed layer dynamics of the ACC. The project involves monitoring the fronts in southern Drake Passage over a period of 15 weeks by deploying and piloting a pair of ocean gliders that will collect approximately 1000 profiles of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, fluorescence and optical backscatter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mesoscale variability in southern Drake Passage influences at least three aspects of Earth?s climate system: the Southern Ocean?s meridional overturning circulation (MOC), air-sea exchange of CO2 and the productivity of the Southern Ocean ecosystems. These processes are of importance to simulating Earth?s climate, and thus to society in general</AbstractNarration>

(200-800 words)  Federal Award ID: OPP-1246160  Award Title: Collaborative Research: Boundary Current Control of Upwelling in Southern Drake Passage: Whither Weddies?  Report Submission Period: 07/01/2013 - 06/30/2018     The tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is a unique and dynamic environment that has experienced different trends in air and ocean temperatures and sea ice growth compared to other regions along the continental margin of the Antarctic continent. These trends in physical parameters have led to distinct patterns in the biological productivity and ecosystems within the marginal shelf waters of the Antarctic Peninsula.  Still, we do not yet fully understand how the coupling of ocean dynamics with biogeochemical processes, and the interaction of the large-scale offshore Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) with these shelf seas and basins, can lead to the observed trends.     A major focus of the project was to observe and characterize the southern Drake Passage region by combining high-resolution in situ autonomous ocean glider observations with remotely-sensed properties of the surface flow and existing long-term historical data sets. These observations along with model output are used to quantify the dominant spatial and temporal scales of variability in physical and biochemical tracers in this region as well as the physical mechanisms that give rise to it.     To address our goals, we continuously monitored the fronts in southern Drake Passage from December 2014 through May 2015 by deploying and piloting a pair of ocean gliders that collected approximately 1400 profiles of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, fluorescence and optical backscatter to around 1000 m depth. Multiple reoccupations of the two transects across the continental slope allowed tracking of the southern ACC fronts with unprecedented resolution and permitted direct calculation of cross-shelf eddy fluxes of heat and salinity. The glider data provided key insights into the physical processes that control upwelling and ventilation along the southern boundary of the ACC in Drake Passage.     We observed surface and deep sub-surface chlorophyll maxima in southern Drake Passage that lay well below the euphotic light zone. The productive layers are trapped subsurface when successive summer heating of the surface layer occurs. Eddy interactions between the offshore waters and the shelf waters can transport these deep chlorophyll rich waters between the two regimes. This represents an export of nutrients and properties not observed by surface satellite measurements that may contribute significantly to biological uptake in this region.     The high-resolution glider measurements enabled us to detect and examine the frontal structure in this region with unprecedented resolution and precision, not possible from satellite or other in situ data sets.
