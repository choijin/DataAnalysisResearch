<AbstractNarration>The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) will take place just before the flagship programming language conference, Principles of Programming Languages (POPL 2013), which is being held in Rome Italy. This grant will support 15 or more students to attend the PLMW event plus the POPL conference. While there is other funding available, this grant is intended specifically to increase the numbers of students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents. The broader impacts of the grant relate to the need to broaden participation, provide opportunities for students to receive mentoring from top members of the programming languages community, and build the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this important research arena.</AbstractNarration>
