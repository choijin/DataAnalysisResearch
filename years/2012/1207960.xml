<AbstractNarration>This award will support NSF funded research programs by providing a safe platform for studies conducted primarily on the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico.  This proposal covers year 1 of a 5-year cooperative agreement, from January through December 2012.  Funding will be re-negotiated each year and will be dependent upon the number of days at sea in support of NSF funded research.  In 2012, 69  operational-sea days out of 112 are funded by NSF.  The intellectual merit of the proposal lies in the peer-reviewed proposals from the science sections that have been funded.  Cape Hatteras is in compliance with USCG, University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) regulations and is owned by the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The R/V Cape Hatteras was built in 1981, owned by the National Science Foundation, operated by the Duke/UNC Oceanographic Consortium, managed by Duke University and scheduled by the University National Oceanographic Labortory System (UNOLS) from the time of vessel construction until the vessel was sold.  The R/V Cape Hatteras home port was the Duke University Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, North Carolina.  Her areas of operation were the North American East Coast from Nova Scotia to the Caribbean.  She was operated primarily as a Regional Zone Research Vessel.  The R/V Cape Hatteras was sold on March 3, 2013.  There are no outcomes, scientific findings or R/V Cape Hatteras operational expenditures to report during the award period, 4/1/2012 and 3/31/2019.  Proceeds from the sale of the R/V Cape Hatteras were for outfitting a 30' Safeboat (R/V RT Barber), procurement of oceanographic scientific equipment for the R/V RT Barber and support of outreach programs.  Reports on the R/V RT Barber operations and programmatic expenditures were sent to the NSF Program Manager every 6 months.  A no cost extension and revised proposal / re-budget for R/V RT Barber sea days, oceanographic equipment, and support of marine debris and water quality outreach programming were approved January 2017 and August 2018.
