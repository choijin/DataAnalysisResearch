<AbstractNarration>This research bridges the gap between manufacturing capability of current technology and the need to manufacture flexible, netshape gradient silica aerogel articles. Potential uses for these porous gel materials include insulation for cryogenic fuel tanks, for example, or filtration media for removal of particulates or volatile organic compounds from air. The fundamental mechanisms of aerogel reinforcement by hybrid molecules and conformal coating of polymer crosslinks are investigated with the ultimate aim to manufacture stronger silica aerogel articles with negligible changes in density and porosity and strong control of hydrophobicity. This research utilizes a novel method for homogeneous reinforcement of aerogels using chemical reactions between small, optimal quantities of molecularly mixed, very small (approximately 1 nanometer) size hybrid organic-inorganic molecules or silane-endcapped polyurethanes with the silica particles.  The research also develops a new ?one-pot? manufacturing method for aerogel articles of complicated shapes; the steps of gelation, chemical reinforcement, and drying are all carried out sequentially in the same mold to dramatically reduce the manufacturing time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research are expected to yield understanding of manufacturing of complex shapes of mesoporous, netshape aerogel specimens with gradients of density, porosity and surface energy. Given the large investment in research on aerogels and significant development of understanding of chemistry of aerogel reinforcement in batch processes over the past decade, this systematic program dissecting the source of structure and property generation in aerogel system will benefit a wide range of scientists and engineers in the field. It is anticipated that several derivatives of the proposed research work will be soon developed by other researchers to accommodate inorganic aerogels derived from alumina or organic aerogels derived from polymeric sources. Several outreach functions will be carried out in this research to attract minority and female students to STEM education.</AbstractNarration>
