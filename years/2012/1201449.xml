<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1201449&lt;br/&gt;Cook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalysis is a key technology for improving the quality of life while simultaneously reducing the adverse impact of human activities on the environment.  The discovery of new catalytic processes and the improvement of existing ones have a major economic impact on our nation.  It is estimated that 80% of the products of modern society go through a catalytic process at some point in their manufacture.  Catalysis is also critically important for securing the nation?s energy supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests support for the 2012 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Catalysis.  The conference, which will be held at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire, on June 24?29, 2012, will bring together leading researchers from around the world to discuss their latest, most exciting work in catalysis and future directions for the field.  The meeting sessions that will take place are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Catalysis: New Advances and Applications&lt;br/&gt;2) Advances in Surface Science and Characterization&lt;br/&gt;3) Advances in Theory and its Application to Catalysis&lt;br/&gt;4) Perspectives on Catalytic Mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;5) Organometallic Catalytic Systems: Homogeneous to Heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;6) Closing the Pressure Gap, Fundamentals to Application&lt;br/&gt;7) Advances in Photocatalysis&lt;br/&gt;8) New Frontiers in Catalysis in Energy Systems&lt;br/&gt;9) Catalysis: Impact and Future Directions.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;A special effort will be made to support early career scientists who otherwise would be unable to attend: junior faculty members, post-docs and graduate students, with special emphasis on promoting the participation of women and underrepresented groups.  Participation by early career catalytic researchers will add significant value to this conference and will foster communications among current and future leaders in a field that derives its vitality from the continuous interplay between academic and industrial research.  The setting of the conference helps keep participants on-site in order to maximize interactions, intellectual discourse and networking.</AbstractNarration>

In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.          Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
