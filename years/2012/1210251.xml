<AbstractNarration>This action funds Michael James Duchene of The University of Notre Dame to conduct a research project, entitled "Speeding up hurricane storm surge simulations on supercomputers" during the summer of 2012 at Tokyo Institute of Technology in Tokyo, Japan.  The host scientist is Takayuki Aoki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to improve large-scale hurricane storm surge simulations by utilizing the latest supercomputers equipped with GPUs (graphics processing units).  The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC-DG) model (www.adcirc.org) is more accurate than, but also has more overhead than, the continuous Galerkin (ADCIRC-CG) version of ADCIRC.  However, the localized nature of the DG method makes it suitable to parallelize for the supercomputers and GPUs, which would help reduce simulation times and allow for larger problems to be simulated, and all with better accuracy.  ADCIRC-DG represents the next-generation of hurricane storm surge models, and the ability to perform large-scale simulations promises to provide enhanced flood protection systems that could minimize negative environmental impact, and perhaps even be applied to real time forecasting as part of a safety warning systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided an international research experience at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in Tokyo, Japan.  There was a cultural exchange component of this project that was primarily fulfilled by working in one of the research laboratories at Tokyo Tech.  Integrating with the laboratory allowed for daily interaction with Japanese researchers and students, and even allowed for participation in regular lab meetings.  The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science was also able to provide a family homestay experience.  All of these interactions created opportunities to visit Japanese shrines, participate in traditional festivals, and experience traditional ceremonies.  The research component of the project uses the ADCIRC (www.adcirc.org) model on new supercomputer architectures for the application of simulating hurricane storm surge.  These new supercomputer architectures are a hybrid of traditional computer processors and new parallel processors.  The size/scale, and hence results, of hurricane storm surge simulation can be limited by the architecture of the system performing the simulation.  The performance characteristics of the new hybrid architectures needs to be studied to determine their applicability to improving the results of storm surge simulations.  Several simulations were run on the Tsubame 2.0 supercomputer at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in Tokyo, Japan.  The resolution of these simulations was varied from small to large and the number of processors used on the supercomputer was varied to obtain scaling and performance results.  These results will be used to evaluate the applicability of running ADCIRC on hybrid supercomputers.       Last Modified: 11/30/2012       Submitted by: Michael J Duchene]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
