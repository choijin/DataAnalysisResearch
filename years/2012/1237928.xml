<AbstractNarration>Funds from this award will be used to develop new tooth and skeletal indicators of mammal health that can be applied to fossil populations of mammals.  To do so, the association between overall health and the animal's anatomy will be documented using jaws collected over the past fifty years from a well-studied predator-prey pair, Isle Royale National Park gray wolf and moose, that are known to have suffered multiple food shortages.  Nutritional stress in predator and prey will be assessed based on quantifiable microscopic and macroscopic features of their teeth and skeletons.  The ability to see these indicators in fossils will then be tested on extinct bison from the Rancho La Brea tar seep deposits of California that are between 50,000 to 11,000 years old.  Assuming the method works, it can be used to infer relative population sizes of predator and prey in past communities, such as North America at the time of human arrival about 12,000 years ago.  If these prey animals show little evidence of food stress, then their population densities were low, probably due to intense predation by large predator carnivores.  Under these conditions, the arrival of human hunters would have been more likely to lead to the extinction of prey species than if they were at high densities.  Thus, this project can illuminate the possible role of humans in the late Pleistocene large mammal extinctions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Approximately two-thirds of North America&rsquo;s large mammals, including mammoths, horses, and camels, went extinct during the late Pleistocene The cause for this extinction has been debated for decades, with most authors favoring either human hunting or climate change.&nbsp; A critical piece of the puzzle concerns the nature of the ecosystem at the time that humans arrived. If late Pleistocene ungulate prey were already at low densities due to intense predation by carnivores, then the arrival of human hunters would have had a more profound impact than if ungulates were at high densities. However, it is very difficult to assess species densities in the fossil record using simple counts of fossil specimens. In our project, we developed a new methodology for assessing relative density of fossil and living ungulate populations using the record of nutritional stress preserved in teeth and bones. When population numbers increase dramatically in wild ungulates, competition for food intensifies, and individuals can exhibit evidence of nutritional stress in their teeth, such as reduced dental growth rates, heavy wear, dental crowding, and dental enamel defects (Fig. 1).&nbsp; To test this, we focused on three well-studied ungulates that are known to have experienced periods of both food shortages and food abundance: 1) moose (<em>Alces alces</em>) of Isle Royale National Park (IRNP), 2) elk (<em>Cervus canadensis</em>) of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, and 3) red deer (<em>Cervus elephas</em>) of the Isle of Rum, Scotland. These three populations have been studied for decades, and numerous skulls have been preserved over this time period, allowing us to examine hundreds of jaws and thousands of teeth from individuals that lived during times of food scarcity or plenty. In all three populations, we found visible evidence of food limitation in the tooth enamel but the prevalence of different types of defects was not the same in all three.&nbsp; Whereas the moose displayed a high frequency of enamel growth defects known as hypoplasias, the two species of <em>Cervus</em> did not, and instead, exhibited a greater frequency of teeth with poorly mineralized enamel and chipping (Fig. 2). These differences in the array of enamel defects probably reflect differences between the moose and <em>Cervus</em> in the timing of enamel formation.&nbsp; In moose calves, growth of enamel in multiple teeth is initiated prior to two major stressful events, weaning and their first winter. Consequently, enamel formation can be affected and disrupted by the combined effect of these stressful events and limited food. In contrast, most enamel formation begins after weaning and the first winter in <em>Cervus</em>, and thus is not affected by these events.&nbsp; Instead, food limitation is manifest in poor mineralization of the enamel. To better understand the impacts of nutritional stress on dental growth at a finer scale, we are currently developing an assay that relies on microscopic examination and quantification of incremental lines of growth in molar tooth roots. We expect to find that teeth grow more slowly during times of food scarcity.</p> <p>Our study of the association between food limitation and dental growth produced a set of indices, such as frequency of enamel hypoplasias, that can be quantified in the teeth of fossil ungulates and thereby infer their nutritional history and relative population density. We tested this in nine samples of North American Pleistocene and Holocene bison, moose, and elk.&nbsp; Enamel hypoplasias were found in all of the samples, but always at much lower frequencies than observed in the IRNP moose (Fig. 3). This suggests that food limitation was not seriously affecting these populations, and that their population densities were relatively low. Given this, the negative impact of late Pleistocene human hunters in North America could have been more significant than expected. &nbsp;Interestingly, there is an increase in the frequency of hypoplasias in Holocene versus Pleistocene bison, and this is consistent with a rise in the numbers of bison after the extinction of the megafauna. However, this needs to be confirmed with larger samples and with an assessment molar tooth root growth rates.</p> <p>Results from our dental growth studies have contributed to understanding how variations in environmental conditions affect dental growth in a population. We are the first to to document the impacts of food shortages on dental growth in wild ungulates and the first to show that differences in the timing of dental development might determine the distribution and kind of defects that form. As shown above, these results are immediately applicable to the study of fossil teeth, and open the door to new discoveries about the structure of past ecosystems as well as the impacts of humans on large herbivores and their predators. The research also provided educational opportunities for two graduate students (both female, one Filipina) and 3 undergraduates (2 females, 1 LGBT male), and thus has contributed to enhancing diversity in the sciences.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/24/2016<br>      Modified by: Blaire&nbsp;Van Valkenburgh</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1237928/1237928_10183630_1472076859748_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1237928/1237928_10183630_1472076859748_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1237928/1237928_10183630_1472076859748_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Relative frequency of enamel defects in the teeth of various Pleistocene, Holocene, and Recent populations of ungulates.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Caitlin Brown</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Blaire&nbsp;Van Valkenburgh</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1237928/1237928_10183630_1472076605266_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1237928/1237928_10183630_1472076605266_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1237928/1237928_10183630_1472076605266_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Relative frequency of enamel hypoplasias observed in the teeth of Isle Royale (IRNP) and mainland moose, yellowstone National Park elk (YNP) and red deer from the Isle of Rum (RUM).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Caitlin Brown</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Blaire&nbsp;Van Valkenburgh</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1237928/1237928_10183630_1472076360018_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1237928/1237928_10183630_1472076360018_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1237928/1237928_10183630_1472076360018_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Examples of enamel defects on Isle Royale National Park moose (Alces alces) teeth due to food limitation.
