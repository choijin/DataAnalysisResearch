<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) Origami Design for the Integration of Self-Assembling Systems for Engineering Innovation (ODISSEI) award is to develop methods to design origami structures that actively fold from an initially flat sheet to complex three-dimensional shapes in response to multiple fields (e.g., electric, thermal, magnetic). They will also actively unfold, in contrast to current origami structures that must be manually unfolded. These multi-field responsive origami shapes will be developed through collaboration with a visual artist and approximated and modeled using geometric modeling and &lt;br/&gt;origami mathematics. The artistically inspired shapes will provide targets for designing novel active compliant mechanisms, which along with predictive multi-scale modeling and multi-physics simulations, will guide the development of new active materials.  This new class of multi-field responsive materials includes micro- and nano-enabled hybrids where a graded distribution of particles enables coupling between multiple external fields to allow selective folding and unfolding along creases. A design optimization framework will be developed to integrate the modeling, design, and active materials efforts and enable system trade studies from the nano to the macro scale.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will foster novel concepts and design innovation in several application areas.  For example, origami-based surgical instruments will benefit minimally invasive surgery, where there is a need for mm-scale devices that can deploy inside the body to manipulate tissue.  Similarly, origami-based adaptive aircraft structures, reconfigurable robots, and deployable space structures will help enhance mission versatility.  A summer student exchange program and multi-university capstone design projects among Penn State, Rowan, and George Mason will help broaden participation of under-represented groups in engineering &lt;br/&gt;and STEM majors.  The research will also be leveraged to create interactive artistic pieces and K-12-targeted workshops for the Discovery Space Museum in State College, PA and Penn State's Palmer Museum of Art.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of this EFRI ODISSEI project was comprised of the development of modeling, design, and optimization methods for materials and structures specifically for self-folding origami.  A particular focus of our work was on multi-field actuation, where the self-folding structure responds to one or more stimuli.  For example, our team developed a bi-fold structure that folds in response to electric field, and then folds in an orthogonal direction in response to magnetic field.  We have developed new active materials as well as the underlying microstructure-based mechanics of these materials, which are then incorporated into predictive models.  The modeling efforts included continuum, rigid-body dynamic, and finite element-based approaches.  Finally, a design optimization framework was developed to systematically design these multi-field folding structures.  Potential applications range from large-scale deployable space structures to small-scale medical devices for treatment of abdominal cancer.  The broader impacts included development of 12 public programs focused on the interdisciplinary facets of the research.  We sought to help broaden participation in STEM by leading the development of outreach programs aimed at elementary school-age children.  For example, in collaboration with Discovery Space, a hands-on science museum for children in State College, PA, we developed origami-themed STEM modules for their summer camp for girls age 6-9.  The sessions included pre- and post-surveys to assess their impact on the children?s interest in STEM.  We also developed and led similar hands-on origami activities for the Palmer Museum of Art, Science U summer camps, and the Bennett Family Center kindergarten on the Penn State campus.
