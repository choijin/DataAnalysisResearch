<AbstractNarration>This research seeks to push the frontiers of coreference resolution research via achieving two objectives. First, it addresses the Winograd Schema Challenge by examining a class of difficult-to-resolve anaphors whose resolution requires commonsense knowledge involving the roles played by the participants in an event and their causal relationships. It adopts a deep text-understanding approach to this problem. Specifically, it ventures into unexplored areas of coreference research, including the use of script-like knowledge and sentiment analysis, as well as an examination of the role of discourse connectives. Second, it enables the acquisition of coreference resolvers for a substantially larger number of natural languages and domains than is currently possible. One of the major obstacles to the deployment of coreference technologies across a large number of languages and domains is the high cost associated with coreference-annotating data in a language and domain. It investigates two cost-effective approaches to data annotation, one involving translation-based projection and the other bootstrapping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As coreference is an enabling technology for many traditional and emerging text-processing applications, the project has the potential to improve these applications. Through the construction of a multi-lingual, multi-domain coreference resolver and the availability of annotated data produced in the course of this investigation, the project may stimulate research in under-studied languages and domains by a broader community of researchers. Equally importantly, the use of commonsense knowledge in the resolver mimics the human coreference resolution process, bringing artificial intelligence researchers one step closer to building an intelligent agent that can truly understand natural language.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to develop algorithms for advancing the state of the art in coreference resolution. We focused on three challenging coreference resolution tasks: entity coreference resolution, zero pronoun resolution, and event coreference resolution.   The first task, entity coreference resolution, involves determining which entity mentions in a text refer to the same real-world entity. Consider the following pair of sentences:  The city councilmen refused to give the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.  The city councilmen refused to give the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.  An entity coreference resolver should determine that the pronoun "they" in the first sentence is coreferent with "the city councilman", and that "they" in the second sentence is coreferent with the "the demonstrators".   We made the following contributions to entity coreference resolution:   1) We pioneered work on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), which concerns the resolution of "difficult" pronouns. The occurrences of the pronoun "they" in the two sentences above are examples of "difficult" pronouns whose resolution requires commonsense knowledge.   2) We developed a projection-based approach for performing entity coreference for resource-poor languages, enabling coreference technologies to be deployed to a larger set of natural languages than is currently possible.   3) We developed linguistically-aware coreference evaluation metrics, treating the entity mentions to be clustered as linguistic rather than generic objects and producing scores for systems that correspond more closely to our intuition of how useful their outputs are.  4) We developed a state-of-the-art coreference resolver for the biomedical domain.  5) We wrote a survey on entity coreference resolution, with the goal of providing researchers interested in this task an accessible overview of the state of the art.
