<AbstractNarration>Nitrate is a ubiquitous contaminant in polar snow whose concentrations in ice cores serve as a history of nitrogen oxide pollution in the atmosphere. It was once thought that nitrate deposited in snow was essentially inert, but a decade ago researchers in Greenland discovered that snow nitrate is broken down by sunlight to form products such as nitrogen oxides and nitrous acid. These species are emitted from the snow into the atmosphere, where they can significantly change atmospheric composition and chemistry. For example, nitrogen oxides from snow can lead to the formation of ozone in the lowest layers of the atmosphere, while nitrous acid is an important source of hydroxyl radical, a key oxidant that determines the lifetimes of atmospheric pollutants. There is significant uncertainty about the efficiency with which nitrate photodecomposition forms two of its products, nitrite and peroxynitrite. Studying the formation of these products is important because they are major sources of important atmospheric gases in polar regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed work is to quantify the formation of nitrite and peroxynitrite from illumination of nitrate in/on ice so that the budgets of reactive nitrogen and oxidants in the Arctic can be better constrained. The investigators would accomplish this goal by: (1) Measuring the efficiencies for nitrite and peroxynitrite formation during nitrate illumination in ice; (2) Characterizing the impacts of organic molecules, which are ubiquitous constituents in snow, on nitrite and peroxynitrite formation; (3) Examining whether yields of nitrite and peroxynitrite vary if nitrate is present in different locations in/on the ice; and (4) Using the results to calculate rates of nitrite and peroxynitrite formation from nitrate photolysis in Arctic snow. Overall, these results should significantly improve understanding of the chemistry of nitrogen oxides, ozone, and hydroxyl radical in the Arctic snowpack and should help clarify the impacts of nitrate reactions on the overlying atmospheric boundary layer. The work would be carried out using wellÂ­defined laboratory ice samples, a variety of analytical techniques, and simple numerical modeling to determine the impact of the results on the chemistry in the Arctic snowpack and atmosphere. Two graduate students and several undergraduate students will be trained and mentored through the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Although it was once thought that pollutants in snow are preserved, in the past two decades we have come to realize that there is vigorous chemistry occurring in snow, much of it initiated by sunlight.  These snow reactions are significant because they can release pollutants to the atmosphere, destroy toxic species, and alter the concentrations of chemicals that are used in ice core research to understand past atmospheres.  One of the most important pollutants in snow is nitrate, which breaks down in sunlight to form nitrogen oxides (NOx, i.e., NO and NO2) and nitrous acid (HONO).  These reactive nitrogen species are important because when released to the atmosphere they form ozone (i.e., smog) and alter gas-phase chemistry.      When nitrate in snow absorbs sunlight it reacts in two ways, forming (1) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and (2) nitrite, which is the precursor for HONO.  Our work in this study examined the second pathway.  In the past the first reaction pathway was thought to be faster than the second, which was thought to be relatively slow.  However, our new measurements of the second pathway give a rate that is nearly five times faster than the previous recommended value.  In addition, we found that the rate of the second pathway is less sensitive to temperature.  Thus at room temperature the two pathways are equally important, but at ice temperatures the second pathway dominates: in typical summertime polar snow (-20 C), the second pathway is twice as fast as the first.  When we put this new information into models of snow chemistry we find that we can generally predict the measured amounts of NOx and HONO released from sunlit snow in polar regions.  This suggests that we now have a very good understanding of nitrate photochemistry in snow and ice, which should improve predictions of how nitrate affects atmospheric chemistry and how sunlight alters the ice core record of nitrate.
