<AbstractNarration>This project aims to build on and extend the success of the current Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-Poly) and take it on a path towards self-sustainability.  It leverages and improves the resources and infrastructure generated by the current SFS program to prepare a cadre of SFS scholars who can tackle security and privacy problems from multiple viewpoints. The program instills a cybersecurity mindset that looks beyond just technology while approaching problems. The project supports an educational program that relies on a number of high-quality courses in the area of information assurance (IA), participation in research projects supervised by faculty, hands-on experience both at NYU-Poly and during summer internships, and state of the art infrastructure for IA research. In addition to providing technical skills and research experiences, the program nurtures and develops leadership and communication skills, and good citizenship. The proposed project has an important mission of preparing cybersecurity professionals for positions in agencies of the Federal, state, local and tribal government. Using knowledge and skills obtained in the program, the graduates are well prepared to meet challenges of protecting the information and infrastructure resources of our Nation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed  and delivered an engaging and educational cybesecurity program to a cadre of undergraduate and graduate college students from different schools at NYU who went on to take up a career in the federal government.  A total of 39 students were trained, which included 28 from the Engineering School,  7  from the Law School, 3 from Policy and one from the Business School.  Students participated in lab activities, attended technical and non-technical talks,  hack nights and cybersecurity club meetings that introduced them to concepts and challenges in cybersecurity.  Students applied and enhanced their cybersecurity fundamentals by completing  research projects, participating in internships, giving presentations, and developing and competing in cybersecurity related competitions. Besides their curricular work, projects, papers and activities that students participated in, included a variety of topics. A few examples are provided below:  The paper - Constitutional Rights in Criminal Risk Assessment published in a journal. Developed IC watermarking techniques. Participation in a Tech Law &amp; Policy Clinic working with journalists, engineers, and policymakers. Quantifying the efficacy of automated Trojan detection in RTL code. Identified  problems with IOS development certificates. Developed  challenges for NYU's annual security competition CSAW.  Designed a better Random Number Generator  Built encrypted partition support in Firefox OS and made it available to the community.  Developed techniques for determining authorship of bitcoin purchases of ad space on adult services classifieds, with the aim of identifying human tracking organizations. Collaborated with a PhD and Postdoc researcher on investigating users' readiness to trade-off biometric fingerprint data. Did a pilot survey as part of the project and published work in a conference.  Wrote and presented a  paper on the importance of policy, the federal government's initiative regarding secure authentication, and the challenges agencies are facing, Participated in the Economist magazine, challenge to universities around the world to design a system for digital voting that addressed such issues as ensuring privacy and validating contested results.
