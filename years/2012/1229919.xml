<AbstractNarration>Studies of how scientific knowledge is used in policy decisions usually shed light on how natural and physical science intersects with policy. By contrast, less is known about how social science is utilized in policy making. To fill this gap, this study investigates how intelligence analysts acquire, process, and utilize social science to make policy, through a study of the uptake of science and technology studies (STS) research by weapons of mass destruction experts and policymakers. It addresses a gap that the U.S. intelligence community has recognized: the need to access expertise about the human-technology interface in order to mitigate future intelligence failures. Using participant observation, anonymous surveys, and anonymous in-person interviews, the study investigates how weapons of mass destruction assessments can integrate social and technical factors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two groups composed of STS researchers and WMD policymakers are studied: one that examines nuclear weapons technologies, and one that examines biological weapons technologies. The study (1) interjects into the U.S. intelligence community analytic perspectives from science and technology studies that can generate new understandings on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats; (2) studies how intelligence analysts absorb these perspectives to make sense of these threats; and (3) examines how feedback from intelligence practitioners can refine and suggest new research avenues for STS scholarship related to WMD threats.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through publications, presentations at conferences, workshops, teaching, and web-based publishing, the findings of this project are made available to a broad range of expert, educator, student, and informed lay audiences. The specific research outputs of this project are scholarly publications, briefings to U.S. intelligence and policy officials, and workforce training to improve WMD assessments. Integrated with the research, the project also creates new graduate and undergraduate courses for students interested in science, technology, and security, and produces new knowledge about pedagogical methods to teach science and security issues at the undergraduate and graduate level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has created new knowledge about how intelligence analysts acquire, process, and respond to new information and analytic methodologies on WMD issues.  Such findings are useful for academic social science scholarship: (1) to better understand how knowledge production operates in diverse settings and populations such as the U.S. national security community; (2) to study the consequences that occur when S&amp;TS scholars bring their theoretical insights about science and technology to practical intelligence problems; (3) to better understand what gaps and shortcomings exist in the academic literature that could be further developed to aid understanding of WMD problems.  The findings of this project are also useful for U.S. intelligence reform at the grass roots analytic level and provide recommendations for workforce development in order to improve future WMD intelligence assessments and U.S. national security policymaking.   With its direct engagement between S&amp;TS scholars and intelligence analysts, this project has challenged the conventional wisdom in policy and intelligence communities that substantive discussions of intelligence analysis of WMD threats can only occur in highly classified settings and solely relate to technical expertise and knowledge.  Although this project was focused on WMD issues, the results of the project illustrate more broadly how social science and non-government expertise can prove beneficial for assessing a broad array of wepaons threats to U.S. national security.   By bringing the S&amp;TS field and its disciplinary tools to bear on intelligence and policy problems, the U.S. government has gained new analtyic approaches for probing science and technology issues in weapons development; this project has also offered valuable training tools to intelligence analysts.  The project has also provided new education and training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students interested in the intersection of science, technology, and intelligence through the development of two new courses.  The project has led to several journal publications in peer reviewed journals for academic, policy, and intelligence audiences. The project has also presented it's findings in national and international meetings consisting of academic, policy, and intelligence audiences. Through these public and unclassified forums that the project results have been presented, the public is able to learn more about aspects of how intelligence analysis is conducted.  It is anticipated that this project will lead to follow-on work at the intersection of S&amp;TS and intelligence, which will advance academic social science scholarship as well as training in intelligence, and new policy formulations for intelligence training.
