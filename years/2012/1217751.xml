<AbstractNarration>The presence of salient features or anomalous behavior is a characteristic shared in many modern application domains. For example, an anomalous region in an MRI image could indicate the presence of a tumor or lesion; accurately locating conspicuous features in perhaps very high-dimensional images is a critical step in automated surveillance; and identification of anomalies in network traffic is a crucial step in detecting various attacks.  Each of these applications is illustrative of an underlying theme, where subsets of data or image sub-regions are deemed interesting based on their relationship with (or, more precisely, their deviation from) typical behavior exhibited by the bulk of the data. In this sense, saliency can be understood as a natural generalization of the notion of sparsity, but one that is intrinsic to the data itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent developments in compressive and adaptive sensing have demonstrated that tremendous improvements in sensing resource efficiency can be realized when inferring high-dimensional data or objects that possess simple, low-dimensional representations. This research develops new theory and methods extending resource-efficient compressive and adaptive sensing techniques, which exploit sparsity as a model for data parsimony, to procedures that exploit saliency as a low-dimensional model for certain high-dimensional data. In particular, this effort (1) advances the current state-of-the-art theory and methods in compressive and adaptive sensing by developing a novel set of efficient saliency-based sensing methods, (2) demonstrates the robustness of these methods to uncertainties and noise, (3) integrates these new developments into the curriculum at the University of Minnesota, and (4) leverages emerging mobile device technologies as a novel vehicle for demonstrating and broadly disseminating the results of this effort to potentially new and diverse audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on problems wherein the aim is to identify and locate outliers in large-scale data collections.  The specific outcomes of our effort include the development of new, resource efficient sampling and inference methods for such tasks, and the evaluation of the efficacy of these methods &ndash; both by way of formal theoretical analyses, and comprehensive experimental evaluation &ndash; in various applications motivated by problems in diverse application domains (including data science, image processing, and computer vision, to name a few).    The enabling technologies exploited in this work include structural notions of "sparsity," which are used here to formally model the phenomenon that outliers in data sets are nominally rare, "dimensionality reduction" or "compression" methods, certain instances of which allow one to reduce (often dramatically) the size of data to be processed, and "adaptivity," which describes methods that utilize sequential, data-dependent actions in the overall data processing chain. Our novel utilization of these ideas in concert was shown, in the context of certain outlier identification tasks, to facilitate significant computational advantages (up to 100x or more speedup in image saliency estimation tasks) relative to existing methods that perform inference directly on the full data, as well as to provide a notable reduction in the storage space needed to execute our algorithms (often a small fraction of the storage required to execute existing inference methods). Collectively, the results of this effort have been published in numerous peer-reviewed conference and journal publications, primarily in IEEE-sponsored venues, but also occasionally in other "application-specific" venues.  The intellectual merits of our work include the development of new analytical tools and proof techniques that are useful for analyzing the performance of large-scale data inference methods that utilize dimensionality reduction, adaptivity, and certain structured data models. More generally, our effort fits within the context of a contemporary body of work aimed at the development of efficient methods for analyzing structure in data that are corrupted by perturbations or "noise," or are subject to other forms of uncertainties such as missing data.  Within this framework our analyses provide new insights into scenarios where the computational and storage burdens associated with certain instances of these kinds of inference problems can be significantly reduced, especially in the settings that comprise our primary focus, where the specific (rare) corruptions to the data are, in fact, the noteworthy aspects of the overall data set that we aim to infer.   Our work on this effort has also had broader impacts on education and training, and to the scientific community and beyond. Specifically, the primary graduate student researcher working on this effort and the PI were awarded a Best Student Paper Award at a signal processing conference for work related to the primary thrust of this effort.  Another thrust of our effort gave rise to a research opportunity for an undergraduate student, who worked with the PI to develop smartphone applications (or "apps") that implement and demonstrate techniques related to the ones developed here.  Yet another thrust led to an interdisciplinary investigation motivated by the ideas underlying this effort, which facilitated the transfer of new signal processing technologies (algorithms and software) to applications in structural health monitoring and non-destructive evaluation.
