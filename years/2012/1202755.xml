<AbstractNarration>The main thrust of the project is to continue joint work with John Shareshian on the interplay between symmetric function theory, enumerative combinatorics, and algebraic geometry.  This project arose from the study of a class of symmetric functions that appears in various contexts such as in the work of Carlitz, Scoville and Vaughan on enumeration of Smirnov words, in the work of Procesi and Stanley on the representation of the symmetric group on the cohomology of the toric variety associated with the type A root system, and in the work of the investigator and Shareshian on a q-analog of the Eulerian polynomials.  In an effort to understand the basis for the relationship between these structures, the investigator and Shareshian have proposed a far-reaching generalization of this relationship, which this project will explore.  The conjectured generalization involves a quasisymmetric refinement of Stanley's chromatic symmetric functions,  Tymoczko's representation of the symmetric group on the cohomology of the regular semisimple Hessenberg variety of type A, and a q-analog of a generalization (due to De Mari, Procesi and Shayman) of the Eulerian polynomials.  The conjectured relationship would provide an algebro-geometric approach to attacking Stanley and Stembridge's long standing $e$-positivity conjecture for chromatic symmetric functions and  a conjecture of the investigator and Shareshian on unimodality of their q-analog of the De Mari-Procesi-Shayman generalized Eulerian polynomials. The project will also continue the work of the investigator on the interplay between poset topology and enumerative combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this grant is in algebraic combinatorics, which is an area of mathematics that seeks to develop connections between combinatorics (the science of counting, arranging and analyzing concrete discrete configurations) and fields of pure mathematics that involve sophisticated abstract algebraic structures.  The idea is to use these connections to gain deeper insights and solve problems in combinatorics and in the other fields. The discrete configurations that are studied in combinatorics arise in various fields of mathematics, computer science, physics, biology and engineering; DNA sequences, phylogenetic trees, and communications networks are all examples of discrete configurations. Combinatorial methods are playing an increasingly important role in these fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project makes significant contributions to algebraic combinatorics, a field concerned with the interplay between combinatorics and other fields of mathematics such as symmetric function theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry and topology.  Combinatorics is an area of mathematics that studies discrete configurations that arise in various fields of mathematics, computer science, physics, biology, and engineering; DNA sequences, phylogenetic trees, and communications networks are all examples of discrete configurations. Combinatorial methods are playing an increasing role in these fields.     The outcomes fall into two interrelated topics.   (1)  Permutation enumeration, symmetric functions and representation theory.   In 1995 Stanley introduced a symmetric function analog of the classical chromatic polynomial of a graph.  A long-standing conjecture of Stanley and Stembridge, the e-positivity conjecture, states that the chromatic symmetric function (for a certain class of graphs), when expanded in the basis of elementary symmetric functions, has nonnegative coefficients.   Motivated in part by this conjecture, the PI and Shareshian introduced a refinement of Stanley?s chromatic symmetric functions called chromatic quasisymmetric functions. For the path graph, the chromatic quasisymmetric function is shown to be a symmetric function analog of the Eulerian polynomials studied earlier by the PI and Shareshian, who showed that it specializes to a natural q-analog of the Eulerian polynomials.   The PI and Shareshian refine the Stanley-Stembridge e-positivity conjecture and provide evidence for the refined conjecture.  For instance, they obtain a  Schur-expansion formula for the chromatic quasisymmetric functions (for a certain class of graphs) and they conjecture a power-sum expansion formula, which was subsequently proved by Athanasiadis.  The Schur-expansion formula implies that the chromatic quasisymmetric functions encode a graded representation of the symmetric group.   The PI and Shareshian formulate a conjecture for the representation in question. They conjecture that it is a representation, due to Tymoczko, on the cohomology of a regular semisimple Hessenberg variety of type A.  This conjecture has generated quite a bit of interest in the combinatorics and algebraic geometry communities.  In 2015, the conjecture was proved by Brosnan and Chow and subsequently by Gay-Paquet.  Some important consequences of the conjecture combined with results of the PI and Shareshian  include a decomposition of Tymoczko's representation into irreducibles.  Also  a formula for the character of the representation follows from this conjecture and the formula conjectured by the PI and Shareshian, proved by Athanasiadis.  A potential consequence of the conjecture could be a proof the Shareshian-Wachs refinement of the Stanley-Stembridge e-positivity conjecture, which would be obtained by analyzing the Tymoczko representation.   The PI and Shareshian also also obtain combinatorial consequences of the connection to Tymoczko?s representation involving a q-analog of unimodality of a generalization (due to De Mari, Procesi and Shayman) of the Eulerian polynomials.   The PI?s Ph.D student (and RA on the grant from 2014-2015) Brittney Ellzey embarked on a project in which a fundamental generalization of the chromatic quasisymmetric function is studied. The class of graphs considered by Shareshian and Wachs can be viewed as acyclic directed graphs.  Ellzey has extended some of the work of Shareshian and Wachs to all digraphs in a very interesting way.    The Eulerian polynomials possess a stronger property than unimodality known as gamma-positivity.  Recent interest  in gamma-positivity stems from Gal's strengthening of the well known Charney-Davis conjecture.  In earlier work, the PI and Shareshian obtain a q-analog of gamma-positivity of the Eulerian polynomials.  Under this grant, the PI and collaborators have worked on extending this q-analog in several directions.  A symmetric function version of gamma-positivity is also studied.   (2) Topological aspects of partially ordered sets (posets).  One can associate an abstract simplicial complex, known as the order complex, with a poset by letting the chains of the poset be the faces of the simplicial complex.  The order complex provides a deep and fundamental link between combinatorics and other branches of mathematics.  Interest in this connection originated with the Steele Prize winning 1964 paper of Gian-Carlo Rota on the Mobius function of a partially ordered set.     By studying certain examples of posets and combinatorial simplicial complexes that arise in various areas of mathematics, the PI has contributed to the development of powerful tools, such as shellability, for computing homotopy type, homology, and group representations on homology of  order complexes of posets.   The PI and her Ph.D. student (and RA on this grant from 2012-2014), Rafael Gonzalez D'Leon,  analyzed the topology of the order complex of the poset of weighted partitions and used it to study the free Lie algebra with multiple compatible brackets, a structure of interest in particle physics. There are interesting connections with structures of significance in enumerative and geometric combinatorics.   The PI supervised the research of two graduate students who worked as RA?s on this grant.  She gave numerous lectures on her research at universities and conferences, which were attended by graduate students and early career mathematicians.
