<AbstractNarration>What explains the diversity of color in nature, and both our and other animals? great appreciation for beauty in color? Now it is possible to advance our understanding of this through the use of genetic analyses that investigate differences in the molecules involved in color vision and thus, in how color is viewed by different species.  This project investigates whether different species of birds perceive color differently, and whether this could explain why different species of birds have evolved dramatically different plumage colors. For example, if one bird is red and one is blue, is this associated with differences in perception of red and of blue? This question is being addressed by studying the opsins from multiple species of warblers, which vary greatly in their color patterns.  Opsin proteins are the critical light-absorbing molecules that modulate vision in all vertebrates, including humans.  This project combines sequencing of opsin genes, and recreating opsins proteins in the laboratory, with computer modeling to find out whether different species of birds perceive color differently and identify the underlying causes of such differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding whether changes in opsins are responsible for the observed plumage color differences will give us important insight into the evolutionary processes that gave rise to species diversification and into the origins of the spectacular diversity of colors we see in the animal world.  Moreover, since opsins are also responsible for vision in humans, dissecting the molecular bases for changes in vision could help us understand color-blindness and other color vision disorders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we focused on the study of opsins, the molecules in the eye responsible for color vision, in birds.  Color vision is mediated by light-catching molecules in the retina called opsins. Human color perception for example, involves three different types of opsins, sensitive in the long or "red" part of the spectrum, the middle or "green" part of the spectrum and the short or "blue" part of the spectrum. With these three opsins we are able to perceive millions of colors. Birds have a fourth opsin type in their retinas sensitive in the ultraviolet that allows them to perceive wavelengths that are invisible to humans.     We studied opsins in two clades of birds, the New World and Old World warblers. While these two clades occupy the same range of environments in different regions of the world, they exhibit dramatically different plumage colors. Old World warblers are dull and monomorphic (i.e. males and females look the same) and New World warblers are very colourful and sexually dimorphic. We studied several aspects of opsins that could impact the way different species of warblers perceive color.

In general, the effects a gene has on an organism can differ not only though changes in the gene itself, but also though differences in how much that gene is expressed, or changes in the regulation of that gene.

I found differences in the expression of opsins among species and between sexes.   More specifically, the degree of sex-bias was different among warbler species:  most species have female-biased expression (higher relative expression in females than males), but other species exhibited the opposite pattern or no sex bias, implying sex bias in opsin expression is an ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
