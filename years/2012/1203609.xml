<AbstractNarration>The rapid loss of biological diversity, due in large part to changes in land use related to agriculture and development, has lent a new urgency to efforts to document and understand patterns of biodiversity and the potential impacts of its loss. This project will bring US graduate students, recruited nationally, to tropical China for four weeks where they will work with Asian graduate students, recruited from the many tropical countries in the region, to study issues of forest management and restoration and to learn protocols for rapid biological surveys using cutting-edge technologies. The course will be based at the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, a well-established research institute in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will substantially increase our knowledge of the biological diversity of the forests of Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China, which are home to a unique complement of species and which are under severe pressure from expanding plantation forests. Several experimental trials have been established to develop environmentally-friendly mixed agro-forestry management systems and to promote the restoration of natural forest on degraded and unproductive sites. Digital imagery, audio, and web-based sharing technologies will be used to study forest biodiversity, from micro- to macro-scopic scales, and environmental samples will be collected for analysis using next-generation gene sequencing methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the training of the next generation of experts in the field of biodiversity and it will pioneer survey methods based on commonly available equipment to accelerate the collection and distribution of meaningful data about forest condition. The resulting protocols will be freely available and actively updated and improved. The course will focus on the development of international collaboration skills, and continued interaction among participants will be encouraged through a 'distributed discussion' course to be offered in the following fall.  Beyond the topic of forest restoration, the course will allow students to learn best practices for live web-based interaction and cooperation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly supported by the Dimensions of Biodiversity program and the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Technological advances are often perceived as driving scientific progress, but conservation biology is frequently regarded as less technology-driven.  This is particularly true in the developing world, where conservation needs are acute, but technical advances lag behind more developed nations.  This project funded a series of hybrid online/field courses to bring together graduate students from the United States, China, and developing countries in Southeast Asia with a similarly diverse group of lecturers.  These individuals represented a diverse array of cultures and academic experiences focused on the goals of envisioning new conservation uses for existing technologies and identifying critical needs for technological solutions to conservation problems.  During the academic semester, students viewed a one-hour lecture presentation online, then "met" online in groups of 4-6 students together with one professor to discuss the weekÆs lecture.  During the summer, students convened for a one-month field course at Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan.  Not only is this facility a key laboratory for ecology in China, but Yunnan province in southwestern China is home to a unique and highly endemic fauna that is under intense human pressure, primarily from deforestation for rubber production.   Here, students participated in additional lectures, undertook independent and small group research projects, and brainstormed about novel solutions to the problems of conservation and biodiversity science.  Several dozens students from all over the world were trained in this course over the two years that the course was held.
