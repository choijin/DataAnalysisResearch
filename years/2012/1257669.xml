<AbstractNarration>Where species live changes through time -- for example, mountains may rise, dividing one species into distinct populations, or a small group of individuals may hitch a ride in ballast water and start spreading within a new geographic area. To investigate the history of species through time, scientists often represent possible histories as models and compare the fit of observed data to these models. This grant will develop new modeling methods and software to allow scientists to test alternative, complex models that best fit observed data for various groups of organisms. A test case, using North American bats, will help ensure that the new software can accommodate various types of data effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has practical importance because the new methods can be used to help identify sources of invasive species. It is also important in conservation because these methods will provide information about whether a species in different river systems is one or multiple populations, whether hybridization is occurring between two related species, and what the effective population size of a species has been through time. Graduate students and postdoctoral students will be trained in these methods as well.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Species consist of individuals clumped in populations. Through time, these populations change: they increase or decrease in size, they split or merge with others, individuals move from one to another. Understanding how this plays out over time and across space is the realm of phylogeography. This can help in understanding how species responded to past changes in climate, how genes can move across the landscape, and how speciation happens. The related field of taxonomy often uses this information, in conjunction with others, to decide which sets of populations should be described as independent species. However, most existing approaches require examination of just a few particular hypotheses. While powerful, this makes it difficult to make new discoveries -- unexpected movement between populations, surprising merging of populations in the past. Moreover, many approaches work by ignoring some key aspects of biology, such as approaches for inferring species that assume there is no gene flow between populations. In some cases this is necessary because there is no feasible way to calculate the probability of data under some models.</p> <p><br />We have developed a new approach to get around some of these problems. It creates a wide set of models to compare that can cover many processes of population subdivision, gene flow, and population size changes. It then uses simulation under these models to estimate the probability of the observed data under each model, which can then help evaluate which models fit best as well as estimate parameters of those models. Thanks to NSF funding, this is implemented in free, open source software (Fig. 1) as a package in R, called PHRAPL. It has been tested through extensive simulations, as well used for understanding phylogeography in <em>Myotis</em> bats.</p> <p><br />As part of this grant, one postdoctoral scholar was trained and went on to a career in cancer research.

For further outreach, there is even the possibility to make a 3D model of a phylogeographic history to use in communication (Fig. 3). We have published three papers so far, all in prominent journals in evolutionary biology, and colleagues are actively using our software in their work already.
