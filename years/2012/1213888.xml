<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research of Professor Alexander Vilenkin at Tufts University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent developments in cosmology suggest that much of the universe is in a state of explosive accelerated expansion, called inflation. We live in a "bubble" where inflation has ended, and other bubbles with diverse properties are constantly being formed. A major unresolved problem in this theory of eternal inflation is the problem of calculating relative probabilities of different measurements. In the course of eternal inflation, any event having a nonzero probability will happen an infinite number of times, and comparing infinities is an inherently ambiguous task. The challenge is to formulate a compelling probability measure prescription. This will put the theory on a much firmer footing and will (at least in principle) allow its observational tests.  Another major topic of this research is the evolution and observational signatures of cosmic strings. Strings can be formed as high-energy linear defects in the early universe and can produce a variety of observational effects at the present time. A detection of cosmic strings would be of great importance, as it would open a unique window into the physics of very high energies and into the early history of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  The new worldview that has emerged from the eternal inflation scenario has far-reaching implications beyond physics. Professor Vilenkin will continue presenting these ideas in public lectures, in popular articles, and in popular magazine and TV interviews. The research described above will be done with active collaboration of graduate students and postdocs, thus providing crucial training to the young physicists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The theory of inflation, which has been the leading cosmological paradigm over the last  three decades, has led to a major change in our global view of the universe. According  to the new worldview, much of the volume in the universe is still in the state of  explosive inflationary expansion.  We live in a "bubble" where inflation has ended, but  it will never end in the entire universe. The total volume of inflating regions continues  to grow, and other bubbles with diverse properties are constantly being formed.  A  serious challenge to this "multiverse" worldview has been the problem of assigning  probabilities to different observations, known as the measure problem.  All possible  events will happen an infinite number of times in the course of eternal inflation, and it  is not clear how one should compare these infinities and distinguish probable events  from highly improbable.  This problem has been recognized for more than 20 years,  but despite much effort still remained unresolved.    A new approach to the measure problem, introduced in this project, involves an  idealized æeternal observerÆ traveling through the multiverse.  Such an observer will  pass through all possible kinds of bubbles and will see all events that can possibly  occur in the multiverse. In particular, all possible outcomes of a given measurement  will occur an infinite number of times. The probabilities of different outcomes can  then be identified with the frequencies at which they occur along the observerÆs  worldline.  We have verified that this approach does not suffer from the  phenomenological problems that afflict the earlier measure proposals.      Another intriguing question raised by the multiverse scenario is related to the beginning  of the universe.  Since inflation never ends in the future, one might think that it could  also be eternal to the past.  We would then have an inflating universe without a  beginning and without an end.  This possibility, however, is excluded by the theorem  that I proved in 2003 with Arvind Borde and Alan Guth.  This so-called BGV theorem  states that if the universe is on average expanding, then its history cannot be  indefinitely continued to the past and must terminate after a finite time.  A number of  physicists have subsequently attempted to construct models of an eternal universe in  which the universe existed for eternity as a static "seed" &ndash; a small closed universe,  which would then burst into inflationary expansion.  The expansion rate averaged over  infinite time would then be zero, and the BGV theorem would not apply.  In the  present project, we showed that a static seed universe is necessarily unstable with  respect to quantum collapse.  It may be stable by the laws of classical physics, but  there is a nonzero probability for it to make a sudden quantum transition to a  vanishing size and disappear.  It follows that the seed universe could not have existed  for an infinite time before the onset of inflation.  Thus, it appears that the universe  cannot be eternal to the past and must have some sort of a beginning.  This conclusion  has far reaching implications beyond physics, in particular to the philosophical aspects  of cosmology.   The second major topic of the reported research is an investigation of cosmic strings.  Strings could be formed as linear defects in the early universe and could produce a  variety of observational effects at the present time.  Describing the cosmological  evolution of strings has proved to be a tremendously difficult problem. Now it is  nearing its solution, due to important recent breakthroughs in computer simulations  of cosmic string networks.  We used the simulations developed by our group at Tufts  to determine the statistical properties of the networks and of closed loops of string.   A detection of cosmic strings would be of great importance, as it would open a unique  window into the physics of very high energies and into the early history of th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
