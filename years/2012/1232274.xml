<AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is innovative research in new transformative algorithms for high-precision localization services using low-cost WiFi technology. Features of the Physical Layer RF signal will be exploited to create transformative localization algorithms which are vital for next generation indoor navigation, network security, emergency evacuation and commercial services. The program connects researchers from Rice University (RU), University College Dublin (UCD) and Queen?s University Belfast (QUB) with expertise in localization algorithms (UCD), baseband/FPGA processing architectures (QUB/RU), WiFi Physical Layer networking (RU/QUB) and localization applications (UCD/QUB); the UCD and QUB work is funded by their national funding agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the creation of the Spotlight and Location-Sync algorithms to achieve sub-meter accuracy in real-world indoor environments. Spotlight will utilize multiple antennae at the Access Point and beamsteering for a combined Direction of Emission - Receive Signal Strength signature, thereby reducing multi-path and occlusion. Location-Sync uses a Time of Flight approach to measure the range between WiFi nodes; it enhances precision through joint clock synchronization and location estimation and fusion of clock and range parameters over time and between multiple nodes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are significant improvements to Location Based Services benefitting the wider community through more effective indoor pedestrian navigation. In addition to research publications, the modules distributed for the WiPhyLoc8 platform (Rice University WARP with Xilinx 10G NetFPGA) will provide algorithm performance measurements in network security and geofencing applications. The WiPhyLoc8 project plans to develop open-access educational materials and semester length courses.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Current systems for determining the position of mobile devices, e.g. smartphones, show poor accuracy indoors. GPS does not work indoors due to attenuation of the radio signals from the GPS satellites by the building fabric. Although the conventional WiFi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) uses information made available in 802.11 network cards, more information on the RF signal is available at the Physical Layer (Phy) but is difficult to access and utilize. The Rice University (RU) WARP platform is able to capture physical layer samples and this information is utilized in more accurate and robust location algorithms and can be evaluated in real-world testbeds and prototypes. The project brought together researchers from RU, University College Dublin (UCD) and Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast (QUB) with expertise in the relevant topics including localization algorithms (UCD), baseband/FPGA processing architectures (QUB/RU), WiFi Physical layer networking (RU/QUB) and localization applications (UCD/QUB).

High accuracy technologies such as this will enable new location based services such as indoor navigation for the visual impaired, child tracking in malls and airports, and improved navigation for emergency responders.

High performance solutions were created to meet the new processing requirements and implemented on the WARP platform. Using WARP, a <em>WiPhyLoc8 </em>experimental platform was created for both performance measurements and application assessments.
