<AbstractNarration>MAKING ETHICS EXPLICIT:&lt;br/&gt;RELOCATING ETHICS TO THE CORE OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Ethics Education in Science and Engineering award supports an interdisciplinary effort to transform engineering ethics education by developing pedagogical approaches that engage students in innovative ways. Engineers and social scientists will work collaboratively to study problem-based learning as a strategy to incorporate cutting edge research into ethics curricula. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project incorporates two interrelated research and education components: 1) develop&lt;br/&gt;innovative pedagogical approaches to engage with students? emotions and existing value&lt;br/&gt;systems; and 2) explore how student-directed, problem-based learning can place ethics at the&lt;br/&gt;core of the curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team includes the four PIs at University of California Berkeley and collaborators from the University of California, Los Angeles and from the 3TU Centre for Ethics and Technology at the three technical universities in the Netherlands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project creates a diversity of research experiences for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, including opportunities to: 1) become involved in curriculum evaluation and development, 2) create new curriculum materials and resources, 3) participate in an advanced, intensive ethics summer program, 4) incorporate ethics components into their dissertations, and 5) contribute to the ethics research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include an active program of dissemination via peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, as well as substantial curriculum development, such as course modules, an advanced undergraduate course, an intensive summer graduate program, and a concise textbook-style resource. All course materials will be made available to other institutions through the NSF-funded online resource center, The National Professional and Research Ethics Portal (http://nationalethicsresourcecenter.net) as well as the Online Ethics Center for Engineering and Research (http://onlineethics.org). By involving students in research and curriculum development, our project enables new scholars to incorporate ethics into their research programs and teaching activities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A new and innovative approach to engineering ethics education that creates a shift from learning &ldquo;about&rdquo; ethics to &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; ethical was developed in this project. Pedagogy and course content were developed that honors emotion as a necessary part of ethical decision-making and moral behavior. Taking students&rsquo; emotions seriously does not mean that students learn to equate ethical reasoning with gut emotional reactions. Rather than labeling emotional responses as an impediment to moral reasoning, emotions supply a valid source of information that is grounded in each student&rsquo;s personal experience. Students already arrive at the University with an established set of values, assumptions and beliefs regarding ethics and moral behavior. Family of origin religion, culture and psychological dynamics play a large role in students&rsquo; perspectives and experience regarding ethics and morality. Exploring how different perceptions are rooted in different experiences builds a classroom environment that respects diversity and creates a platform for integrating multiple perspectives. An essential finding of this project is that problem-based learning (PBL) approaches can be employed to engage with student&rsquo;s emotions regarding the resolution of the difficult ethical issues that arise with emerging technologies.
