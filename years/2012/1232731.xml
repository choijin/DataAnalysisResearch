<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to connect structure to plastic deformation in bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). Experiments with fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM) will be used to measure nanoscale medium-range order in BMGs.  The FEM data will be combined with an empirical interatomic potential in a hybrid Reverse Monte Carlo structural refinement, producing models with realistic short- and&lt;br/&gt;medium-range structure.  Research on Pd-Si BMGs will provide an essential test of the generality of a recently proposed structural model&lt;br/&gt;for Zr-Cu-Al BMGs that consists of nanometer-regions with crystal-like and icosahedral-like internal structure.  If crystal-like nanometer scale regions are a general feature of BMG structure, it could have significant impact on models of their plastic flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will lay the fundamental scientific groundwork for expanded applications of BMG alloys, by eventually assisting design of new alloys with desired mechanical and glass-forming characteristics through detailed understanding of their structure and its connection to plasticity.  The research team will involve undergraduate and graduate students, especially from under-represented groups, and will engage the general public and K-12 students in the excitement and outcomes of the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This  project resulted in new understanding of how atoms fit together inside  metallic glass alloys.  One of the basic rules of materials science is  if we know  where the atoms are, we can predict the properties and uses of  materials, so future research may use the new understanding generated by  this project to help create advanced metallic glass alloys with  desirable properties.  We also created a new combined experimental  / computational method for discovering atomic structure information for  complex materials, which will be used for further studies of different  glasses and maybe other nano- or biomaterials in the future.  The project has also resulted in new understanding of how metallic glasses plastically deform under stress or pressure. In this context "plastic deformation" means irrecoverable deformation in much the same way that a coiled spring, if stretched too far, won't return to its original length.  In metallic glasses plastic deformation concentrates along narrow bands of shear, much like the fault lines that form in the earth's crust during earth quakes but at far smaller length scales. Inside these shear bands the atoms all slide past each other during plastic deformation.  Our experiments indicate how it might be possible to separately probe shear band initiation and shear band sliding and connect each of these back to the underlying atomistic processes.  The better we understand these processes and their relation to atomic structure, the better we will be able to design advanced metallic glasses.
