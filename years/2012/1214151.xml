<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Diane K. Smith of San Diego State University develops new methods to control supramolecular structure through electron transfer.  The first set of projects builds upon previous work with two hydrogen-bond systems by exploring different means to create redox-dependence in existing three and four hydrogen-bond homo- and heterodimers.  The second set of projects addresses the need to develop strong, selective, on/off redox-dependent binding systems that work in aqueous solution.  A completely new approach based on the use of radical pi-dimerizations will be explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many advanced applications of supramolecular chemistry will require some means to control structure using an external signal.   Electron transfer is a particularly attractive approach because it provides a natural conduit between the nanoscopic world of supramolecular assemblies and the microscopic realm of conventional electronics.  The new possibilities for electron transfer signaling opened up by this research may impact a number of future technologies, including molecular electronics, smart materials, and molecular machines.   More immediately, it will provide excellent education and training to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom are from groups under-represented in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The basic goal of supramolecular chemistry is to learn how to utilize weaker, reversible interactions between molecules to create well-defined assemblies of molecules, or "supramolecules", that have unique properties, distinct from the individual components.  While these supramolecules have interest and applications on their own, many of the more advanced applications, such as smart materials, molecular electronics and molecular machines, also require some means to control the structure of the assembly using an external signal.  The goal of this project was to develop new methods to do so using electron transfer as the signal. This is an attractive approach because electron transfer provides a natural link between the nanoscopic world of supramolecular assemblies and the microscopic realm of conventional electronics.  Two different approaches to controlling supramolecular structure using electron transfer were investigated in this project.  One was to utilize the well-known tendency of organic dye molecules to stack together to form pairs (dimers) in aqueous solution upon addition (reduction) or removal (oxidation) of one electron.  By linking together dye units in a semi-rigid manner that allows multiple dimers to form simultaneously, the strength of the interaction in the oxidized or reduced state should greatly increase. This was demonstrated by showing that the strength of the interaction between two, one-electron reduced viologen dye units in water increased by at least 3 orders of magnitude by linking two viologens together.    While proof of concept was achieved with the stacked dyes, much greater progress and success was achieved with the second approach under investigation, which involved modifying the structure of molecules ("H-bond arrays") known to pair up (dimerize) in organic solvents via the formation of 3 to 4 strong hydrogen bonds.  A hydrogen bond arises from the favorable electrostatic interaction between a partial positively charge hydrogen atom (the H-donor) and a partially negatively charge atom (the H-acceptor).  Due to their relative strength and directionality, hydrogen bonds are one of the most important interactions used in supramolecular chemistry. Due to their electrostatic nature, they are also ones whose strength can readily be perturbed by electron transfer. To utilize this, known H-bond arrays were modified to include a component that can reversibly give or take an electron, resulting in a change of charge on at least one of the H-donor or acceptor sites, thereby changing the strength of one or more H-bonds.  All in all, three 4 H-bond arrays (2 new, 1 previously made by others) and one new 3 H-bond array were made and the effects of electron transfer on their dimerization investigated. In addition, a previously studied 2 H-bond array that contained the same electron transfer group as the 3 H-bond array and one of the 4 H-bond arrays was re-investigated in much greater detail after we realized that electron transfer was not just increasing the strength of H-bonding but actually causing the hydrogen, in the form of H+ (a proton), to transfer to a completely separate site in the molecule.  Prior to this discovery, we thought that proton transfer such as this was something that needed to be avoided because it would inevitably lead to irreversible electron transfer.  However, the electron transfer in this system is reversible in solvents in which H-bonding is strong, showing that irreversibility is not necessarily inevitable when proton transfer accompanies electron transfer.  As it turned out, unanticipated proton transfer was a pervasive theme in this project.  With one of the 4 H-bond arrays, electron transfer is used to weaken the H acceptor.  In this case, no proton transfer occurs, and, as was anticipated, the electron transfer breaks apart the dimer. However, in the other cases, electron transfer was expected to increase the strength of the H-bonding, but resulted instead in proton transfer to another site in the molecule.  With the 3 H-bond array this leads to no significant change in dimerization strength, but with the 4 H-bond arrays, break-up of the dimers occur.  The latter result, although opposite of what was expected, is not necessarily bad in that we achieved the goal of changing structure though electron transfer.  In addition, since proton transfer results in an entirely different H-bond pattern, it opens up the possibility of not just turning binding on and off using electron transfer, but also to use it to switch binding partners.   In conclusion, we have successfully developed systems in which electron transfer can be used to change supramolecular structure in a reversible fashion: turning on binding in the case of the linked organic dyes and turning off binding in several of the H-bond arrays.  The new possibilities for electron transfer signaling opened up by this research may impact a number of future technologies. In the present, it has provided both new fundamental knowledge and excellent education and training to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom are from groups under-represented in science.
