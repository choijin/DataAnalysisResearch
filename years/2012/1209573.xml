<AbstractNarration>This project represents the first quantitative study of the effects that different forms of a sexually dimorphic bioluminescent trait have on patterns of species diversity in lanternfishes (family Myctophidae), one of the most common and widely distributed deep-sea vertebrate groups. Analysis will be conducted in three stages. First, an evolutionary tree of over 130 lanternfish species will be constructed, using both mitochondrial and nuclear protein-coding DNA sequences. Second, data on the innervation of the bioluminescent trait will be gathered using a combination of traditional and novel imaging techniques to more accurately determine the number and structure of traits. Third, the different traits will be mapped onto the evolutionary tree. Patterns of dimorphism will then be statistically compared with patterns of monomorphism to assess the effect of dimorphic bioluminescent traits on diversification in lanternfishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deep sea is both the largest and least well-known region on Earth, and bioluminescence is one of the most abundant traits across the tree of life. Despite these facts, no studies have yet quantitatively analyzed the effect of differences in bioluminescent structures on patterns of species diversity in deep-sea organisms. Lanternfishes present an ideal model group for enhancing our understanding of evolution in this poorly understood realm.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Context:  Studies  in evolutionary biology have, in recent years, focused on developing  and employing powerful statistical models to test hypotheses about  how quickly, and through what mechanisms, organisms are changing  through space and time. Yet although these developments have enabled  more precise statements to be made about rates and causes of evolution,  the conclusions drawn from such models about global  evolutionary processes have been limited to inferences available from  accessible terrestrial, freshwater, and near-shore organisms, which live  in environments representing less than a quarter of the volume of  Earth. Therefore, the general evolutionary patterns  and processes inferred from such accessible systems represent a limited  and biased sample. To expand understanding of evolution at a truly  global scale, this project applied statistical models to organisms from  the deep-sea environment, which represents over  three-quarters of EarthÃ†s volume.  Intellectual Merit:  Based  on statistical analysis of evolutionary rates associated with a  light-emitting (bioluminescent) organ, in the context of the largest  evolutionary tree ever assembled for a group of deep-sea organisms,  this study contradicted untested conventional wisdom about the  evolutionary consequences of bioluminescence by providing the first  evidence that one such organ is associated with decreased,  rather than increased, evolutionary rates in lanternfishes, the worldÃ†s  most abundant deep-sea vertebrate. This study further showed that  features of the lanternfish bioluminescent organ evolved in an  irreversible sequence, providing the first evidence that  this phenomenon, known in terrestrial organisms, occurs in both the  deep sea and in a bioluminescent organ. Furthermore, the specific  sequence of evolution within the features of the lanternfish organ  agreed with model predictions of a specific type of natural  selection hypothesized to be otherwise uncommon based on studies of  terrestrial taxa.  Analysis  of body shape within the context of the evolutionary tree of two  related groups of lanternfishes with diverse body  plans showed that these fishes exhibited a significant evolutionary  trend toward body elongation, and that light-emitting body organs  (photophores) in these fishes&mdash;hypothesized to influence  speciation&mdash;instead strongly tracked the axis of elongation. Furthermore,  analysis of correlations among body shape components in these fishes  showed that the lowest covariation occurred between the anterior (head)  and posterior (tail) regions, thereby providing evidence for an explicit  modular structure potentially serving as the  constraint through which shape diversity in these fishes is generated.  These results provided the first explicit evidence that the positions of  photophores are influenced by larger-scale changes in body form that  are likely related to environmentally-imposed  constraints on movement.  Broader impacts:  A major impediment to public  engagement with, and involvement in, deep-sea research is that data are  sparse and unevenly distributed across different organismal groups. This  study filled a critical gap in the accessibility  of deep-sea organisms for public inquiry by generating a broad array of  data for a charismatic and economically and ecologically critical group  of fishes, in different areas, including molecular sequences,  anatomical data, high-resolution photographs, and  a web-based, interactive taxonomic key of lanternfishes, which are  often difficult to identify. Moreover, new analytical techniques developed for  and employed during this study have been made available through public  repositories.
