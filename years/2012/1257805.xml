<AbstractNarration>Vascular plants have two fundamentally different axes of growth, roots and shoots, which first become established through precisely orchestrated cell fate decisions in the early embryo.  While the mechanisms underlying this patterning process remain poorly understood overall, previous work has clearly identified a key role for the YODA (YDA) cellular signaling pathway.  The YDA pathway, which contains a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase module, becomes activated upon fertilization and promotes division of the zygote into a large basal and a small apical daughter.  This asymmetric first division defines polarity and sets the stage for subsequent elaboration of the main axis with root and shoot poles.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the molecular mechanisms of YDA signaling in the zygote and early embryo will be analyzed using a diverse set of methodologies, including classical genetics, comparative phylogeny, molecular biology, genomics, microscopy, and biochemistry.  Particular attention is dedicated to factors regulating the core MAP kinase module in the context of fertilization, as well as the gene expression programs targeted by the pathway and executing the establishment of polarity.  The expected results will make pioneering contributions to our understanding of how the basic body plan of plants is laid out and may inform targeted approaches for initiating embryos from somatic cells in culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will lead to training of a post doctoral associate and a graduate student in plant genetics, molecular biology, genomics, and advanced microscopy.  Participation of a high school teacher, high school students, and undergraduate students is an integral part of the research plan; recruitment will be through the Georgia Intern-Fellowships for Teachers (GIFT) program, the Empowered Youth Program (EPY), the University's Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP), and the NSF-sponsored Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PSLSAMP).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The body of multicellular organisms arises in a step-wise fashion from a single cell, the zygote.  The zygotes of plants typically divide asymmetrically, creating a small apical daughter and a large basal daughter.  These two cells follow along fundamentally different developmental trajectories: while the apical cell produces the embryo, the basal cell gives rise to a support stricture called suspensor.  Root formation is initiated across the boundary between embryo and suspensor.  Thus, the polarity created with the asymmetric first division directly correlates to the direction of the main body axis (see Image).  In Arabidopsis thaliana, a relative of radish and cabbage commonly used as a genetic model, growth and division of the zygote are regulated by a cellular signaling pathway with a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade at its core (the MAPKK kinase YDA, the MAPK kinases MKK4/MKK5, and the MAP kinases MPK3/MPK6).  MAP kinase cascades are universally found signaling proteins; due to their cooperativity, they can produce steep response curves and are often employed as molecular switches.  In the absence of MAP kinase signaling, Arabidopsis zygotes fail to elongate and divide into daughter cells of similar size.  Subsequently, embryo and suspensor are not properly differentiated; rather, a mass of cells forms that lacks visible as well as molecular features of an apical-basal axis and eventually arrests.  This project has focused on investigating the SSP protein and BSL family phosphatases, two cellular signaling functions acting in concert with the MAP kinase cascade to regulate the asymmetric division of the zygote.  We had previously shown that activation of MAP kinase signaling is linked to fertilization by the up-steam activator SSP.  SSP protein is produced in the zygote from mRNA transcripts stored the sperm cell, such that it accumulates only after fertilization.  Furthermore, the presence of SSP protein is sufficient to trigger activation of the YDA MAP kinase cascade, implying that it acts like a signal.    The closely related sister protein of SSP, BSK1, lacks this property: the presence of BSK1 alone is not sufficient to trigger activation of the MAP kinase cascade.  A detailed functional comparison revealed that the ability to activate the MAP kinase pathway relies on a small segment of the SSP proteins.  This segment is part of a domain involved in protein-protein interactions and likely affects binding of SSP to as yet unknown clients in the signaling chain.  Thus, our work identifies the structural feature underpinning the signal-like properties of SSP and suggests a molecular model: whereas BSK1 binding to its client proteins is likely modulated by cell-surface receptors in response to extracellular signals, SSP likely binds its clients independently of such regulation, thereby constitutively activating the MAP kinase pathway.  BSL family phosphatases with kelch-like domains are commonly thought to regulate cellular responses to the plant hormone brassinosteroid (BR), and recent work suggested that they may also mediate cross-talk between BR and YDA MAP kinase signaling.  Our work establishes that BSL family phosphatases are in fact an integral part of the YDA MAP kinase signaling pathway: loss of BSLs and loss of the MAP kinase cascade not only result in similar phenotypic abnormalities during embryogenesis (see Image); they also cause largely overlapping changes in the global activity of genes.  Further genetic tests argue that BSL phosphatases act either in close conjunction with the MAP kinase cascade or downstream of the MAP kinase cascade.  The kelch-like domain of BSL family phosphatases, which is predicted to form a large disk-like platform for interaction with other proteins, as well as their catalytic activity are both essential for proper function.  These results suggest the possibility that polar positioning of the division plane in the zygote may be organized by a protein complex including BSL family phosphatases along with members of the MAP kinase cascade.  Surprisingly, our work did not uncover any evidence for an involvement of BSL-family proteins in BR signaling, implying that current models of BR pathway may need to be reconsidered.  Intellectual Merit:  The mechanisms regulating cellular polarity and asymmetric divisions in plants are poorly characterized.  Our work has advanced understanding of a key signaling pathway organizing the asymmetric division of the zygote.  The results will inform studies of asymmetric divisions in other contexts and contribute to developing a conceptual framework for understanding this cellular process.  Broader Impacts:  Brassinosteroids regulate many aspects of plant growth, and there is an agricutural interest in manipulating responses to this hormone as a means for enhancing resistance to stress and pathogens.  Our results are directly relevant to ongoing work aimed at dissecting the molecular basis of BR signaling.  The project has provided five paid summer research internships for high school students, all of which were from under-privileged social backgrounds and from demographic groups currently under-represented in the STEM fields; as well as training for two undergraduate researchers, two graduate students and one post-doctoral fellow.
