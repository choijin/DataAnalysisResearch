<AbstractNarration>This is an EAGER proposal supported under the SAVI initiative that is conducting research on knowledge organization techniques for visualizing and presenting STEM content digitally so as to engage students and engender deep learning. The PIs are applying the results of their research (in an iterative fashion) toward the development of new presentation, interaction, and navigation techniques for digital STEM content, and then evaluating these digital artifacts in the context of an inquiry-based pedagogy designed around dynamic digital text. In the long term, the team envisions a cloud-based service architecture that allows anytime, anywhere, and as-needed access to dynamic digital content covering an extensive set of topics for school and college level STEM education that is integrated with a proven pedagogy that makes effective use of digital STEM content. Collaboration with researchers in Finland is a key component of this work, as the team is testing its theoretical framework for dynamic digital texts with content in science and computing, for middle school and college, in Finnish and English. As such, this project is a first attempt to systematically evaluate the use and utility -- across multiple content domains, learner levels, and cultures -- of dynamic digital texts founded on concept map-based organizations of domain knowledge. In keeping with the spirit of the EAGER mechanism, this project is exploratory in nature; and while its multi-faceted nature presents risks in execution, there is a potentially transformative payoff to this work in that it can lay an excellent technological foundation for dynamic digital texts of the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:   This project's principal discipline is STEM eduction. The two eTextbook architectures that were further developed and integrated in this project have potential for expanded use and impact in future. The OpenDSA materials and infrastructure is already in use in a number of institutions, with the level of use expanding over time.

Some of the specific content materials developed may also be of use for courses in other disciplines.  Broader Impact:  In our studies in three countries, we discovered that language and educational culture could be barriers to adoption of eTextbooks and their use in inquiry-based curricula in Finland, and thereby increased our understanding of the support that teachers and students need in other cultures. A key outcome was that we established the technical feasibility of an eTextbook architecture that integrates concept maps for visualization and navigation (that replace traditional table of contents and glossaries) with embedded interactive exercises and visualizations/animations to support the teaching and learning of science and computing in middle schools and colleges. Finally, we developed significant STEM content suitable for two student populations: middle school students and undergraduates.
