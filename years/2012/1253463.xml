<AbstractNarration>It is widely accepted among evolutionary biologists that speciation is a gradual and constant process. As an empirical investigation of the unified species concept, this study seeks to understand how the evidence for speciation has accumulated over time, and to quantify the tempo and mode of trait evolution, in the North American group of the plant genus Castilleja (the paintbrushes) inferring if there is an order or a sequence for the acquisition of species properties, and if specific properties are more important than others at a certain times or depths in their evolutionary history. Additionally, paintbrushes are one of the most emblematic groups of wildflowers in western North America, but are also one of the most taxonomically difficult; this study will provide the evolutionary framework necessary to investigate species delimitation, and create a stable and useful infrageneric classification to aid in species identification, future discovery, and conservation. Furthermore, the proposed work will critically evaluate the evolutionary and ecological correlates of diversification, allowing for the discovery of the extent to which extrinsic (e.g. geography and/or ecology) and intrinsic (e.g. polyploidy and/or morphology) isolating mechanisms lead to increased diversification rates, and increase our understanding of the process of speciation in the heterogeneous mountains of western North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also integrates education and training across multiple subdisciplines in the biodiversity sciences (e.g. from molecular systematics to floristic research) and across multiple educational levels (from K-12 to postdoc). It is clear that federal land management and science agencies are facing a significant shortage of botanical expertise that will reduce our ability to conserve natural landscapes in the future. The richness found in the texture that the biodiversity sciences add to the natural world is where the Advanced Field Botany course proposed here will fill this growing need for botanical expertise, provide significant career opportunities to students, and enhance botanical education and research at the University of Idaho. Moreover, the collaborations with University of Idaho McCall Outdoor Science School (MOSS) faculty and graduate students will ensure that this botanical knowledge flows to the more than 2,000 K-12 students and 200+ teachers that participate in MOSS education and training programs each year.</AbstractNarration>

Fourteen peer reviewed articles representing the work of several graduate students, undergraduates, a postdoctoral researcher, and multiple collaborators resulted from this project. These papers were published in a variety of journals, including New Phytologist, Applications in Plant Sciences, American Journal of Botany, Systematic Botany, Madro&ntilde;o, Molecular Ecology, Peer J, and PLOS One, demonstrating the broad interest and importance of our work.  We collected and curated 700+ collections of the more than 100 Castilleja species that occur in North America throughout this project; all collections have been added to the University of Idaho Stillinger Herbarium, and are available through our Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria data portal (www.pnwheraria.org), increasing the value of these collections for both the research community and the public. Comparisons of phylogenetic analyses of our large multilocus datasets has revealed a pattern of repeated rounds of isolation and secondary contact, where species-level diversity seems to have been generated and maintained in the presence of widespread gene flow. As a significant part of this project, we developed the necessary wet-lab and bioinformatic pipelines for producing and processing these complex multilocus datasets, and the hypotheses and analytical approaches that are necessary to formally test these hypotheses.

The course trained 47 students in botanical collecting, preservation, identification, and curation, and included undergraduates, graduate students, land management professionals, and high school teachers from multiple different institutions and agencies from around the country.  In total, over the seven years of the course, we made over 2,800 collections, and identified and databased 2,495 of these collections, which are publically accessible through the Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria data portal (pnwherbaria.org).
