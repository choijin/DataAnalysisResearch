<AbstractNarration>This award, to be supported by the Office of International Sciences and Engineering (OISE),  will enable the participation of U.S. academic oceanographers in a program development workshop between the US and Chile. The central goal of this workshop is to bring together individuals for the US and Chile who are experts on oceanographic research in the eastern South Pacific. It is expected that this workshop will facilitate interactions between Chilean scientists from academia, the Chilean Navy Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (SHOA), and the National Oceanographic Committee, and US scientists from the Naval Research Laboratory, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and academia.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of intellectual merit, the workshop will be provide an opportunity for coordination and collaboration between U.S. and Chilean scientists that are interested in oceanographic research aboard the new Chilean vessel, the Cabo de Hornos. In addition, as U.S. scientists often coordinate with Chilean scientists on ocean cruise activities in the Southern Ocean, Eastern Pacific, and Triple Junction areas, this workshop will enable interested stakeholders to meet face to face to set future priorities in science, logistics and ship facilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A very successful workshop was held in Concepcion, Chile to bring U.S. and Chilean oceanographers together, to exchange information about ongoing and planned research, and to build the basis of further collaborations.  The workshop was held at the University of Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile on August 8-10, 2012.  This grant paid for seven U.S. oceanographers to travel to and attend the workshop.  Travel funds were provided for David Chadwell, Chris Basselt, Anne Trehu, Paty Matrai, Dale Kefer, Michael Hinton, and Maria Vernet.    Chilean and U.S. oceanographers presented ideas for collaborative research.  University of Concepcion has an interest in further developing research capacbility in Patagonia.  This growing interest could provide a basis for collaboration as the U.S. National Science Foundation installs and maintains the Ocean Observatory Initiative (OOI) Southern Ocean site at 55&deg;S, 90&deg;W.  Installation is planned for 2015 with annual cruises thereafter.  Discussion of this opportunity lead to a broader discussion of potential collaboration on ship time in the southeastern Pacific.  If the OOI Southern Ocean site had an annual service cruise from the NSF facility in Punta Arenas, Chile, for example, this could provide a means for multidisicplinary sampling opportunities starting in the Straits of Magellan and extending out to the open ocean, providing excellent sampling across gradients in chemical, biological, and physical properties.  A tour of the new Chilean research vessel, Cabo de Hornos, added to this topic by providing a look at new research vessel capabilities in Chile.
