<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, is a fundamental investigation of supported materials which focuses on oxide-supported metal/metal oxide nanoclusters, and supported zeolitic imidazolate frameworks.  Such materials are promising candidates for applications in gas capture and storage, and hold potentially novel, unexplored reactive properties.  The interaction of energy-relevant molecules with these supported materials will be probed using temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These techniques will shed light on some key fundamental questions regarding binding sites, relative binding strengths, and reactivity. They will also enable critical investigation of the chemical and thermal stability of the supported films. This work is expected to establish connections between material composition and gas binding and reactivity, enabling the prediction of structural and chemical changes in supported materials which will lead to enhanced reactivity and selectivity in gas binding.  Furthermore, the bulk of this work will take place at the University of San Diego, a primarily undergraduate institution, affording an integration of materials chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum.  Finally, a portion of the funds will be used to develop a network of female STEM faculty in the San Diego region (the "femSTEM" network) which fosters the retention and promotion of STEM women in academia, and mentors women transitioning to academia from postdoctoral and graduate positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of challenges exist currently in the areas of energy production and gas storage.  For example, carbon dioxide produced from the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels continues to contribute to global warming.  One potential mitigating solution to this problem is the filtration and storage of carbon dioxide using high surface area materials, such as porous metal-organic frameworks.  The proposed work, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, is a fundamental investigation of such supported materials for energy-relevant gas storage and reactivity. Materials of interest include zeolitic imidazolate frameworks and supported metal and metal oxide nanoclusters. The goal is to establish relationships between material structure/composition and gas adsorption, as well as energy-relevant reactivity using surface science techniques.  This work will heavily involve undergraduate researchers, and will also lead to the integration of materials chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum at the University of San Diego.  A second important aspect of this work involves the development a network of female STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) faculty in the broader San Diego region ("femSTEM" network).  The purpose of this group will be to foster the transition, development, and promotion of women faculty in the STEM fields of academia.</AbstractNarration>

First, in a fundamental study focused on surface chemistry, we uncovered evidence that the external surfaces of metal-organic frameworks differ from their predicted internal composition.&nbsp; Specifically, we found that the surfaces of ZIF-8, a type of metal-organic framework comprised of zinc metal ions and methylimidazolate organic linkers, are Zn-rich relative to methylimidazolate.&nbsp; The presence of oxygen was detected at the surfaces using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and this oxygen is likely in the form of non-native carbonates and water/hydroxyl groups bound to zinc ion sites.&nbsp; This finding is significant because MOFs are highly porous materials and under consideration for gas sorption in a number of processes, including the storage of energy- and environmentally-relevant molecules like methane gas and carbon dioxide.&nbsp; Any gases entering the sponge-like nanostructure of MOFs must first pass through the external surfaces, thus an understanding of these surfaces is key.&nbsp; Also, due to the porous nature of MOFs, non-native groups present at external surfaces are also likely to exist as defects within the structure, and this work is part of a growing body of evidence that has uncovered the presence of such defects in MOFs.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we characterized the surface chemistry of ZIF-8, we shifted our focus towards the study of gas adsorption.&nbsp; We have detected and quantified the adsorption of carbon dioxide and water in ZIF-8 films using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and quartz crystal microbalance mass measurements. &nbsp;We found that carbon dioxide entered the pores of the nanoparticles comprising the films, and that it was mobile at relatively low temperatures and pressures within the particles.&nbsp; We were able to distinguish between carbon dioxide in pores and at surfaces of the nanoparticles, and could clearly distinguish a difference in the way water binds to ZIF-8 versus carbon dioxide.&nbsp; Water does not enter the pores of ZIF-8 due to ZIF-8's hydrophobic nature, while carbon dioxide is readily taken up in the pores.&nbsp; This in-situ characterization was the first of its kind on MOF nanoparticle films, to the PI?s knowledge.&nbsp; We also studied the adsorption and diffusion of methanol in ZIF-8 films, and found that we could control the adsorption using temperature. &nbsp;Adsorption was observed to occur at external surface sites at 90 K and within pores at 130 K.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are currently pursuing methods to control surface chemistry in order to make headway towards the successful incorporation of MOFs in applications as mixed matrix membranes and coatings.&nbsp; Overall, this work also provided a significant educational opportunity for undergraduate research students at the University of San Diego, many of whom are now coauthors on publications.&nbsp;
