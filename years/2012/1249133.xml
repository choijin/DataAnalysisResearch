<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to develop understanding of the mechanisms and magnitude of heat transport upward from the Atlantic Water (AW) in the eastern (&gt;30oE) Eurasian Basin (EB), to the point where accurate projections can be made for varying lateral input of AW under different scenarios of large-scale climate variability.  Specific objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;O1. To evaluate and improve parameterizations of heat and salt fluxes due to double-diffusive convection (DDC) including the sensitivity of DDC heat fluxes to added velocity shear (e.g., mean flow, tides);&lt;br/&gt;O2. To map the spatial distribution of DDC parameters using all available eastern Arctic microstructure, Ice-Tethered Profiler (ITP) and Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) data for 2007 and 2009;&lt;br/&gt;O3. To estimate the spatial distribution of velocity shear using a 3D baroclinic, coupled ocean/sea-ice model including tide forcing;&lt;br/&gt;O4. To evaluate the relative roles of turbulent mixing and DDC processes in shaping EB upward fluxes;&lt;br/&gt;O5. To estimate impact of DDC and feedbacks with stratification and shear on the hydrographic structure of the EB (via modeling); and&lt;br/&gt;O6. To estimate the lateral intrusive heat fluxes, assessing their role in ventilating the ocean interior.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose advanced analyses of a suite of existing hydrographic data with fine vertical resolution ? microstructure, CTD, ITP and MacLane moored profilers ? taking advantage of the unique EB dataset collected over the recent decade by the international community. A high-resolution 3D regional ocean model with active sea ice will be used to quantify upper ocean shear from mean flow, eddies and tides, and provide a tool for investigating sensitivity of modeled fluxes to parameterizations of DDC, shear-induced turbulence, and DDC/shear coupling.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The major physical components of the Arctic climate &ndash; atmosphere, ocean, land, sea ice, and ice caps &ndash; have experienced recent change consistent with expectations for a warming planet. However, there is large natural variability in the Arctic climate system and the ability to model complex coupling between these components is still insufficient for reliable prediction of the future state of the climate system. This study focused specifically on deeper understanding and quantifying of vertical fluxes of heat, salt and momentum in the intermediate and upper layers of the eastern Arctic Ocean. The major challenge was to figure out how changes in ocean heat flux into the Arctic from subpolar regions can affect the sea ice cover? The eastern Eurasian Basin (EB) of the Arctic Ocean is the region of most rapid heat loss from warm and salty Atlantic Water (AW), the primary source of heat for the Arctic. Changes in processes acting there might significantly affect the distribution of ocean heat throughout the entire Arctic Ocean.</p> <p>Intellectual merit of this study is determined by the major outcome: quantitative description of mechanisms of the upward heat transport from the Atlantic Water (AW) layer in the eastern Eurasian Basin. This finding allows substantial improvement of present climate models with respect to more accurate parameterization of heat fluxes from the deep water layers to the ocean surface and sea ice. More accurate parameterizations increase the reliability of model-based &nbsp;projections of future climate under various scenarios of natural and anthropogenic large-scale impacts. Key scientific results of the accomplished study may be summarized in the following statements. (1) Double-diffusive staircases (specific feature of the vertical thermohaline structure in the Arctic Ocean) are coherent on the basin-wide scale. However, their spatial pattern has very distinct regional peculiarities in the eastern, central and western EB - see Figure 1.. (2) A quantitative relationship for correction of CTD-based estimates of double-diffusive heat fluxes for big interfaces was obtained&nbsp; - see Figure 2. (3) Diapycnal heat fluxes range from ~2 W m-2 to ~8 W m-2; the average flux is ~4 W m-2. These large fluxes confirm a critical role for the diffusive layers instability in cooling and broadening the AW layer as it circulates around the eastern Arctic Ocean. (4) A positive feedback on seasonal time scale has been revealed between the observed retreat of sea ice in the western EB in winter and the growing influence of oceanic heat, released upward through the turbulent mixing induced by winter convection - see Figure 3.</p> <p>Broader impacts of the accomplished study are linked with an increasing significance of the Arctic Ocean as a new scene for commercial navigation, natural resource exploration and governance. However, there are major uncertainties in our understanding of the primary causes of polar ocean and sea-ice variability; even the relative contributions of natural and anthropogenic forcing are poorly known. The project outcomes about observed Arctic Ocean changes were disseminated via mass media and public lectures, thus making general public aware on how the Arctic climate system is functioning at the present stage of rapid changes. The project enhanced international cooperation, which resulted &nbsp;in sharing research infrastructure, updated databases, and knowledge synthesis. 13 peer reviewed scientific papers were published on the basis of project results.
