<AbstractNarration>Workload consolidation on virtualized datacenters is one common  &lt;br/&gt;technique used to manage the power usage and energy efficiency of  &lt;br/&gt;cloud platforms. However, current solutions limit the available  &lt;br/&gt;insight into exactly how energy is consumed by the various cloud  &lt;br/&gt;tenants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to address this gap, this research develops PowerMeter ? a  &lt;br/&gt;set of mechanisms and tools that make it possible to track energy  &lt;br/&gt;usage in virtualized cloud infrastructures, on granularity of  &lt;br/&gt;individual VMs, or sets of VMs corresponding to a specific cloud  &lt;br/&gt;tenant, e.g., a customer or an application. PowerMeter is developed  &lt;br/&gt;for a 3000-core fully instrumented datacenter prototype and a 1000- &lt;br/&gt;core system based on newest-generation technology, and is evaluated  &lt;br/&gt;using representative workload mixes based on popular cloud  &lt;br/&gt;applications and publicly available cloud traces. PowerMeter will  &lt;br/&gt;provide currently missing capabilities for dynamically assessing in- &lt;br/&gt;datacenter/in-cloud energy usage, necessary to enable energy usage  &lt;br/&gt;transparency and accountability to cloud customers, to understand the  &lt;br/&gt;opportunities for improved energy efficiency in virtualized cloud  &lt;br/&gt;systems, and for further development of management methods for energy- &lt;br/&gt;efficient datacenters.</AbstractNarration>
