<AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the practices of musician-inventors in Berlin, Germany who build and modify musical equipment. Specifically, it is an ethnographic study of how networks of Do-It-Yourself (DIY) music technologists are formed and how their structures, ideas, and building processes contribute to larger discourses about the invention, use, and repurposing of technologies. The research will bring together interdisciplinary approaches to music, technology, and society with new participant observation, interviews, and data collection. The overarching purpose is to provide a cogent account of independent innovation in contemporary sonic arts. DIY music technologists and the objects they create are entwined in socio-technical systems from which many paths and outcomes have yet to be explained. The central research question here is to determine how sound technologies, creativity, and knowledge production are linked and potentially transformed through the DIY process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study investigates where the contemporary DIY ethos fits within the historical trajectory of hobbyism, amateurism, sound recording and production, and artistic and technological innovation, establishing what is unique about this specific, post-internet, post-globalization juncture. The topic probes the real-world usefulness of notions such as expertise, knowledge production, and innovation, as well as questioning barriers to access and education about technology. Viewing DIY music technology through the frameworks of Hacking and Folk Technology can contextualize this phenomenon within a broad range and scale of participating communities, revealing insights into human-technology interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research may have broad implications for issues of circulation, access, and agency worldwide, as both non-Western metropolitan sites and increasingly connected rural sites share and create new modes of social interaction involving sound and technology. This new comparative study in Berlin complements a prior three years of research in New York City and ideally precedes further fieldwork in non-Western settings as part of the researcher?s long-term commitment to exploring nontraditional partnerships for connecting technology with the arts. Ultimately, the project aims to provide an entry point for understanding technologies in various geographical regions and contexts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From Occupy Wall StreetÆs opprobrium for financial excess to former NSA contractor Edward SnowdenÆs release of confidential U.S. government documents on the basis of ethical objection, myriad forms of resistance and protest have grabbed recent media headlines and captured the public imagination. Yet beneath the radar of popular news coverage, another form of resistance is brewing in the realm of technology and the arts, linking the history of technical invention with current events in the early 21st century. This research project is an ethnomusicological investigation of "DIY (Do-It-Yourself) music technologists," a loose network of musician-inventors independently constructing instruments and sound technologies outside the context of large musical equipment corporations. DIY music technologists disrupt formal channels of production and consumption, actively reasserting the agency of individual creators and challenging notions of expert knowledge. The study examines how this phenomenon affects human-technology relationships by bridging the social, technical, and aesthetic realms through ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Berlin and New York City, two international hubs for music technology widely recognized by participants.  Following prior New York fieldwork, the Co-PI worked with musician-inventors in Berlin, Germany during the NSF-supported research stage. The Co-PI conducted extensive interviews with musical instrument builders, received technical instruction through workshops alongside other amateur-to-intermediate builders, charted the connections between coworking/hacker spaces and underground music scenes, attended relevant concerts and lectures, and conducted frequent participant observation at community sound arts venues.

Key findings include:  -   The Co-PI discovered a network of people, objects, and ideas linking not only Berlin and New York, but also international musicians who come to the city due to its inexpensive rent and cultural orientation. Such patterns of economic migration include those moving from and between Berlin and London, Scandinavia, the Czech Republic, and Latin America.  -   Besides interviews, workshops conducted by musician-inventors proved a primary site for gathering information. These included entire days spent learning how to build experimental instruments, including the "micro_blackdeath noise synthesizer," the "soundbox," and the "microgranny." The most prominent venue for such workshops was the sound arts venue NK Projekt.  -   Despite the diversity of the movement, certain objects, events, and terms were found to be central to participation. For example, knowledge of the Arduino microcontroller, BerlinÆs winter Transmediale and CTM festivals, and the concept of "hardware hacking" would commonly mark someone as a DIY music technologist.  -   Observations of gendered participation indicated that discourses and performances of masculinity are often rewarded for both males and females (with queer perspectives absent and femininity downplayed); female participation is rising but was found to stagnate after the introductory level; a critical, local dialog on female and feminist perspectives was stronger in the related media arts than in music technology, although some initiatives to promote female musical participation were identified.  -   An unprecedented number of new technology start-up companies, coworking spaces, and fabrication laboratories (the largest being the venue Betahaus) figured into the DIY music technology ne...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
