<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the collaborative research between the Richter-Addo and Shaw groups at the University of Oklahoma and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, respectively.  This research employs advanced electrochemistry techniques to probe the redox and chemical behavior of heme models bearing nitrogen oxides as ligands.  Also investigated are the effects that nitrogen oxide ligands have on metalloporphyrin redox behavior, and the effects of the porphyrin scaffold and the trans ligands have on the chemical reactivity of the metal-bound NO groups.  Spectroelectrochemistry, using simultaneous chronoabsorptometry and chronoamperometry techniques, will be utilized to derive the UV-vis spectra of unstable redox intermediates to aid in their characterization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen oxides are present in the urban atmosphere and in living systems.  Metal centers, such as those present in metalloporphyrins as heme models, regulate the chemistry of these nitrogen oxides.  This project will shed insight on both the observed chemistry and redox behavior of newly synthesized complexes containing nitrogen oxides as ligands.  The varied complexity of the sub-projects is ideal for the OU-SIUE collaboration, as it provides training appropriate for students at both a Ph.D. institution (OU) and an RUI (SIUE).  Educational interactions with a minority-serving institution will be strengthened, as will productive contributions to the Upward Bound programs at both OU and SIUE.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The simple diatomic molecule "nitric oxide" (NO) is a fascinating species that is redox active and interacts with biologically important metals such as Fe.  Indeed, the inorganic chemistry of the Fe-N-O fragment controls most of NO's biological effects such as blood pressure control and enhanced memory transmission.  Many, but not all, of the protein targets of NO in biology contain Fe-porphyrin "heme" centers (e.g., the "heme" in the blood protein hemoglobin).  It is now widely recognized that higher nitrogen oxides (NOx; e.g., hyponitrites, NONOates) play important roles in the overall bioinorganic chemistry of NO; however, the heme-NOx area is less well developed. The combination of synthesis, spectroscopy, theoretical calculations, electrochemistry, and reactivity continues to provide a wide range of educational research opportunities for students with different academic interests. Our NSF-sponsored work dealt with determining how the presence of the NOx ligands affects the redox and chemical properties of iron and ruthenium porphyrins.  The intellectual merit of the proposed activity       We developed new synthetic methodology to access previously unknown Fe-NO species of biological relevance.  We showed, for the first time, that the NO ligand could induce variable structural trans effects on the Fe-X bonds, a feature that underlines its inherent chemistry.  We also demonstrated a hitherto unreported but biologically relevant hydride attack at an Fe-NO center to generate the Fe-HNO derivatives.  While it is usually assumed that the NO ligand binds to metals (and non-metals) via its N-atom, we demonstrated for the first time, using theoretical calculations, that nitrosothiol linkage isomers are experimentally accessible.  Further, we demonstrated, for the first time, the preparation of isolable Fe-hyponitrite species that are intermediates in the N-N coupling step of the global nitrogen cycle, an area of vital strategic importance to the NSF INFEWS program.  We extended this work to the NONOate group of compounds that are known vasodilators.  In addition, we demonstrated that a nitroso metabolite of amphetamine, namely nitrosoamphetamine, could bind to heme Fe to inhibit its normal function in enzymes and other biomolecules. Our NSF-sponsored work resulted in twenty (20) primary research papers, two (2) invited book chapters, and twenty-seven (27) conference presentations.  The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity       The PI engaged in several ventures that helped disseminate current research results and enthusiasm, and overall relevance of higher education, to undergraduate and disadvantaged high-school students, and to the general public.  For example, the PI led group discussions for our in-residence STEM-to-Store Academy for high school students; the discussions focused on academic leadership, research creativity, and civic responsibility.  This group was quite diverse; for example, in 2015, the group comprised 9 boys and 21 girls from diverse ethnic backgrounds;  Native American (9), African American (4), Asian American (4), Hispanic American (5), Caucasian American (6), and other (2).        In addition, the PI participated as a guest instructor for our university's Sooner Upward Bound program for at-risk high school students from inner city OKC schools who are at a high risk of academic failure. [He taught a full 1-week of this program in 2015] This SUB program "generates in program participants the skills and motivation necessary to complete a program of secondary education and to enter and succeed in a program of postsecondary education".        At his home institution, the PI co-developed a new Learning Community course for freshmen at OU.  This non-traditional course introduced the students to research creativity, modern chemistry topics, scientific leadership, manuscript and proposal writing, ethics in science, and overall academic responsibility.
