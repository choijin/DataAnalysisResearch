<AbstractNarration>Sprays are used in a variety of technology intensive industries from microelectronic manufacturing to fire-protection applications.  Because of the complexity of the physical processes associated with atomizing a continuous stream of fluid into a spray and the difficulty associated with characterizing atomization details, spray formation and its relationship to injection conditions is poorly understood. As a result, spray related development is inhibited by analytical concessions, which rely primarily on "cut and try" and empirical approaches. However, as computer based design tools become increasingly popular, detailed atomization models will be needed for computer-aided development, analysis, and evaluation of spray devices and systems. It is essential to precisely characterize engineered sprays in order to develop models to describe their behavior and to leverage this understanding for advancements in spray technology. Building on existing instrumentation and laboratory infrastructure, this team  seeks to develop a major instrument capable of characterizing large-scale sprays (e.g. sprays used in fire suppression applications) while also providing the capability to interrogate small-scale sprays (e.g. sprays used in microelectronic applications). The Spatially-resolved Spray Scanning System (SSSS) expands on ideas from the PI's NSF PECASE research and a recent UM invention (PP: 61/548530) that allows for scanning the near-field of large-scale fire suppression sprays.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Spray nozzle manufacturers have developed a great variety of application specific injector designs (e.g. fire sprinklers). Advances in product development and engineering analysis practices have increased interest in quantifying the spray produced by these devices. These spray patterns consist of complex spatio-stochastic flow features originating at the nozzle exit.  The Spatially-resolved Spray Scanning System (4S) shown in Fig. 1 has been developed to capture the complete spatio-stochastic nature of the spray at its point of origin for documentation and analysis.  These high-fidelity 4S spray measurements consisting of terabyte scale data densities present remarkable challenges with regard to data management, test repeatability, and test timing. These challenges are addressed through integration of; 1) flow control and conditioning, 2) integral line patternation, 3) mechanical sphere patternation and 4) optical sphere patternation systems combined with automation, instrumentation, data acquisition and data analysis processes as illustrated in Fig. 2 and described in Patent 9,355,062.  The 4S synthesizes spray measurements, transport analysis, and statistical representation frameworks providing high-fidelity spray characteristics suitable for evaluation of component-level performance (e.g. sprinkler spray pattern uniformity) or system-level performance (e.g. fire suppression system simulations). A nozzle's unique spray pattern is captured through; firstl probing (both optically and mechancially) near its point of origin; and next analyzing the measured local drop characteristics (e.g. drop size, velocity, and volume flux).  Figure 3 shows that these extensive measurements leaving nothing to guess about the spray.  In fact, the measurement framework is so comprehensive that the spray can be be reproduced virtually using the 4S measurements, complete with spatial and random distributions, as depicted in the central sphere in Fig. 3.
