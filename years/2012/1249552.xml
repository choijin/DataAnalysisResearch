<AbstractNarration>Heatflow measurements using a 3.5 m probe will be added to a scheduled experiment "Thermal structure of the cascadia subduction zone on the WA margin (PIs Johnson &amp; Solomon, OCE-1144164). The probe temperature and thermal conductivity measurements will enhance the ~1 m depth heatflow determinations the main experiment will obtain. Improved assessment of possible bottom water temperature variation will be documented by deviations from linearity in the uppermost thermal gradient measured by the probe.  One day of shiptime to conduct heat probe work is confirmed, a second day is requested if ship schedule allows. Postcruise numerical modeling of these data aims to constrain temperature structure extending down to the subducting plate interface, which is related to deep seismicity patterns.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal science goals of this project were : 1) to measure heat flow using a violin style marine heat flow probe on the incoming Juan de Fuca plate, across the deformation front and up the accretionary prism; 2) to link these observations with those being collected by colleagues from the University of Washington and previously collected values of heat flow (seafloor probe, BSR estimates and continental measurements), along strike and across the volcanic arc and into the back arc; and 3) to develop new thermal models to better understand the thermal regime of the Cascadia subduction zone.  On R/V Atlantis cruise AT26-04 (July 31 - Aug 26, 2013) we made 36 successful multipenetration heat flow measurments along MCS Line 4 of the COAST survey (Holbrook et al., 2012). These measurments spanned the incoming plate, the deformation front and the deeper part of the accretionary prism. These measurements have been analyzed and the top of oceanic crust on the incoming plate has temperatures in excess of 200&deg; C.  These high temperatures reflect the youthfulness of the Juan de Fuca plate and the insulating effects of the overlying sediment.  Seaward of the deformation front very high heat flow values are associated with a buried seamount .  This correlation suggests the presence of vigorous fluid flow within the oceanic basement.  Comparisons between these new measurements and those obtained by colleagues from the University of Washington are in general agreement.   More complete thermal models of the subduction zone are being completed at the University of Washington.       Last Modified: 05/29/2015       Submitted by: Robert N Harris]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
