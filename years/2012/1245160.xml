<AbstractNarration>Project Abstract - Collison - 1245160&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building upon a pilot project that produced successful outcomes, this project entails developing and implementing a collection of 12 topic-focused studio-laboratory modules for incorporation throughout the undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory curriculum.  The modules combine a guided-inquiry model with a studio-laboratory methodology.  These efforts comprise a collaboration between four-year and two-year institutions, in order to demonstrate the transportability and effective implementation of the modules and improvement of student learning in various academic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in the development of a fully integrated studio-organic chemistry curriculum that demonstrates enhancement of student learning gains through improved critical thinking skills and confidence in the laboratory, along with more efficient transfer of course material between the lecture and laboratory.  Furthermore, the development of these modules with inherent portability and flexibility of delivery makes for customized incorporation into any undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the project include the ease of adoption and implementation of the modules by a wide variety of types of institutions and departments.  Evaluation activities include the use of teaching observational protocols (TDOP and RTOP), summative grade comparisons of students taught via the studio-lab approach versus historical student grade data, and student interviews and surveys, including the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) instrument. Results and outcomes are disseminated through a faculty development workshop for potential adopters of the curriculum, peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and a textbook partnership.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Undergraduate students often view the traditional organic laboratory experience as an isolated and ineffective use of their learning time and fail to connect what they are learning in lecture to what their hands are doing in lab.  Traditionally, an organic lab starts with a pre-lab assignment, a pre-lab lecture with the remaining lab time used for an experiment to validate the material covered. Reinventing the way in which the organic lab curriculum is traditionally delivered is a vast undertaking few institutions have the time and energy to pursue; it requires more than creating a curriculum from an amalgam of independently constructed experiments. As such, we endeavored to design and implement innovative Reformed Experimental Activities (REActivities) that holistically address the challenges of a traditional organic chemistry laboratory curriculum.  The objective of the organic lab delivery overhaul was to strengthen the foundational learning of the technique labs and create a more seamless and contextual link between these techniques and the reactions run later in the semester, all the while addressing the following student learning outcomes: (a) Improve student engagement in the lab; (b) Improve material connectivity between the lecture and the lab; and (c) Improve student confidence in the lab.  Design - Product of the Work  REActivities are administered via a published lab workbook that includes 16 lab experiences, are delivered during a traditional 3- or 4-hour period separate from the co-requisite lecture, and have both a macroscale and a microscale version. The material covered by the REActivities workbook is the same as traditional organic chemistry lab manuals; however, the REActivities delivery takes a holistic approach and avoids the limitations often imposed by traditionally grouped lab experiments. The REActivities approach comprises the following key features:  Molecular continuity avoiding silo experiments  Value-added  laboratory experience     Students reuse materials continually  Students revisit lab techniques continually  Students required to revisit their own lab notebook entries    Increased peer-to-peer engagement  Post-lab questions forcing students to connect the lecture material to their lab experience  Organized framework for comparing data with other students nearby   The delivery of a REActivity excludes pre-lab assignments and pre-lab lectures by the instructor, and is strongly student-guided with practice time incorporated so students can explore concepts and techniques before completing the formal experiment (Figure 1). Stop sign icons within the workbook require the student to seek out the instructor for validation or clarification. Simply, instructor training involves a review of the REActivity questions and experimental procedures as the basis for discussion among lab instructors. As a result, institutions looking to simplify graduate TA/instructor training will find great value in the adoption of this novel lab delivery.   Findings  In an attempt to ensure fidelity of implementation by adopting instructors, REActivities were designed to be implemented in a variety of organic teaching laboratories and the student-centered nature of the activities requires little in the way of instructor intervention. Thus, an evaluation of the implementation of  REActivities was performed to investigate three goals: (1) REActivities are more student-centered when compared with traditional (expository) labs, (2) The integrity of delivering REActivities is upheld among different instructors, and (3) The integrity of delivering REActivities  is upheld across different institutions.  Using the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP), our investigation produced four key findings when implemented at the home institution (Rochester Institute of Technology) and a local community college (Monroe Community College):  A measurable difference in the overall reformed levels observed between the REActivities as compared to related expository laboratories. REActivities are generally resistant to instructor revision. Implementation of REActivities affords instructors high potential for achieving authentic student engagement without requiring considerable levels of individual professional development.  REActivities can be implemented across institutions without significant erosion of reformed practices.    Future Work  Continued RTOP studies are planned at an additional six institutions to measure the effectiveness of REActivities across a broader span of instructors and institutions. Additionally, our preliminary data using the Meaningful Learning in the Laboratory Instrument (MLLI) shows promise in evaluating student gains in the lab. Overall, our major findings thus far suggest that using REActivities address the common limitations in current organic chemistry lab delivery by adding value to the lab experience and improving student engagement. We hope that instructors teaching undergraduate organic chemistry labs will find REActivities to be a useful teaching resource and that our approach to delivering these labs contributes to the development of future classroom materials in other disciplines, including the K-12 curriculum.
