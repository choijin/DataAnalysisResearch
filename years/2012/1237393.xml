<AbstractNarration>This project will engage and inspire the next generation of computational scientists&lt;br/&gt;through a series of training and engagement activities, including: a four-day Open&lt;br/&gt;Science Grid User School for undergraduate and graduate students; participation by&lt;br/&gt;students in the XSEDE12 conference; and supporting attendance by XSEDE Campus&lt;br/&gt;Champions from minority serving institutions (MSIs) and smaller colleges and&lt;br/&gt;universities at the XSEDE12 conference. These activities build on prior successes with&lt;br/&gt;the TeraGrid student program and OSG Summer School and expand the breadth of the&lt;br/&gt;impact that XSEDE and OSG will have with the participating students.</AbstractNarration>
