<AbstractNarration>Over the past decade, numerous groups within the broad community of sedimentary geology, paleoclimatology, and paleobiology have repeatedly highlighted the importance of continental scientific drilling to address key science questions in climate and linked earth systems.  In recognition of this sustained interest, this award will support a workshop to identify high priority sedimentary targets for scientific drilling to address key questions on Earth system topics.  The primary goal of this workshop will be to galvanize research teams to plan and begin to execute proposals for pursuing specific, high priority drilling targets, intended to address key science questions related to paleoclimate, paleobiology, and extreme events in Earth?s history.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop attracted 41 geoscientists from 35 different institutions, including universities, geological surveys, and national labs across the U.S. The workshop focused on discussions of continental drilling for research applied to understanding the evolution of the earth system, so included the broad community of sedimentary geology, paleoclimatology, and paleobiology, as well as geochemistry and geochronology.  Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts: The workshop stimulated progress in our understanding of Earth's climate and related systems by discussing and highlighting drilling-aided approaches to such research, and educating and energizing researchers in considering drilling as a means to forward their research. To this end, we requested, as "admission" to the workshop, that researchers submit mini-proposals for specific drilling projects. Through this exercise, we generated a map and list of potential future projects. We also discussed the needs of this community with respect to use of drilling technology. The broader impacts included the participation (and exposure of) 41 geoscientists to drilling discussions -- including many young researchers (e.g. graduate student and post-doctoral participants) and those "new" to drilling as a research tool.  The results of the workshop were published in three venues&mdash; publications of the American Geophysical Union (the largest geoscience organization), the Society for Sedimentary Geology, and the journal "Scientific Drilling." Additionally, the results were disseminated at the decadal planning conference of the International Continental Drilling Program (November 2013).The report of this workshop will be compiled with the other Continental Scientific Drilling workshop reports in the coordinated report to NSF that will be submitted later in 2014.
