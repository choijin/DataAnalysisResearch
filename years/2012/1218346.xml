<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to enable the creation of new human-centered computing tools that will help people effectively analyze large collections of textual documents by providing powerful statistical analysis functionality in a usable and intuitive form. To accomplish that, this project investigates "semantic interaction" in visual analytics as a method to combine the large-data computationally-intensive foraging abilities of formal statistical mining algorithms with the intuitive cognitively-intensive sensemaking abilities of human analysts. Semantic interaction enables users to inject their domain expertise into the algorithms by interacting directly with the data. For example, analysts synthesize hypotheses about a set of documents by simply re-organizing them within a spatial visualization, highlighting important sentences, or annotating in the margins. Meanwhile, the underlying statistical models learn from these actions and interactively respond to help spatially organize additional relevant information according to the user's feedback.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Semantic interaction offers a new approach to interactive visual analytics that emphasizes usability. This research will (1) contribute new user interaction and visual feedback techniques for naturally controlling algorithms via the interactive sensemaking process; (2) contribute a flexible visual analytics framework that seamlessly integrates mathematical models with interactive visualization; and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of semantic interaction, which provides a quantitative mechanism to investigate the complex interplay between human intuition and formal statistical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This research will support a broad range of applications in visual text analytics, including intelligence analysis, funding portfolio management, and literature research. Participating agencies will test the software in ecologically valid settings. The software framework will be distributed to enable others to integrate additional models and to provide a usable platform for analysts.  The project also proposes an educational and outreach agenda called "CS for CSI" that exploits the popularity of crime investigation stories to attract young students to technology research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to create new human-centered visual analytics methods to support sensemaking of large document collections.&nbsp; There are many scenarios in which people need to analyze large amounts of textual information, such as intelligence analysis, journalism, scientific literature review, digital humanities, etc.&nbsp; When attempting these tasks in a world with rapidly growing quantities of such information, people experience several critical difficulties. There is too much information to read, and they experience information overload. They must both forage for relevant information and synthesize the information into coherent mental model, but existing tools disconnect these activities from each other making it difficult to make rapid progress. They need to make use of advanced mining, modeling, and visualization tools to deal with big data, but the parameters and controls for these tools are designed for statistical experts.&nbsp; They need to express their complex synthesized understanding of the information, but must first un-intuitively transform these high-level thoughts into low-level mathematical parameters of the tools.&nbsp; How can we effectively marry cognition and computation to accomplish such difficult tasks?&nbsp; This project made significant advances towards overcoming these problems.</p> <p>In terms of <em>intellectual merits</em>, this project invented the transformational method of <strong>Semantic Interaction</strong>, which helps people efficiently analyze large collections of textual documents by providing powerful statistical analysis functionality in a usable and intuitive form. It combines the large-data computationally-intensive foraging abilities of formal statistical mining algorithms with the intuitive cognitively-intensive sensemaking abilities of human analysts. Semantic interaction enables users to focus on their domain-level expertise, and interact directly with the information in familiar semantic ways. For example, an analyst can synthesize hypotheses about the information by simply beginning to organize it in a way that makes sense to them, highlighting important sentences, or annotating in the margins, etc. Meanwhile, underlying machine learning algorithms and statistical models learn from these user interactions, and respond by helping to find, retrieve, and organize additional relevant information according to the user&rsquo;s feedback. Thus, together, the analyst and system collaborate to make sense of the information over time, but much more rapidly and effectively than either could do alone.</p> <p>This research made numerous contributions, including the following. We studied how people naturally do sensemaking of large textual information and formalized the concept of &ldquo;space to think&rdquo;, which externalizes some portion of the person&rsquo;s cognitive reasoning process into the workspace. We designed new user interactions and visual feedback techniques to naturally control algorithms via the human interactive sensemaking process. We invented novel machine learning algorithms that observe human sensemaking, model informational interests, forage for relevant information, and synthesize it within user&rsquo;s organizational scheme.&nbsp; We established a flexible visual analytics framework that seamlessly integrates mathematical models with interactive visualization, and a software architecture to demonstrate how these techniques can be plugged into big data repositories such as major search engines for broad application and societal impact. We created a prototype system called StarSpire to concretize the concepts. We expanded semantic interaction to non-textual information such as big quantitative data in spreadsheets, and created a system called Andromeda that enables users to directly manipulate visualizations of very high-dimensional data in a natural way, by simply dragging the points on the screen to explore alternative projections of the data.

Overall, the project resulted in over 25 publications.</p> <p>In terms of <em>broader impacts</em>, this project advanced several educational objectives. To support student education about complex mathematical concepts related to data analytics, we invented a novel approach called &ldquo;Be the Data&rdquo; for learning about high-dimensional data projection.

Using this system, we conducted several outreach educational workshops for students of various ages and under-represented groups, including 3rd&nbsp;graders, 7th&nbsp;graders, high school seniors, undergraduates, and graduate students, totalling 300 students. We also developed several novel educational modules about interactive big data analytics for use in various undergraduate and graduate courses, and we evaluated the effectiveness to discover valuable enhancements to education. &nbsp;These modules have already been used by over 400 students.
