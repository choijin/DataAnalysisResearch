<AbstractNarration>This award will support a comprehensive theoretical investigation into core collapse and the resulting supernovae explosions of massive stars.  The project will focus on full-star simulations in three dimensions of compact progenitors of certain classes of supernovae and long gamma-ray bursts.  The goals of the project are (1) to explore the physical conditions and processes that distinguish between various outcomes of the explosion and to understand which situations produce gamma-ray bursts; (2) to track neutrino-driven and magnetorotational explosions through compact progenitors and make predictions about explosive yield of various nuclei, mixing of ejecta, and explosion morphologies that can be compared with electromagnetic observations; and (3) to provide predictions for the gravitational wave and neutrino signatures of extreme core collapse supernovae and long gamma bursts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamma-ray bursts are probably the most energetic events in the universe, and the physics involved is still not well understood.  The project is expected to release its codes and simulations to the astrophysics community, and will also involve the training of graduate students in numerical astrophysics.</AbstractNarration>
