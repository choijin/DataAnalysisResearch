<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on two of the PI's current interests, thresholds for random structures and asymptotic enumeration, with somewhat more emphasis on the former.  Roughly speaking, a threshold is the point at which some event of interest in a random system becomes likely as some intensity parameter increases.  Understanding when this happens has long been a central concern of probabilistic combinatorics and related areas, particularly theoretical computer science and statistical physics.  For example, thresholds have been a main focus of the theory of random graphs since its initiation by Erdos and Renyi fifty years ago.  They are closely tied to the theory of percolation, a basic model of statistical mechanics dating to work of Broadbent and Hammersley in 1957.  (It was, however, some decades before the connections between these disciplines began to be appreciated).  Asymptotic enumeration of the type considered in this project is concerned with estimating rates of growth of various combinatorially interesting families (e.g. graphs without triangles or functions representable by k-SAT formulae) in situations where traditional generating functions techniques seem to be of little use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several of the problems considered in the proposal have roots in related disciplines (one general theme underlying much of the material is that complicated structures can often be usefully approximated by simpler ones), though the focus is primarily on what appears to be  mathematically fundamental. These problems are simple and seemingly basic questions that have long resisted solution.  Attacking such questions requires one to go beyond existing methods, and to find and exploit connections with other parts of mathematics.  Despite the probable difficulty of the main questions considered, recent progress by the PI and coauthors gives hope of further developments and even full resolutions of some of them.  There are also many interesting lesser (sub- or related) problems that may prove more tractable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary focus of this project was the study of (large) discrete random systems, a central part of modern combinatorics that also enjoys ties to, for example, statistical physics, probability and theory of computation.  Many of the problems considered were concerned with estimating the points at which certain properties of interest in such a random system first appear as an underlying "intensity" parameter increases; in particular, several of the principal outcomes involved understanding the intensities at which some of the classical (non-random) theorems of combinatorics continue to hold in the random setting.  (This type of question has been a central theme of probabilistic and extremal combinatorics over the last few decades, particularly the last five or ten years.)  For example, one striking outcome settled a question from around 1985 by providing a precise understanding of the intensity needed for Turan's Theorem of 1941, the result that initiated extremal graph theory.  Questions of the above type have been a central theme of probabilistic and extremal combinatorics over the last few decades, and especially the last five or ten years.  A particular merit of the area is that there is typically little relation between what works for one problem and what works for another, so that to make progress one is constantly pushed to come up with new approaches and ideas, and to find ways in which ideas and methods from other disciplines might be brought to bear.  For example, in several cases the work mentioned above led to discovery of new, general probabilistic tools that are expected to be useful well beyond the questions for which they were developed.
