<AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial support for Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar on plasmonics at Colby College in Waterville, Maine on June 9-15, 2012. The field of plasmonics encompasses the science and engineering of optical interaction with nanometer-to-micrometer structures. The Gordon Research Conference on plasmonics brings together some of the most active world renowned senior and junior scientists in the field of plasmonics to deliver exciting, cutting-edge, and thought-provoking invited lectures and to actively promote and engage in extensive scientific discussions and interaction with researchers, students, and postdoctoral fellow participants. The two-day Gordon Research Seminar, run by graduate students before the conference, is designed to stimulate students' awareness of the fast growing frontiers of plasmonics across multiple disciplines, provide an environment for initiating and building professional relationships and fostering interdisciplinary dialog and collaboration, and prepare graduate students and postdocs for the extensive interactive scientific dialog during the subsequent Gordon Research Conference on plasmonics. The NSF funds are used mainly to provide financial support for graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty members, especially from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
