<AbstractNarration>The main objective of this research is to advance the state of the art of Structural Health Monitoring&lt;br/&gt;(SHM) systems by creating novel Frequency Selective Structures (FSS) and an FSS-based&lt;br/&gt;Impediographic monitoring technique. The proposed approach is based on the concept of concurrent&lt;br/&gt;design where the SHM system is no longer retrofitted to an existing structure but, instead, it is designed&lt;br/&gt;concurrently with the structure itself. The system is achieved by implementing the idea of Frequency&lt;br/&gt;Selective Structure. FSS exploit the concept of mistuned periodic structures as a general framework to&lt;br/&gt;synthesize dynamically tailored components with self-focusing vibration energy capabilities. The new&lt;br/&gt;structural design approach will allow delivering targeted excitation to the damaged areas even in complex,&lt;br/&gt;non homogeneous components. The integration of FSS with the impediographic approach will then enable&lt;br/&gt;advanced damage identification capabilities characterized by high sensitivity, high resolution and a&lt;br/&gt;minimized transducer and sensory network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will create a transformative intellectual pathway in synthesizing novel and&lt;br/&gt;realistic structural damage identification methods of the next generation for complex mechanical systems.&lt;br/&gt;The technology will have general applicability and could be implemented across the aerospace,&lt;br/&gt;mechanical and civil engineering fields leading to the next generation of transportation and infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;systems having advanced health monitoring capabilities. The proposed technology will also eliminate the&lt;br/&gt;barriers that have prevented, to date, the experimental implementation and validation of the&lt;br/&gt;impediographic approach. Experimental findings will allow an unprecedented insight into impediography&lt;br/&gt;and provide critical inputs to foster its application to diverse fields, such as medical imaging, where&lt;br/&gt;remote non-invasive monitoring techniques are of primary importance. The results will be disseminated&lt;br/&gt;through classroom teaching, undergraduate and graduate student mentoring, community outreach, and&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with potential users.</AbstractNarration>
