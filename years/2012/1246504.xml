<AbstractNarration>This goal of this Innovation Corps project is to explore the commercial viability of software tools developed as part of the Cybercommons for Ecological Forecasting.  The IT Informatics Team at The University of Oklahoma has developed a flexible suite of modular software components for data cataloging, modeling and analysis/visualization. The Innovation Corps curriculum and associated funding will be used to: i) rapidly explore target markets with data management and modeling challenges; ii) create an actionable strategy for developing a small business; iii) packaging and enhancing existing software tools as a fee-based hosted Software as a Service (SaaS) offering, which can meet an expressed need for data collection and modeling.  As data sets grow larger, it becomes necessary to present new computational tools and paradigms to traditionally non-computational disciplines. Expanding the commercial opportunities for applying this toolset will continue to advance the usability and research capabilities of the tools, while expanding avenues for commercial application of ecological forecasting and related science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity, developing commercial applications for an existing software research infrastructure, will have broader impacts in several areas. It will provide a significant expansion of the user community for these research software tools, enabling the opportunity to enhance usability and robustness of the tools.  If successful, this activity will improve the commercial viability of software tools, thus enhancing the research competitiveness of the region.</AbstractNarration>

Specific innovations of the project center around: 1) data management; 2) distributed processing environments and 3) generalized user interfaces and user interface creation tools. Commercial applications of our technology included novel data management tools for cataloging and indexing data and metadata in disparate databases, spatio-temporal analysis tools, processing workflows and provenance, distributed processing environments and automated user interface generation tools.  While our project was born out of the ecological sciences, it has broadly applicable offerings to a broader community in need of cyberinfrastructure tools to manage data, computation and user interfaces.  Much of the work through the I-Corps process was testing this hypothesis of transferability to other disciplines, largely serving business needs.  We specifically explored the commercial applications and ability of our tools and capabilities to address specific pain points within potential customer organizations, identified through the customer discovery process of I-Corps. While we continue to search for a sustaining business model for our tools, weÆve begun to spread the approach to customer discovery and business model exploration with many groups around our campus and state. We have embedded the teaching material learned through I-Corps in both undergraduate and graduate education in the Price College of Business, the Center for Creation of Economic Wealth (CCEW), The Oklahoma Innovation to Enterprise, Inc (i2E) "Proof of Concept" center, and the Office of Technology developmentÆs business evaluation processes.  Student interns across the university are being taught how to undergo customer discovery in order to evaluate technologies coming out of research labs at the university.
