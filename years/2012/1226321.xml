<AbstractNarration>The PhET Interactive Simulations group at the University of Colorado is expanding their expertise of physics simulations to the development of eight-to-ten simulations designed to enhance students' content learning in general chemistry courses.  The simulations are being created to provide highly engaging learning environments which connect real life phenomena to the underlying science, provide dynamic interactivity and feedback, and scaffold inquiry by what is displayed and controlled.  In a second strand of the project, a group of experienced faculty participants are developing and testing lecture materials, classroom activities, and homework, all coordinated with well-established, research-based teaching methods like clicker questions, peer instruction, and/or tutorial-style activities, to leverage learning gains in conjunction with the simulations.  The third strand of the project focuses on research on classroom implementation, including measures of student learning and engagement, and research on simulation design.  This strand is establishing how specific characteristics of chemistry sim design influence engagement and learning, how various models of instructional integration of the sims affect classroom environments as well as learning and engagement, and how sim design and classroom context factors impact faculty use of sims.  To ensure success the project is basing sim design on educational research, utilizing high-level software professionals (to ensure technically sophisticated software, graphics, and interfaces) working hand-in-hand with chemistry education researchers, and is using the established PhET team to cycle through coding, testing, and refinement towards a goal of an effective and user friendly sim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collection of simulations, classroom materials, and faculty support resources form a suite of free, web-based resources that anyone can use to improve teaching and learning in chemistry.  The simulations are promoting deep conceptual understanding and increasing positive attitudes about science and technology which in turn is leading to improved education for students in introductory chemistry courses both in the United States and around the world.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this NSF project, the PhET Interactive Simulations group at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) partnered with college chemistry faculty to study the design and classroom use of interactive simulations for advancing undergraduate chemistry learning. Over the course of the grant, we developed 17 high-quality, interactive simulations for undergraduate chemistry topics. These simulations are free open educational resources (OER), available at <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">https://phet.colorado.edu</a>. The Balancing Chemical Equations simulation &ndash; currently used over 3.7 million times per year &ndash; provides a good example of this type of interactive learning tool. Visit:&nbsp;<br /><a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/balancing-chemical-equations">https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/balancing-chemical-equations</a></p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In our research on simulation design, we found that designing a simulation with <em>implicit scaffolding</em> results in a particularly powerful and flexible tool for learning.&nbsp; Implicit scaffolding is where the selection and layout of controls as well as the visual feedback provided by the simulation help cue student interactions and interpretations. These simulations create an open exploratory environment where students can readily engage in exploration, ask their own questions, and discover key scientific ideas. In the Build an Atom simulation, implicit scaffolding is seen, for example, in the choice of buckets that cue students to pull out a proton, the skeleton of the atom that provides a building framework, the labels and the mass and charge readouts that immediately respond as students add a proton. We also found solutions to challenges particularly common to chemistry visualizations, such as ways to support student exploration across macroscopic, submicroscopic, and symbolic representations. For example, in the pH Scale simulation, we developed strategies to successfully allow exploration of acids and bases as everyday solutions that are made up of differing concentrations of proton donors and acceptors.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through additional research and technical innovation, we extended these design principles to create the foundation for a next-generation of interactive simulations. These new simulations are built on advanced HTML5 software technologies that run on all of today&rsquo;s classroom technologies (from Chromebooks to iPads to computers), are easily embeddable, and provide intuitive interaction whether you are on a touch or mouse device. Moreover, these new simulations are highly extensible to enable new opportunities for research on learning, such as advances to make simulations accessible to students with disabilities or to create customizable, interoperable simulations that measure a learner&rsquo;s progress.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These simulations, and their built-in implicit scaffolding, provide new opportunities to create student-centered classroom environments using simulations. Research conducted by CU Boulder, in collaboration with a working group of college faculty, resulted in a number of strategies for effective, student-centered sim-based instructional approaches. Examples include sim-based interactive clicker questions, sim-based guided inquiry activities, and recitation or laboratory activities. Research, for instance, examined and demonstrated the effectiveness of an initial period of open play, during which students explore the simulation without specific instructions. A few minutes of open play at the start of an activity establishes student agency over their learning, decreases the need for sim-related procedural instructions, and engages student in a sense-making mode of student learning that faculty can leverage through facilitation. A collection of 37 teaching activities and resources were created by the faculty working group (facilitated by the CU Boulder team), and is available through the activity database on the PhET website. In addition, teacher professional development resources &ndash; written and video &ndash; were also created to support effective teacher implementation of sim-based lessons:&nbsp;<a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/en/teaching-resources">https://phet.colorado.edu/en/teaching-resources</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, the results of this project are transforming the way chemistry is taught and learned at the undergraduate level. In the 2015-16 academic year, the collection of chemistry simulations on the PhET website were used over 40 million times, with usage in all 50 states as well as internationally.
