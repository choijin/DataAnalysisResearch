<AbstractNarration>1266159 Iowa State University; David Grewell &lt;br/&gt;1266249 University of Massachusetts Lowell; Margaret SobkowiczKline &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the proposed center are: to improve the basic understanding of the synthesis, processing, properties, and compounding of bioplastic and biocomposite materials; to develop reliable material characteristics data for industrial partners; and to support large-scale implementation of renewable magterials. Iowa State University and the University of Massachusetts Lowell are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with Iowa State University as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in the creation of transformative new materials and processing technologies and the necessary reliable, comparable material data to allow efficient and profitable industrial use of biorenewable alternative materials. This will reduce dependence on petroleum and the release of harmful greenhouse gases. The team of researchers includes experts from the fields of polymer processing, polymer chemistry, materials science, and crop utilization. It combines a wide breadth of experience and expertise allowing a well-rounded interdisciplinary approach. The proposed center's vision is to develop the knowledge that will allow the production of an array of high-value products, including plastics, coatings, adhesives, and composites, from agricultural feedstocks that are compatible with current manufacturing systems at attractive scales and thereby promote rural-based economic development and sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will have positive impacts on the environment and the economy. The knowledge generated through research at the center will accelerate the demand for bioplastics, promoting a substantial, sustainable workforce that is less likely to be outsourced. Because much of the research will be conducted by undergraduate/graduate students and postdoctoral research associates, this center will train and educate future scientists and engineers. The center will also prepare web-based videos targeted at K-12 teachers that will provide instructions on how to make simple and easy off-the-shelf bioplastics in the classrooms. By leveraging existing activities on the various campuses, the center will strive to achieve 50% recruitment of under-represented students. In addition, by working with the same organizations and using a similar approach, the center will strive to retain 90% of these students.</AbstractNarration>

A total of 103 meeting attendees included two faculty members from WSU, six faculty members from UML, and the remainder were students, postdoctoral research associates, and officials from ISU.     (1)   Grewell and Sobkowicz-Kline (proposed Center Director and Site Director), and Mack Shelley, Center Evaluator, communicated the benefits and policies of center membership to industry participants.  (2)   Time was allocated for networking among participants at the reception, during coffee breaks and at meal times.  (3)   Tours of selected laboratories at ISU were provided  (4)   Ten projects were presented to the industry representatives, and 27 additional projects were presented in poster format. Of the presented projects, 11 projects were picked by majority vote of industry attendees.  (5)   Industry representatives described areas of interest, including:  socio-economic related issues, policy related issues, synthesis, sealing, and production of films.   After the meeting, 24 companies and organizations provided letters of commitment (LOC) for a total of $450,000 of cash and an additional $60,000 of in-kind support.
