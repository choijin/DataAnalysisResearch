<AbstractNarration>1233793&lt;br/&gt;Koch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental studies reveal that gas flows can be greatly altered by the presence of suspended particles with diameters of 10 microns to 1 mm even when the concentration of particles by volume is relatively small.  Such particle-laden gas flows arise in many industrial processes such as circulating fluidized beds and processes that use gas to convey solid particles.  Despite the importance of these flows and the documented influence of solid particles, there remains a lack of understanding of the physical mechanisms by which particles influence gas flows.  This research project will elucidate one such mechanism.  Centrifugal forces tend to expel particles from regions of a flow that are strongly rotating; the particles then accumulate in intermediate regions dominated by straining flows.  The researchers postulate that the gravitational forces acting on the more concentrated regions can reinforce the original gas flow leading to a strongly fluctuating gas flow with an inhomogeneous particle distribution.  The physical mechanism will be revealed through a linear stability analysis, a study of the growth of small perturbations in the particle concentration and gas velocity from a simple base state condition where the particle concentration is uniform and the gas is undergoing a shearing flow where the gas velocity is a linear function of spatial position.  The analytical study will be complemented by a numerical simulation of the nonlinear dynamics of the gas velocity under the influence of many interacting solid particles.  The simulations will provide a test of the analytical theory while also revealing the complex flows that develop when the perturbations grow beyond the scope of the linear stability analysis. Building upon the insight obtained these studies, a model will be developed for the effect of gravitational-inertial particles on turbulent flows.  This model will be based on rapid distortion theory wherein a small eddy and its associated particle density fluctuations are influenced primarily by a local linear flow produced by larger eddies.  The large scale flows will be modeled as consisting of alternating periods of straining and rotational flows.  The resulting statistical theory will be tested and refined using full numerical simulations of a gas-particle mixture subject to random isotropic forces that produce the turbulence.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will reveal a new physical mechanism by which gas phase turbulence is produced by the gravitational forces acting on particles that concentrate in non-rotating regions of a gas flow.  This new qualitative understanding of particle-laden turbulent flows will aid engineers designing many industrial processes such as automotive, aircraft, and rocket engines; industrial furnaces; and fluidized beds used in fossil and biorenewable energy conversion and in chemical plants.  To help students understand the complexities of particle-laden flows, the simulations developed in the project will be incorporated in an educational module teaching how the nature of gas-particle flows is influenced by particle size.  This lesson will be disseminated using SimCafe, a Wiki-based online resource for teaching and simulation being developed at Cornell.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The motion of a gas carrying suspended solid particles can be distinctly different from its single phase counterpart. Particles form clusters as a result of fluid forces and particle inertia and they exert forces that drive fluid motion over a wide range of length scales. This coupling of particle concentration and fluid flow is controlled by the mass loading, defined as the ratio of the mass of the suspended particles to the mass of the gas, and particle Stokes number, the ratio of the time it takes a particle to respond to forces to the time scale of the fluid motion.  In different circumstances, the dynamics of the particle-laden flow can be completely controlled by the particle phase (high mass loading and Stokes number) or by the fluid motion (low mass loading).   This project investigates the most challenging case (moderate mass loading and Stokes number) in which the two phases are strongly coupled and both contribute significantly to the two-phase dynamics.  Because the mass density of solid particles is much larger than that of a gas, moderate mass loading occurs while the fraction of the volume occupied by the particles is still small.  A theoretical prediction was developed for the instabilities (particle concentration variations and small scale fluid velocity fluctuations) that arise when such a particle-gas suspension is subjected to a horizontal, homogeneous shearing motion.  Homogeneous shear flow of a single phase gas has been shown by Lord Kelvin to be stable, so the instabilities predicted in the present study can be assured to result from the present of the particles.  It was shown that small fluctuations in the fluid velocity couple with fluctuations in the particle concentration in a manner that leads both to grow significantly typically reaching 100 to 1000 times the initial amplitude.  The particle concentration variations were caused by a phenomenon known as preferential concentration, in which particles tend to be expelled from rotationally dominated parts of the flow and to concentrate preferentially in regions of low rotation rate and high strain rate.  The particle concentration variations lead to a fluctuating gravitational force on the fluid that enhances the initial fluid velocity variations.  To confirm the theoretical predictions and clarify the nonlinear dynamics that occur after the perturbations to the fluid and particle concentration fields become strong and complex, numerical simulations of sheared particle-gas flows were conducted. The challenge in simulating homogeneously sheared flows is to emulate the unboundedness of the homogeneous shear.  Two types of simulations were performed, Eulerian simulations, in which coupled equations for the particle concentration and fluid velocity are solved, and Lagrangian simulations, which follow the motion and forces of many individual particles in the flow.  The Eulerian simulations confirmed the theoretical prediction that the fluctuations that grew most were those with wavelengths smaller than the distance that a particle falls in a time equal to the inverse of the shear rate but large enough so that viscous damping does not dominate.   The Lagrangian method was most effective in describing the highly nonlinear, clustered particle-gas flow that arises at long times. The Lagrangian method captures the discrete nature of the particles and introduces particle concentration fluctuations of all wavelengths owing to the random initial positions of the particles. When the imposed fluid velocity perturbationÆs wavelength is a few hundred times larger than the inter-particle distance, it was found that the continuum (Eulerian) description and the stability theory are accurate.  However, shorter wavelength perturbations grew faster in the Lagrangian simulations than predicted by the continuum description, because they were coupled with the statistical noise caused by the randomness of discrete particle positions.
