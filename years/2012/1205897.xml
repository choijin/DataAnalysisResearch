<AbstractNarration>This project is a collaborative effort between Bryn Mawr College and Ursinus College in which we are exploring the coherent control of interactions among ultracold Rydberg atoms with a combination of experimental and computational efforts.  When atoms in an ultracold gas are excited to weakly bound Rydberg states, they can exchange energy through a dipole-dipole interaction.  In many cases this energy exchange proceeds quickly enough that the atoms are essentially stationary, resembling an amorphous solid.  This leads to complicated many-body processes during the energy exchange that can be manipulated with a variety of techniques.  We are focusing our efforts on coherently controlling the dipole-dipole energy exchange among atoms by exciting coherent superpositions of initial states, arranging the Rydberg atoms in particular spatial patterns, and manipulating the geometry and timing of the electric field used to tune this energy exchange into resonance. These experiments are helping to expand the toolkit for controlling atomic interactions.  We are modeling the experiments using parallel computing resources in order to contribute to the understanding of the complex many-body interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cold Rydberg atoms provide a rich system in which to explore a range of fundamental physics that is of interest to a broad segment of the community.  The precision with which both the internal structure of each atom and the spatial arrangement of these atoms can be controlled will allow us to study many-body and correlation effects for a range of configurations.  The interest in ultracold gases coupled by long range dipole-dipole interactions has grown rapidly in recent years and is being explored using atoms with large magnetic spins and heteronuclear molecules as well as Rydberg atoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will engage undergraduates, with particular attention to attracting female students, at both Bryn Mawr and Ursinus in computational and experimental research on ultracold Rydberg atoms.  Bryn Mawr and Ursinus are small, national liberal arts colleges located in close proximity in southeastern Pennsylvania.  Bryn Mawr awards a small number of PhDs and this project will also support a graduate student.  The collaborative nature of the project will broaden opportunities for students at both institutions.</AbstractNarration>

The exaggerated properties of Rydberg atoms &ndash; relatively large sizes, strong interatomic interactions, sensitivity to external fields &ndash; make them ideal laboratories for quantum physics. Studying Rydberg atoms themselves can yield insights into fundamental quantum physics while they can also be used to model more difficult-to-study systems.

This process only works efficiently when the first electron&rsquo;s energy loss is the same as the second electron&rsquo;s energy gain; in other words, energy must be conserved. Fortunately, the energy levels of Rydberg atoms are easily manipulated by experimentally applied electric and magnetic fields. This means that it is relatively easy to arrange for the interaction to occur and, furthermore, to control the interaction by turning it on and off.</span></span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span>In our recent work, we have studied, both in experiment and simulation, the way in which Rydberg atom interactions can redistribute energy. In one experiment, we excited two parallel columns of atoms, separated by a few thousandths of a millimeter, to different Rydberg states. One column of atoms was in a higher energy state than the other column and the atoms in different columns could exchange energy as described above. We measured which atoms were in the higher energy state by ionizing those atoms and sending the resulting electron to a detector. Along their path to the detector were electric fields that spread the signal out in space giving us a magnified picture of the spatial energy distribution. We measured the energy distribution at different times and the results are shown in Fig. 1.</span></span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span>We also examined a similar system in supercomputer simulations.

Thus, if we control the orientation, we can control the way in which the energy moves among the atoms. As shown in Fig. 2, the energy spreads more quickly in different directions, depending upon the way in which the atoms are initially oriented by an experimentally applied electric field.</span></span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span>In a separate set of experiments, we have studied the ionization of the Rydberg electron.

We excited the Rydberg electron to a superposition of three states that are closely spaced in energy. To ionize this electron, a rapidly increasing electric field is applied to the atom. This field not only strips the electron from the atom, but it also shifts the many available energy levels so that the electron follows a complicated path to ionization, as shown in Fig. 3, where each of the initial states are shown in a different color.</span></span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span>The map shown in Fig. 3 is the result of a calculation on a supercomputer that accurately accounts for the signal that we measure on our detector.
