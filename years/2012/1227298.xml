<AbstractNarration>This award funds research on strategic decision making by groups and individuals in a number of economically important settings: multilateral bargaining, markets with a small number of powerful firms, and markets with asymmetric information (one side of the market has better information than the other side of the market). The common theme underlying these three lines of inquiry is the use of two person teams participating in laboratory experiments designed to mimic the environments in question.  The goal is to better understand decision making processes in these environments.  Because teammates must talk to coordinate their team's decisions, using teams provides a real time accounting of agents' thought processes as they make decisions.  The resulting dialogues can be used to sort out between competing explanations for the observed behavior.  In short, the goal is to develop realistic models of agents thought processes and behavior in the target environments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second, important, motivation for the research is that many, if not most, decisions made in these environments involve team decision making of one sort or another (freely interacting teams or advisors and advisees interacting).  A common claim is that for economic environments like those we study, teams learn to behave strategically much faster, and in a number of ways more rationally, than individuals. The research studies if this claim is valid and, if so, how team play improves rationality.  The PIs also study whether the heightened 'rationality' of teams extends to new domains beyond those previously studied by the PIs and by other research teams. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;While it is well known that cognitive ability plays an important role in economic success there is growing recognition of the importance of key personality characteristics on economic outcomes as well.  The role of cognitive ability and personality characteristic on the outcomes reported will be studied as well, with particular emphasis on how the characteristics of individual team members combine to affect team performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has several broader impacts.  Graduate students will participate in the project and will learn about research methods for lab experiments in economics.  Another impact of the research is to demonstrate the utility of using team dialogues and information about agents' personal characteristics to better understand decision makers' behavior in strategic environments. Because many kinds of social science include the study of human behavior in strategic environments, the project will be valuable to an interdisciplinary research community.  The research is of considerable practical importance as well given that many major decisions are made by teams as opposed to individuals.  As such to the extent that teams behave differently from individuals this is important to know.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Economists, both theorists and experiments, typically treat decision making as an individual enterprise, but casual observation reveals that important decisions in most organizations are made by groups.  It would be a rare CEO who never consulted other executives in his firm before making a major decision, and committees are ubiquitous in most workplaces.  If decision making by groups differs substantially from decision making by individuals, conclusions that economists reach based on the study of individuals may be seriously flawed, leading us to misunderstand how firms and other organizations will make decisions in a variety of strategic settings.  Likewise, a failure to account for the internal organization of work teams can damage our ability to understand how groups within a firm will function.  Given that models of decision making serve as the foundation for virtually every economic model used by policy makers, this implies that economists may provide flawed advice due to a poor understanding of how decisions will be made.  Our research funded by this NSF grant made a number of important contributions to our understanding of how group decision making functions in strategic settings.  The following conclusions are all drawn from strategic settings where we can identify an optimal strategy that should be followed.  (1)  In theory, there should be no difference in performance between a freely interacting two-person team and an individual receiving input from a motivated advisor.  If the advisor figures out the optimal strategy, they should be able to explain it to their advisee.  Thus, the advisee should get the benefit of two people?s insights.  We find that this is not the case, as advisees consistently do worse than freely interacting two-person teams.  This stems from two sources: advisors who have figured out the optimal strategy often fail to advise its use and advisees who receive sound advice often don?t follow it.  If advice is supposed to serve as a pipe conveying an advisor?s insights to their advisee, in practice the pipe is quite leaky.  (2)  Teams often include multiple roles, with some roles being both more challenging and more important.  An important determinant of a team?s success is getting the right people in the right roles.  It seems intuitive that allowing team members to agree among themselves on role assignment should improve performance since insiders should know who is the best fit for each job.  If all team members have a stake in team performance, they should be motivated to get the right people into the right job.  Unfortunately, this intuition turns out not to be quite correct.  Left to their own devices, teams perform reasonably well at getting the ablest individuals into the most challenging jobs.  The problem is that these individuals then perform significantly worse than they would have if randomly assigned to the same job.  A follow-up experiment indicates this reflects a negative psychological effect.  Put plainly, people appear to resent being stuck with the harder role and react by expending less effort at figuring out the optimal strategy.  (3)  Anyone who has ever been a member of a committee knows that there are some people who love the sound of their own voice.  This has important implications for the performance of teams.  We study relatively large teams (four people) attempting to solve complex logic problems.  Contrary to previous evidence, we find that teams do no better than individuals.  If a small cost is imposed for sending a message to the team, team performance improves significantly.
