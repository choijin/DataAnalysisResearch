<AbstractNarration>During HIV infection, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a type of immune system cell, exert selective pressure on the HIV population through attack at multiple epitopes. Several recent datasets demonstrate that CTL attack can occur simultaneously at multiple epitopes, and that HIV escapes such attack through multiple mutation pathways that lead to rapid selective sweeps of mutant variants. However, HIV escape dynamics from CTL attack and the effect of such attack on HIV genetic diversity are not well understood. Current models of HIV escape from CTL attack typically involve deterministic dynamical systems that model CTL selection but not HIV mutation. In a different context, HIV genetic diversity is often explored through phylogeny construction using evolutionary models that include mutation but not CTL mediated selection. This project bridges these two approaches by developing stochastic birth-death models that include both CTL attack and HIV mutation. Using such models as a basis, this project involves construction of mathematical and computational tools through which the effect of CTL attack on HIV genetic diversity can be explored. Further, novel statistical methods and algorithms will be developed to infer HIV escape dynamics under multi-epitope CTL attack by exploiting both population dynamics and genetic sequence data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are immune system cells thought to play a central role in controlling HIV infection. CTLs kill cells infected by HIV, but HIV escapes this attack through mutation. HIV escape from CTL attack is complex as CTLs mount many simultaneous attacks while the HIV population escapes through many different mutations. Currently we do not have a quantitative understanding of HIV escape from CTL attack, especially in the context of multiple, simultaneous CTL attacks. One reason for this is that current mathematical and statistical techniques typically fully model either CTL attack or HIV mutation, not both. This project will develop mathematical, statistical, and computational tools for understanding HIV escape by bridging existing approaches that consider CTL attack with those that consider HIV mutation. Using these newly developed tools, HIV escape will be quantitatively explored through data-based inference and theoretical analysis. A quantitative description of HIV escape from CTL attack is useful in understanding the role of the immune system in controlling HIV infection and, potentially, in designing vaccines. Further, lessons learned from HIV may be transferred to the numerous other viruses exposed to CTL attack.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The supported research investigated the nature of HIV evolution driven by cytotoxic T cell (CTL) mediated selection.   CTLs target HIV epitopes, leading to selection for HIV variants that can escape such targeting.  The resulting dynamics are complex and the interplay between CTL response and HIV escape is not well understood.   In an initial series of articles we developed novel ways to model HIV evolution under CTL targeting of multiple epitopes.  Unlike previous methods, we developed models that accounted for stochasticity arising due to mutation and we developed inference methods that estimated CTL selection strength across multiple epitopes.  Previous models used to analyze CTL selection strength account for only a single epitope and we showed that such approaches can be strongly biased statistically.     Using our novel methods, we showed that datasets used in existing studies are not sufficient to accurately estimate CTL mediated selection strength.   Further, through analysis of existing datasets, we showed that early HIV evolution is characterized by simultaneous escape through multiple mutation pathways and is likely driven by higher levels of CTL selection than previously thought.     Given these results showing the limitation of current datasets, we began to develop methods that exploit next generation sequencing (NGS) data to characterize HIV evolution.  Such datasets are capable of capturing HIV evolution at a fine scale but require the development of novel methods to cope with the short read length of NGS data and the resultant lack of direct linkage information.   In particular, we developed a method to reconstruct HIV haplotypes and their associated frequencies based on NGS data collected during early HIV infection, allowing for more robust analysis of early HIV dynamics than possible with Sanger sequencing datasets.  Existing methods of haplotype reconstruction depend on higher levels of genetic diversity than seen in early HIV infection, a problem addressed by our novel method.  Through the supported research, we trained three graduate students.   Research findings were published in major journals and presented at multiple mathematical and biological conferences.
