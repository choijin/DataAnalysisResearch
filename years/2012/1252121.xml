<AbstractNarration>This 5-year research proposal lays out a set of studies that will be conducted across 3 sites (UC-Riverside, Northwestern University, and Georgetown University) with 18 month old to 6 year old children to explore how the relationships that children form with fictional characters (called parasocial) in DVDs and other digital media utilizing intelligent agents influence their learning of STEM concepts. The studies, though all focused on social attachment with media figures, use different measures and different stimuli: some assess children's perceptions of known media characters, while others introduce novel artifacts such as interactional toys. Little is known about how children's relationships with characters traverse different media platforms and whether similar learning principles apply in different media environments. In this research, the collaborative group of investigators brings the developmental and communication research areas into contact with the work in the learning sciences in a series of studies examining the formation and impact of parasocial relationships with characters in the toddler and preschool years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses children's social experiences with characters on TV, DVDs, or as intelligent on-line agents (called avatars), and how these experiences can support STEM learning. Young children form strong relationships with their favorite characters. These characters can be used as positive role models for children and also have the potential to provide continuity for children as they are exposed to math and science in different environments (e.g., home, school). The guidelines and principles derived from this work should help policy makers, educators, and companies make better use of the media characters that pervade the daily experiences of children to improve STEM education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Grant Number: # DRL-1252146  Grant Title: Collaborative Research: Using Educational DVDs to Enhance Preschoolers' STEM Education     Ellen Wartella, Sandra Calvert and Rebekah Richert.     Todays young children live in a media saturated world.  According to national surveys by among others Common Sense Media, children between the ages of 0 and 8 spend an average of 2 hours per day engaging with screen media. For children in this age range, the majority of this time is spent watching television and DVDs (1 hour and 20 minutes on average); however, an increasing number of children are engaging with mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and iPads. New developments like intelligent agents are also on the horizon. These findings suggest that educational programming targeted to young children has the potential to play a major role in introducing young children to Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) concepts at an early age that they might not be introduced to otherwise. In this sense, we can view children's interactions with educational media as an early informal learning environment.  Across three universities (Georgetown, University of California at Riverside and Northwestern), we designed a series of studies to examine the impact of STEM digital media materials on young children's interest and learning about STEM. In addition we examined how STEM is portrayed in video materials in particular. And we also examined the role of parents in children's interest in and learning about STEM from digital materials. Our focus was primarily on preschool children.  First, we found that children's attachment and interest in the characters of STEM programs is an important influence on their learning about STEM from these characters.  As children grow older they tend to lose interest in media characters from the shows they watched as preschoolers and the gender of the character is more important as children grow older and want to watch characters who are more gender stereotyped such as girls wanting to watch characters who are represented by soft colors on screen and boys with darker colors.  And among preschoolers children's perception trust in the character was associated with greater learning about STEM from that character.  Second, preschool children are especially attracted to media characters who show effort to understand STEM content.  Indeed working hard at math and science problems was highly valued by the children and when evidenced by program characters the children learned the STEM content.   However, we found some stereotypes of who are likely to engage in STEM activities: unfortunately both female and minority characters are underrepresented in STEM programming.  Third, parents play an important role in guiding children towards STEM interests.  We found that the vast majority of parents (about 2/3rds) of preschool children report that STEM material is important for their children's education and their future, they encourage their children to attend to digital media STEM content and they believe that their preschool children are learning from STEM digital media.  Parent comfort around STEM is related to how much parents engage their children in informal science and math activities, including exposing their children to STEM media. Additionally, parents who do more informal activities with their children also use media more as a tool for their children's STEM learning.  We also found that parents report more comfort in teaching children about match than teaching children about science and many parents use science- oriented media to engage their children in science.  In short, digital media (DVDs, APPs ,television programming) are important sources for encouraging young preschool children's interest in STEM and parent's by and large recognize this and are encouraging the use of these digital media by their children.
