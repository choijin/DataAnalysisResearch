<AbstractNarration>Chatham University includes an undergraduate college for women, and the goal of this S-STEM project is to prepare female scholars for careers in biology, chemistry, and biochemistry.  Specifically, this project recruits and retains academically talented students and facilitates a successful transition to STEM careers or graduate school upon graduation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this plan stems from the cohort experience offered to the scholars in order to strengthen ties to like-minded colleagues and facilitate dynamic in- and out-of-class programming. This cohort experience enhances their bond to the University and the disciplines. This S-STEM project works at retaining students in STEM by providing them with realistic goals and plans for their futures in STEM careers. Additionally, a focus on acquiring skills in science-based information technology is provided throughout the students' academic tenure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts result not only via reducing the financial burden of those receiving the scholarships directly but also via investigating the cohort approach as it impacts students' career paths. This project has the potential to result in important curricular and programmatic changes both at Chatham in the Science Department and in the science education community more broadly. Plans are in place to disseminate findings through publications and presentations at conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of Chatham University's grant, "Preparing Female Scholars for Careers in Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry" was to recruit and retain academically talented students in biology, chemistry and biochemistry and facilitate a successful transition to STEM careers or graduate school upon graduation. By the end of the four years, 36 students actually matriculated into the program in four cohorts and we expect 26 of these (72%) to graduate as STEM majors at Chatham, supported by this grant. All scholarship recipients who have graduated so far are working in STEM fields.  Many of our original plans have had to be adapted to the many changes that have occurred at Chatham in the past three years (unanticipated at the time of our grant submission). Not only has the university become coeducational, we have also changed our mission statement, changed our general education requirements, and changed presidents. During the five year grant period, undergraduate enrollment increased by 47%, while enrollment in first-year science courses increased by 138%. Nevertheless, based on retention numbers, GPAs, and student feedback, the data suggest that a cohort system does boost retention and positive attitudes toward science and science careers. In particular, activities that start before classes give science students a chance to connect and form groups that help support them in their first year and beyond.   Our cohort included students in three fields (biology, biochemistry, and chemistry). Although only three of our S-STEM scholarship students switched among these majors while at Chatham, it is not uncommon and we believe that forming cohorts across majors is beneficial. Although many colleges and universities have advising meetings during orientation week, we recommend including more socially oriented activities to increase the opportunities to form connections.  Before the first student cohort arrived, we developed a survey of 50 questions designed to examine student attitudes about science. Some of the survey statements were related to technology. All the first-year students agreed that technology was important, although there was a slight tendency for the scholarship students to more strongly agree that they were comfortable with, and knowledgeable about, technology. Surprisingly, there was a decline in expectation to use technology among the scholarship students over the four years. In every group, the expectation of needing to use technology was stronger than the confidence level in their ability to actually use such technology. We also asked a series of questions about student perceptions of scientists.

We also found that this program was very labor-intensive for faculty and support staff, and that greater compensation and/or release time needs to be integrated into future efforts. As one faculty member suggested, "salary=accountability," so this must be considered so that future programs are sustainable.  These findings have been presented at PKAL and ACS meetings, and work on journal articles is in progress.               Last Modified: 09/28/2018       Submitted by: Lisa A Lambert]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
