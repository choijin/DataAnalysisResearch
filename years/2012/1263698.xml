<AbstractNarration>Chickasaw (ISO 639-3 code: [cic]), is a severely endangered language in the Muskogean family, with 70 or so fluent first language speakers remaining.  The Muskogean languages have extraordinarily complex verbs, especially with regard to the intersection of their morphology (word structure) and phonology (sound system).   Chickasaw is prosodically complex, with long vowels, geminate consonants, laryngeals (consonants produced with constriction near the glottis), pitch accent, nasalization and rhythmic lengthening, all of which intersect with a rich morphology that includes prefixes, suffixes and an elaborate system of internal changes known as verb grades.   This project will investigate these elements of Muskogean verbs.  Verb morphology is vulnerable to loss through language attrition and since all of the Muskogean languages are either highly endangered or no longer spoken, it is important to document the verb information now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a unique collaboration between the Chickasaw Language Revitalization Program (CLRP) located in Ada, Oklahoma, and The University of Texas at Arlington. Linguist Colleen Fitzgerald of UT Arlington and CLRP Director Joshua Hinson have designed a documentation project that will increase our understanding of the Chickasaw verb and make available a significantly-sized database of verbs, both in number of verbs and in the number of inflected forms per verb. This project will collect verbs in paradigms and connected speech (e.g. narratives). Analyzing paradigms will increase knowledge of Muskogean verbal structure, theoretically important for linguistics. Documenting and analyzing texts will record Chickasaw speakers' traditional knowledge and experiences in context, essential to indigenous language revitalization.</AbstractNarration>

Accomplishments for this award include the collection of approximately 11 hours of digital audio recordings of narrative and conversation data in Chickasaw and 7 hours of HD digital video recordings of Chickasaw conversation data. During the time period, fieldwork and data collection of Chickasaw verbs included: structured elicitations, elicitations using stimuli, narrative and conversation documentation, and professional- grade, multimedia studio HD recording of several group conversation sessions of fluent speakers. There are also numerous transcriptions in ELAN and texts entered in FLEx.

Activities increased opportunities in social science research for Native Americans, who are highly underrepresented in linguistics and social science. THE NSF-DEL grant products, in particular recordings of fluent speaker narratives, have had broader impacts in support of Chickasaw language revitalization. Specifically, they have been utilized in departmental efforts including the Chikasha Academy Adult Immersion Program and Rosetta Stone Chickasaw. The CLRP has taken these fluent speaker narratives and modified them into progressively more grammatically advanced stories in a beginner, intermediate, and advanced version for each narrative. These are used as vehicles for language acquisition in the immersion environment. Additionally, the program has created simplified versions of native speaker narratives and have animated them for use in Rosetta Stone Chickasaw.
