<AbstractNarration>Funds are  provided for the principal investigators (PIs) to participate in a project that aims to investigate the dynamics controlling fault continuity, strain partitioning, and interaction between multiple fault branches as fault systems evolve. Specifically, the proposed work will focus on the evolving relationship between the northern and central branches of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF). To evaluate a series of possible models describing this relationship, the project will use high-resolution multi-channel seismic (MCS) data already collected for the northern branch, and will collect new MCS data for the central branch. The data will be combined with modeling to characterize slip history, strain partitioning, and relative fault activity. Results will constrain the evolution of the NAF system and enable comparisons with other transform fault systems. Funds will allow the initial participation of the PIs on the Turkish reserach cruise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed work has direct implications for understanding seismic hazards in Turkey, and may also support a future IODP initiative in the area. It will strengthen international ties through ongoing collaboration with Turkish researchers. The PIs will continue ongoing outreach efforts. Data management includes archiving of data in various repositories within two years of acquisition/analysis.</AbstractNarration>
