<AbstractNarration>This project consists of two activities. The first will continue the operation and data distribution of observations from the Magnetometer Array for Cusp and Cleft Studies (MACCS). The second is a research program using the MACCS data along with SuperDARN radar, the Relocatable Atmospheric Observatory in Resolute Bay, nominally conjugate stations in the Antarctic and GPS TEC receivers at two of the MACCS sites. Data from the AMPERE satellites also will be used. The proposal identifies four topics: &lt;br/&gt;* Performing detailed studies of dayside high-latitude ULF waves and transient events, using multi-instrument ground-based and satellite data. &lt;br/&gt;* Providing observational and theoretical support for the recently-launched Radiation Belt Storm Probes mission by investigating the role of ULF waves in energizing or depleting radiation belt electrons during magnetic storms, in part using the recently developed ULF index. &lt;br/&gt;* Investigating the high-latitude field-aligned current structures associated with both transient events and steady convection, using magnetic field and GPS TEC data along with global data from the AMPERE project. &lt;br/&gt;* Using the combination of MACCS data with simultaneous data from both low-orbiting and high-orbiting satellites to separate spatial and temporal variations in magnetospheric and ionospheric processes, and carrying out theoretical and modeling studies of the excitation and propagation of ULF waves through the global magnetosphere-ionosphere system. This study will use the BATS-R-US global magnetohydrodynamic simulation code. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MAACS data are freely distributed to the entire science community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes Report for AGS-1265651"Studies of Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling and Space Weather using theMagnetometer Array for Cusp and Cleft Studies (MACCS)"     Space weather is the emerging field of space science that strives to understand the technological impacts of solar energy flows into the Earth?s space environment. Societally important communication, navigation, aviation and power distribution systems are susceptible to solar storms that cause electrical currents to flow in the Earth?s magnetosphere and ionosphere. Many of the large amplitude current and mass flows happen in the high-latitude magnetosphere &ndash; precisely the location of the MACCS Array. The eight magnetometers located in Nunavet in the high eastern Canadian arctic are ideally located to study space weather phenomena that give rise to magnetic signatures observable from the ground and in space.   MACCS research at the University of Michigan has primarily focused on three areas &ndash; the relationship of a class of magnetic waves (called ultra low frequency or ULF) and variations in the ionosphere?s density as observed with Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) total electron content (TEC) measurements; the propagation of ULF waves through the magnetosphere and the development of a new magnetometer system. Space (opposed to the internal Earth) magnetic signatures arise from electrical currents that are spatially and temporally variable and generated by changing solar wind driving of the magnetosphere and ionosphere. The magnetospheric cavity itself also supports magnetic wave propagation through the system in the form of ULF waves. MACCS was designed to study the interplay between the structure and dynamics of the ionosphere and ionospheric currents.  At the University of Michigan our main contributions to the project include using the global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model within the UM-Space Weather Modeling Framework to understand ULF wave propagation and solar wind-magnetosphere coupling and the connection of MACCS observations to global magnetic and ionospheric GPS TEC observations. We are beginning to develop new collaborations with the Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) operated by the University of New Brunswick to combine the MACCS magnetometer data with co-located GPS TEC observations.
