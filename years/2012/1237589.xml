<AbstractNarration>This is an award to support the Space Weather Enterprise Forum (SWEF) being held on June 5, 2012 in Washington, DC, which brings together members of government at all levels, the private sector and academia, to raise awareness, improve understanding, and to educate all participants on opportunities, needs and priorities related to space weather. The forum focuses on the costs of space weather impacts and the benefits of improved space weather services with an emphasis on the anticipated needs of the user community from 2011 to 2020. Space weather scientists and service providers seek to better understand and serve society's needs for space weather information. The desired outcome is actionable information to drive improved space weather science, products, services, and applications to serve a broad user community.</AbstractNarration>

The TCRF included plenary sessions, poster sessions, a Working Group for Hurricane and Winter Storms Operations and Research (WG/HWSOR) meeting and a panel discussion on the emergency response to Hurricane Sandy.  Conference sessions addressed the following topics: 1. Tropical Cyclone Research, Federal Agency Overview 2. Working Group for Tropical Cyclone Research 3. Federal Modeling Initiatives 4. 2012 Tropical Cyclone Season in Review 5. Joint Hurricane Testbed Project Updates 6. Tropical Cyclone Model Development and Technology Transfer 7. Observations and Observing Strategies for Tropical Cyclones and their Environment 8. Improvements in Tropical Cyclone Forecast and Warning Products and Services  9. Social Science Applications to the Tropical Cyclone Forecast and Warning Notification Problem   The Working Group for Hurricane and Winter Storms Operations and Research (WG/HWSOR) meeting was held virtually on March 4, 2013, immediately prior to the formal opening of the IHC/TCRF.
