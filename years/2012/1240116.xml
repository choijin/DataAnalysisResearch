<AbstractNarration>In this project, Dr. Barsony and her collaborators will conduct an observational survey to search for sub-stellar or planetary-mass objects in regions of star formation.  These objects, called T-dwarfs, are relatively luminous when young, and can be detected because they exhibit broad absorption features from methane in their spectra.  The research team will conduct a wide-area infrared survey to find T-dwarfs by imaging at the wavelength of the methane band and at an adjacent wavelength.  Objects that are faint in the methane band are likely to be T-dwarf stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activity will have a broader educational impact through the involvement of undergraduate students in the research effort.  Students will be recruited at San Francisco State University and at Utah Valley State College (now Utah Valley University), and will have the opportunity to visit the other institution in the collaboration.  The detection of large numbers of T-dwarfs will help improve theories of star formation, especially in the domain between the least-massive stars and the most-massive planets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        The motivation for this research was to find whether or not free-floating objects of planetary mass (less than about 13 Jupiter masses for  objects of Solar composition) are common in the Galaxy. If found in large numbers, our ideas of how stars and their planetary systems form would need to be revised.         Since  such objects are at their brightest upon formation, and quickly fade to  below detectable faintness even in the Solar neighborhood, our strategy was to search the five nearest and youngest star-forming regions to Earth for their presence.

Brown dwarfs are objects between 13 to 80 Jupiter masses that do not reach central temperarures hot enough to ignite the hydrogen fusion that is the ultimate energy source making stars shine.  At the young ages of the star-forming regions in our investigation (1-3 million years), objects with temperatures characteristic of old (5-10 billion years) brown dwarfs in the Solar neighborhood, should have planetary masses. By analogy with the cool atmospheres of brown dwarfs, we had expected to find methane absorption in the young planetary mass objects in the five star-forming regions we searched.       The methane absorption would be detected by comparing near-infrared images of individual star-forming regions viewed in special filters that transmitted wavelengths at which the methane absorption occurs, and at nearby wavelengths where methane absorption does not occur.

Despite this setback, our team developed an alternative means of identifying potential planetary mass objects in the five nearby star-forming regions we investigated.  Verification that our candidates are really of planetary mass requires near-infrared spectra of these faint objects. We have acquired such spectra, on the largest telescopes in the world, and are currently working throught the detailed, challenging task of processing the data to compare the intrinsic spectra of our candidate planetary mass objects with template and model spectra to ascertain their nature.               Two graduate students were supported and trained under the auspices of this grant. Many public lectures, spanning audiences from elementary school children, to high school students, to the general public, were delivered focussing on the research pursued in this grant.
