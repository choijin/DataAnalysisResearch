<AbstractNarration>Dr. Alan D. Chapman has been awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a research and education plan at Stanford University.  This work aims to quantify crustal fluxes associated with shallow subduction by applying modern geo-/thermochronologic techniques (e.g., U-Pb geochronology, (U-Th)/He thermochronology, and fission track analysis) to the best recognized exposure of an ancient shallow subduction system on Earth, located in southern California.  The resulting dataset will be used to address: 1) regional issues pertinent to the North American Cordillera, most notably the relative importance of subduction erosion versus trench-linked transform faulting during the Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary Laramide orogeny and 2) global questions centered on processes by which crustal materials are recycled during shallow subduction (e.g., tectonic erosion, delamination, underplating, and magmatism).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will directly engage faculty, postdocs, researchers, and students of active geo-/thermochronology and subduction zone tectonics groups at Stanford.  The results of this investigation will provide new insights into subduction dynamics, addressing questions of global importance regarding the life cycle of shallow subduction and the mechanisms of mass transfer between the crust and mantle. This project will deliver a wide range of data that address fundamental questions posed by the Subduction Cycles and Deformation initiative of the GeoPRISMS Program, the most pertinent of which concerns the origin and evolution of the continental crust.  The proposed education plan involves: 1) teaching a seminar on the topic of shallow subduction followed by a field course to Big Sur, California; 2) mentoring a high school intern through the Stanford High School Internship Program; and 3) maintaining an active outreach program through the GeoKids cooperative with the U.S. Geological Survey.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was done both at Stanford University and the Missouri  University of Science &amp; Technology (MST).  At Stanford, I  supervised Ph.D. students Eric Gottlieb and Vladislav Powerman on a  project related to both studentsÃ† dissertation work on the sources of sediments in the SW United States.  At  MST, I mentored three undergraduate students (Xiaokun Ma, Jianjun  Li, and Jing Li) working under the Opportunites for Undergraduate  Research Experiences (OURE) program in field and lab-based projects.  I am currently supervising one  MST student (Lisa Arnold), who is working toward understanding how and when rocks in central coastal California became exposed at the surface for her M.S. thesis work (to be completed in  summer, 2016). I gave two presentations (one in 2013, another in 2014) to  elementary and middle school students from the greater Rolla, MO area  entitled "Rip, tear, crunch - Understanding mountains with sandbox  experiments" and "trashcano" in which results from  this study were focus areas.  I co-led a field institute with Mihai Ducea  (University of Arizona) through ExTerra (GeoPRISMS) to Big Sur to  discuss the results of this project and identify areas of future  research in 2014.  Details of the institute can be found at the  following url: http://geoprisms.org/exterra/field-institutes/exterra-2014-salinia/.   At least 100 km and as much as 1000 km of slip has taken place along a poorly understood fault in central coastal California since the fault became active ~65 million years ago.  The major goal of this project was to test among hypotheses for the origin of this fault.  Was motion along the fault compressional, like large faults in the Himalaya, or strike-slip, like the San Andreas fault?  This project sought to address this question by doing fieldwork (to better understand the nature of the fault) and using various dating techniques (to better understand the timing and magnitude of offsetting along the fault).  The dataset resulting from this study has important implications for recognizing 1) how continental crust grows and changes in composition with time and 2) analogous systems in mountain belts worldwide.
