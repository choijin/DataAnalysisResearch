<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Knot theory is the study of knotted loops in 3-dimensional space, considered up to smooth deformations that do not break the loops.  Over the course of this project, the PI studied bridge surfaces, where a bridge surface for a knot is an embedded plane that cuts the knot into two collections of unknotted arcs.  Topologists often understand complicated spaces by cutting them into these types of simple building blocks.  The bridge number of a particular knot is the minimal complexity of such a decomposition, and this knot invariant yields a useful partition of the set of all knots into different classes.  For instance, the collection of 2-bridge knots provides a test case for many theorems -- these knots are parameterized by the rational numbers and the additional structure given by their bridge surfaces makes proving difficult propositions tractable for 2-bridge knots.  The PI studied a generalization of bridge number to many different decomposing surfaces, giving rise to a sequence of integers called the bridge spectrum.  Fundamental problems around this structure include computing bridge spectra for large classes of knots and determining which sequences of integers can appear as bridge spectra of knots in 3-dimensional space.  By connecting bridge surface to another class of surfaces called Heegaard surfaces, the PI achieved considerable progress on both fronts, completely determining the bridge spectra of most iterated torus knots, which exhibit previously unknown behavior.     The PI also made new connections between Heegaard surfaces, bridge surfaces, and other structures in low-dimensional topology.  An n-manifold is an abstract topological space that locally resembles n-dimensional real space, and a Heegaard surface splits a 3-manifold into two simple pieces.  Recently, David Gay and Robion Kirby developed a decomposition called a trisection of a 4-manifold, a splitting into not two, but three simple pieces, as a 4-dimensional analog of a Heegaard splitting.  In collaboration with Jeffrey Meier, the PI produced several important results in the nascent field of trisections.  First, he applied ideas from Heegaard splitting theory to classify all low-complexity trisections, where the complexity of a trisection is measured by the complexity of the three pieces and their intersections.  This result is one of the first to use 3-manifold topology in a fundamental way to prove a result about 4-dimensional trisections.  The PI also further strengthened the analogy between Heegaard splittings and trisections by introducing bridge trisections of knotted surfaces, the 4-dimensional analog of bridge splittings.  This work included proving that every knotted surface has a bridge trisection, and these structures give rise to new 3-dimensional diagrams of these objects that can easily be drawn and manipulated.     The intellectual merit of this work lies within the development a network of connections between various aspects of low-dimensional geometry and topology, applying classical ideas in new and innovative ways.  While 3-dimensional topology has seen great progress over the last thirty years, many problems in 4-dimensional topology remain intractable.  Thus, understanding new structures with which to examine these problems has the potential to make a huge impact.  The study of trisections is primed for great expansion, and the PI helped lay the groundwork for growth over the course of this project.     One major broader impact of the PI?s work included integration of students at many different levels.  The PI collaborated with two different graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin, Jeffrey Meier and Samuel Taylor, and both of these efforts resulted in significant publications.  In addition, the PI worked with an undergraduate physics major, Derek Davies, on another research project, the product of which is currently submitted for publication.  Lastly, the PI gave research presentations to several groups of undergraduate students at various institutions (some without graduate programs) to expose these students to accessible current topics in mathematics research.  Knot theory is a great subject for beginning students -- tangible and intuitive enough to be explained and understood, while also sitting squarely at the frontier of low-dimensional topology research.
