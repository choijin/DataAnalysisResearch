<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Charles H. Winter of Wayne State University will develop new precursors and deposition methods for the growth of first row transition metal thin films.  The project entails the synthesis and characterization of transition metal silyl complexes with optimized atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursor properties, solution reactions of the transition metal silyl complexes with complementary transition metal complexes containing other ligands to identify reactant pairs that afford metal powders, transformation of the solution reactions to ALD processes, and demonstration of copper/manganese alloy film formation and self-forming manganese-based copper diffusion barriers. This project will be performed in collaboration with SAFC Hitech, which will enable advanced ALD precursor evaluation, large scale precursor synthesis, advanced growth trials, and technology transfer to industry. The broader impacts involve training postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate students, enhancing research and education infrastructure by bringing together a collaborative group under the GOALI program that includes Wayne State University and SAFC Hitech personnel, industrial internships for Wayne State University students at SAFC Hitech, and the potential societal benefits of having new precursors and atomic layer deposition processes for first row transition metal thin films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thin layers of metals, only a few atoms in thickness, have many existing and anticipated future applications in microelectronics devices and functional materials.  However, the required deposition processes are known for only a few, first row transition-metal elements.  This research seeks to develop new molecular precursors and deposition chemistry that would enable the low temperature, atomic layer growth of these metals.  Successful execution of the proposed research could enable practical applications such as self-forming copper diffusion barrier layers in microelectronics devices, magnetic random access memory device fabrication, and manufacturing of other devices that require thin films of first row transition metals. The technology from this project would contribute to the continued miniaturization of microelectronics devices which would have a broad, positive impact on the economy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project addressed the challenges associated with the development of atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursors and processes for first row transition metal films. Transition metal thin films are difficult to deposit by ALD, since ions in the precursors have negative electrochemical potentials and are thus hard to reduce to the metallic state. Moreover, transition metal precursors used in ALD must combine volatility, high thermal stability, and high reactivity toward a reducing precursor to afford the metallic films. Major discoveries in this project included the development of new transition metal ALD precursors that contain 1,2,5-triazapentadienyl ligands, discovery of low energy decomposition reactions of [ZnX(Si(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>)]<sub>2</sub> to afford zinc metal and XSi(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (where X is halogen), ALD growth of titanium metal films using TiCl<sub>4</sub> and the new strong organic reducing agents 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-2-methyl-2,5-cyclohexadiene (compound <strong>1</strong>) or 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1,4-dihydropyrazine (compound<strong> 2</strong>), ALD growth of high purity cobalt metal films using bis(1,4-di-<em>tert</em>-butyl-1,3-diazadiene)cobalt(II) and formic acid, ALD growth of cobalt and nickel metal films using bis(1,4-di-<em>tert</em>-butyl-1,3-diazadiene)cobalt(II) and bis(1,4-di-<em>tert</em>-butyl-1,3-diazadiene)nickel(II) with ammonia or alkylamines, selective ALD growth of cobalt metal films on metallic substrates using bis(1,4-di-<em>tert</em>-butyl-1,3-diazadiene)cobalt(II) and formic acid, and the growth of manganese borate and cobalt borate films using MnTp<sub>2</sub> or CoTp<sub>2</sub> (where Tp is tris(pyrazolyl_borate) with ozone. These new precursors and processes are of immediate use to the microelectronics industry, which requires ALD-grown transition metal films to&nbsp;keep pace with demands for increased performance in consumer electronics. This work was carried out as a GOALI grant in partnership with SAFC Hitech, which is a major world-wide electronics chemical supplier. SAFC Hitech assisted in this project by scaling up precursor syntheses and marketing the new precursors and processes to the world-wide microelectronics industry. To date, three active patent licenses have resulted from this project. One more license is currently being negotiated. Two graduate students who worked on this project spent three month internships at SAFC Hitech in Haverhill, Massachusetts. These internships were part of the education paln for the project, and were transformational for the students. Both students returned with much clearer perspectives on ALD precursor development, and were much more focused on their research. This project also supported a minority undergraduate chemistry student, who is now enrolled in dental school.</p> <p>Several transformational discoveries resulted from this project. A formal comproportionation reaction was documented between Zn(Si(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and ZnX<sub>2</sub>. This process occurs by ligand exhange, and thus it is better described as reductive elimination of XSi(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> from [ZnX(Si(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>)(THF)]<sub>2</sub>. Zinc(II) is a good model for transition metal(II) ions, since its size is similar and its electrochemical potential is intermediate between iron(II) and chromium(II). Accordingly, the results with zinc strongly suggest that metal ALD processes based upon formal comproportionation reactions between M(Si(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and MX<sub>2 </sub>should afford the metallic films. This represents a completely new approach for the ALD growth of metallic transition metal films. Discovery of silyl elimination reactions to reduce transition metal ions to the metallic states led to the discovery of the very novel reducing agents <strong>1</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>2</strong>, and related structures. Initial film deposition studies led to the growth of titanium, nickel, and cobalt metal films. Discovery of these reducing agents is very important, since the central challenge in the ALD growth of metallic first row transition metal and element films at low temperatures is the current lack of strong reducing co-reagents. Significant new ALD processes for cobalt and nickel metal films were developed using bis(1,4-di-<em>tert</em>-butyl-1,3-diazadiene)metal(II) (where metal is cobalt or nickel) and formic acid, ammonia, or alkyl amines. These processes give high quality metal films with high growth rates. There are currently very few ALD processes available for cobalt and nickel metal films. There has been considerable industrial interest in these processes, since ALD must be used to grow these metals for future applications.
