<AbstractNarration>Microbial activities at the microscale influence biogeochemical cycles at the ocean-basin scale. Motility and chemotaxis - the sensing of resource gradients and subsequent movement toward them - may enable bacteria to use microscale nutrient resource patches for maintenance and growth. Indeed, some marine bacteria can markedly outperform the classic chemotaxis model organism Escherichia coli, which suggests that advanced chemotaxis strategies have evolved in the marine environment. However, attaining a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and ecological roles of bacterial chemotaxis remains a major challenge in microbial oceanography, especially given enormous genetic diversity among marine bacteria. This research will tackle this challenge within three overarching hypotheses:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) The community composition of chemotactic bacteria shifts as motility increases in response to nutrient inputs.&lt;br/&gt;2) Resource gradients trigger the partitioning of a natural bacterial assemblage into subcommunities, as evidence of niche specialization through chemotaxis.&lt;br/&gt;3) Planktonic particles attract ephemeral bacterial swarms, the dynamics of which are dependent on the sensing and chemotactic capabilities of nearby cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include development of new molecular tools that will be of interest to the research community. The investigator will continue long-term involvement as a volunteer for the National Ocean Science Bowl (NOSB), an outreach program to help high school students from diverse backgrounds prepare for an ocean-themed academic competition. Additional activities include mentoring undergraduate students through an institutional program, teaching, and development of an education videogame on marine microbes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (OCE PRF) program, with goals to support novel research by early career scientists and increase the diversity of the U.S. ocean sciences workforce and research community. With OCE-PRF support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to ocean sciences and broaden participation of under-represented groups in the ocean sciences.</AbstractNarration>

These detailed fingerprints of the bacterial response provide a unique view of the consequences of point-releases of DOM in the ocean. Bacterial chemotactic clusters lasted from ~1 min to 1 h, extended to a distance of 2 mm from the diatom (the æphycosphereÆ), and frequently reached cell concentrations &gt;100-fold above background. In some cases, distinct clusters accumulated at multiple loci on a single diatom chain, illustrating patchiness within patchiness as a signature of the microscale heterogeneity in the DOM release by the diatom.   The measured spatiotemporal distribution of bacteria was used as input to a mathematical model that quantifies (i) the fate of DOM released from the diatom &ndash; whether used in the vicinity of the diatom or diffusing beyond the phycosphere (where non-motile bacteria are the dominant consumers); and (ii) the relative DOM consumption by chemotactic and non-motile bacteria, a metric for the consequences of chemotaxis on bacterial consumption of DOM from primary producers. Model results predict that most DOM released from a diatom can be consumed rapidly (&lt;10 min) by chemotactic bacteria in the phycosphere (&lt;1 mm from the diatom) under typical marine conditions, but that the DOMÆs fate strongly depends on DOM type (i.e. diffusivity), concentration of motile and non-motile bacteria, and their uptake kinetics.   The fundamental value of this work resides in presenting a robust, mechanistic approach &ndash; integrating high-resolution observations into a predictive mathematical framework &ndash; for the quantification of bacterial consumption of DOM from primary producers.
