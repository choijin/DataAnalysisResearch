<AbstractNarration>This action funds Maximo Andrew Navarro of University of Central Florida to conduct a research project, entitled "Spontaneous shape and phase changes over time in Lanthanum-based Perovskite crystal structures," during the summer of 2012 at National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The host scientist is Dr. Sanboh Lee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lanthanum cobaltite is the parent compound of the system that is a mixed electronic and oxide-ion conductor of technical interest for oxygen separation membranes, the cathode of solid oxide fuel cells, oxygen sensors, and catalysis.  The Intellectual Merit of this research project lies in the insight gained from measuring physical properties and behaviors of lanthanum cobaltite under specific types of mechanical stresses, including tensile, microhardness, and nanoindentation tests. The experiments also address the phase changes that lanthanum cobaltite in specific environments and conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
