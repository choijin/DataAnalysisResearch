<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the 21st International Workshop on Electromagnetic (EM) Induction in the Earth.  This workshop is sponsored every two years by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) and is the primary forum for earth scientists in the world to share their EM research and plan international cooperative experiments.  The workshop will be held in Darwin, Australia in July, 2012 and will be hosted by the Australian Society of Exploration Geophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EM measurements provide a unique view of the Earth because of the sensitivity of electrical conductivity to temperature, fluids, ore minerals, and lithologic variations.  This sensitivity is important in monitoring environmental problems, exploring for energy and mineral occurrences, studying the interior structure of the Earth and other planets, and  investigating regions of potential natural and man-made hazards (e.g., seismic, volcanic, unexploded ordinance).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support is being provided by the PI?s Australian colleagues from Australian organizations and international companies to help defray costs of the convention center rental, publication and publicity expenses, materials for participants, local transportation, and audiovisual equipment.  The largest portion of the NSF funds will support travel for students and young scientists.  There will also be support for a few senior scientists from developing countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The electromagnetic induction workshops (EMIW), organized by Working group I.2 of the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aerononmy (IAGA), Division-I, provide a venue for electromagnetic (EM) geophysics researchers from around the world to present and discuss recent progress in this geophysical specialty.  The workshops have been held every two years in countries around the world since 1972.  The purpose of this grant was to provide partial support for students and early career scientists to attend the 21st EMIW, held in Darwin, Australia on 25-31 July, 2012.  Presentations at the meeting were organized into nine scientific sessions, covering basic theory, numerical modeling, hardware, data processing and interpretation, as well as applications of the methods to a wide spectrum of Earth science problems, from applied resource exploration (e.g., geothermal, mining, petroleum and groundwater) to more basic studies of geodynamic, tectonic, and magmatic processes at regional and global scales.  A specific objective of this NSF project was to increase participation of young scientists from the US in the field of EM induction.   Retirements over the past decade or so had led to a decline in the number of US students working in this geophysical specialty, just as the importance of EM methods in geological research has increased.  We advertised the availability of funding for young US scientists widely, and gave preference to eligible US participants for support.  As a result, we were able to provide substantial support to all qualifying US applicants. Participation of students in this meeting (significantly enhanced by this grant) is a critical component in developing a new generation of first-rate researchers and applied practitioners.   With an aggressive strategy of advertising availability of funds for US students we have significantly increased participation of US students.   This is likely to pay important dividends down the road with regard to human resources in this important but esoteric geophysical specialty.
