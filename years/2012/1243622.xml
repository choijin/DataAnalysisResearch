<AbstractNarration>"Assessing the Impact of Technology-Aided Participation and Mentoring on Transformative Interdisciplinary Research:  A Data-Based Study of the Incentives and Success of an Exemplar Academic Network" uses computational analysis, data extraction, and social networking analysis to embark on the first large-scale study of the interplay of cyberinfrastructure and scholarly communication in an academic peer-produced network.  The exemplar virtual institution studied is the Humanities, Arts, Sciences and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC or "haystack"), a network of over 9000 educators dedicated to innovative, technology-aided forms of collaborative research and teaching.  Formed in 2002, HASTAC, now headquartered at Duke University in the Ph.D. Lab in Digital Knowledge, is currently adding 200-300 new members a month.  The study mobilizes six years of the extensive HASTAC data pool, including the 176MB MySQL database of individual and institutional member profiles, for social networking analysis, data extraction, text and content analysis, and procedural and organizational analysis.  It provides critically needed evidence for the current and future capacities of institutions to support the interdisciplinary collaborations essential to meet the Grand Challenges (such as energy, water sustainability, or human sciences and policy design) confronting the world, especially those requiring collaboration among scientists working with humanists and social scientists trained to confront the societal and cultural factors that deter the implementation of scientific and technological solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the unique interdisciplinary nature of HASTAC as a virtual organization and the fact that this is a first, exploratory study of its extensive, accessible, anonymized "clean" individual and institutional data (in a Drupal database), this is a transformative, high-impact early-stage study for which EAGER was designed.  Because one focus of the study is the 522 current students and recent alumni (80% graduate, 20% undergraduate) in 63 disciplines and departments on small scholarships from over 120 supporting institutions, the study will also test the hypothesis that networked interdisciplinary young scholars outcompete more traditional peers, another first commensurate with the EAGER mission of transformative knowledge with the potential for maximum impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the project include modeling a method by which cyberfrastructure can enable successful collaborative research adaptable to other problem-based research centers and scalable to other projects, such as NSF-funded Science of Learning Centers (SLC); determining the best incentives for risk-taking early career interdisciplinary research; and calculating how voluntary, scholarly networking and virtual mentoring support and promote early-stage researchers in both scholarly innovation and high-prestige academic achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the study is in addressing one of the most urgent structural problems in higher education and one on which there is little quantitative, data-based research: how to incentivize and support the range of cross-disciplinary researchers who must work together successfully in order to solve society?s biggest problems.  At its broadest, it is anticipated that the study will intervene in current theories of organizational behavior, social media protocols, disciplinary and interdisciplinary formation, and self-governing systems, and lay the groundwork for increased collaborations dedicated to tackling the major problems and Grand Challenges of the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[HASTAC's EAGER grant, "Assessing the Impact of Technology-Aided Participation and Mentoring on Transformative Interdisciplinary Research: A Data-Based Study of the Incentives and Success of an Exemplar Academic Network," embarked on the first large-scale study of the interplay of cyberinfrastructure and scholarly communication in an academic peer-produced network. The exemplar virtual institution studied is the HASTAC network comprised of 13,000+ educators, scholars, and leading-edge thinkers dedicated to innovative, technology-aided forms of collaborative research and teaching.   HASTAC is the worldÆs first and oldest academic social network, begun in 2002, before MySpace, Facebook, or the oldest scientific social network, NanoHub.     The study mobilized six years of HASTAC data, including a 176MB MySQL database of individual and institutional member profiles and additional collected data on 868 current students and recent alumni in the HASTAC Scholars program.  The data was subjected to social networking analysis, computational analysis, data extraction, text and content analysis, and procedural and organizational analysis.     The intellectual merits of the project included modeling a method by which cyberfrastructure can enable successful collaborative research adaptable to other problem-based research centers and scalable to other projects, such as NSF-funded Science of Learning Centers (SLC); determining the best incentives for risk-taking early career interdisciplinary research; and calculating how voluntary, scholarly networking and virtual mentoring support and promote early-stage researchers in both scholarly innovation and high-prestige academic achievement.     The broader impact of the study is in addressing one of the most urgent structural problems in higher education and one on which there is little quantitative, data-based research: how to incentivize and support the range of cross-disciplinary researchers who must work together successfully in order to solve societyÆs biggest problems. It provides evidence for the current and future capacities of institutions to support the interdisciplinary collaborations essential to meet the Grand Challenges (such as energy, water sustainability, or human sciences and policy design) confronting the world, especially those requiring collaboration among scientists working with humanists and social scientists trained to confront the societal and cultural factors that deter the implementation of scientific and technological solutions.    The goals of the project focused on the incentives and disincentives of scholarly collaboration, data extraction and analysis, and peer participation and feedback. Primary research questions considered       how voluntarism organizes and structures academic discourse, with cyberinfrastructure allowing for an intellectual architecture that exists outside silos in higher education;   the motivations for peer-networking and knowledge-sharing in online spaces, especially for early-career professionals for whom the rewards of such extra-institutional collaboration can seem unclear;   how virtual peer-mentorship contributes to career development, including risk taking;   if and how networked young professionals "outcompete" those whose work remains fixed in more hierarchical, linear disciplinary professional structures; and   what factors incentivize or disincentivize collaboration; and   how discourse online translates into cyberinfrastructural transformation (such as institutional impacts, pedagogical applications, research impacts, or tool management or deployment).      Findings included:    Scholarly networks associated with academic output: Analysis between online social networking and offline academic scholarship found considerable cross-pollination between activities. Results indicated that Scholars dedicated to interdisciplinary work presented a higher level of co-authorship on academic works compared to peers with intradisciplinary backgr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
