<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project addresses the need for ocean observational techniques which was highlighted by the recent Deepwater Horizon incident. The proposed project investigates heterogeneous ocean robots (including wave gliders, unmanned surface vessels, and autonomous underwater vehicles) to detect and monitor the propagation of oil plumes. Specific objectives include: 1) the development of a distributed multi-robot cooperative deployment algorithm using partial differential equation (PDE) based methods that match the oceanographic model of oil transport, 2) the development of authentic dynamic model of the new wave glider platform to incorporate in the cooperative control, and 3) assessing the potential advantages of innovative algorithms through simulations and experimental demonstration in a coastal experiment using a network of ocean robot platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed project will provide novel algorithmic and software support for collective sensing, and address a pressing real-world need for better sensing of underwater hydrocarbon plumes. The techniques developed in the proposal will have long-term impacts in underwater exploration such as oceanographic survey and energy production in deep water. The results may also potentially benefit other environmental monitoring tasks with underlying diffusion and advection processes, such as weather event tracking and climate prediction. The planned work will integrate research projects with education activities through robot-centric undergraduate and graduate education, robotics competition, short course and workshop development, and outreach to K-12 education. Partnering with the Stevens' Center for Innovation in Engineering and Science Education, the project will showcase the proposed research in the curriculum of the Stevens Build IT Underwater Robotics Scale-Up for STEM Learning and Workforce Development Project awarded by NSF.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to create a way for robot teams to work together to manage ocean pollution.  For example, a team of robots, working at the surface and underwater, could automatically find and follow an oil spill.  The robots would provide a much more detailed picture of how the oil is moving in both space and time - critical information for decision makers tasked with responding to such events.  Responding to pollution events in the ocean environment is dull, dirty and dangerous which makes it an excellent application for robotics.  One reason that robots are not currently used this way is that the ocean environment is complex, making it challenging for autonomous machines to make their own decisions about how to monitor the environment.  This work focused on this aspect of the challenge by proposing a new method for robot teamwork and making experimental observations of the results.  The important results of this work are threefold.  First, we have described a new method for multiple robot coordination that takes into account a model of the ocean environment.  Second, we have experimentally deployed a team of two ocean robots off the coast of Hawaii to demonstrate this approach using inert tracer dye as a surrogate for pollution.   Third, the experimental results suggest that there is a gap between our current descriptions of fine-scale pollution dynamics and the models necessary to test and evaluate these robotic tools.  This work has supported a collaboration between Stevens Institute of Technology and the University of Hawaii that has included two faculty, two postdocs, four graduate students and four undergraduate students.    Videos of our experimental work can be found at...  https://vimeo.com/channels/511795       Last Modified: 11/24/2015       Submitted by: Brian S Bingham]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
