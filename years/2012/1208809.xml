<AbstractNarration>The tree of life links all biodiversity through a shared evolutionary history. This project will produce the first online, comprehensive first-draft tree of all 1.8 million named species, accessible to both the public and scientific communities. Assembly of the tree will incorporate previously published results, with strong collaborations between computational and empirical biologists to develop, test and improve methods of data synthesis. This initial tree of life will not be static; instead, the investigators will develop tools for scientists to update and revise the tree as new data come in. Early release of the tree and tools will motivate data sharing and facilitate ongoing synthesis of knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological research of all kinds, including studies of ecological health, environmental change, and human disease, increasingly depends on knowing how species are related to each other. Yet there is no single resource that unites knowledge of the tree of life. Instead, only small parts of the tree are individually available, generally as printed figures in journal articles. This project will provide the global community of scientists who study the tree of life with a means to share and combine their results, and will enable large-scale studies of Earth's biodiversity. It will also create a resource where students, educators and citizens can go to explore and learn about life's evolutionary history.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The tree of life describes the relatedness of all life forms on earth. The Open Tree of Life project built the first complete tree of life available online for anyone to browse, search, and download (https://tree.opentreeolife.org). We built this tree by developing new algorithms to synthesize a tree of life from smaller input trees, and then creating a website where people could upload published phylogenetic trees. Then, every time we re-run the algorithms, we incorporate newly published and uploaded knowledge about the tree of life. In this way, the Open Tree of Life is not a static website, but is instead constantly evolving in light of new research. On the Open Tree of Life website, you can browse the tree and see not only the structure, but the research that supports and / or conflicts with the displayed relationships (see Figure 1). In addition to the website and tools for synthesizing the tree, we also developed software to combine taxonomies (classifications), methods to track history of user edits to the input trees, and programming libraries to interface with the OpenTree data. All of the data and software produced by the project is publicly available for re-use with Open Source / Open Data licenses, and we also provide programmatic access to our data. This has allowed many other projects to incorporate our tree of life in order to organize, visualize, and analyze biodiversity, and has allowed educators to use the tree in classrooms and museums. Open Tree of Life interacts with the broader community and public through Twitter (4500 followers) and Facebook (1600 followers).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/10/2018<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;S&nbsp;Manos</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1208809/1208809_10173628_1539198618914_Unknown--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1208809/1208809_10173628_1539198618914_Unknown--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Example from the mammals"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1208809/1208809_10173628_1539198618914_Unknown--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Example from the mammals"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Browsing the Open Tree of Life: A clade in Mammals that is the most recent common ancestor of Cetartiodactyla (whales and even-toed ungulates) and Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates).
