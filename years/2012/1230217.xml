<AbstractNarration>The NSF Sustainable Energy pathways (SEP) Program, under the umbrella of the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) initiative, will support the research program of Prof. Luping Yu and co-workers at the University of Chicago, Prof. Yang Yang and co-workers at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and Prof. Lin Chen and co-workers at Northwestern University. The objective of this multidisciplinary collaborative project is to develop organic solar cells with power conversion efficiency competitive with amorphous inorganic solar cells.  Novel materials (both donor and acceptor materials) with the best power conversion efficiencies and controlled absorption windows will be synthesized.  Detailed structural and spectroscopic studies will be performed to probe and understand exciton generation, charge separation, and transport mechanism in these newly developed materials, which will form the foundation for device fabrication.  Novel geometries of tandem solar cells will be developed to maximize solar energy conversion.  Close collaborations with active feedback among the team will lead to rapid realization of the research goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall viability of organic photovoltaics (OPV) as a sustainable energy technology will be assessed based on their environmental, health, and economic impacts via collaboration with a Dr. Peter Sinsheimer on urban planning, Prof. Zhu Yifang on public health, and Mr. Timothy Malloy on societal impact.  Issues associated with technology diffusion and possible commercial, institutional, legal, policy, technological, and cultural barriers associated with the design, development, and adoption of new sustainable technologies will be evaluated experimentally and/or based on viable models.  This collaborative effort will be used as a platform to attract underrepresented undergraduate students to the research area of sustainable energy pathways.  The project will provide great opportunity to educate and train graduate students and postdoctoral associates in system-based research in the area of sustainable energy pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this project succeeds, it will result in alternative solar energy harvest materials and devices that can be manufactured in an environmentally friendly approach, with flexibility, and at a low cost. It will change the landscape of renewable energy and exert significant impact on sustainable economic development and environmental protection.  The resulting technology may penetrate into our daily life, as it may be used in a wide range of electronic devices like portable battery chargers, energy saving computer displays, and house decorations. Students working on this project will be prepared to become leaders in renewable energy research and development.</AbstractNarration>

Detailed structural and spectroscopic studies have been carried out to probe and understand exciton generation, charge separation and transport mechanism in new materials and new cell architectures in the NWU team.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The intellectual merit of the outcome</strong>: Through the works of the project, we have gained following understanding in synthetic chemistry, photoinduced charge transfer, novel device concepts and energy policy/economical impacts related to OPV devices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>1) Correlating energy levels of building blocks with high device performance</strong>: Rational design strategies for controlling the energetics of conjugated &ldquo;donor-acceptor&rdquo; copolymers allows to employ donor-acceptor LUMO-LUMO energy-level tuning. We investigated the effect of local copolymer block energetics on the fundamental OPV processes in<strong> PTRn </strong>polymers (Figure 1) and demonstrated that local copolymer block energetics drastically affect the ultrafast generation of free charge carrier and trap state populations. &nbsp;An almost complete reversal was observed in the efficient generation of free-charge in <strong>PTB7</strong> to the ultrafast creation of trapped pseudo charge transfer states (Figure 2) even the driving force predicts a PCE increase.&nbsp; This study demonstrated that the previously viewed key factor of the &ldquo;driving force&rdquo; for the exciton splitting alone cannot predict the PCEs while intra-repeating unit energy tuning is crucial to avoid the trap generation in &ldquo;donor-acceptor&rdquo; copolymers for high device performance (Figures 1&amp;2).</p> <p><strong>2) Role of the local transition dipole moment in polymers for high performance devices</strong>: We found previously that a key difference between homopolymers and charge transfer polymers is the local charge density distribution.&nbsp; The local charge asymmetry in the latter promotes the exciton splitting which enabled the electron and hole existence even for polymer in solution. We investigated the role of the transition dipole moment charge in a new series of polymers which intended to expand the transition dipole moment ?&micro;<sub>ge</sub> vs. device power conversion efficiency PCE range in order to obtain the full range (Figure 3). We can reason that a higher ?&micro;<sub>ge</sub> implies a larger displacement of the hole-electron pair in an exciton, but the introduction of strong electron withdrawing group simultaneously enhances the polarizability of excitons and lowers the polymer LUMO energy. The ultrafast spectroscopic results confirmed such hypothesis (see Figure 4). These results seem to indicate that an optimized polarizability in polymer repeating units is achieved with a dipolar change around 4 Debye (Figure 4).</p> <p><strong>3) Ternary cell operating echanisms:</strong> We investigated ultrafast exciton dynamics of ternary OPV systems where a highest possible PCE in devices was achieved. Ultrafast transient absorption measurements on the ternary BHJ films (PTB7+PDI2+PCBM) can be used to rationalize the reason for the PCE enhancement from 7.45% to 8.22% (Figures 5c&amp;d). The main difference between the binary and ternary systems is the population of the CT state which is likely to contribute to the geminate recombination after the hole and electron are separated from the exciton splitting. Apparently, PDI2, the second polymer, is able to reduce the CT population and minimize the geminate recombination.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The broader impacts</strong>:&nbsp; The proposed research activity brings impact to the national and global effort in developing new and sustainable energy strategy.&nbsp; Knowledge gained from this project has already impacted chemistry, material science, device engineering and energy policy and even entrepreneurship through our publications and presentations.&nbsp; The project has offered trainings to young scientists, and students/postdoctoral researchers become experienced in solar energy research and aware of future scientific and societal challenges. This grant supported two postdoctoral research associates (Zhiwei Lin and Bill Pandit, both working in Ultrafast Systems, Inc.), one Master student (Meghan Orr, a female underrepresented minority, now a senior chemist in NAMSA) as well as two undergraduate students (no cost, Han Lin Rong and Julie Bloom) and one visiting student (no cost, Shiyu Yao from Jilin University, China).&nbsp; The results from the project have been published in scientific journals, with six published papers and a couple more in progress. The PI and students/postdoctoral associates have given seminars in conferences and been invited to institutions for lectures.&nbsp; The PI (Chen) has been appointed as a Senior Editor for ACS Energy Letters due to her expertise partially gained from the project.</p> <p><strong>Summary </strong></p> <p>Through cooperation among with other PIs in the OPV field, the Northwestern team has six research articles, given 11 invited lectures on the new progress resulted from the studies from the project. In particular, the results dissimilated from the studies will advance our knowledge for the insight into the fundamental steps of OPV operations which were unknown before. &nbsp;Our work produced by this grant will continue to provide a strong foundation to the study of polymer photovoltaics as this field continues to mature.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/31/2016<br>      Modified by: Lin&nbsp;X&nbsp;Chen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1230217/1230217_10210424_1477936794665_Figure5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1230217/1230217_10210424_1477936794665_Figure5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1230217/1230217_10210424_1477936794665_Figure5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">a) Polymer structures; b) energy diagram for all components in the device; c) ultrafast transient optical spectra of neat, binary and ternary systems at 1 ps time delay; and d) kinetics of different species involved in exciton splitting and charge separation for the three systems in c).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lin Chen</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lin&nbsp;X&nbsp;Chen</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 5</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1230217/1230217_10210424_1477935748690_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1230217/1230217_10210424_1477935748690_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1230217/1230217_10210424_1477935748690_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic of the effect of molecular structure and energetics on the exciton pathways  in the PTRn series.
