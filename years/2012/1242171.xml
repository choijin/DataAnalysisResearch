<AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Improvement of Nanoscale Device Education via Theory, Experimental Design, and Characterization", at Purdue University under the direction of Dr. Michael T. Harris, will develop a new path for undergraduate students interested in developing a strong nanotechnology background that starts in their First-Year Engineering courses and can continue throughout their career at Purdue University.  The components of this program span from classroom instruction through laboratory experiments and finally, to hands-on summer research programs for interested students. In particular, the educational thrusts will focus on the fabrication of novel devices for clean energy generation and storage applications, advanced bioengineered devices, and the development of sensing platforms for enhanced homeland security.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the inherently interdisciplinary nature of nanoscience and nanoengineering education, the proposed projects will allow for unique extensions in the fields of chemistry, materials engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and bioengineering.  Specifically, 100% of first year engineering students will be impacted (~2000 undergraduate students/year), ~200 sophomore and junior engineering students per year (~10% of all undergraduate engineering students/year), ~1% of all undergraduate students (20 engineering students/year) will participate in 3-month faculty-led research experiences through this program. Successful education of these talented undergraduate students will lead to a well-trained nanotechnology-based workforce capable of manufacturing devices for the next generation of biomedical and energy-generating devices.</AbstractNarration>

As such, providing nanotechnology-related educational pathways for future leaders in science and engineering is of critical import.  Here, we have implemented a program in the College of Engineering at Purdue University over the past 2 years in order to ensure that nanotechnology is part of the curriculum for our future Purdue graduates.  Specifically, we have developed a tiered pedagogical profile that introduces all Purdue engineering students to nanotechnology and then allows students, based on their individual interests and desires, to explore the details of nanotechnology education with respect to science and engineering.  In this way, we have been able to impact greater than 1,000 students during the course of this funding, and the classroom modules we have developed during the funding period are long-standing and able to continue to impact a large number of students for many years into the future.     In the first of these efforts, a new module for the First Year Engineering (FYE) program at Purdue University was developed.  In this module, students work through a design project that introduces the fundamentals of quantum dot semiconductors.  Furthermore, it allows them to elucidate how new materials can be implemented in next-generation energy conversion systems (e.g., solar panels).  In particular, this module allowed them to view the potential and tangible hurdles for solar energy implementation relative to existing energy technologies.  In this way, the students were able to both appreciate the science and engineering of novel nanomaterials and were also made aware of the potential issues regarding social, economic, and environmental considerations that are inherent to nanotechnology-based systems.  Working in teams of 3-4 people, the students were asked to develop new computer simulations based on their materials, and these simulations were used as a large part of their final score for the course.  Furthermore, the pedagogical practices developed from this module are the centerpiece of a doctoral student's thesis in the School of Engineering Education at Purdue University.  Because of this, numerous peer-reviewed publications and conference proceedings have begun to emerge due to this research and education activity.     In the second level of implementation, a new course regarding nanotechnology and flexible electronics was developed for upper-level undergraduate students at Purdue University.  Specifically, the course focused on how polymeric materials could be implemented in novel display, logic, and energy conversion devices.  In this course, which was the first of its kind at Purdue, the theory behind design, charge transport, and device application of polymer semiconductors and conductors was examined.  In addition to traditional examinations, the students also wrote semester manuscripts.  In these documents, the students examined a particular avenue of flexible electronics (i.e., from materials design to advanced manufacturing) in order to determine where they foresaw the next innovation breakthrough.  In its 2 offerings the course received marks of 4.9/5.0; this highlights the success of the course with the students.     In the most extensive level of this program involved 27 undergraduate students from Purdue University participating in hands-on, graduate-level research involving nanotechnology during the summer months at Purdue.  In particular, with the support of the NSF NUE, these students participated in the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program at Purdue.  In this program, the students learn about science and engineering through hands-on experiences and are provided career counseling services with respect to both industrial and academic futures.  During this time, they were able to particip...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
