<AbstractNarration>Robert Horton, Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;Joshua Heitman, North Carolina State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heat transfer and associated temperature variations are fundamental drivers of water phase changes within the hydrologic cycle. Yet, our understanding of soil water phase changes in the presence of temperature gradients remains limited. Newly-developed instrumentation provides detailed, fine-scale measurements of soil thermal properties, temperature and water content. Combined with conservation of energy and mass, these measurements allow calculation of in situ latent heat sinks and soil water fluxes, thus revealing both time and depth dynamics of soil water phase change. Research will test a central hypothesis about the evaporation process, that the depth of the evaporation front is controlled by the magnitude of the liquid water flux to the front, within a context considering both heat and water transfer. This hypothesis will be evaluated through a series of non-isothermal laboratory experiments using thermo-TDR equipped soil columns for a series of surface boundary conditions and two soil types. Measurements of liquid water and water vapor flux profiles, soil surface temperature conditions, and mass balance will offer unprecedented information about both heat and water transfer occurring with soil water evaporation. Concurrently, research will address a second hypothesis about quantifying soil freezing, that a combined measurement-based energy and water balance can accurately characterize the rate of soil freezing, ice contents, liquid water contents and liquid water fluxes at the freezing front in partially frozen soil. This hypothesis will first be addressed through numerical experiments aimed at testing system-imposed limitations, and microcosm experiments and inverse numerical analysis aimed at adaptation of thermal property measurements for temperatures near the freezing point. Incorporating findings from these studies, the hypothesis will be tested in a series of freezing soil column systems, instrumented with thermo-TDR sensors to measure soil water and ice contents, and associated heat and water fluxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soil water phase changes -- evaporation/condensation and freezing/thawing -- drive the hydrological cycle and determine water availability for biological, chemical, and physical processes occurring throughout the terrestrial environment. These phase changes also tightly couple water and energy budgets. They involve both sensible and latent heat transfer, and both liquid water and water vapor fluxes. To date, understanding of the interplay of water and energy fluxes with soil water phase changes remains extremely limited. This research will carefully examine water and energy budgets together using newly developed, fine-scale instrumentation in order to improve understanding of the hydrologic cycle, soil water evaporation, and soil freezing. Implications for this research include improved capabilities for land-surface modeling and remote sensing of surface processes, as well as direct application to understanding carbon and trace gas transmissions and myriad other biogeochemical processes.</AbstractNarration>

We designed and constructed a novel soil sensor and developed a sensible heat balance theory that allowed us to measure water and energy budgets with unprecedented millimeter-scale detail in the near-surface soil environment.

In both cases, the sensors and theory agreed well with independent coarse-scale evaporation and ice content estimates from accepted technologies, but also provided new details about evaporation, ice content, and soil water movement that could not previously be measured.

Field experiments allowed examination of evaporation processes occurring in both bare soil surface and cropped field conditions. For bare surface conditions, we tracked the migration of the evaporation front from the surface to the subsurface. In cropped conditions, we were able to quantify and separate the portion of total evapotranspiration generated by direct soil evaporation from the portion of evapotranspiration coming from plant transpiration.  Experiments on soil freezing and thawing were also performed.  A numerical study confirmed that sensible heat balance theory in principle could determine soil ice contents during freezing and thawing processes.  Heat pulse sensor measurements used with sensible heat balance theory led to accurate description of changes in soil ice contents.  This new method was particularly effective at soil temperatures between 0 and -3 C.  Determining soil ice contents at these temperatures has been problematic in the past, so this research finding represents an important discovery for use in future investigations of soil freezing and thawing.   One key discovery from this research project is that a combination approach using co-located sensible heat balance and water balance from heat-pulse sensors, provides a new, and the only known approach, for determining fine-depth scale liquid water fluxes in situ.  Another key discovery is that the sensible heat balance method based on heat pulse sensor measurements is able to determine changes in soil ice content at temperatures between 0 and -3 C.  These new findings will help guide scientists in future studies of the heat and water dynamics in surface soil.   Outcomes from this project are a new sensor and theory for improved measurement and understanding of soil water evaporation, soil ice content, and soil water movement. The sensor and theory have applications for improving agricultural water use efficiency, assessing water availability in arid and water-limited environments, and developing improved drying technologies in manufacturing and engineering. The project results have potential to impact water availability for human use.  Knowing more about soil water evaporation can lead to improved water use and water availability strategies.

These new measurements of soil water evaporation, soil ice content, and soil water movement will aid the micro-meteorological community on improving energy balance measurement techniques. These measurements will also help climate modelers to improve their algorithms for partitioning near surface energy and water balance components.  The sensible heat balance can be used to determine rates of soil freezing and thawing which will be of interest to many disciplines such as climatologists, hydrologists, agronomists, and ecologists.  The freezing thawing studies will also be of interest to civil and construction engineers.  The results will be used by the scientific community for development of enhanced hydrology and climate models.  This research project also offered important opportunities for training of new scientists and for engagement with the scientific community. Four graduate students, including a minority Ph.D. student, were trained through research performed as part of the project.
