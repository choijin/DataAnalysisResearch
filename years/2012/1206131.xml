<AbstractNarration>This project concerns the development of semiclassical asymptotic techniques for initial-value problems and initial/boundary-value problems of nonlinear wave propagation in the situation that the equation of interest is completely integrable, possessing a Lax pair representation and all of the corresponding mathematical framework.  Specific problems to be addressed include (i) the weakly dispersive asymptotics of the intermediate long-wave equation and its degeneration to the Benjamin-Ono equation, (ii) mixed initial/boundary value problems for the semiclassical defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation on the half-line, (iii) initial-value problems for the semiclassically scaled 3-wave interaction equations, (iv) transsonic initial-value problems for the semiclassical modified nonlinear Schroedinger equation, and (v) large-degree asymptotics for rational solutions of Painleve equations.  Solving these problems will require the development of new tools of asymptotic analysis for nonlocal and higher-dimensional Riemann-Hilbert analytic factorization problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves models for the propagation of waves of various sorts.  In particular, the models are capable of making predictions about the behavior of physical systems ranging in diversity from optical fibers carrying high-intensity pulses of light to the ocean, where contaminants can become trapped at the boundary between layers of fluids of differing density.  Our aim is to provide practical methods for accurately approximating the solutions of these models so that their predictions can be compared with experiments and ultimately used in place of expensive or invasive experiments themselves.  In particular, we note that in the wake of environmental disasters like the Deepwater Horizon oil leak of 2010, it becomes increasingly important to have accurate and easy-to-use methods for predicting the location of contaminants in the fluid column of the ocean.</AbstractNarration>

An envelope equation describing ultra-short pulses in optical fibers was analyzed in a kind of short-wavelength limit, and it was shown that the same equation can describe simultaneously stable and unstable behavior of light wave pulses. The rational solutions of the Painlev\'e-II equation, functions that are important in models of planar fluid vortex motion, magnetic flux propagation in superconducting Josephson junctions, and string theory among other applications, were succesfully analyzed in the limit of large degree.  This is a natural limit in several physical applications.  A new method was advanced for studying nonlinear wave equations posed on a semi-infinite domain like a long wave-tank with paddles at one end.  This method allows solutions to be studied even though in general the initial data and the boundary data (paddles) interact in a complicated way that can be difficult to unravel.  New techniques for studying the stability properties of periodic waves in nonlinear systems were developed, and the mathematical proofs obtained have at last corrected some misleading statements that have been in the literature for 45 years.  In related work, a graphical approach to a kind of stability index known as a Krein signature was explained and popularized through a review article.  This graphical approach was also applied to develop a tool called an Evans-Krein function that can be used to detect the signatures accurately.  An asymptotic model for long internal waves in stratified fluids, the Benjamin-Ono equation, was partly solved as a method was developed to explicitly compute the "scattering data" associated with a given initial condition, under a technical assumption (the initial condition is a rational function) that can be dispensed with for the purposes of practical applications.

Also in connection with stratified fluids, a method for decomposing flows into barotropic and baroclinic contributions and a perturbative way to take the effect of bottom topography into account were advanced, making a contribution to the field of physical oceanography.    Among the broader impacts of this award were the training of two graduate students, the publication of a widely-read review article on the topic of Krein signature theory from a practical "graphical" perspective, and the advancement of the theory of a model for internal wave propagation in stratified fluids that should have influence in the fields of physical and theoretical oceanography.
