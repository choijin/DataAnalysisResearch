<AbstractNarration>Complex dynamic behavior has been observed or predicted in a number of different fluid flow networks, both man-made and natural, at a variety of scales. Some examples include the flow of blood through the microcirculation, the flow of droplets through microfluidic devices, the flow of magma through lava tubes, refrigerant flow in cooling systems and water flow in solar steam generators. While the physics differ, the underlying phenomena are often similar. In all of the examples above it is difficult to predict and determine the distribution of different phases or constituents within the network. Complexity in a network with many inter-connections containing unusual fluids (such as blood in the microvasculature) may seem unsurprising. However, even the   simplest networks with ordinary fluids can demonstrate extraordinary behavior. This proposal seeks to develop and verify a new general theory for describing phase distribution within and the dynamical behavior of fluid networks. The proposed work takes a building block approach, fully describing the behavior of simple network elements and then adding complexity in a systematic manner. The theoretical study is closely integrated with an experimental track which will verify the key predictions of the theory. Without the experimental data, it would be impossible to map the mathematical theory to specific physical manifestations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network fluid dynamics have been studied theoretically and computationally for approximately 20 years, yet few general statements about network behavior exist. The prevalent approach has been direct simulation which does not allow for the key parameters to be understood in a systematic way. Further, key predictions have never been tested in experiment. This proposal overcomes these limitations and will develop a new general theory for network fluid dynamics which is rooted in experiment and will describe the equilibrium and dynamic behavior of the network in a general manner such that results can be easily translated to specific physical systems.  Finally, the work will be conducted at an undergraduate college with undergraduate students playing a central role in the research.</AbstractNarration>
