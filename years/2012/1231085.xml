<AbstractNarration>The NSF Sustainable Energy pathways (SEP) Program, under the umbrella of the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) initiative, will support the research program of Prof. Shulin Chen and co-workers at Washington State University, University of Georgia and University of Minnesota. The vision for this SEP project is to develop sustainable energy systems through a biomimicry pathway inspired by natural biological systems.  The central hypothesis of this project is that wood feeding termites harbor biocatalysts that modify lignin structure in order to improve the accessibility to and functionality of saccharifying enzymes.  New knowledge about the reaction mechanisms and enzyme systems in termites will provide the required critical insights for designing new methods to break lignocellulosic biomass.  A nature-inspired lignocellulose processing system can be developed by building upon a stepwise lignin degrading catalytic process, and by mimicking the termite system. The objective of the project will be accomplished by achieving four specific aims: (1) elucidating the mechanism of selective lignin modifications in wood feeding termite and evaluating the alleviated inhibition effect of lignin on cellulase, (2) identifying, locating, expressing, and characterizing new lignin modifying enzymes of the termite, (3) integrating biomimetic approaches with interdisciplinary sciences to develop a nature-inspired lignocellulose processing system, and (4) conducting sustainability and social acceptance analysis of the biologically inspired energy system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the SEP program goal in terms of societal, economic, environmental, and education /workforce development imperatives.  The project will benefit the society by producing new knowledge and highly competent professionals for building an innovative sustainable pathway to secure energy future, to strengthen sustainable economic development, and to combat climate changes. It is anticipated that the project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning. The complexity and scientific challenges will enhance interdisciplinary learning and training. Minority students will participate in this project thus broadening the participation of under-represented groups. The research opportunity for K-12 students will promote science and engineering interests to the next generation.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the project will produce multiple impacts: The research activities will yield new transformative knowledge and enabling tools that may lead breakthroughs in the fundamental science needed for the development of a biofuel industry to achieve the mandated national biofuel goals.  It will demonstrate the possibilities and scientific challenges in employing nature-inspired systems for the development of robust, effective, and environmentally-friendly biorefineries. The project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education through fostering collaborations among the members of the consortium. The results will enhance scientific and technological understanding through broad dissemination to the public, the scientific community and industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The vision for this SEP project was to develop sustainable energy systems through a biomimicry pathway inspired by natural biological systems.  Such new energy systems will mark drastic advancement from the existing technologies that often employ processes requiring high temperature, high pressure or environmentally harsh chemicals to pretreat lignocellulosic biomass before hydrolyzing it into sugars for making biofuels and biochemicals.  Using a suite of advanced tools and with multidisciplinary expertise involved in chemistry, biology, engineering, mathematics, and economics, the project team conducted a comprehensive study on the mechanism that food-feeding termite employs for modifying lignin and deconstructing plant cell wall.  The study also encompassed consumer preferences for advanced biofuels that are produced with a sustainable pathway.   The project contributed to the knowledge base by advancing discoveries and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning.  The project results established the knowledge base on mechanism of lignin modification by termite, including (1) selective modifications of lignin structure along the termite gut such as the specific reactions occurring on the functional groups and substructures; (2) information on the inhibitory effect change of termite modified lignin to cellulose digestion; (3) determination of importance of reactive oxygen species for lignin degradation in termite; (4) role and source of hydrogen peroxide. The project also obtained new findings on the differential expression of lignin degradation enzymes and their characterization, confirming the mechanism of lignin modification in termite and the importance of reactive oxygen species. The project enhanced knowledge on non-heme Fe complexes for the oxidative valorization of lignin potential application of new oxidative processes in lignocellulose pretreatment processes mimicking termite. The project also generated new information on radical-based pretreatment as a nature-inspired lignocellulose processing technology. The project results also advanced modeling capability in describing lignin degradation in termite gut. The project also obtained information on consumer acceptance of sustainable biofuel.  The new knowledge and information were documented in a series of publications, dissertations, and conference presentations.  Dissemination of the information through these means provides the scientific and engineering communities with new insights for lignocellulosic biomass processing and utilization.  This project also provided the great opportunity for training a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  The project information was also reached to K-12 students and the general public through school presentations and popular articles.   This project contributed to the SEP program goals in terms of societal, economic, environmental, and education /workforce development imperatives.  These project results have produced multiple impacts: The research results have already been used and cited in the literature.  The graduate students trained are now active in various research and development positions in both the public and private sectors.

The project results have demonstrated the possibilities and scientific challenges in employing nature-inspired systems. The project has fostered collaborations among the members of the research team.
