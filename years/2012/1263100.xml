<AbstractNarration>Currently, over half of the world's population lives in cities, making the study of urbanism central to anthropology and relevant in addressing current global challenges and debates surrounding urban living and sustainability. The Cerro Jazmín Archaeological Project (CJAP) studies an ancient city that was intermittently inhabited for nearly 1800 years to learn about the city's form, function, and environmental impact through time. The ancient city of Cerro Jazmín is located in the mountainous Mixteca Alta region of Oaxaca, Mexico, where modern farming communities are struggling to survive on an agricultural economy. By learning about the history of occupation and agricultre at Cerro Jazmín the project will investigate different models of sustainable and unsustainable urbanism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase I of CJAP, also funded by NSF, identified a long, but intermittent history of occupation at the ancient city and geomorphological data study identified a period of landscape stability and soil formation at a time corresponding with massive urban growth in the 10th century AD. This find suggests that the city was able to strike a balance, if at least momentary, between population growth and the environment. This period of stability was followed by one of erosion and terrace construction. CJAP Phase II will investigate the city's structure, function, and system of food production to learn about the successful and failed models of urbanism followed at Cerro Jazmín. These finds and the proposed investigations will build on a growing number of studies that have found that higher populations need not result in land degradation. Instead, correct land management and targeted labor inputs from large populations are needed to build and maintain anthropogenic landscapes of production associated with urban centers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Phase II the project will conduct archaeological excavations of residential, civic-ceremonial, and agricultural areas to learn about the relationship between the city's political and economic function and prominence (reflected on monumental architecture and agricultural terraces) and the activities of high- and low-status households. The project will study monumental architecture, craft production, and foreign goods to investigate the city's local and regional function and its involvement in regional trade and political interaction spheres. The investigations will focus on times of residential stability (Early Classic), possible abandonment (Late Classic), and re-occupation (Postclassic). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today the environmental impacts of urbanism are becoming increasingly problematic and Cerro Jazmín provides a valuable case study on humanity's urban experience. Archaeology is strategically poised to make a broad contribution to current socio-natural studies and debates pertaining to sustainability and the impacts of human action and urbanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Mixteca Alta flat land and water are rare commodities and frost is a constant risk. Still, the archaeological record demonstrates that despite these challenges urban communities flourished for centuries. Perhaps the project's most significant contribution is that it will investigate: What urban strategies did the ancient Mixtec follow to grow food for dense urban populations in a challenging environment? Efforts directed towards answering this question will be of interest not only to scholars, but also to rural communities trying to survive in the Mixtec highlands today.</AbstractNarration>

The CJAP team excavated ten different areas of the ancient city and generated large amounts of architectural, artifact, faunal, botanical, bioarchaeological, and chronological data about the pre-Hispanic city, its history of occupation, and the mode of life and sociopolitical activities of its inhabitants.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The data generated by the project has corrected previously held ideas about the Cerro Jazm&iacute;n&rsquo;s occupation and has documented evidence of changes in the forms of sociopolitical organization adopted to by the city&rsquo;s inhabitants and rulers perhaps in an effort to ensure its stability.&nbsp; The city was founded in 300 BC and enjoyed a continuous occupation until 300 AD. Six hundred years of sociopolitical continuity is no small feat considering the fact that the United States and its government have only just celebrated their 241<sup>st</sup> birthday.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>During the 600 years of urban occupation at Cerro Jazm&iacute;n there were notable shifts in the way that the rulers and city inhabitants engaged in communal sociopolitical activities. The first 300 years are marked by material patterns that suggest a focus on the elevated status of a small sector of the population, rulers and elites that had access to foreign goods. In the second 300 years we documented a shift towards more communal forms of organization, ritual, and urban spatial configuration, which gave a larger portion of the population greater access to monumental areas and access valuable goods, but this time of local manufacture. The city began to decline in 200 AD, however, and was mostly abandoned by 300 AD. It remained abandoned for nearly a thousand years and was re-occupied by 1300 AD when it became part of the renowned kingdom of Yanhuitl&aacute;n, which ruled the area at the time of the European invasion in 1521 AD.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Previous scholars posited that Cerro Jazm&iacute;n, and other contemporary Mixtec cities, were established by 300 BC and were abandoned by 50-100 AD, suggesting that the first wave of urbanism had not been stable. Later on some cities seemed to have been reoccupied during the Classic period (300-900 AD); this settlement history was based on the recorded presence of a ceramic type that was thought to date to the Classic period. Ceramic and chronological evidence generated by CJAP, however, established that the ceramic type in question had been mistaken for another and with supporting radiocarbon evidence we defined and correctly dated this chronologically important ceramic type, Tiltepec yellow wares to the Late Formative period (300 BC-300 AD).&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This chronological correction makes an important contribution to our understanding of the history of urban development and settlement in this corner of Mesoamerica. Also. The new chronological data provides others scholars with the needed tools to evaluate contemporaneous settlements and assess whether or not there was a period of regional abandonment or if early urban centers were more stable that previously thought. If the later is found to be the case, this has important implications that point to early Mixtec cities as valuable case studies of long-lived and possibly sustainable urbanism. As over half of the world&rsquo;s population currently lives in cities it is important to learn about the strategies followed by previous, successful urban societies. With this broader contribution in mind, ongoing CJAP analyses are investigating the economic, agricultural, and political activities of Cerro Jazm&iacute;n&rsquo;s inhabitants to learn about how they sustained and organized their city for six centuries.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>CJAP provided field training and research opportunities to graduate students from US universities and to undergraduate students from Mexican universities. It served as an important source of employment for the rural community of Tiltepec, which has few economic opportunities for its young people, many of whom showed great interest and talent during their three field seasons of employment.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout the three years of the project the research team engaged the community, including local school groups, in community outreach and educational activities aimed at explaining the real goals of science and archaeology. We hosted, in the field and during the excavations, several local school groups while we designed age-appropriate activities and hands-on learning experiences that taught kids about archaeology, pre-Hispanic life, and about the importance of protecting the areas&rsquo; cultural and biological diversity.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For the adults the Cerro Jazm&iacute;n team prepared a series of informational posters and public presentations where the local community and authorities learned about the project&rsquo;s development and results.
