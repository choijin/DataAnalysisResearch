<AbstractNarration>The most fundamental service for the delivery of data on the Internet is routing, the task of computing the path that messages must follow in order to go between networks that are not directly connected. While a large body of work has studied the task of ensuring that these paths are computed correctly, surprisingly little work has been done to study the behavior, when under attack, of the system of computers, software and protocols that compute these paths, what we call the routing system.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is investigating the resilience of the Internet routing system to attacks that induce "churn" by forcing programs or computers to (temporarily) stop participating in the routing system.  The project is devising experiments and simulations that will allow the development of mathematical models that can measure the vulnerability of the routing system to "cascading failures," caused by resource depletion, software faults, and protocol errors, that cause the entire routing system to become unavailable.  The project is also developing methods to mitigate the effects of these attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to result in new data, models, and software that can be used by the community to evaluate and improve the behavior of the current routing system and proposed "future Internet" designs under destabilizing attacks, positively impacting the safety and economic health of the United States and other nations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Internet has become a key component in the critical infrastructure of the United States and other countries. Thus the availability of the Internet &ndash; its ability to deliver data between connected hosts when needed, and in spite of attacks &ndash; is a topic of critical importance. The most fundamental service for the delivery of data on the Internet is routing, the task of computing the path that messages must follow in order to go between networks that are not directly connected. While a large body of work has studied the task of ensuring that these paths are computed correctly, surprisingly little work has been done to study the behavior, when under attack, of the system of computers, software and protocols that compute these paths, what we call the routing system.  This project studied the resilience of the routing system under two types of attacks:  We studied attacks that manipulate protocol errors to cause resource depletion in routers.  We found that routers can manipulate the format of messages sent to other routers to cause arbitrary, remote routers to run out of memory or exhaust their CPUs.  We ran experiments to measure the behavior of the most popular router brands in these conditions, finding that they do not come with sufficient memory or processing power to resist these attacks, and can fail in ways that cause failures to spread to other routers.  We also studied attacks where Internet providers form coalitions to "embargo" other providers that interfere with traffic that passes through their network.   We found that by diverting traffic away from these interfering networks, coalitions can cause substantial damages, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for the interfering networks.  We developed new algorithms for estimating the effects of these attacks on the coalition's traffic, and found that the coalition could enforce the embargo with no monetary or performance cost.  The project gathered data and developed simulation software that can be used by Internet service providers to evaluate deployments of new routing equipment, and by other researchers to evaluate new designs for routing protocols.  The project additionally contributed to the education of hundreds of undergraduate students through course lectures, as well as the research training of two undergraduates and one graduate student.
