<AbstractNarration>This research investigates policies that could increase the supply of college graduates educated in a science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) field, either by encouraging students to undertake a STEM major, or by increasing the retention of such students. In particular, this project will measure the efficacy of one program, the Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science (MITES), in increasing STEM participation and educational attainment. MITES is a summer program held annually at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that has been serving at-risk, high-achieving high school students for over 30 years. This project will conduct a rigorous, randomized evaluation of the MITES summer enrichment program in order to assess the effect of MITES on the educational attainment of its participants, as well as whether MITES increases interest in STEM fields. The objective of the study is to give the strongest possible evidence on the impact of the MITES program, and provide a breakthrough in the effort to identify the barriers to STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluating the impact of MITES is necessary and valuable, both for the administration of the program itself and to further the understanding of how to encourage educational attainment and participation in STEM among underrepresented student populations. The MITES program is resource intensive and has significant capacity constraints. With so much need in the community of underserved students, it is important to be sure that universities are reaching out and offering enrichment opportunities as efficiently as possible. An evaluation can help illustrate the impact of MITES relative to MIT's other programs, as well as which groups benefit most. Finally, estimates of the impact of MITES could help other universities and partners systematically adopt a similar program design and serve more students in need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project adds to a growing literature that rigorously evaluates education interventions. The target population of high-achieving, at-risk students has been largely overlooked, despite documented lags among such students in college completion, STEM participation, and quality of the college of matriculation (Adelman 2006; Pallais and Turner 2006). In addition, a recent literature emphasizes the importance of the period immediately preceding college applications in influencing the choice to apply to, enroll in, and complete college, and the choice to apply for financial aid (Bettinger et al. 2009; Carrell and Sacerdote 2012; Avery and Kane 2004). This research project explores how interventions during this sensitive time can also impact a student's choice of major.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to conduct an in-depth impact evaluation of the MITES program, the researchers will randomly assign a subset of MITES applicants to either participate in a summer enrichment program implemented through the MIT Office of Engineering Outreach Programs (OEOP), or to be part of a comparison group. Using data from the OEOP, the National Student Clearinghouse, surveys, and social networking websites, the researchers will identify the causal impact of the OEOP's programs on education investment decisions and STEM participation in particular. The study will measure changes in the educational attainment of subjects, including: the quality of the college of matriculation, as estimated by college rankings; the proportion of students who complete a degree; the average amount of time taken by students to complete a degree; a student's cumulative college GPA; and whether a student majors in a STEM field. This project will make an important addition to the research on educational interventions that strive to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and higher education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    There are substantial gaps in access to selective universities between low-income and affluent students and between underrepresented minorities (URM) and students of other ethnicities. For example, application rates to elite universities are smaller for low-income students, even conditional on having high standardized test scores and grades. Meanwhile, according to the NSF Science and Engineering Indicators: 2014, Blacks, Hispanics, and other underrepresented minorities together constitute 26% of the U.S. population, 15% of college graduates, and 10% of the science and engineering workforce.   Underrepresentation of certain students in STEM is troubling due to the implications for earnings: median earnings for STEM workers were $78,270 in 2012, more than twice the median earnings of the U.S. workforce at $34,750 a year.   Public and private interventions attempting to increase participation of underrepresented students in STEM abound, yet little is known about how to achieve this goal. Given the various measures and resources dedicated to encouraging STEM careers, it is necessary to understand what is successful, and why.  This study measures the effect of three challenging summer programs for high school students to see if they increase application and matriculation rates at top universities, and STEM-major rates among traditionally underserved populations. The programs are held annually at a selective private school that awards a majority of its degrees in STEM fields. The mission of the programs is to increase access to STEM careers among students who face barriers such as being first-generation college-goers, low-income, or URM.  The first part of the project uses applications to the flagship program from 2005 through 2011 to retrospectively measure program impacts. The program brings academically excellent high school students from across the country to the host institution (HI) for six-weeks in the summer and simulates the first year of undergraduate education at the HI.   The program exposes students to information about their own ability, the college application and financial aid process, and the challenges they will face freshman year. It also provides a chance to refine the skills necessary to succeed in college, and a peer group that is facing the same challenges and is of similar background and ability.  The study matched applications between 2005 and 2011 to the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC), and data from 31 selective, private universities. After conditioning on an applicant making it through the first rounds of screening, program effects were estimated using OLS regression and propensity score methods. Estimates reveal the program caused students to apply to the HI 70% more often, and increased admission rates at the HI by 150% relative to comparison students. The admissions effects are large enough that they cannot be explained by increased application rates alone (some applicants must also have higher admission rates conditional on applying).            Estimates also show the program increased the probability of attending the HI by  225%. There are no detectable increases in enrollment at any other university. The increase in HI enrollment does not come primarily from shifting students between other selective institutions; thus, the average selectivity of the college of matriculation increases.   Moreover, the program increased the probability of graduating with a STEM degree within four years by 9.2 percentage points. Estimates of the effect of the program on degree completion suggest that students are not harmed by attending an elite institution. Admitted students do just as well in terms of persistence and overall graduation rates.      In addition to the retrospective analysis, applicants between 2014 and 2016 were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: six weeks on the HI campus through the flagship program, one week on campus, five days on campus coupled with a six-month online forum, a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
