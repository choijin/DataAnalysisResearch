<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: &lt;br/&gt;Efficiently converting sunlight and water into hydrogen is an attractive approach to producing 'green' fuels that could help support the future US economy.  Commercially realizing this goal requires improved scientific understanding of the associated processes and the development of human capital capable of addressing the engineering challenges.   A variety of catalysts have been known to perform photolysis (converting water to hydrogen) for several decades, but many remain too inefficient or expensive for commercial application.  The properties of photocatalysts may be improved most effectively by controlling their electronic structure, which depends on variables such as particle size, shape, chemistry, defect structure, or their interactions with adjoining materials. The resultant photocatalytic performance is typically characterized over an ensemble of millions of particles, whose individual properties could vary significantly.  Averaging over the entire system obscures the fundamental relationships between the electronic properties and the photocatalytic performance at the nanoparticle level.  This project develops and utilizes new approaches to measuring the electronic properties and photocatalytic performance of individual nanoparticles in order to develop improved scientific understanding of the effects of size, defects, and interfaces on both the electronic structure and the associated photocatalytic performance.  The activity integrates research and education through a research experience for education majors program while promoting diversity.  It will enable Illinois teachers to bring authentic scientific research experience into the K-12 classroom, research experience for undergraduate students, and research support for a graduate student.  As well, inquiry-based and active-learning approaches to education will be fostered by working closely with the Illinois Foundry for Innovation in Engineering Education (IFoundry).  This multifaceted approach will have impact at all levels of the STEM pipeline. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:&lt;br/&gt;The project is seeking to develop improved scientific underpinnings for nanostructural design of optimized high-efficiency low-cost heterojunction photocatalysts.  The electronic properties and photocatalytic performance of individual heterojunction nanowires are being characterized as a function of size.  The experiments utilize a geometry that enables electrical measurements, ex situ structural and chemical characterization, and subsequent in situ photocatalysis by environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  In situ TEM provides appropriate spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and geometric flexibility necessary to quantify the rate of photocatalytic gas evolution at individual nanostructures.  Special emphasis is being placed on elucidating the role of characterized defects and defect states in affecting the variation in performance of individual nanoscale photocatalysts.  The experiments target ZnO-Pt and ZnO-Fe2O3, which will serve as model oxide-metal and model low-cost oxide-oxide systems that exhibit the desired physics and fulfill experimental requirements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project demonstrated via a novel in situ nanoscale electron microscopy-based observation technique that electrolytically evolved H2gas bubble nucleation delocalizes from its point of reduction on the electrode. Instead it nucleates homogeneously adjacent to the electrodes.  The result is surprising because at the macroscopic scale bubbles appear to nucleate heterogeneously on electrodes.  Our investigation found that the variation in dissolved H2around the bubble as a function of bubble size affects its contact wetting angle on the surface.  Large bubbles always wet the surface because of their lower H2pressure and associated higher surface energy.  However, nanoscale bubbles have varying surface energy that is affected by interactions with nanoscale surface roughness.   The results help us better understand how gas bubbles form, move, and coalesce on electrode surfaces, which is important in engineering more efficient electrolyzers for H2production.   Similar methodologies were developed to study gas bubble formation during rapid heating, i.e. boiling, at the nanoscale using high-speed electron imaging.  The experiments allowed us to observe that the initially formed bubbles rapidly dewet the heating surface due to the formation of a bubble composed of dissolved gas whose surface energy is unfavorable for wetting.  Growth of the bubble due to water vaporization changes its surface energy and makes wetting more favorable.  The effect was found to be highly reproducible and indicates that gas nucleation during boiling is highly spatially dynamic at the micron length scale and the microsecond time scale.  The results have important implications related to heat transfer in many industrial systems involving boiling.  This project also developed and demonstrated the first in situ auger electron spectroscopy and in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy methodologies applied to testing Li ion batteries.  The new approaches were developed to measure changes in the surface chemistry of the batteries during electrochemical reactions, which is challenging to do ex situ, since the surfaces easily react when exposed to the environment; i.e. transferring the sample into the instrumentation. The innovative approach allowed us to develop a completely new understanding of how organics, e.g. electrolyte, oxidize to form carbonates and sub-carbonates on cathodes during cycling.  These reactions evolve gas and the work was extended to show how gas evolved during battery cycling plays a dominant role in governing battery cycle life.  In one example, we showed how H2that forms from electrolyte decomposition enters the cathode particles and severely weakens them and causes their fracture. This fundamental work provides new routes to mechanism informed development of Li-ion batteries with longer cycle life.    This project supported the work of 2 MS and 1 PhD at the University of Illinois; all now working at US engineering firms.  The budget also supported research experiences for 3 pre-service teachers, 2 of which continued on to obtain master?s degrees in teaching.  These valuable experiences allow the teachers to bring insights into scientific research into the classroom and expose a large number of students to the possibilities and potential of scientific research.  The project also supported a summer research experience for an undergraduate student, and 2 research experiences for high school students enrolled in the TRIO Upward Bound program, which is a federally funded program to help prepare underprivileged students for college. Project time from the PI was also utilized to participate in a number of outreach efforts on campus including the Girls Learning About Materials camp, demonstrations for the TRIO Upward Bound College Prep Academy, ASM camp, World-wide Youth in Science and Engineering demonstrations: Discover Engineering, Explore Your Options I &amp; II), and Experience Illinois.
