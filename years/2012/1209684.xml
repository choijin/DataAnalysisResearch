<AbstractNarration>This action funds Amy Klegarth of the University of Notre Dame to conduct a research project, entitled "Genetic relationships and ranging patterns of urban monkeys," during the Summer of 2012 at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.  The host scientist is Dr. Michael Gumert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project includes the first effort to track long-tailed macaques with satellite collars and compare their population genetic structure on varied temporal and spatial scales. The multi-pronged approach is novel within the field and has broader implications for disease ecology and complements ongoing research examining the population genetic structure of gastrointestinal parasites harbored by the macaques. Modeling is being used to assess the impact of parasite transmission and provide powerful predictions for identifying potential transmission routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the research is being reported in a blog and the Fellow leads guided tours educating visitors about wildlife tracking.  Research results are being presented to the National Parks Board (NPB) to encourage proactive protocols for dealing with human-macaque conflict and for identifying problem areas where education, outreach programs, and population control programs can focus on mitigating human-macaque conflict at their interface.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My EAPSI project is a continuation of my primary dissertation research investigating how the urban landscape impacts genetic variation and ranging of an urban monkey.  Long-tailed macaques interface heavily with humans throughout Southeast Asia and are a main subject of human-wildlife conflict in Singapore.  My project aims to use real-time monitoring of home and daily range size in conjunction with genetic data to understand how these monkeys move across the urban landscape to promote better understanding of the complex interface.     During my EAPSI summer fellowship I continued to foster the international collaboration that has always been an integral part of my dissertation project.  I met with and worked alongside researchers and Nanyang Technological University as well as with SingaporeÃ†s National Parks Board managers. I also have the opportunity to present on the subject of monkey management and conflict mitigation to business managers who are directly affected.     My project was successful on multiple fronts.  I finalized the field-testing of GPS satellite collar's remote drop-off unit.  These units enable us to deploy GPS collars on monkeys without needing to further stress or recapture the animal.  In a brief field test we deployed and dropped off a collar successfully.  These drop-off units have since been used on a sister project in Gibraltar and are currently being utilized in a long-term deployment here in Singapore.     I also collected several hundred parasite and genetic fecal samples during the course of EAPSI.  Furthermore, I tested saliva sample collection methods at the end of the project.  These proved very fruitful with the genetic samples being of much higher quality.  These same methods have been adopted for my longer-term field collections during my current Fulbright fellowship also in Singapore.     A secondary project included assisting with the macaque census efforts conducted over the summer.  This census is a follow-up to the original efforts made in 2009 and will be subsequently followed up in 2013-2014 as part of SingaporeÃ†s active population monitoring.     The broader impacts of my work include fostering international collaboration, promoting informed, sustainable species management, supervising undergraduate researchers, and supporting relevant research, including the population census.     The intellectual merit of my work includes further implementing new technologies to answer questions about urban monkeysÃ† home and daily ranges.  Additionally, my sample collections make up the largest sampling of wild macaques in the world, and make Singapore the most comprehensively sampled wild population of macaques in particular.  This also represents the first major effort to characterize the genetics of an urban monkey and to utilize GPS collars on a large scale.
