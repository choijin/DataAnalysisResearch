<AbstractNarration>This project will utilize dynamic programming to develop approaches for solving problems where&lt;br/&gt;sequentially arriving jobs can either be rejected or assigned to a currently unassigned worker. In&lt;br/&gt;the general model the resulting reward from an assignment will be determined by an arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;function that depends on both the characteristics of the job and the worker. Particular cases,&lt;br/&gt;such as where the reward is binary, yielding a reward of 1 when a job is assigned to a qualified&lt;br/&gt;worker, will be considered. Models where the problem ends when each worker has been assigned&lt;br/&gt;and ones where workers return for reassignment after a random time will be considered. In the&lt;br/&gt;case of returning workers, probability distributions for the time it takes each worker to complete&lt;br/&gt;a job are assumed, and problems will be analyzed both when these distributions are assumed&lt;br/&gt;known and when they are unknown. Results will determine optimal policies when possible, good&lt;br/&gt;heuristic policies otherwise. Simulation techniques, using innovative variance reduction ideas,&lt;br/&gt;will be used to analyze the performance of policies. The project will will yield important insights&lt;br/&gt;as to how to solve and approximate dynamic programming problems having multidimensional&lt;br/&gt;state spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will impact many important application areas. For examples, in health care, workers might be patients waiting for organ transplants, and jobs could be arriving organs. The model is also equivalent to one that&lt;br/&gt;assumes that an organization has jobs to fill, with each sequentially arriving job seeker having&lt;br/&gt;a vector giving the values to the organization of assigning that candidate to the different jobs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have studied a variety of stochastic optimization models in which  a decision maker tries to assign sequentially arriving jobs to a currently idle  worker who is eligible to do that job. Both the jobs and the workers can be of varying quality and the objective is make assignments so as to maximize an average return. In some cases the problem is assumed to end when all workers have been assigned and in others the workers are presumed to return for further assignments after their work on their current job is completed.  We show how to obtain either optimal or near optimal policies for such models.  One such model is concerned with a company that has different types of jobs it needs filled, with each job type requiring a given quota of workers. Workers arrive sequentially, with each worker being eligible to do each type of job with a specfied probability, and the problem is to assign workers so as to minimize the time until all jobs have been filled. We show how to determine the optimal decision when   the remaining quotas of each type satisfy a certain condition. For instance, we show that if the  eligibility probabilties for all jobs are equal then it is optimal to assign a worker to the worker qualified job type that has the largest remaining quota.   In worker return models, we show that a ``worker fair" policy that always assigns a new job to that eligible worker who has been idle the longerst yields the same rate of lost customers (where a job is lost if there are no idle eligible servers when it arrives) as does a policy that always assigns a new job to the eligible worker who has been idle the shortest or even to a randomly chosen idle/eligible worker.      Our research has involved both the senior investigator and graduate students working towards a Ph.D degree. The results of the research have been published in technical journals and some of them will also appear in widely used texts in the field written by the senior investigator.
