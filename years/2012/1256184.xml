<AbstractNarration>This effort provides support for student attendance, student networking and student mentoring activities for the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS). Adaptive structures and materials systems by definition are intelligent, flexible systems that have sentience and responsiveness to ever changing environments. The field has rapidly matured due to synergistic interdisciplinary efforts across sectors of universities, government and industry. The purpose of the SMASIS conference is to assemble world experts across engineering and scientific disciplines (mechanical, aerospace, electrical, materials, and civil engineering, biology, physics chemistry, etc) to actively discuss the latest breakthroughs in smart materials, the cutting edge in adaptive structure applications and the recent advances in both new device technologies and basic engineering research exploration. Support from the NSF will promote student participation at the conference to activities that foster technical and intellectual exchange include a student hardware design competition and a student paper competition as well as activities to develop a network of peers and mentors for students that include a student mentoring luncheon and a student outing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outreach program is designed to engage students who might not otherwise be familiar with smart materials or adaptive structures from local high schools, HBCU's and/or community colleges. The specific goals are to 1) foster technical and intellectual exchange among students who are excited about prospects for research on smart materials and adaptive systems, 2) instill in its participants the sense of a technical community of student peers with a common enthusiasm for research and this technical field and of possible mentors for contact as they develop their own career paths in this field, 3) increase participation of underrepresented students in this professional development activity, and 4) increase participant awareness of the broad range of ideas and topics being studied within this field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to promote student engagement in professional development activities while attending the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS) conferences that were held in the fall of 2012, 2013 and 2014. Although the annual SMASIS conference has only been held since 2008, it is already one of the largest annual conferences for research on smart materials, with separate symposia held (1) Development and Characterization of Multifunctional Materials; (2) Mechanics &amp; Behavior of Active Materials; (3) Modeling, Simulation and Control of Adaptive Systems; (4) Integrated System Design and Implementation; (5) Structural Health Monitoring; (6) Bioinspired Smart Materials and Systems; and (7) Energy Harvesting.  Support from the NSF allowed the technical committee on Student and Young Professional Development to sponsor networking and mentoring activities designed to increase awareness of quality scholarly research, promote interaction with members from the scientific community (industry and academia), and provide opportunities for students to develop long-term social and professional relationships with fellow students.  These activities included a "Best Student Paper Competition", a "Best Student Hardware Competition" and events for networking.  Student papers were judged by a committee of smart materials and structures experts. Finalists were required to present their papers at The Student Best Paper Sessions, where their oral presentations were also evaluated. All finalists were honored during the Pioneer Banquet, which was held the second night of the conference.  Student Hardware Competition entries were also judged by a committee of smart materials and structures experts and a list of finalists was determined based upon the technical paper. Finalists presented their papers at a regular conference session but also had to participate in a special exhibit session on the first day of the conference, to demonstrate hardware operation and a present a poster explaining the nature of the project. All finalists from this competition were also honored during the Pioneer Banquet, which was held on the second night of the conference.   The Student and Young Professional Special Events committee also coordinated special student "outings" for the first evening of the conference, as well as other fun events for both students and professionals, with the goal of helping students get to know more senior professionals in the field.  These activities included bingo games during lunches, where tables competed with providing answers to smart materials trivia questions, which promote students developing a sense of belonging to a professional community.
