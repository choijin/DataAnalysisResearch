<AbstractNarration>The project is redesigning the way in which future machinists, technologists, and engineers are educated at community colleges by using concurrent engineering principles. Three entry level core courses at Monroe Community College are being designed for students from all three disciplines (machining, engineering technology, and engineering science) to take them together. These courses enable the student to gain a basic understanding of how to design and build engineering systems. The nine modules in the three courses include both online learning and traditional class and lab instruction. An interdisciplinary capstone design course is being created for small, interdisciplinary teams of students in their final semester from all three majors. Additional project activities include a student competition and collaborative research with a local company.  The project is also creating and testing low priced, commercially available student kits, including the hardware and course materials required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project evaluation includes an assessment of the impact of the interdisciplinary approach on student retention as well as the effectiveness of the learning modules and the quality of the web-based content.  Course curriculum is distributed through the SUNY Faculty Council of Community Colleges and chief academic officers at each applicable campus. Course hardware and web links are publicly accessible on-line and the student kits are made commercially available. Further dissemination includes presentations at national engineering education conferences and journal article submissions. The project will enhance our understanding of the interdisciplinary approach on student retention.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Successful product development companies utilize concurrent engineering principles in which a broad range of team members from engineering, manufacturing, and management work closely together from initial concepts to final production.  The efficient communication that this model facilitates reduces the time and cost of developing new products by identifying problems early in the design cycle and prior to significant investments in failed designs.  Unfortunately our compartmentalized approach in education separates students into isolated majors and prevents them from learning how to successfully work in interdisciplinary teams.  Although many engineering universities have some form of interdisciplinary design courses, they are only integrated horizontally by being comprised of students from various engineering disciplines.  The objective of our project was to create vertically integrated courses in which engineering, machining, and technology students could participate in together. This involved the modifications of two entry level courses, and a capstone design experience.  The main challenge in our two entry level courses was to design them so that engineering students with stronger math skills would be challenged, while providing the necessary support so that machining and technology students would still be successful. In our Mechanical Design and Prototyping course we created 73 videos so that students could learn using a self-paced tutorial approach.  For our Digital Systems course we created a new laboratory manual that balanced the hardware aspects best mastered by engineering students, with programming modules in which computer technology students were strong.  In our capstone experience we combined students from engineering and machining into 8 teams with each team having 2 engineering and 2 machining students. The students were assigned the task of designing and building servelliance robots. The results showed that the teams in which engineering and machining students worked closely together and communicated effectively were most successful.  As a result of this project our intercollegiate design teams have been transformed from only containing engineering students, to teams comprised of machining, computer, and engineering students.  Our students have won first place in  the SUNY Two-Year Engineering Science Association (TYESA) Robotics  Competition for the past three years.  In the SUNY TYESA Drone Competition this spring our  students finished second.  At the ASEE National Two-Year  College Design Competition MCC students have finished second for the  last three years.
