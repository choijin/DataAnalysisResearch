<AbstractNarration>This research will combine the skills of a comparative physiologist, an engineer, and a systematist to unravel the performance, design principals, and evolution of the sucker disk that allows some fishes to cling to rocks.  These fishes, called clingfish, adhere to fouled, irregular substrates in pounding surf and while launching feeding attacks to pry limpets from the rocks.  The work will involve a field component to measure the irregularity of substrates in the field, a pure modeling component that seeks to understand the effects of disk shape and material properties on suction, and a phylogenetic survey component.  In the survey the suction abilities of clingfishes from all over the world will be quantified and the relationships among clingfish species will be determined using phylogenetic methods.  The shape and underlying structure of the disk will also be investigated.  The results of these studies will be deposited in several public databases, including Genbank, Tree of Life, and a custom database for morphological data such as CT scans.  Other broader impacts of the grant include the development of biomimetic suction systems that could be used in surgical or robotic settings, development of tools for modeling soft matter interactions, education and outreach at the K12 and undergraduate level, and support of graduate education.</AbstractNarration>

The investigators measured the performance of these disks on surfaces of different roughness and amount of fouling. Some fish could stick to rough surfaces with 1200 times their body weight. The surface must be very rough indeed, about 5% of the total disk width, before the suction fails.

They collected sticking performance data from fishes as small as 18mm long. The data on performance, combined with shape data gathered from scanning electron microscopy, CT scanning, and histology, implied a new mode of failure for a suction disk. This led to the group proposing a new method of disk failure that was patented and is available for commercialization. More than a dozen students were supported on the grant and several have launched successful scientific careers. The project was featured on NPRs Science Friday and is available on YouTube where it has been viewed about 150,000 times. The project led to more than a dozen scientific papers as well as the description of five species of clingfish.
