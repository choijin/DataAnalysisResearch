<AbstractNarration>This proposal provides a systematic approach to combining existing electrical energy storage technologies and power conversion circuit designs with sophisticated runtime management policies to create a hybrid electrical energy storage (HEES) system with performance metrics that would be superior to those for any of its constituent components. In particular, the proposed research focuses on: (i) Architecture design and charge management, including charge allocation, migration, and replacement policies in HEES systems; (ii) Application driver and customization, including application to portable systems, and (iii) System prototyping and evaluation, including HEES system deployment studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research claims to produce unprecedented benefits in terms of energy availability and efficiency in electronic systems as well as significant reductions in cost of operating these systems. In particular, the proposed work aims to achieve 2x cost reduction and 10x cycle life improvement over conventional electrical energy storage systems. This will in turn enable the design of integrated products and platforms that deliver a wide range of new capabilities based on efficient power delivery and local energy storage. Another expected benefit of this proposal is the training of students, who will acquire knowledge in the development of new means and methods for electrical energy storage, conversion and delivery.</AbstractNarration>
