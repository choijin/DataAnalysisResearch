<AbstractNarration>Transformative concepts for optical data storage (ODS) applications are needed for future needs in multimedia, digital archiving, security, and many others. Commercial data storage technologies are moving to three-dimensional materials, but the known concepts suffer from limitations and high fabrication costs. Herein, a demonstrated storage medium, based on co-extruded multilayer films, overcomes these problems and allows for terabyte-level (TB), bit-by-bit optical data storage. Information in the form of complex patterns and individual bits was recorded in up to 23 superimposed layers by photobleaching a fluorescent dye via one-photon absorption. Results indicate this fabrication process is far simpler than current approaches and enables a read/write system that is nearly Blu-ray compatible, producing high-density multilayer storage media capacities orders of magnitude higher than the state of the art. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The explosion of digital data of all kinds in the internet, entertainment, health care, and a plethora of other industries will require an ever increasing capacity of archival storage, data distribution and security. For example, the rapid growth of ?cloud? storage and access will require secure backup. Current manufacturers of optical data storage media have continuously reported their efforts to increase capacity and density to meet future market needs, such as super HD video. In analyzing the reported approaches, the proposed process for manufacturing multilayer polymer data storage substrates has the potential to be transformative, enabling a truly scalable, low-cost approach. In addition to potential applications in digital data storage, such films could be applicable in a number of other technologies requiring written multilayer data for secure storage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A team consisting of a faculty PI, a student Entrepreneurial Lead, and a Business Mentor attended an I-Corps Entrepreneurship Program at the Georgia Institute of Technology during the summer 2012.  The team applied the hypothesis validation approach to generate a Business Model Canvas in preparation for the possible commercialization of a novel optical data storage medium discovered at the National Science Foundation Center for Layered Polymer Systems.  As a result of the program, Folio Photonics LLC was formed in October 2012 to commercialize the technology.  The Business Model Canvas and the discovered customers, partners, value proposition and other canvas elements have guided the company since its inception. Folio Photonics, LLC, is engaged in the commercialization of terabyte scale recordable optical storage disc.  While it is the same physical size as CD, it is expected to hold up to the equivalent of 50 Blu Ray discs or 250 DVDs.  This breakthrough in capacity is due to our novel DataFilm storage medium. DataFilm is manufactured in a continuous roll-to-roll polymeric co-extrusion process and contains hundreds of thin layers, each with the ability to store tens of gigabytes of data.  The film is then cut and laminated to a plastic substrate to create a DataFilm Disc (DFD). In the age where the amount of data is doubling year over year, the need for a fast, high capacity, long lived, low-energy, and inexpensive archival storage medium is essential.  The DataFilm Disc addresses all of these needs, and is a perfect candidate for the development of a new generation of archival data storage for enterprise, cloud, and personal data applications.
