<AbstractNarration>This grant provides support to broaden participation in the Twenty-first International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT12), to be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota on September 19-23, 2012. PACT is the premiere forum to bring together researchers from architecture, compilers, applications and languages to present and discuss innovative research of common interests.  The grant will primarily fund US citizens/residents, and the highest priority will be given to under-represented groups. Attending the conference is an important educational/training experience for the participants and helps create the next generation of researchers in this area.</AbstractNarration>

To augment the $12,000 from the NSF, we also obtained $3,000 from IEEE TCCA, and $7,000 from ACM SIGARCH, bringing the total amount of travel grant awards to $22,000. We awarded total 38 full-time students, among which 23 students are supported by the funding from NSF. The award amounts were determined by a mix of merit (e.g., presenting author, co-author, or attendee) and need (as demonstrated by both the raw costs for each student and whether their faculty advisor wrote a letter of support indicating that they could not provide funds). We were able to support all the students who applied for a grant.

Moreover, four student awardees have U.S. citizenship or are U.S. permanent residents. There was no student from other under-represented groups (e.g. Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Blacks or African Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders, and Persons with Disabilities) applying for the travel grant. We would put more efforts on publicity in the future events to attract more under-represented minorities, therefore, increasing the breadth and diversity of participation in the conference.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The following table captures the list of students we supported with the NSF fund</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="601"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="31" valign="top"> <p>#</p> </td> <td width="179" valign="top"> <p>Name</p> </td> <td width="234" valign="top"> <p>School</p> </td> <td width="74" valign="top"> <p>Category***</p> </td> <td width="83" valign="top"> <p>Minority</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="31" valign="top"> <p>1</p> </td> <td width="179" valign="top"> <p>Ausavarungnirun, Rachata</p> </td> <td width="234" valign="top"> <p>Carnegie Mellon University</p> </td> <td width="74" valign="top"> <p>(2)</p> </td> <td width="83" valign="top"> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="31" valign="top"> <p>2</p> </td> <td width="179" valign="top"> <p>Chidambaram, Nachiappan</p> </td> <td width="234" valign="top"> <p>Pennsylvania State University</p> </td> <td width="74" valign="top"> <p>(2)</p> </td> <td width="83" valign="top"> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="31" valign="top"> <p>3</p> </td> <td width="179" valign="top"> <p>Ding, Wei</p> </td> <td width="234" valign="top"> <p>Pennsylvania State University</p> </td> <td width="74" valign="top"> <p>(2)<...]]></DRECONTENT>
