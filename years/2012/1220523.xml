<AbstractNarration>The 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj√∂koll, which paralyzed international air traffic, called attention to Iceland?s geological uniqueness and potential global impact.  Both the explosive behavior of its many active volcanoes and the plentiful geothermal energy resources that power the clean island nation are linked to unusual oceanic magma systems that yield abundant silicic lava, ash, and granitic rocks. This project emphasizes the mineral zircon as a tracer to explore the processes operating in Iceland at present and in the past to generate silicic magmas, build a continent-like island in the mid-Atlantic, and power its dynamic volcanic and geothermal systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iceland?s size and the thickness of its crust, as well as its copious silicic magmatism, make it unique among Earth?s oceanic islands.  These characteristics have led previous researchers to propose that the island provides a modern example of the early stages of formation of permanent, low-density continental crust, perhaps mimicking the initiation of the first continents over four billion years ago.  Notably lacking in the extensive studies of Icelandic geology are investigations of zircon, which have elsewhere provided the underpinnings for much of our understanding of magmatic processes and the origin and evolution of the Earth?s crust.  Zircon, a mineral typically associated with the silicic rocks of continents and island arcs, is the most durable and reliable material for radiometric dating of high-temperature processes and at the same time provides information about the environments in which it grows.  Although a majority of Iceland?s crust is low in silica (basalt) and therefore poor in zircon, the island's higher-silica rocks (granite and rhyolite) carry sufficient zircon to elucidate its history.  This investigation builds on pilot studies by the investigators using radiometric dating and elemental and isotopic compositions of zircon to clarify the processes by which silicic magmas are generated in Iceland and stored and modified prior to eruption.  The research will refine understanding of how magmatic and related geothermal systems work in Iceland.  In so doing, it will also address issues of evolving climate (did the change from temperate to glacial conditions affect magmatic processes?) and tectonic construction of Iceland (what roles do rifting and plume processes play in production of silicic magma?; is Iceland underlain by fragments of ancient continental crust that remain from the opening of the Atlantic?).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Earth?s permanent continental crust is constructed primarily by silica-rich magmas that crystallize to form granitic and compositionally similar volcanic rocks (rhyolite, dacite).  Oceanic crust is thinner and mostly composed of less silicic, denser basalt, and therefore it is for the most part doomed to be destroyed by subduction into the underlying mantle.  Iceland is unique as an oceanic island with relatively abundant silicic rocks (~10%, with the remainder being basalt) and thick crust, and may not be destined to perish by subduction.  As such, it may provide insights into the most fundamental processes by which continental crust initially forms.   Though minute in abundance, the mineral zircon is almost ubiquitous in silicic rocks, and it is well established as the most robust means of dating ancient events and evaluating otherwise inaccessible environments of the past.  This project &ndash; the first comprehensive study of the age and geochemical information provided by zircon in Icelandic rocks &ndash; has taken advantage of these attributes, employing multiple analytical methods to characterize zircons and the rocks in which they are found throughout the island.  Among our new findings are:  (1) Contrary to a commonly held view, Iceland does not represent an environment similar to that in which Earth?s earliest known crust formed more than four billion years ago.  The only tangible record of the ancient Hadean crust is zircon crystals found as sand grains in much younger sedimentary rocks.  Our study demonstrated that elemental and isotopic compositions of Icelandic zircons are dramatically different from those of Hadean age; counterintuitively, Hadean zircons formed in a cooler and wetter environment than Icelandic zircons.  (2) Silicic magmas in Iceland were almost all products of a combination of fractional crystallization of mantle-derived basaltic magmas and remelting of the hot, newly formed Icelandic crust.  Oxygen isotope compositions of zircon document important contributions to silicic magmas from crust that had been altered by meteoric waters throughout Iceland?s history.  However, only rare, very low-volume magmas formed entirely, or largely, by melting of the crust  (3) Icelandic volcanoes may have active lifetimes that exceed two to three million years.  Using the sensitive and reliable ages recorded in zircon, this study has demonstrated longevities twice as long as previously estimated for large volcanic centers.  (4) New, greatly improved elemental partition coefficients for zircon, based in large part on data from Icelandic zircons, will greatly enhance the ability of researchers to evaluate chemical environments in which zircons crystallized.  These partition coefficients provide reliable estimates of elemental abundances in magmas from which zircon crystals grew.  Because zircons are so durable, they commonly survive long after the other minerals with which they formed, and the rocks that contained them, are destroyed; Hadean zircons older than four billion years are an excellent example.  Zircon present as grains in sand can be used to trace "lost" magmas that existed millions or billions of years ago.   In addition to contributing to "pure" science, the improved understanding of silicic volcanism in Iceland that this investigation has provided can contribute to evaluation of volcanic hazards in Iceland and internationally (e.g. to threats of explosive eruptions in Iceland to global air traffic).   Collaboration with eight senior investigators representing eight institutions in the USA, Iceland, France, Canada, and Germany was central to success of this project and the research of three PhD students and one undergraduate supported by the grant. In the process, the four students gained invaluable experience in international research and collaboration.  Two of the former PhD students are now tenure-track faculty members, one at an undergraduate institution and the other in a primarily undergraduate department.  Both new faculty members are female, and both are already carrying out new projects in Iceland with their undergraduate students.  The third PhD student, of Hispanic origin, currently has a laboratory position in Antarctica, and the undergrad (African-American female) is now enrolled in an environmental science graduate program.
