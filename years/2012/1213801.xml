<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Brian Fields at the University of Illinois and Professor Lloyd Knox at the University of California Davis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest elements--hydrogen, helium, and lithium--in the first seconds of the big bang. BBN predictions for cosmic light-element abundances are in broad agreement with observations; this concordance is a major success of the hot big bang model. Moreover, BBN provides a measure of the ordinary matter ("baryon") content of the universe, as well as total content in relativistic particles ("radiation") in both visible and invisible form (e.g., neutrinos and any other forms of "dark light"). In the past decade, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has emerged as a precise and independent measure of cosmic baryons. Comparing BBN and CMB baryon measures thus has provided a new fundamental test of the hot big bang cosmology, and reveal a "lithium problem." This BBN/CMB connection is now poised to open qualitatively new possibilities.  Recent and upcoming measurements of the CMB for the first time will simultaneously probe not only cosmic baryons, but also cosmic radiation as well as the helium abundance itself. This will enable powerful new tests of cosmology: for the first time, the predictions of BBN can be tested entirely with very precise CMB data. Agreement would dramatically demonstrate the consistency of the standard cosmology, while any difference probes new physics.  Professors Fields and Knox will both evaluate and interpret the BBN-CMB comparison, develop tools to efficiently and accurately compare BBN and CMB data. For the first time, a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach will be used to evaluate BBN uncertainties; this will allow a direct and consistent means of combining BBN predictions and CMB data and statistically characterizing the results. As part of this analysis, a new open-source BBN code will be produced, tested, and publicly released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this work will have substantial broader impacts.  A publicly available open source BBN code will be released. Moreover, new and strong links will be forged among the CMB and early-universe particle astrophysics communities, and more widely among the particle astrophysics, cosmology, and astronomy communities. Graduate students, both in formal courses in research mentoring, will be trained to synthesize these approaches and to work in an interdisciplinary way. In addition, Profs. Fields will maintain vigorous, sustained outreach programs which include school visits and public lectures bringing this forefront science to a wider audience.</AbstractNarration>

That the universe would have a dense early phase is a straightforward extrapolation, using Einstein?s general theory of relativity, from Edwin Hubble?s discovery that the universe is expanding. Using what they knew about nuclear physics, Gamow and collaborators found that the early universe could indeed be a site for nucleosynthesis (the creation of heavier elements from lighter ones). Further, they found that the early universe needed to be very hot or more heavy elements would be synthesized than are actually observed today.  This was an amazing discovery. It led Alpher and Herman to speculate about the remnants of that heat today. They predicted that today there should be a background of microwave photons, the thermal radiation of the hot and dense early phase cooled down by billions of years of expansion. This cosmic microwave background (CMB) was subsequently detected in 1964 by Penzias and Wilson, a result that led to widespread acceptance of what is now known as "the big bang": the hot, dense, and rapidly expanding phase of the universe.   Since these early days, measurements of element abundances, and measurements of the spectral properties and spatial variations in the cosmic microwave background have backed up this basic picture. More than that, they have developed into precision probes of physical processes occurring in the very early universe.   Observations of CMB anisotropy now place strong constraints on the contents of the early universe. Not only are the conditions of the early universe such that they lead to some nucleosynthesis, they also potentially lead to thermal production of a quite wide range of particles that have been theorized but not yet detected. Observations of CMB anisotropy, and light element abundances together can be used to constrain these theoretical possibilities, and potentially detect them.   Since the early work of Alpher and Herman, and indeed even after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background, we now have an amazingly successful theory called the Standard Model of Particle Physics. In this model there are 3 different species of neutrinos. With some assumptions about conditions in the early universe, one can use this model to make predictions for the early contents of the universe. One of these predictions is that a significant fraction of the energy density at very early times should be in neutrinos. This prediction has been verified via measurements of the abundance of the light elements Helium and Deuterium, and by observations of CMB anisotropy (spatial variations).  With the data from the Planck satellite, the third satellite launched to observe and successfully map out CMB anisotropy, these observations have achieved a new level of precision with which we can ask yet more refined questions of the data and hope to use it to find potential departures from the standard model of particle physics and the standard cosmological model.  We explored how well current data constrain properties of axions, or what are sometimes called "axion-like" particles (ALPs), where the latter name clarifies that this is a more general class of particles than the QCD axion.  Some expect, based on string-theoretic arguments, that there may be a number of different types of axions waiting to be discovered. We studied their production in the early universe and their impact on light element abundance, CMB anisotropies, and a host of other relevant observables.      Outcomes  We focused on mass and lifetime ranges for these particles such that decays happen near the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis. We found that a previously allowed region in parameter space near m =1 MeV and &tau; =100 ms , consistent with a QCD axion arising from a symmetry breaking near the electroweak scale, is now ruled out at &gt;3 &sigma; by the combination of CMB +D /H measurements if only ALPs, photons, and three thermalized neutrino species contribute to the relativistic energy density. This bound can be evaded if one allows for the presence of additional light species. We further found that data to come from the particle physics experiment Super-KEKB could rule out (or detect) the region near 1 MeV and 100 ms even given this additional freedom in the number of light species.
