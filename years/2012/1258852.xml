<AbstractNarration>Dr. Gabriela Valdivia (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) and Dr. Flora Lu (UC Santa Cruz) will collaborate in research to investigate the effects of regulatory changes on the relationships between government, industry, and communities. The research will take place in Huaorani communities in the Amazon region of Ecuador, a major site of seismic exploration and oil extraction, as well as in the coastal city of Esmeraldas, adjacent to the nation's main oil refinery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valdivia and Lu will conduct a combination of archival, ethnographic, household economic, and survey approaches to characterize the new regulatory framework; examine who lives in oil communities and how their daily routines and activities intersect with this extractive industry; and explore the lived, visceral experience and perceptions of oil, with attention to gendered and generational dynamics. In collaboration with Ecuadorian scholars, they will undertake focus groups, key informant interviews, archival research, participant observation, time allocation studies, household economic diaries, surveys (on topics including dietary intake, perceived health and well-being), and participatory mapping and photography in six study communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ecuador, like other countries in South America, has recently sought strategies to reduce its dependency on foreign direct investment and imported energy. The project contributes significantly to anthropological and broader social scientific analyses of environmental and energy policy, and analyses of regulation and public policy. The project will integrate the material from this research into coursework at both the graduate and undergraduate level in both the U.S. and Latin America. There are also well developed plans for the international exchange of experiences, ideas, and solutions among scientists focused on energy and environmental policy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project examines the effects of the regulatory changes introduced in the oil sector at the beginning of the twenty-first century on the relationships between state, firm, and community in Ecuador. Our goals were to: (1) characterize the new regulatory framework of oil under the Correa administration, its implementation, and how these reassemble relationships between state, firms, and communities; (2) better understand those populations who live adjacent to the oil complex and the routines and activities through which they intersect with it; (3) explore the experience of the oil complex to better understand the visceral experience of life entangled in the oil complex, with attention to its gendered and generational dynamics. As a study of the political economy of oil in a South American country, our project contributes to scholarship about the economic, ecological, and socio-cultural tensions that arise when social investment and infrastructural development are funded by oil extraction in biodiverse and fragile environments. Our focus on understanding the experiences of Native Amazonians (including people in voluntary isolation) and Afro-Ecuadorians moves beyond deficit and damage-centered frameworks to illuminate state-citizen relations and demonstrate the integral role of these groups in state formation and policies.</p> <p>Co-Principal Investigators Lu and Valdivia created academic opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to engage with the subject matter, from classroom teaching and conference presentations to international fieldwork. Students from diverse backgrounds honed their ability to write proposals, analyze data, enact human subjects&rsquo; protection, and synthesize and share results. Over the course of the project, six REU and two REG grants were awarded, six senior theses produced (winning four academic awards), and many opportunities generated for UNC and UCSC students to present research findings in community-organized, university-sponsored, and academic conferences. We also disseminated our&nbsp;research findings broadly to representative organizations and members of the communities who participated in the research and the scientific communities in the U.S. and Ecuador. This includes videos in English and Spanish on youtube.com; project reports in English, Spanish and&nbsp;<em>Wao tededo</em>; multiple publications (one book, four book chapters, four peer-reviewed journal articles); and many presentations for academic audiences as well as the broader public.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/06/2018<br>      Modified by: Flora&nbsp;Lu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1258852/1258852_10240910_1533587937330_WaoraniandOil--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1258852/1258852_10240910_1533587937330_WaoraniandOil--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Waorani and the impacts of oil"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1258852/1258852_10240910_1533587937330_WaoraniandOil--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Waorani and the impacts of oil"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A Waorani man wearing an oil company uniform sits along the oil road in his community.
