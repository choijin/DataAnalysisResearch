<AbstractNarration>Probing Fluids, Fractures, Faults, and Strain with PBO Borehole Data&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duncan Carr Agnew&lt;br/&gt;Andrew J. Barbour&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are studying the how the uppermost part of the Earth's crust behaves when it also contains fluids such as water, using data from the borehole strainmeter (BSM) network operated by the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) component of Earthscope.  This network includes measurements of ground deformation (strain) and fluid pressure at sites throughout the western United States, some of them in an active fault zone: the San Jacinto fault in southern California.  We are examining how the strain and fluid pressure change because of changing air pressure acting on the ground, seismic waves from distant earthquakes, and the tidal motions of the Earth's crust.  We are combining this information with data on the fractures around each borehole to estimate hydraulic properties of the surrounding material, and relate these to large-scale features (such as fault zones) in each region of the network.  At one site we are also looking at how groundwater pumping (which we monitor) affects two strainmeters nearby.  We are developing methods to correct these and other BSM data for nearby pumping or other groundwater changes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this grant was to study data from the borehole strainmeters (BSM's) installed as part of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), to learn about both the performance of these sensors, and to investigate what their data could tell us about fault zones and about other processes in the Earth. Most of the data came from BSM's along the San Jacinto fault in Southern California, in the Anza region, where a large earthquake is thought to have a larger chance of happening than elsewhere.  The first thing studied was how groundwater changes affected these measurements, which we could investigate using a a large-scale experiment, where two closely-spaced BSM's are affected by nearby pumping which we recorded.  We found that the data validated the BSM calibration.  Models for the data show that fluid flow is relatively rapid, and the rocks relatively weak, for this location within the San Jacinto fault.  In a related study, we compared changes in groundwater pressure caused by earthquake waves to the Earth deformation recorded by the BSM's.  Within the zones of the San Jacinto fault and the San Andreas fault, there is little change in pressure, compared to what is observed away from the faults.  This implies that the fault-zone rocks allow easy and rapid flow of fluids, probably because the rocks are very fractured.  Finally, we examined the steps in the BSM date seen for local earthquakes.  Most of the BSM steps differ substantially from the strain predicted by models (validated by other data), and also do not match longbase laser strainmeter data: the average disagreement is a factor of six.  The large seismic waves must be causing apparent strain offsets, so the BSM strain-step data are not useful.       Last Modified: 11/02/2015       Submitted by: Duncan Carr Agnew]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
