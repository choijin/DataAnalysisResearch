<AbstractNarration>Arsenic is a naturally occurring metalloid that is toxic to most organisms and is a known human carcinogen.  It is a major contaminant of soils and ground water in many regions of the world and an increasing agricultural and health concern.  The fern Pteris vittata is exceptional among plants and animals in that it is able to tolerate and accumulate very high levels of arsenic.  The goal of this project is to understand how this fern is able to do this by discovering genes and the mechanisms necessary for arsenic tolerance and accumulation in this species.  One aim of the project is to determine the route arsenic travels from the soil to the top of the plant where it is sequestered and test whether and how arsenic-related proteins previously identified (called ACR2 and ACR3) are involved in determining this route.  A second aim is to discover new arsenic-related genes by assembling and identifying all of the genes that turn on or off in response to arsenic.  Finally, individual genes that are turned on by arsenic will be knocked-down in the fern and tested to see if they are also necessary for arsenic tolerance in this species.  The knowledge gained from this project has great potential to eliminate arsenic contamination in food and feed crops.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Funds for this project will support three graduate students and many undergraduate students, who will receive training in molecular genetic techniques, data analysis, plant culture techniques and technical writing in order to assist in the research described.  To inform the public about this remarkable 'arsenic-eating plant', the PI has been interviewed by NPR and participates in a local science caf√© where this work is described.   Each summer the PI also helps to prepare 20 elite high school students selected from across the US for the annual International Biology Olympiad.  Data from this project will be used extensively in training these students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Pteris vittata is an extraordinary fern that is able to thrive on and accumulate large amounts of the deadly toxin arsenic.  Our research project is to understand how this fern is capable of accomplishing this feat by seeking the genes in this fern that are necessary for tolerance to arsenic.  By sequencing the genes in arsenic treated and non-treated plants, we have identified several genes whose expression is turned up by arsenic.  By knocking-down their expression in the fern, we discovered that three of these genes are necessary for arsenic tolerance.  We then performed experiments to understand how they function in the fern.  The results of these experiments have led us to propose a new model that describes how arsenic, once it enters the cell, is moved through the cell?s interior in a manner that sequesters arsenic so that it is unable to exert its toxic effects.  In other experiments, we asked if the same fern genes, when expressed in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana (which does not tolerate arsenic), could render the plant tolerant to arsenic.  One fern gene, called PvACR3, not only renders transgenic Arabidopsis plants more tolerant to arsenic, but also increases the amount of arsenic that accumulates in the shoot.  This information will be useful for the remediation of arsenic contaminated soils using plants.       Last Modified: 10/03/2017       Submitted by: Jo Ann Banks]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
