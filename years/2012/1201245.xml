<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to answer the question: how does oxidative stress affect the response of red blood cells (RBCs) to changes in shear stress?  Many chemical species are known to affect the "fluidity" of red blood cell membranes and their corresponding ability to deliver oxygen throughout the body.  Little is known, however, about the dynamic response of RBCs to changes in shear stress, such as the increased viscous stress present in an atherosclerotic constriction.  In particular, oxidative stress - the excess in reactive oxygen species associated with many disease states - is known to cause RBC membranes to rigidify.  Strikingly, however, it is unknown how quickly oxidative stress causes RBCs to rigidify, and it is unknown how quickly or to what degree shear-induced mechanotransductive signaling is affected.  Studies conducted under this award will combine high-speed video and sensitive photon-counting assays to investigate the behavior of RBCs moving through model constrictions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, these studies will provide the first hard experimental data regarding the mechanical and biological responses of RBCs to changes in shear stress under varied amounts of oxidative stress.  The knowledge gained from these efforts will thus enhance the field's ability to model and understand RBC behavior under more physiologically relevant flow conditions, ultimately providing a more fundamental understanding of several disease states associated with oxidative stress (e.g., diabetes and pulmonary hypertension).  The educational plan focuses on leveraging the awardee's expertise in high-speed video at the elementary school level, by collaborating with a local children's science museum to develop interactive hands-on exhibitions. At the undergraduate level, the results of this research will be incorporated into a seminar titled "The Mechanics of Blood," which will focus on exposing students to research opportunities across campus and helping attract undecided first-year students to science or engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research investigated how red blood cells (RBCs) behave when they move through a constriction.  This behavior is important to understand both for healthy situations, like when RBCs move from a large artery to a smaller capillary, or unhealthy situations, such as when RBCs pass through an atherosclerotic constriction (i.e., where plaque builds up in a capillary and blocks flow, leading to cardiovascular disease).   Both of these situations have a common feature: in the wide part of the channel the flow is slow, and then it speeds up as it enters the constriction.  Our research was aimed at understanding how the RBCs respond to this acceleration of the fluid flow, both mechanically and in terms of "mechanotransduction," which refers to how different molecules are emitted by the RBCs in response to the change in flow.  To do the experiments, we took RBCs from human volunteers and inserted them into a "microfluidic channel" that had a constriction in it.  We used high speed video cameras to obseve the motion of the RBCs, and we used an enzyme extracted from fireflies (luciferase) that reacts with a molecule called ATP to release light - this molecule is believed to be released by RBCs in response to the higher velocity in the constriction.    Our high speed video work yielded several notable results.  First, We performed an exhaustive analysis of all the observed motions and demonstrated that the observed rotational behaviors (twisting, flipping, tumbling) of the RBCs is explicable in terms of simple models of rigid body rotation (Zeng &amp; Ristenpart, Biomicrofluidics, 2014).  Second, we showed that RBCs drawn from donors diagnosed with metabolic abmormalities exhibit significantly less deformability compared to healthy controls.  In other words, healthy RBCs were stretchy, but RBCs from patients with metabolic syndrome were relatively rigid. (Zeng et al., PLoS One, 2016).  Third, we performed highly detailed measurements of the strecthing dynamics of individual RBCs, including both the initial stretching and the subsequent retraction.  We demonstrated that the observed extension/retraction was explicable in terms of a simple "viscoelastic" model called the Kelvin-Voight model, but that the observed elastic modulus (a measure of the RBC "stretchiness" ) is a factor of 10 higher than values reported for slower flow conditions.  This last result suggests that efforts to model RBC flow inside the human body might be using incorrect values for mechanical properties measured under flow conditions dissimilar to those that occur in the body (Mancuso and Ristenpart, in submission, 2016).   The broader impact of our work, using pressure driven flow through constrictions, is establishing that the mechanical behavior of RBCs is much more diverse and complex than anticipated based on the current experimental paradigm of simple linear velocity gradients.  The key take home message is that work aimed at understanding how RBCs behave in flow should use experimental flow conditions similar to those observed in the human body, since experiments performed under other flow conditions might not necessarily be representative of how they behave in the body.
