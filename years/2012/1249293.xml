<AbstractNarration>This program is for theoretical research and education for a revolutionary recent idea for quantum computation, known as topological quantum computation (TQC). TQC has been shown to be free of many of the serious problems facing other more conventional means of quantum computation. Although this has been proved as a point of principle in mathematics, suitable platforms to support TQC are yet to be found in nature and this program addresses this issue. In the absence of suitable natural platforms, the PIs will devise practical methods to artificially induce the desired properties for TQC on cold atom systems and semiconductors. They will also develop the appropriate TQC architectures on the considered physical systems and study the fundamental limits on quantum coherence due to thermal and disorder effects in the various TQC platforms. In contrast to other, more "conventional" means of quantum computation, TQC is inherently fault-tolerant and scalable. The studies performed in this program, consisting of TQC platforms, limits on quantum coherence, and suitable computation architectures, will result in TQC being one step closer to experimental realization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will seek to realize synthetic TQC platforms and to design appropriate TQC architectures. A deep theoretical understanding of the fundamental limits of quantum protection in these systems would not only pioneer coherent control of quantum information, but would also influence the basic strongly-correlated atomic and electronic physics in the classroom. The latter has broader impact beyond the field of quantum computation. This research will foster training of graduate students at both Washington State University and Clemson University at the interface of quantum information science, atomic physics, condensed matter physics, and numerical methods. The diverse nature of this training will prepare the students in a multidisciplinary employment market. This research will also help both universities update the physics curriculum to reflect the modern trends in science and technology. Per NSF mission of promoting science and engineering education, these integrated research and education activities will promote the participation of undergraduate and graduate students from the state of Washington and the EPSCoR state of South Carolina in science and technology, and will improve the two states' long-term infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ About six decades ago modern electronics was reinvented by switching from analog to digital data processing. Today we may be witnessing another conceptual revolution in data processing known as quantum information processing. The prospect of quantum information arises from the creative use of the resources of quantum mechanics to exponentially enhance the computational power of a device. Representative problems include efficient quantum simulation, secure communication based on quantum cryptography, many classically intractable but technologically significant computational problems (e.g., prime factorization), and quantum database search. Given the potential of this spectacular technological breakthrough, the race is on to determine the ideal physical system in which to implement the basic, workable, architecture of a functional quantum computer.     The principal obstacle to quantum computation arises from the interactions of a quantum system with a large number of external degrees of freedom which constitute the æenvironmentÆ. The interactions with the environment, usually referred as ædecoherenceÆ or ænoiseÆ, render the system behave almost classically. Another major obstacle concerns scalability: a realistic quantum computer would consist of millions of the basic quantum two-level systems, commonly called quantum bit or æqubitÆ, as well as billons of quantum operations, commonly called 'quantum gates'. The problem then is not just to isolate an individual system from its environment; one must also ensure that the errors at the individual qubits and quantum gates do not aggregate to render the entire system too noisy. Remarkably, the important quantum threshold theorem for fault-tolerant computation ensures that if the noise per gate is below a threshold, fault-tolerant computation can still be achieved using error correction codes at the software level. However, as it has become clear in the past few years, reducing the noise below the stringently low threshold is experimentally very difficult.

Some of our theoretical predictions have been realized or currently under investigation in experiments. Some of our works have created great impact in the community. For instance, the PI did the first study of BCS-BEC crossover physics in spin-orbit coupled degenerate Fermi gases (Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 195303 (2011)).
