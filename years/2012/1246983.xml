<AbstractNarration>Earth is unique among the known planets in exhibiting plate tectonics as the primary means of transporting internally generated heat.  Plate tectonics is responsible for Earth's unusual topography distribution, geochemical interaction between the surface and the deep interior, and the strength of the geodynamo, among other factors that make our home planet special. The timing of the origin of plate tectonics on Earth has been difficult to establish observationally, but there are hints of very early (Hadean) geochemical processes with modern plate tectonic analogues. The mechanism and timing of plate tectonic initiation have direct bearing on models of the geochemical and thermal evolution of our planet, the uniqueness of Earth as an abode for life, and our understanding terrestrial planets in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will primarily support a graduate student to carry out, under the mentoring of the PI, numerical simulations of heat transport in the pre-plate tectonic Earth in order to understand the transition to plate tectonic behavior.  This period of history is dominated by volcanic heat transport, called the heat-pipe mode of planetary cooling.  Numerical simulation of the flow of Earth?s mantle materials including heat transport by melting and melt segregation (volcanism) will be accomplished using a specialized code.  A systematic investigation of the parameters governing convection and melting will be undertaken, and bounds on the transition to plate tectonics will be established.  The implications for early Earth will be compared with published petrological and geochemical data.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong> </strong>The NSF-funded project "Heat Transport in the Hadean Mantle: From Heat Pipes to Plates," has resulted in three very significant outcomes. First, student support from this project led to the granting of Hampton University's first Ph.D. in Planetary Science to Dr. Duminda Kankanamge. Hampton University has the only Planetary Science program at a Historically Black College or University and the granting of this degree marks the culmination of a decade of effort to develop this program. Second, Dr. Kankanamge's work published in Geophysical Research Letters provided the first quantitative models of the pre-plate-tectonic Earth, demonstrating how heat pipe volcanism suppresses plate tectonics. This work opens a window onto the early geologic history of our planet, a time when Earth's atmosphere and ocean formed and life first arose. Third, in a manuscript to be published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, Dr. Kankanamge has demonstrated how heat pipes affect the evolution of all rocky planets early in their history. This work helps us understand the difference between planets such as Earth and Venus, and provides us the basis for interpreting observations of rocky planets around other stars. The accompanying figure illustrates the evolutionary pathways followed by rocky planets as they cool from initially hot, molten states (magma oceans) through heat-pipe volcanism, to settle down into plate tectonic (Earth) or single-plate, rigid-lid states (all other planets known). The figure demonstrates that the heat production rate at the time of the transition determines whether a planet experiences plate tectonics (higher heating rates) or rigid lid (lower heating rates). Rocky exoplanets several times Earth's mass are identified by "LTP." They remain in the heat-pipe phase for long periods (billions of years), making it likely that they will be observed in this phase. This work has also been submitted for publication (in Earth and Planetary Science Letters) as part of a project partially supported by this grant.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/21/2017<br>      Modified by: William&nbsp;B&nbsp;Moore</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246983/1246983_10228888_1492787356734_HFCart--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246983/1246983_10228888_1492787356734_HFCart--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Evolution of Heat Flow and Temperature for Rocky Planets"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246983/1246983_10228888_1492787356734_HFCart--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Evolution of Heat Flow and Temperature for Rocky Planets"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The evolution of the heat flow and internal temperature for rocky planets is shown starting from the magma ocean state in the upper right.
