<AbstractNarration>Montana State University proposes to transform their main campus through a systematic approach that operationalizes Self-Determination Theory (SDT).  Guided by their institutional context, the social science literature, and the tenets of SDT they propose a number of activities to achieve three main goals established to increase the participation and advancement of women in the STEM fields.  Their goals include improving research capacity; improving work-life balance; and improving cultural attunement.  To achieve these goals they propose several unique initiatives including the development of policy to encourage interdisciplinary research; a care-giving leave donation pool; and the use of diversity depth hires (incentives to hire women in STEM departments with low representation.)  Their robust test of SDT has strong potential for broader impacts both on their regional campuses and across the country.</AbstractNarration>

The initiative was highly successful. Over five years, grant expenditures by women in STEM/SBS more than doubled to nearly $14 million. In that time, the number of projects with women PIs increased by 49% and the average yearly research expenditure per woman faculty member increased by more than 22%. The gender gap in total grant expenditures per STEM PI closed by 14%, with the difference between men and women starting at $67,274 in 2012, closing to $27,212 in 2016. Moreover, 79 faculty from 30 different departments and centers (including at least one person from every STEM department on campus) participated in one of five Grant-Writing Bootcamps. A one-year pre-post test of the impact of Bootcamp on women faculty in STEM&rsquo;s research capacity was reported in the peer-reviewed journal Bioscience.

The initiative was highly successful. Longitudinal survey data shows that involvement with Project TRACS significantly increased self-determination and improved all faculty members' feelings of job satisfaction over time, no matter their gender or field of study (published in Smith, Handley et al). One example of impact of this initiative was a 67% increase in the number of women faculty hires in STEM/SBS. MSU went from 60 women faculty in STEM/SBS at the start to 100 women at the end of ADVANCE. The Broadening the Search Process training was largely responsible for the improvement in faculty hiring as shown by a randomized and controlled trial test of our three-step faculty search intervention based in self-determination theory. Results were published in the peer-reviewed journal Bioscience (Smith et al., 2015) and featured in several national media outlets. The data show that the numbers of women candidates considered for and offered tenure-track positions were significantly higher in the intervention groups compared with those in controls. Searches in the intervention were 6.3 times more likely to make an offer to a woman candidate, and women who were made an offer were 5.8 times more likely to accept the offer from an intervention search.</p> <p class="Pa3"><strong>Enhancing Work-Life Integration</strong>: This initiative focused on flexible solutions for work-life integration in general and during major life transitions for all faculty. Because of this initiative, infrastructure increased to support faculty during difficult life transitions: 3 policies were created or modified: The&nbsp;Extending the Tenure Review Period&nbsp;policy, the Faculty Modified Duties policy (with centralized funding), and the Sick Leave Donation Pool Policy; 6 new family care-rooms were created including in the high profile space in the student union building; and 4 job descriptions were broadened: 2 new job candidate family advocates, 1 Student Family Support Program Manager, 1 faculty dual-career community liaison, and 1 work-life HR specialist. A total of over 400 job candidates were supported by a Job Candidate Family Advocate; and approximately 130 people received one-on-one assistance from a Family Advocate. Project TRACS worked on more than 70 academic partner accommodation cases resulting in 33 tenure-track faculty who accepted positions in 21 different departments (63% women) over five years.
