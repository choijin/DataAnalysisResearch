<AbstractNarration>The Magnolia grandiFLORA project, named in honor of the official state tree and flower of Mississippi, will develop digital databases of images, labels, and georeferenced locality data for more than 250,000 vascular plant specimens from herbaria at Mississippi State University, University of Mississippi, Delta State University, University of Southern Mississippi, Gulf Coast Research Laboratory, Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, and Institute for Botanical Exploration.  A web interface that allows for integrated database searches will be established through the High Performance Computing Collaboratory at Mississippi State University.  Specimen imaging and label digitization will provide worldwide access to the collections, biological and geographical metadata for broad-scale studies based on plants, and a permanent back-up of specimen data in the event of natural or other disasters.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting high quality data set will provide tools for plant identification and information on plant distributions in Mississippi to government agencies, researchers, and the general public.  These data have applications in tracking rare and invasive species, developing environmental policy, increasing citizen knowledge of the natural history of Mississippi, and enhancing K-12 science education with interactive tools.  The data will contribute to the development of a comprehensive list of plants in Mississippi and national efforts to catalog and map plant diversity.  Numerous undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the project.</AbstractNarration>

The project is named in honor of the state&rsquo;s official flower and tree, Southern Magnolia (<em>Magnolia grandiflora</em>). These efforts began in the herbaria at the University of Mississippi (Dr. Lucile McCook), Mississippi State University (Dr. Lisa Wallace), Delta State University (Dr. Nina Baghai-Riding), the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science (Ms. Libby Hartfield, Ms. Heather Sullivan, Ms. Angel Rohnke), and the University of Southern Mississippi (Dr. Mac Alford). A portion of the collection at the Institute for Botanical Exploration, previously housed at MSU, and the Gulf Coast Research Collection, now housed at USM, are also being digitized through this project. Collectively, these herbaria contain more than 400,000 preserved plant specimens.</p> <p><strong>Why digitize the specimens?&nbsp; </strong></p> <p>Natural history collections, much like libraries, are important reservoirs of historical information about biodiversity and contribute to many areas of science and society, including systematics, ecology, environmental management, agriculture, and medicine. These collections also provide educational benefits by documenting distributions and providing resources to identify species and their unique features. The preservation of biological collections is essential for maintaining and expanding knowledge about biodiversity, particularly in the face of habitat modification and biodiversity loss.</p> <p>Digital access to herbarium specimens and their associated georeferenced collection locales enhances their value because individuals who may not have previously thought of using the collections have ready access through the internet.&nbsp; Our digitization process involves four steps: 1) capturing high-resolution images of herbarium sheets, 2) transcribing herbarium labels into a computer database, 3) determining geographic coordinates for the collection location of each specimen, and 4) providing all of this information in a searchable web interface.<strong> <br /></strong></p> <p><strong>How will the digitized data be used? </strong></p> <p>Mississippi ranks in the top third to half of U.S. states for the predicted levels of plant diversity. Documentation of most species distributions in MS is sparse, representing one of the major gaps in our knowledge of the North American flora. The data set that will be assembled from this project is urgently needed to accurately document biodiversity and understand underlying processes contributing to high biodiversity of the Southeast. &nbsp;Additionally, the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science led the development of educational materials for K-12 teachers and students that can be integrated into the existing Mississippi science education framework.</p> <p><strong>What was accomplished in our first five years?</strong></p> <p>In total, among the six core herbaria in this project (DSC, IBE, MISS, MISSA, MMNS, and USM), we digitized, in whole or in part, approximately 258,000 specimens, slightly exceeding the original goal of 250,000. &nbsp;Roughly 97% of those specimens have high-resolution digital images loaded into a public, searchable database, accessible through two organizations: the SouthEast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC; sernecportal.org) and the NSF-funded Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio; www.idigbio.org). A little more than one-third of the specimens (35%) have been georeferenced, to provide geolocations of the original site of collection.</p> <p>In accomplishing this work, at Mississippi State University alone, we involved 10 undergraduate students and 8 graduate students in all facets of specimen preservation, storage/organization, imaging, label digitization, and georeferencing.&nbsp; Those students were supported for a total of 51 months (average of 2.7 months per student) during their studies at MSU.&nbsp; The full impact of the educational component of this program, however, will be met through the teacher training and teaching materials that continue to be provided through the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science.&nbsp; Their &ldquo;Project Magnolia&rdquo; program provides botany training and resources to teachers throughout the state, with six workshops having been held during the grant period.&nbsp; Educational materials from the program are provided through the project website (MississippiPlants.org) and have been solicited not only by teachers in Mississippi but from other states, as well.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/24/2018<br>      Modified by: Gary&nbsp;N&nbsp;Ervin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203687/1203687_10181562_1537820703370_Botany2016poster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203687/1203687_10181562_1537820703370_Botany2016poster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Botany Conference 2016"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203687/1203687_10181562_1537820703370_Botany2016poster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Botany Conference 2016"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This project, named in honor of the state tree and flower of Mississippi, involves the six largest herbaria in Mississippi, and provides improved access to more than 200,000 specimen sheets, as well as georeferenced locales.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Lisa Wallace</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gary&nbsp;N&nbsp;Ervin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Botany Conference 2016</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203687/1203687_10181562_1537820808598_iDigBio_portal--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203687/1203687_10181562_1537820808598_iDigBio_portal--rgov-800width.jpg" title="iDigBio portal to MISSA specimens"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203687/1203687_10181562_1537820808598_iDigBio_portal--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="iDigBio portal to MISSA specimens"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is one of the web portals through which digitized specimens from this database can be accessed.</div> <div class="imageCredit">iDigBio</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gary&nbsp;N&nbsp;Ervin</div> <div class="imageTitle">iDigBio portal to MISSA specimens</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203687/1203687_10181562_1537820897988_WebPortal--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203687/1203687_10181562_1537820897988_WebPortal--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Magnolia grandiFLORA portal"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203687/1203687_10181562_1537820897988_WebPortal--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Magnolia grandiFLORA portal"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is the web home for our digitization project.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Lisa Wallace</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gary&nbsp;N&nbsp;Ervin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Magnolia grandiFLORA portal</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203687/1203687_10181562_1537821141564_InfoCardAngioFront--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203687/1203687_10181562_1537821141564_InfoCardAngioFront--rgov-800width.jpg" title="InfoCard -
