<AbstractNarration>The primary objective of this project is to provide theoretical support for updating and improving parameters for the water vapor molecule in the HITRAN database. The latest changes made to the pressure broadened half-width, induced line shift, and temperature exponent for the principal oxygen isotopologue of water vapor in HITRAN come mostly from theoretical calculations that rely on the Robert-Bonamy formalism, which was developed more than three decades ago and contains several approximations. Direct calculation of these spectroscopic parameters from first principles is characterized by theoretical complexity as well as numerical difficulty. The proposed approach offers several new features and advantages. First, re-formulating the Robert-Bonamy formalism shows that the removal of one debilitating approximation actually reduces the computational burden. Second, introducing the coordinate representation in Hilbert space enables the use of sufficiently high cut-offs to guarantee full convergence for all the calculations. Third, contribution analysis from different collisional processes establishes a new guideline for selecting benchmark lines in optimizing the potential model. Furthermore, the adoption of the causal function concept from signal processing to obtain the Hilbert transforms, crucial in calculating line shifts, allows the calculations to go forward without even having to perform the Cauchy principal integrations. With these powerful tools in hand, the broadened half-widths, line shifts, and temperature exponents for the absorption lines in the pure rotational band will be recalculated ? all with full convergence and from the "exact" trajectory model. These results will significantly reduce the numerical uncertainties, and are thus more reliable than the existing calculated values in HITRAN 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reliable information retrieval using space and ground-based instruments, and reliable climate and atmospheric modeling are directly dependent on accurate water vapor spectroscopic parameters provided by HITRAN. Research scientists in many different disciplines have come to expect the high quality of HITRAN as their indispensable data resource that simply must be correct. The updating of the HITRAN water vapor spectroscopic parameters will improve the accuracy of radiative transfer modeling, such as the 20 micrometer 'dirty window' spectral region that controls the local energy balance in the cold and dry polar atmospheres. The computational approach described herein is applicable not only to the water vapor lines in the pure rotation band, but to other bands as well. Moreover, it can also be used to predict line parameters that involve very high j states in the development of HITEMP, a project designed to address high-temperature modeling of the spectra of molecular gases needed for astrophysics, planetary and stellar atmospheres, as well as industrial, environmental, and surveillance applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Retrieval of reliable information from space and ground-based measurements and the ability to perform reliable climate and atmospheric modeling require accurate and reliable knowledge of the spectroscopic parameters of the radiatively significant molecules. Molecular spectra cover the entire spectrum from the microwave to the ultraviolet with each of these molecular species contributing literally thousands or even millions of spectral lines. A full and complete knowledge of these lines, including how their intensities and shapes vary with the temperature and pressure of the atmospheric environment, is crucial in all of these applications. Meanwhile, there are many cases where the spectra are not solely determined by individual molecular lines. These events result from so-called line mixing, i.e., another important collision-induced spectroscopic phenomenon which occurs when collisions between two molecules cause redistribution of line intensity thereby dramatically changing spectral distributions. Thus, accurate knowledge of line mixing is also crucial, especially in spectrally resolved remote sensing applications.   In order to meet the requirements, great experimental and theoretical efforts have been carried out by many research groups around the world over the past half of century. Given the fact that there are millions and millions molecular lines, to measure all of them is not realistic. In addition, measurements canÆt be performed at some temperatures and pressures of interest. Hence, line shape theories play an important role for providing the necessary information. Unfortunately, there are still no satisfactory theories available that can fully meet all of the spectroscopic requirements.    For example, with respect to some important spectroscopic parameters, one of the line shape theories (i.e., the Robert-Bonamy formalism) has be commonly used to calculate these parameters for the past 35 years and the calculated results have been adopted in main databases. Despite many improvements of this formalism, its main weaknesses remain unaddressed. In many cases, calculated results donÆt match measurements well. On the other hand, concerning with line mixing, for complex molecular systems, there are no "first principle" calculations in existence, and the Robert-Bonamy formalism completely fails to address this research subject. As a result, one has to rely on the use of semi-empirical models involving adjustable parameters.    We have studied line shape theories for two decades, and the current project represents our recent efforts to improve the Robert-Bonamy formalism. By carefully scrutinizing the theoretical basis of this formalism, we have found that one of its main weaknesses arises from the application of an invalid approximation. By removing this approximation, and by correctly evaluating the terms involved, we have developed a better and more capable formalism which enables one to not only reduce uncertainties of the calculated spectroscopic parameters, but also to calculate the effects on the spectra arising from line mixing. The method has been successfully applied for several important molecules including nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. In comparison with that obtained from the Robert-Bonamy formalism, the newly calculated spectroscopic parameters are closer to measured data. Our improvements to the Robert-Bonamy formalism are developed from a sound basis in physics. In summary, with significantly enhancing our knowledge of line mixing and opening the door for a more accurate prediction of molecular spectra important in remote sensing applications, the achievement of this project is far beyond our original expectations and has a profound impact on the development of the line shape theory.
