<AbstractNarration>The publications culture of a research community has an impact much broader than simply how research is disseminated. This culture can have substantive impacts on how and why research is conducted.  The purpose of the workshop is to bring together key players in this ongoing discussion within the CISE community for a discussion and deliberation, with the aim of analyzing the issues and developing guidelines for the way forward. The participants will represent all stakeholders, from academic researchers to for-profit publishers. A specific focus of the workshop would be to develop consensus around a set of guiding principles. The workshop will make significant progress in exploring the current and alternative publication models for computing research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The computing fields have a unique publication culture that relies heavily on conferences as a venue for publishing scholarly work. However this different publication model has a number of negative impacts on the conduct or research. In addition, scholarly publication in general is under considerable stress including the tension between open access and reader-pays publishing, the role of social media in reviewing and publishing, and the (likely negative) impacts on the computing societies which are major publishers within the field. This project brought together a group of stakeholders, from researchers to for-profit publishers, to discuss the issues involved and to generate a consensus manifesto which has been published and presented to appropriate groups.  As intended, the workshop focused on the issues that need addressing:        Scaling: The publishing ecosystem in computing research&mdash;conference and journals&mdash;has not scaled up. Policy: We have no universally accepted norms and policies, and no single authority. Data: We have many opinions but little data. Business model: Huge gap between publishers and authors/readers. Incentives: Large number of small papers. Measurements: Highly imperfect metrics. Conferences: Too many submissions and resubmissions, random-like decisions, too many conferences, too much travel, conferences as "journals that meet in hotels". Journals: Not exciting, hard to find reviewers, poor journal management systems. Reviewing: Increasing burden, declining standards, declining competence.             The end result is a better understanding of the publication process within the computing fields that will result in higher value and higher quality research, which encompasses both intellectual merit and broader impact.
