<AbstractNarration>This Partnership for Innovation project from SUNY College of Environmental Science &amp; Forestry will improve and enhance the technology for Hot Water Extraction (HWE) to carefully and completely deconstruct wood. The process that is being developed and applied will sustainably and cost effectively extract highly valuable carbohydrate and chemical assets from wood fiber. The enhanced technology that will result from this research will facilitate the development of valuable bioproducts that increase the rate of commercial implementations. These HWE derived bioproducts will replace similar products which are made from less sustainable and by less efficient means both in the U.S. and abroad. The wood fiber (and its constituent asset elements that will be the focus of this project) is currently primarily being burned for energy. In addition to the production advantages of HWE technology, the production of these products within the forested economic regions where industry needs them will reduce transportation costs and environmental impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project will accelerate the building of capacity and skill to strategically locate, engineer, design, fabricate equipment, and build facilities to efficiently and cost-effectively make products from existing raw materials; frequently on existing underutilized sites. Further, the partners will gain significant technical expertise and market advantage in understanding how to enhance the HWE process for these carbohydrate and chemical products. The broader impacts of this research extend to all forested regions of the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Knowledge Enhancement Partners are the lead academic institution , the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry and three small for profit business: 1) Applied Biorefinery Sciences, Syracuse, New York, Dr. Joel Howard; 2) Highland Engineering, Glens Falls, New York ( Mr. Patrick Sullivan, and 3) Miller Mechanical Services, Glens Falls, New York , Ms. Elizabeth Miller. RockTenn is a large for-profit forest products business and a non-KEP partner; the liaison is Dr. Jose Iribarne at the Solvay, NY facility.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF PFI-BIC Award Number 1237815  - Project Outcomes Report                 This project has four major research components, each with its relevant outcomes.  The first component resulted in the development of a Hot Water Extraction (HWE) followed by an Acetone, Water, and Oxygen (AWO) delignification procedure producing a high quality lignin for commercial applications.  The lignin does not have any added sulfur, making it preferable to currently available lignin from commercial processes.  This procedure was also demonstrated to be able to produce a substrate useful for laboratory production of Nano-Cellulose materials. The second component uses lignin recovered from HWE to produce resin that has competitive strength properties (98% of the tensile strength) with those of a widely used commercial Phenol Formaldehyde (PF) resin.  The resin produced in this work uses the recovered lignin mixed with furfural, which can also be recovered from HWE, and processing conditions comparable to those used for commercial PF resin.  The third component prepared Nano Fibrillated Cellulose (NFC) from softwood bleached pulp and Nano Crystalline Cellulose from HWE-AWO prepared material.  The NFC was shown to significantly increase the water retention value and to have significant effect on strength in tests of blends with a hydrophilic plastic (PVA).  The fourth component developed a potentially useful, at a commercial scale, process for producing furfural from the five carbon sugars (over 90% xylose) extracted during Hot Water Extraction of hardwood chips.  The process has selectivity over 80% (xylose to furfural) with conversion of over 95% of the xylose.  This work used pure xylose solutions and will need to be extended to mixed sugar mixtures to continue development of this novel process for commercial use in Biorefineries.  An additional outcome of this work is that initial funding ($3.5M) has been secured towards a $16M scale up facility to be built at a site in New York State.  This facility will scale up the HWO process and provide much larger samples for resin production and product testing of a wide range of intended Biorefinery products.  The facility is designed to be a continuous processing system with a capacity of 5+ Metric tons per day and involves the three Knowledge Enhancement Partners from this project.
