<AbstractNarration>This project is responding to urgent needs to graduate increased numbers of engineers by developing and evaluating an online calculus course for engineering students. Calculus is a critical course in the success of engineering students, and success rates need to be improved for this course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also producing new knowledge concerning the effectiveness of online learning forums as instructional interventions in engineering education. It is creating and disseminating usage guidelines to promote widespread use of online learning forums throughout STEM education, including K-12 and undergraduate settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supporting a national need to rapidly increase opportunities for underrepresented student groups (geographically dispersed rural residents, working professionals, and women) to pursue engineering degrees via distance education. The numbers of nontraditional students now participating in distance engineering programs necessitates innovative instructional interventions to support them within these challenging new learning environments.&lt;br/&gt;                            &lt;br/&gt;In sum, this project is seeking to 1) improve engineering student academic achievement in calculus, 2) increase engineering student interest in learning calculus and improving students' attitudes toward pursuing an engineering career, and 3) broaden the use of online learning forums throughout STEM education.</AbstractNarration>
