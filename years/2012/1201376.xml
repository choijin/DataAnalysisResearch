<AbstractNarration>The Langlands program, initiated in the 1960s and successfully developed in the last 15 years, is a set of conjectures predicting a unification of number theory and of representation theory of groups: the Langlands correspondence provides a way to interpret results in number theory in terms of group theory, and vice versa. A decade ago, the question of a p-adic/mod p component of this program was raised, motivated by natural questions of p-adic arithmetic geometry. As of now, only very few cases are understood, but they have already had spectacular consequences such as the proof of most cases of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. Because of unexpected and poorly understood phenomena, statements of a general p-adic/mod p local Langlands conjecture remain elusive. The proposal aims to study the mod p representations of p-adic reductive groups in order to understand the right terms of a mod p Langlands correspondence. The PI's previous work has shown that studying  mod p representations of Hecke algebras is a promising approach, because it suggests that a mod p Langlands correspondence does exist. The proposal outlines strategies to study families and complexes of mod p representations of p-adic reductive groups and their associated Hecke algebras. At the heart of this proposal is the wish to go beyond the  (so far most investigated) focus on irreducible objects and give a homological approach to the representations. It goes along with exploring the possibility of a mod p principle of functoriality and shedding a geometric light on the potential mod p Langlands correspondence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The p-adic/mod p Langlands program holds profound prospects for modern number theory with deep ramifications in arithmetic algebraic geometry. It is a new, fertile area involving tools and objects that were still completely abstruse a few years ago. The proposal aims to give a geometric incarnation to the objects that appear naturally in the mod p framework. The outcome of this work will most likely be naturally connected to other areas of mathematics influenced by the Langlands conjectures, such as the geometric Langlands program, and its links with geometric representation theory. The proposal describes strategies towards such connections.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Langlands program, initiated  in the 1960s, is a set of conjectures predicting a  unification  of number theory and of representation theory of groups.  In its classical form, this program has been developed in the last 20 years leading to successes such as the proof of Fermat's last theorem and, more recently, of Serre's modularity conjecture.  The mod p local Langlands program started developing around 2000. It  is still largely mysterious . In the only case where it is understood, it already has spectacular and deep consequences.   However, for general  groups, there is not even the statement of a precise  conjecture as there are many strange phenomena that need to be understood.     This projects aims at exploring the mod p local  Langlands correspondence for a general p-adic reductive group by shedding a geometric light on it. An idea is to study the category of modules over a certain Hecke algebra in characteristic p. These objects are indeed more amenable to geometrization than the representations of the p-adic group. The study  of the homological properties of this algebra has been developed by the PI with the support of this award. This work contributes to opening up  perspectives on a possible "derived" mod p Langlands correspondence.
