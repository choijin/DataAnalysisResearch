<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Manoj Kaplinghat at the University of California, Irvine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the next few years, astrophysical observations will play a pivotal role in the effort to detect dark matter through non-gravitational means. The focus in this project will be on two promising ways forward.  One will be to use observations of gamma-rays towards the luminous satellites of the Milky Way in order to constrain or detect weak-scale thermal dark matter.  Weak-scale thermal dark matter is the most widely studied dark-matter candidate and is motivated by particle-physics models at the high (electroweak-scale) energies currently being probed at the Large Hadron Collider.  The other way forward will be to develop simplified models to describe dark-matter halo density profiles in the presence of significant self-interactions and compare to observations.  As part of the project, the PI will provide a map between these preferred models and the underlying particle-physics models in which such phenomenology is realized.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  The PI will develop a cosmology and particle-physics cluster for the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (i.e., the "COSMOS Program" at UC Irvine).  COSMOS is a program for motivated high-school students and currently has a cluster in astronomy at UC Irvine but none in particle physics.  Based on input from faculty teaching the astronomy cluster, it is envisioned that a particle physics and cosmology module will be highly subscribed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit.  Dark matter is the dominant form of matter in the Universe. While its presence is incontrovertible, the source of its gravity remains a mystery. There is overwhelming evidence that dark matter is made up of particles but these particles do not like to interact with normal matter.  How do we search for dark matter? This depends on what we think dark matter is. For excellent reasons, physicists have focused their attention on candidates like weakly interacting massive particles or axions. However, searches for these particles have turned up empty.  The main aim of the work supported by this grant was to utilize astrophysical  input to broaden the search for dark matter and to  provide guidance for building testable models of dark matter. The main motivation for the work is the fact that we don't know how dark matter particles interact with each other or other dark particles that may exist.  Work supported by this grant has directly led to (1) the possibility that dark matter particles could be interacting with itself strongly (like, for example, protons and neutrons interact) to become part of mainstream research; (2) concrete examples of ways in which self-interacting dark matter could be searched for by the current and future direct and indirect searches; (3) significant contributions to indirect searches for dark matter in gamma rays around the Galactic Center (where we expect the largest concentration of dark matter in our Galaxy), a topic that has been hotly debated in the last three years or so.     Broader Impacts.  The PI and colleagues in the particle physics group created a month-long courses in particle physics and cosmology (cluster) for high school students as part of the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) program at the University of California, Irvine. This cluster was piloted in Summer 2014 and then offered again in Summer 2015 to 18 and 22 talented students, respectively. The PI directed this cluster both summers. Roughly half of the students in 2015 were from traditionally underrepresented groups. The students lived on campus for a month and got an early exposure to college life. In addition to being exposed to the big questions in particle physics and cosmology, the students also gained valuable science communication skills through their work on group research projects. The projects were chosen to be close to the research interests of the PI and the particle physics group at UC Irvine.
