<AbstractNarration>Deep-sea hydrocarbon cold seeps are unlike most environments on Earth, as life there is not reliant on the sun for energy. Despite the lack of sunlight, cold seeps support a diverse collection of organisms that rely on the seepage of oil and gas from the sea floor. Tubeworms are a group of animals that are important for these habitats as they form bushes that provide food, living space and protection for a variety of other animals. Due to their dependence on irregularly occurring seepage, tubeworm communities can be separated by hundreds of kilometers. Currently, there is little information available about how tubeworms are transported to inhabit these patchy environments. The proposed research will identify different tubeworm species as well as determine how transport and colonization of tubeworms connects the various cold seep sites in the Gulf of Mexico, West Angolan Basin (West Africa) and the eastern Pacific off of California. This research uses genetic tools and environmental data to improve human understanding of how unique cold seep communities are established and maintained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cold seep organisms use oil and gas as energy sources, illustrating that life can thrive even under the most extreme conditions. This work will determine how natural and anthropogenic factors impact these specialized ecosystems. Given that the future of deep-sea habitats remains uncertain, it is critical to increase knowledge of these organisms, as they are vital to the foundation of these remarkable habitats.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Until 1977, life was not expected to be found in the deep sea because of the lack of sunlight to provide energy to the ecosystem.  The discovery of thriving communities in the deep sea associated with hydrothermal vents and hydrocarbon seeps required a shift in our thoughts about how organisms make their living in the absence of sunlight.  Deep-sea cold hydrocarbon seeps support biological communities that rely on the seafloor seepage of hydrocarbon gases and fluids. Cold seeps are home to a variety of organisms, including the vestimentiferan tubeworms, a group of polychaete worms that lack digestive tracts and are dependent upon symbiotic bacteria for their nutrients. Vestimentiferan tubeworms are important components of cold seep habitats, as they cluster in bush-like structures that serve as long-term living space and protection for a variety of other fauna. The increase of man-made disturbances that includes deep oil drilling, gas mining, dumping of wastes and effects of climate change, threatens the existence of these unique habitats. It is therefore critical to improve our knowledge of these environments by clarifying tubeworm species and understanding their geographic distributions, which will help boost efforts to protect and conserve these ecosystems.  In addition, it is important to understand the life history factors such as dispersal that affect where the organisms are found in these habitats.  Cold seep tubeworms belonging to three genera Escarpia, Lamellibrachia and Seepiophila are distributed along the west and east continental margins of the Atlantic Ocean, as well as along the eastern Pacific. The relationships among the described species in these genera were not clearly understood, but is necessary information to clarify the processes that shape the distribution of species.  In the case of Escarpia, three separate groups have been described by their appearance and include Escarpia laminata (Gulf of Mexico) Escarpia southwardae (Gulf of Guinea, West Africa) and Escarpia spicata (Gulf of California). Despite the geographic and morphological differences between the three groups, previous genetic markers have identified all three as a single species.  In the case of Lamellibrachia, three species are found at different depth ranges and it is not clear if these are a single or multiple species.  A third species Seepiophila jonesi found at shallow depths was examined to determine if patterns of dispersal are similar for different species of tubeworm.  In this study, highly variable genetic markers known as microsatellites were developed to clarify the relationships of tubeworm species that have different global distributions as well as different depth distributions.  In addition, these data were used to determine how much dispersal occurs within the different tubeworm species.  Various physical barriers, such as geographic boundaries and complex ocean currents likely prevent Escarpia larval transport and exchange across the Gulfs of California, Mexico and Guinea. Our research sought to define the true geographic ranges of the Escarpia and Lamellibrachia by using genetic markers that have faster rates of evolution, including the intron regions of nuclear genes, as well as microsatellite repeats. Additionally, investigation of larval life histories and the direction and speeds of ocean currents allowed us to improve understanding of how cold seep communities are established and maintained.  Overall, these findings support that the three previously described Escarpia are three distinct species that are morphologically distinct and restricted to their specific region. Within region, we find that based on the genetic, life history and ocean currents data, Escarpia tubeworm larvae have the dispersal capability to move nearly 1000km across the Gulf of Mexico and 200km in the Gulf of Guinea, but that the exchange of migrants across ocean basins is likely not occurring, or very small. The data from Lamellibrachia show that ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
