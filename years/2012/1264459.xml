<AbstractNarration>This proposal is an international collaborative proposal that couples molecular modeling with spectroscopies to elucidate the structure, to the atomic scale resolution, of an enzymatic binding center interacting with a substrate surface. The protein fragment is the cellulase enzyme's carbohydrate binding module. The hypothesis is that binding of such a module to a (hydrophobic) surface will induce changes in molecular structure, which are critical to the function of the biomolecule. the simulation part would be carried out by the PI in the US, and the experimental part carried out in Germany by the collaborator.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merits:  This project supported an international collaboration between the University of Washington and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Science in Mainz, Germany.  The investigators developed and applied new methods to couple computational molecular science techniques, namely molecular dynamics simulations, with surface spectroscopy experiments.     The team was able to probe the structure and dynamics of proteins buried at interfaces in a variety of example systems.  A new computational method was developed that allows for rapid simulation of peptide folding and binding thermodynamics at interfaces.     Additional lines of research stemming from this proposal included studying peptide-peptide binding in solution at interfaces as a means to understand the mechanism of peptide-induced biosilification or silica morphogenesis.   By bringing together researchers from two separate research areas (spectroscopy and molecular simulation), this grant advanced the research field of protein interfacial studies in a way that funding either effort alone could not achieve   Broader Impacts:  In the area of technical broader impacts this grant lead to publication of more than 13 peer-reviewed research papers and over 10 conference presentations. These research products will contribute to the knowledge base for many researchers working in related fields of protein/surface interactions.  This grant led to developmenet of a new method for simulation high dimensional problems in molecular systems allowing many slow degrees of freedom to be explored concurrently in a simulation.   This grant supported training of 4 different PhD students and 3 different undergraduates including unique professional development activities like international collaboration.
