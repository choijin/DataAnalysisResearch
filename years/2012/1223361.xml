<AbstractNarration>QUEST Beyond Local is a consortium of six public media providers across the country coming together in a unique collaborative structure to foster widespread STEM literacy for general audiences; support formal and informal education outcomes in the sciences; and revive ailing science and environment journalism in the face of its rapid decline.  QUEST Beyond Local is built on the success of the local, cross-editorial QUEST model, in which media making professionals from multiple disciplines--radio, television, web, and especially education--collaborate to distribute high-quality content to general and underserved audiences.  Two years ago, KQED (serving Northern California) introduced a capacity-building effort with five other public media stations serving markets across the nation: Seattle (KCTS), Wisconsin (WPT/WPR), Nebraska (NET), Cleveland (ideastream), and North Carolina (UNC-TV).  On the heels of this pilot process, QUEST Beyond Local will expand production in all markets and focus its multimedia efforts around the theme "Science of Sustainability" so as to achieve maximum effect on critical STEM outcomes in formal and informal education settings, and to foster science/environment literacy among a wide general audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QUEST Beyond Local is defined by an organizationally and technologically innovative model of content creation: a newsroom structured according to a hub and spoke model; with common branding, technical, and style guidelines; and with a central coordinating and editorial office liaising between local production teams.  Under the guidance of this central office, the collaborative seeks to create content with both local authority and national relevance.  Building on existing media impact research, and previous research and evaluation of QUEST, research firm Rockman et al will apply evaluation theory to determine: (1) the structures and strategies to a successful STEM collaborative that contribute to a greater understanding of and engagement in science and environment topics; and (2) determine the interests, priorities, and media consumption habits of local and national STEM audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primary project deliverables include three diverse multimedia packages for general and professional audiences, focusing on three main themes and anchored in STEM disciplines.  In total, the three packages will include: 18 television segments; 6 half-hour television programs; 20 radio reports; 18 "web extras" (slide shows, maps, etc.); 12 web-based videos; 144 blog posts; 18 education "explainers"; 5 educator trainings; and a comprehensive distribution and social media campaign.  All efforts will be supported by at least 18 science community partners, including zoos, museums, aquariums, research centers, and others.  Through these efforts, the collaborative seeks to repair the systemic damage done by years of neglect to science/environment journalism--particularly the marked decline in this type of coverage over the last decade.  This decline is perhaps related to the observed disconnect between the public and scientific knowledge, despite a demonstrated public appetite for science content and educators' reported desire for more resources and professional development opportunities focused on STEM topics.  At a time when an evolving workforce and economy increasingly demand STEM skills and environmental literacy, QUEST Beyond Local will contribute resources to address these challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ QUEST Beyond Local ("QUEST") is a unique cross-platform science journalism collaborative creating and distributing content for radio, television, interactive, and education audiences (www. QUESTscience.org).  QUEST built on the success of the local, cross-editorial QUEST model wherein professionals from multiple disciplines &ndash; radio, television, web, and especially education &ndash; collaborate to distribute high-quality content to general and underserved audiences.  The original QUEST project began six years ago as an experiment in multimedia science journalism and education designed to deliver content and foster engagement using a range of media formats and presentation styles.  The QUEST collaborative, comprised of six leading public media providers representing diverse markets across the country, aimed to foster widespread STEM literacy for general audiences and support formal and informal science education outcomes reinvigorating science and environment journalism that face dwindling resources.  QUEST sought to produce a lasting impact on informal STEM learning through design and distribution of a scalable 21st-century multimedia production model -- increasingly public in nature, encourages new engagement methods for collaborations and community participation, and more closely integrates production of science content to educational assets aligned with Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards.   QUEST Beyond Local collaborative partners were: QUEST Northwest (KCTS, Seattle), QUEST North Carolina (UNC-TV, North Carolina), QUEST Nebraska (NET, Nebraska), QUEST Ohio (ideastream, Cleveland), QUEST Wisconsin (WPT, Wisconsin Public Radio, Educational Communications Board and Instructional Communications Systems, Wisconsin) and QUEST Northern California (KQED, San Francisco).  QUEST partners created content focused on "Science of Sustainability", including television segments; half-hour television magazine programs; radio reports; "web extras" (slide shows, maps, etc.); web-based videos; blog posts; education explainers, education trainings; and a comprehensive distribution and social media campaign.  The station partners engaged other STEM community partners including zoos, museums, aquariums, research centers, and individual consultants for story content and ideas and science education opportunities.    Stations stated that QUEST altered their perception of the traditional media organization and provided opportunities to experiment with new, innovative ways of linking content and education across multiple platforms, making QUEST a viable model for transitioning from being platform-driven to more content and audience-driven.  Because QUEST was programmatically powerful in delivering content across varied platforms and in creating programming appealing to the viewpoints of diverse audiences across those platforms, stations engaged a broader pool of students, educators and lifelong learners.   Further, partner stations strengthened the quantity and quality of science reporting and programming as multiplatform elements allowed for greater reach and breadth of science content to expanded audiences.  Coordinating producers credited QUEST with strengthening their narrative voice in telling science stories, and with providing opportunities for learning innovative production and graphic techniques to more effectively communicate complex scientific ideas to audiences.   Regarding partnerships, stations with existing community relationships more easily developed new partnerships than stations starting from scratch.  Regardless, regional organizations felt "validated" in serving as QUEST partners as they achieved greater community visibility and awareness of their science programs, and received new learning opportunities for program development and dissemination.  While each QUEST station approached the role and purpose of education differently, individual stations created unique and varied educational media along with QUEST...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
