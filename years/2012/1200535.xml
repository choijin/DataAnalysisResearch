<AbstractNarration>An integrated mathematical-experimental effort in cell biology is proposed, focusing on morphology and dynamics of motile cell phenotypes.  Specifically, we probe and model the molecular mechanisms of chemical-mechanical transduction, and mechanical feedback to chemical kinetics, with intracellular spatial and temporal resolution of a living cell.  The modeling goal is a platform to integrate detailed biological data and test biophysical hypotheses, with a predictive simulation tool for a cell in a specified extracellular environment.   The model platform incorporates advances in cell substructure identification and property characterization (bilayer membrane, cortical layer, cytosol and nucleus), coupled with advances in specific signaling molecules, their kinetics, and their role in mechanical activation and deactivation (Rho family of GTPases).  The experimental challenges concentrate on achieving spatio-temporal resolution in living cells, so that mechanical-chemical feedback mechanisms can be measured and compared with model simulations.   The mathematical challenges lie in a faithful non-equilibrium description and simulation of each cell substructure and its free boundaries, of reacting and diffusing signaling molecular species in deforming substructures, and of the spatio-temporal activation via mechanochemical transduction. A specific cell motility phenotype identified by the Jacobson lab that sustains morphological oscillations with disruption of microtubules is the test-bed for this effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One impact of this effort is an available platform to simulate living cell morphological dynamics in conjunction with experimental protocols to perturb intracellular chemical or mechanical processes.  The oscillation phenotype of the cell is a model system whereby a chemically induced mechanical perturbation (disruption of microtubules) leads to a robust, amplified response that affords hypothesis testing for mechanochemical transduction mechanisms.  The model and experimental methods will provide exploratory tools for other cell motility phenotypes and their underlying biochemical and mechanical basis, including dramatic topological changes associated with blebbing and division. The dynamical cell structure simulation tool will be implemented in a high performance computing environment to resolve the complexity of the non-equilibrium, heterogeneous cell. Another impact lies in the training of a new cohort of mathematicians and biologists who learn with and from one another and understand biological principles and experimental methods and the mathematics of modeling, simulation and experimental validation. The outcome of this research will improve the mechanistic understanding of many disorders due to a dysregulation of the cytoskeleton, including cancers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report   The major goal of this project was to experimentally describe periodic morphological oscillations that cells undergo under certain conditions. Dr. Wang?s group was to develop a theoretical model of such cell oscillations. Our group would provide key experimental data with which to test the current model and produce appropriate revisions to the model.  Such morphological oscillations occur spontaneously or are induced by microtubule depolymerization in non-spread cells. We demonstrated that periodic shape changes are associated with a traveling wave of membrane-cortex density which originates from alternating phases of a folding-unfolding of the membrane-cortex layer.  We discovered that an excess of cell surface area, which is described as the ratio of the area in the spread state to the area that is needed to smoothly cover the cell volume in the rounded state, is a necessary requirement for this phenomenon.  One important outcome was to quantify the amount of the excess cell surface. A second key outcome was to assess the morphology, in terms of the shape, length, surface area and volume of the small surface projections, that comprise the cell surface excess. With respect to the  theoretical outcomes of this grant, with Dr. Wang, we created a set of three complementary structural models aimed at providing an understanding of cell surface excess morphology.  Each of these models featured, respectively, a discrete element simulation, a space filling geometric strategy and a continuum physics approach to model the cortex and were successful, as a first approach, in providing theoretical descriptions of cell surface excess.  This project is significant in that cell morphological changes are intimately coupled to fundamental biological processes and these remodeling events are highly regulated, often requiring the concerted effort of many molecular players. While these events are biologically important, there is currently no quantitative mechanism that adequately describes the formation and dynamics of small surface structures that are capable of storing a large amount of cell membrane.

Thus, our study is relevant for cancer cell biologists studying metastatic cell migration in extracellular matrix; for developmental biologists studying shape transformations during cytokinesis and in in situ migration, for biophysicists studying cell biomechanics and hydrodynamics, and for mathematical modelers developing new models for 3D cell migration and transformation. It is also important for bioengineers who work in area of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine where knowledge of mechanism of cell responses to physical forces is crucial for tissue design.   In terms of human resource development, the main impact of our work is the training of undergraduates for research and development and professional careers.
