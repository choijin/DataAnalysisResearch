<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard award for a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site Program at Columbia University entitled, Forming, Advancing, and Sustaining Teacher-Engineer Relationships (FASTER), under the direction of Dr. Raimondo Betti and Mr. Jay Dubner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Columbia University's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will use all of the resources at its disposal to develop an RET site which will provide pre-college science teachers with a mentored engineering laboratory experience.  The proposed RET site will place ten public middle and high school teachers in Columbia's research laboratories headed by faculty members with appointments in the School of Engineering and Applied Science for 8 weeks in each of two consecutive summers.  An additional secondary school teacher will work in an environmental engineering laboratory at James Cook University in Australia for 6 weeks.  Nine of the ten domestic placed teachers will be from the New York metropolitan area.  The tenth teacher will be from a secondary school in Singapore.  Their research experience will be enhanced through weekly pedagogical meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FASTER's primary goal is to facilitate long-term collaborative partnerships between secondary school science teachers and university researchers by involving teachers in engineering research and helping them translate their new knowledge into classroom activities. The ultimate recipients will be New York City area students whose population are largely underrepresented in the sciences and engineering.  Columbia University faculty will provide teachers with opportunities to gain hands on experience with the tools and materials of science and engineering in an environment attuned to professional development. Thus, teachers understanding of engineering and their ability to develop and lead inquiry- and standards-based science classes and laboratories will improve.  In addition, the teachers will be exposed to a new perspective and a different professional culture which enables them to communicate the vitality and dynamism of applied science to their students and colleagues.</AbstractNarration>

The National Science BoardÆs 2010 report sounded the alarm that the United States is failing to sufficiently identify and nurture the next generation of high-achieving innovators in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) field and that puts our nation at risk for long-term prosperity.

Over the course of the NSF award, 25 Engineering Research Fellowships were awarded to pre-college science teachers. Twelve Columbia University and four James Cook University (Australia) engineering faculty opened their research groups in support of the FASTER program. With each teacher averaging 100 students per school year over the course of their estimated remaining years teaching, ~18,000 students will benefit from their teacherÆs FASTER experience. From the very beginning of the project, our expectations for the vast majority of the 18,000 students wasnÆt to become engineers. What we came to expect is that those students who were soon-to-be of voting age, they would become scientifically literate. When they cast their ballots on Election Day, they will make informed decisions reg...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
