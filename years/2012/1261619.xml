<AbstractNarration>The investigators will build an atmospheric lidar instrument and an airglow imager for deployment on the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream-V (NGV) aircraft. The instruments are designed to make measurements important for studying the impacts of internal gravity waves (GWs) in atmospheric dynamics, and in the chemical, microphysical, and plasma processes they influence. In the stratosphere, GW effects include severe turbulence at flight altitudes, creation of polar stratospheric clouds that contribute to ozone destruction, and systematic influences on the large-scale circulation. Large-scale GWs also have similar, but largely unknown, effects extending well into the thermosphere and ionosphere. The Southern Andes -- ANtarctic GRavity wave InitiAtive (SAANGRIA) is a program that would employ the NGV research aircraft to measure gravity wave effects over the southern Andes, the Drake Passage, and the Antarctic Peninsula, which is believed to be the most dynamically active region on Earth in terms of GW forcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current NGV instruments are well suited to lower atmosphere SAANGRIA observations, but do not address climate and mesosphere-lower thermosphere science topics fully.  The new stratospheric and mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) NGV instruments would include Rayleigh and resonance lidars and a Mesospheric Temperature Mapper that would measure temperatures and vertical winds spanning altitudes from immediately above the NGV flight altitude (~13 km) to ~100 km. These instruments will remain as NGV "facility" instruments thereafter, thus greatly enhancing the scientific benefits of the NCAR facilities for flight programs by NSF investigators in the future. The information obtained from these measurements will benefit the research community and society by helping to improve numerical weather prediction, general circulation modeling, and climate studies.</AbstractNarration>

The lidars were built by GATS Inc, and the AMTM was built by Utah State University. This report will describe only the lidar developments at GATS.  The development of the new GV lidars took advantage of rapidly advancing laser technologies to achieve high-power, narrow-band, frequency-stabilized performance. The lidars were based on a 5-W Ultraviolet (UV) 351-nm laser and a 10-W continuous wave (CW) 589-nm laser employed for Rayleigh and sodium resonance backscatter, respectively.  The Rayleigh lidar employed photons scattered from air molecules to estimate atmospheric density as a function of altitude and used these measurements to infer the atmospheric temperature profile from 20 to 60 km altitudes.  The sodium resonance lidar is entirely novel and uses a high-power, narrow-bandwidth, continuous-wave, fiber-amplified laser which is much smaller, more efficient, and less sensitive to vibrations than normal sodium lasers. We also used new amplitude and beam-angle modulation techniques to divide the CW beam into 33 pulsed beams for range resolution. In the receiver, one of these beams was aligned with a fiber-coupled double-edge magneto-optic filter for stratospheric Doppler wind measurements (obtained by measuring the frequency shift) and the other 32 beams were aligned with a 32 channel massively-parallel lidar receiver and then co-added for better time resolution in the Na layer. employed two frequencies to enable measurements of vertical velocities at altitudes from 15-25 km and sodium densities and atmospheric temperatures at altitudes from 75-100 km.  The two lidars were housed in two standard 19" instrument racks on the GV research aircraft and backscattered photons were collected by a 12" diameter telescope mounted between the two racks and viewing upward through a 20" roof port on the GV.  The lidar measurements during the DEEPWAVE field program were highly successful and are now being employed for a number of different research topics by the DEEPWAVE science team.
