<AbstractNarration>The National Writing Project (NWP) is collaborating with the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) on a four-year, full-scale development project that is designed to integrate science and literacy. Partnerships will be formed between NWP sites and ASTC member science centers and museums to develop, test, and refine innovative programs for educators and youth, resulting in the creation of a unique learning network. The project highlights the critical need for the integration of science and literacy and builds on recommendations in the Common Core State Standards and the National Research Council's publication, "A Framework for K-12 Science Education:  Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas." The content focus includes current topics in science and technology such as environmental science, sustainability, synthetic biology, geoengineering, and other subjects which align with science center research and exhibits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project design is supported by a framework that incorporates a constructivist/inquiry-based approach that capitalizes on the synergy between rigorous science learning and robust literacy practices. Project deliverables include a set of 10 local partnership sites, professional development for network members, a project website, and an evaluation report highlighting lessons learned. Partnership sites will be selected based on interest, proximity, history, and expertise. Two geographically and demographically diverse cohorts, consisting of five partnerships each will be identified in Years 2 and 3. Each set of partners will be charged with creating a comprehensive two-year plan for science literacy activities and products to be implemented at local sites. It is anticipated that the pilot programs may result in the creation of new programs that merge science and writing, integrate writing into existing museum science programs, or integrate science activities into existing NWP programs. Interest-driven youth projects such as citizen science and science journalism activities are examples of programmatic approaches that may be adopted. The partners will convene periodically for planning and professional development focused on the integration of science and literacy for public and professional audiences, provided in part by national practitioners and research experts. A network Design Team that includes leadership representatives from NWP, ASTC, and the project evaluator, Inverness Research, Inc., will oversee project efforts in conjunction with a national advisory board, while a Partnership Coordinator will provide support for the local sites.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inverness Research will conduct a multi-level evaluation to address the following questions:&lt;br/&gt;-What is the nature and quality of the local partner arrangements, and the larger network as a whole?&lt;br/&gt;-What is the nature and quality of the local science literacy programs that local partners initiate, and how do they engage local participants, and develop their sense of inquiry and communication skills?&lt;br/&gt;First, a Designed-Based Implementation Research approach will be used for the developmental evaluation to assess the implementation process. Next, the documentation and portrayal phase will assess the benefits to youth, educators, institutions, and the field using surveys, interviews, observations of educators, and reviews of science communication efforts created by youth. Finally, the summative evaluation includes a comprehensive portfolio of evidence to document the audience impacts and an independent assessment of the project model by an Evaluation Review Board. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in the creation of a robust learning community while contributing knowledge and lessons learned to the field about networks and innovative partnerships. It is anticipated that formal and informal educators will gain increased knowledge about science and literacy programs and develop skills to provide effective programs, while youth will demonstrate increased understanding of key science concepts and the ability to communicate science. Programs created by the local partnerships will serve approximately 650 educators (450 informal educators and 200 K-12 teachers) and 500 youth ages 9-18. Plans for dissemination, expansion, and sustainability will be undertaken by the sub-networks of the collaborating national organizations drawing on the 350 ASTC member institutions and nearly 200 NWP sites at colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>

Each of the ten original partnership sites received $30,000/year for two years and was supported in identifying a mutually interesting and locally relevant science-literacy programming idea to develop and implement. The majority of the resulting partnerships were strong, highly functional, and productive. The resulting science-literacy projects these partnerships created were diverse and wide ranging, and provided productive, rich science-literacy projects for educators and youth. These projects included professional development for formal and informal educators (e.g., creating a professional learning community to study and improve field trip programs), programs for youth (e.g., game and science film making), programs that focused on place-based science-writing (e.g., citizen science projects for middle school youth focused on water, place-based science writing in summer camps and through an app, professional development for educators focusing on sharing science and Native American perspectives on a local river), and making and tinkering (e.g., make cycles -- in-depth long-term science-writing explorations through making in schools, in museums, and online). Over the course of the project, the ten partnership site Intersections&rsquo; programming served over 500 educators (including informal, K-12 and post-secondary educators), over 1,800 youth, and nearly 600 museum visitors and families.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The Intersections project has built the capacity of all involved through several key activities: ongoing, iterative partnership development; high-quality professional development experiences; and ongoing professional support mechanisms, such as monthly video calls, leadership team &ldquo;thinking partners&rdquo; assigned to each site who check in regularly with their sites, all that helped local partnership sites learn from one another, reflect on their own work, and refine their programs along the way. &nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The project also disseminated its work to the field throughout the life of the project through several mechanisms. Every year of the project, at both the ASTC annual conference and the NWP annual meeting, the Intersections project shared its work with the two large communities. Intersections partners also shared their work at annual NSTA meetings, and in regional and local settings. In addition, it created a website (http://intersectionspartnership.org) to share the partnership and project models and resources created through the project. Coupled with the website, the project also created the Partner for Science Learning Design Institute, which took the best of what was offered from the design institutes created for the ten original partnership sites, and engaged 14 new potential partners in three days of learning, with members of the original partnership sites helping to design and implement the programming.
