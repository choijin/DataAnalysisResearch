<AbstractNarration>Benjamin Widom of Cornell University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to study solutions, in water, of substances that are hardly soluble.  The expression "oil and water don't mix" is almost but not entirely true, and the slight solubility of oils and other substances  in water is often of crucial importance.  It affects the efficiency of separations by distillation and extraction in the chemical process industries; it is a primary factor in drug design in the pharmaceutical industry; it is a concern in water pollution and other environmental problems; and it underlies the most fundamental biological phenomena.  It is widely accepted, for example, that it is the relative incompatibility of the oil-like constituents of a protein and the surrounding water that is responsible for the protein's folding into its proper biologically active form.  Low solubility in water is an example of what are known collectively as "hydrophobic" (literally water-hating) effects.  These effects are the objects of the present theoretical and computational research, which is directed toward the understanding of their molecular origins and consequences: What makes a substance hydrophobic?  In what other ways does hydrophobicity manifest itself in addition to low solubility?  How does the structure and other properties of the surrounding water itself respond to the presence of dissolved hydrophobic molecules and what are the physical and chemical consequences of such molecular-scale rearrangements?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of this research is directed to understanding the solvent-induced attraction between hydrophobic solutes, particularly that measure of the attraction contained in the second osmotic virial coefficient.  It is desirable to reconcile the values of this coefficient as found from equations of state and thermodynamic measurements with the integral of the solute-solute pair correlation function, as required by one of the Kirkwood-Buff relations.  In recent work it has been shown how the virial coefficient may be extracted from an equation of state with parameters set to give realistic properties of the pure solvent and a realistic account of those effects of the solute-solvent interaction such as on the solubility of the solute and on its partial molecular volume in the solvent.  The resulting osmotic coefficient agrees well with that extracted from experimental solubility measurements.  Independently, the several pair correlation functions in the two-component mixture are obtained by computer simulation.  These, on being integrated, are consistent with the solvent compressibility, the solute partial molecular volume, and the gas-phase virial coefficients, yet inconsistent with the previously obtained second osmotic virial coefficient.  This is a serious discrepancy, which is important to resolve, for a proper understanding of structural effects in hydrophobic hydration, and hydrophobic effects more generally, depends on it.  There still remains the problem of constructing analytical forms for the several pair correlation functions to test earlier analytical indications that the amplitude of the solute-solute correlation function, which is difficult to measure because of the low solubility, greatly exceeds that of the other two so that the solutes remain effectively correlated to longer distances than do the solvent molecules despite the two having the same formal exponential decay length.  A remaining project is that of determining, by computer simulation and analytically, the solute-solute pair correlation function on the solute-poor side of a closed-loop coexistence curve, to trace the evolution from entropy-based to enthalpy-based solvophobicity as the temperature varies between that of the two critical solution points.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Theory of Liquids and Liquid Mixtures, their Structures and Phase Equilibria              This project was on the theory of the properties of liquids and liquid solutions and of how those properties arise from the molecular structure of the fluids and the interactions among their molecules.  There were five main sub-areas in this research.  (1) What are the origins and consequences of low solubility of the minor components (the solutes) in the major component (the solvent) in a liquid solution ?  A particular aspect of this question is the "hydrophobic effect" - an effective attraction between the low-solubility components themselves resulting from their mutual shielding from unfavorable interaction with the solvent.  This attraction between solute molecules is responsible for many important effects, including the formation of the characteristic structures of proteins and of DNA in biology and of the unusual decrease of the solubility of the solutes with increasing temperature.  The whole question of solubility is of importance also in industrial processes.  In the present research, we have constructed theoretical molecular models that illuminate those properties and in particular allow the calculation of the effective attractive forces between the molecules of low-solubility solutes as measured by the "osmotic second virial coefficient" and its relation to the correlations among the otherwise independently moving solute molecules in the solution.  (2) Sometimes the molecules of one of the components of a liquid solution are able to bind to particular binding sites on the surfaces of the molecules of another component, a particularly notable biological phenomenon and one often observed and studied in the laboratory with spectroscopic techniques.  We constructed mathematical models of this phenomenon and demonstrated their applicability to the analysis of the experimental measurements and to the prediction of others.  (3) Many liquid solutions, in response to the repulsion of the molecules of one of the components of the solution with those of another, will separate into two distinct liquid phases, each richer in one of the components.  Those two liquid phases will be in contact through an interface that forms between them.  That interface has a surface tension, which may be high or low depending on how repulsive the components are to each other and on the temperature.  With increasing dilution of the mixture, or increase of temperature, etc., the two liquid phases may become gradually more alike, with the surface tension gradually diminishing to zero and the interface itself disappearing, at what is called a critical solution point of the two-phase equilibrium.  A similar phenomenon may result from the contact of three distinct phase gradually becoming more alike at a tricritical point, etc.  In such a three-phase equilibrium, one of the three phases may rest as a liquid lens at the interface between the other two or may spread at ("wet") the interface between the other two; and the configuration of the three phases may change from the one to the other with changes in temperature or chemical composition (a "wetting" transition).  We have developed and analyzed theoretical models that have illuminated all of these phenomena.  (4) A single pure liquid, such as water, evaporates to a vapor.  If initially confined at the appropriate volume, then, with increasing temperature, it and its vapor gradually become more alike.  The tension of the interface between the liquid and its vapor thus gradually vanishes, the interface disappears, and the two phases have lost their separate identities and become one.  This is a critical point of the phase equilibrium.  (For water, this occurs at 374&deg;C, or 705&deg;F.).  High temperatures are referred to as supercritical.  Supercritical water has become of increasing importance as an industrial solvent since it may be compressed to liquid-like densities without condensing and yet its solvent properties have been enhanced over those of ordinary liquid water because of the high temperature.  We have calculated, both with theoretical models and from collections of experimental data, how important properties of water such as its heat capacity, its compressibility, and its coefficient of thermal expansion, change with varying pressure and temperature in and near its supercritical state.  This has illuminated its properties both for applications and for settling theoretical issues.  (5) This is an ongoing project aimed, ultimately, at understanding both the molecular and the thermodynamic origins of the phenomena that underlie what have come to be called deep eutectic solvents.  This is of great practical interest as these mixtures are coming to supplement and even replace ionic liquids in laboratory and industrial applications.  We have so far successfully modeled the gas-liquid analogs of the liquid-solid equilibria, which are what are of real interest.  With model theoretical equations relating pressure, temperature, and chemical composition, we have traced the evolution of the resulting phase diagrams for the gas-liquid analogs, and are making progress toward the liquid-solid equilibria of interest.
