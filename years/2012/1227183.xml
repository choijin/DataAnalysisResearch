<AbstractNarration>The University of Hawaii is awarded a grant to advance marine genomics and light microscopy imaging facilities at the Kewalo Marine Laboratory. Marine labs are ideally suited to study interactions of organisms at the interface of terrestrial and marine environments. This proposal requests funds to update molecular and optical imaging resources leveraging existing strengths to facilitate cutting edge research and training in broad areas of marine biology and biotechnology.  These instruments will allow students/trainees to exploit the most modern techniques in DNA sequencing and live cell imaging to address fundamental problems in cellular, developmental, evolutionary, and environmental biology of our local marine biodiversity. KML is uniquely situated for the study of marine life in the sub-tropical northern Pacific environment. Marine habitats on O`ahu, easily accessed from the Laboratory, include coral reefs, sandy beaches, soft sediments, estuaries, and the deep sea and open ocean zones. The marine fauna of Hawai`i reflects a rich tropical diversity: local habitats boast over 2000 species. Due to the relative isolation of the archipelago, the marine fauna and flora provide unique opportunities for the study of speciation, biogeographic distribution and population genetics of coastal marine organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This funding will not only facilitate research on local fauna of the highly productive NSF-funded marine laboratory (and their diverse undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral fellow trainees), but will also bolster the active Visiting Scientist program.  Kewalo Marine Laboratory has a strong record of placing trainees in academic and professional positions.  KML hosts several NSF supported programs (Undergraduate Research Mentoring,  Advanced Technological Education, and Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence) that train under-represented Pacific Islander students and high school teachers. Faculty and students disseminate research results locally and internationally at scientific meetings, and hold outreach programs for K-12 field trips.  The instruments acquired with this award will be used for both research and teaching, allowing a diverse group of students to gain a better understanding of key biological processes that will help preserve and appreciate the unique local environment.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funds provided to the Kewalo Marine Laboratory (KML) by the National Science Foundation under the Field Stations and Marine Laboratories program were used to purchase several items of essential equipment that increase the research, training and service capabilities of the facility.  The Kewalo Marine Laboratory is one of the few "urban" marine laboratories in the U.S., situated within a modern city and adjacent to thriving coral reefs and other coastal marine ecosystems.  The KML is a full time research facility under the University of Hawaii at Manoa, with faculty that study a range of biological phenomena at scales from molecules to ecosystems.  The specific equipment purchased includes gene sequencers and an automated workstation that allows for high capacity processing of tissue and cell samples.    Molecular studies are at the core of KML-based research, and focus on three emerging areas of study: genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics.  Genomic studies center on the genetic makeup of organisms and are used to identify biodiversity and changes that may occur naturally or in response to human activities.  Proteomics is the study of proteins that are produced by organisms as a result of their genetics, but that can differ among different populations of organisms, among individuals within a population or even within a single creature at different times of its life cycle or in response to environmental changes.  Transcriptomics is the discipline that addresses changes in specific gene expression over space and time.  All three areas of study provide valuable information that advance our basic understanding of nature as well as data of tremendous practical value in addressing natural resource decline in the face of mounting human pressures such as pollution.  When data from these studies are applied in a forensic or diagnostic manner, the equipment purchased serve as tools that provide a bridge that can be described as "Dr. Doolittle meets CSI (Crime Scene Investigation)" as we can truly allow organisms to communicate with researchers on a variety of issues including cellular and genetic responses to a variety of environmental stressors.   The gene sequencers purchased under the FSML grant are being used to identify bacterial strains essential to the settlement and metamorphosis (recruitment) of a variety of marine organisms, development and evolution of marine species, connectivity among populations of marine organisms and responses to gradients of stress.  The automated workstation is being used to study proteins of diagnostic value in corals to help address the root cause of coral reef decline and to evaluate the effectiveness of various management and mitigation practices.   Additionally, the equipment purchased under this grant will help train the next generation of researchers, educators and resource managers who benefit from KMLÆs educational programs.  The facility supports numerous undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral researchers on a daily basis, all of whom have access to the equipment as essential tools to support completion of their studies, theses and dissertations.  KML runs a number of formal educational programs and has a long history of NSF-funded training grants that focus on increasing participation of under-represented minority students in the STEM disciplines, particularly Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders and women.  The results of research supported by the new equipment purchases will be shared with partnering state, Federal and international agencies in supporting their management and enforcement mandates, as well as the broader community of stakeholders, from fishers to surfers, to meet information needs supporting their quality-of-life concerns.
