<AbstractNarration>Decades of work comparing neuromuscular synapses in both crayfish and lizards have led to a general acceptance of the dogma that the structure of a synapse has little impact on its function.  As a result, the study of structure-function relationships at synapses has been stymied, and, instead, investigators have focused mechanistic studies on the identification of differences in molecules and events associated with transmitter release and calcium signaling. In this project, a comparative study of neuromuscular junctions from frog and mouse skeletal muscle will be carried out using new techniques and a predictive computational model developed in the project collaborators' laboratories. These animal models offer several important advantages.  The neuromuscular junctions of frogs and mice serve similar roles (as opposed to previously studied synapses that served different roles in the crayfish and lizard animal models) and yet, have distinct differences in their physiological properties and pre-synaptic structure and organization.   The driving hypothesis is that key physiological features of neuromuscular synapses are determined by the structural arrangement of basic building blocks of synaptic structure. This work will offer opportunities for training undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students, and high school teachers. Because this is a collaborative project, all trainees will have the unique opportunity to learn both experimental and computational approaches. Importantly, it is expected that the MCell computational model will provide an example of unprecedented scale and realism for the illustration of nerve terminal structure and function with the potential to literally transform a student's grasp of difficult biochemical concepts in space and time. This model will also illustrate and teach the use of Monte Carlo simulations, sophisticated visualization and animation software, and a variety of statistical analysis methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding provided by the NSF under the EAGER award was critical to our ability to push the frontiers of understanding regarding the manner by which motor nerve terminals use calcium ions to control the release of chemical transmitter.  This mechanism not only underlies the manner by which the motor system triggers muscle contraction, but is a highly conserved mechanism that is applicable to the mechanisms by which all neurons in the brain communicate with one another.   In particular, we provided a mechanistic explanation for a long-standing relationship between calcium and transmitter release using a combination of physiological measurements and a powerful computer model of the motor nerve terminal.  Building on the previous identification of the protein that binds calcium ions and triggers chemical transmitter release, we showed how many of these proteins must be at each release site, and how many need to bind calcium to trigger chemical release.  Surprisingly, we changed thinking in the field by showing that there needs to be a great excess of these proteins as compared with how many are used for chemical communication.  This great excess is critical to create the highly sensitive relationship between calcium ions and chemical transmitter release.  Beyond this relationship, we also determined where these calcium ions originate and showed that very few, perhaps only one voltage-sensitive calcium channel can provide all the calcium ions needed.  This dependence on only a single calcium channel protein reinforced a growing body of evidence that supports the notion that at all synapses in the nervous system, single calcium channels have great importance, and donÆt need to act in concert with others.  Lastly, we expanded our investigation into the mechanisms by which transmitter release changes during repeated activation of a motor axon.  There had historically been several proposed mechanisms, and we used our combined approach to show that one in particular worked best: a second calcium binding protein with different characteristics than the known main protein that triggers chemical release.  This second protein can prime the system so that subsequent activity can work more efficiently.  In fact, our prediction preceded the direct demonstration by another laboratory of the specific second protein that appears to mediate this priming.   Overall, our work had significantly advanced understanding of how calcium ions trigger chemical transmitter release at synapses.
