<AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Martin Hackl, Ms. Hadas Kotek will conduct psycholinguistic experiments on the real-time processing of multiple wh-questions in English (e.g., "John asked which students could not read which sign last night"). Multiple wh-questions are a central construction in the debate regarding the existence of Covert Movement (CM) operations. The debate revolves around the question of whether CM operations are responsible for the interpretation of semantic operators at the syntactic level of Logical Form (LF), or whether alternative mechanisms must be adopted. The CM hypothesis holds that, in contexts like the example above, both "which students" and "which sign" are treated as semantic operators that take scope over [x could not read y last night] by covertly moving out of that structure despite the fact that "which sign" remains a constituent of that larger unit in the (overt) phonological form of the sentence.  The results of this research project will contribute to this debate by experimentally testing the existence of CM operations in multiple wh-questions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to provide a detailed and theoretically informed description and analysis of the Logical Form of wh-questions. Crucial new evidence will be collected that will distinguish between two main approaches. Although these approaches differ substantially in their treatment of the syntax and semantics of interrogatives, traditional means of investigation have not been successful in choosing between these approaches.  One reason for this lack of success is that off-line judgments collected from native speaker informants regarding the acceptability, felicity, and semantic content of multiple questions do not provide direct evidence about CM, and have not pinpointed the grammatical causes of CM for wh-expressions. The project proposes an experimental investigation of multiple wh-questions which goes beyond off-line judgments. In particular, it proposes to conduct three real-time sentence processing experiments to test differing predictions made by these two approaches. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The grammatical configurations that these experiments will investigate focus on so-called intervention effects, which have been central to current debates about the syntax and semantics of multiple wh-questions. This project will provide novel experimental evidence for the existence and nature of intervention effects, which have not been previously tested empirically. This award will also support the scientific training of a promising scholar.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Human languages vary along many dimensions, leading to very different surface appearances. Despite this fact, linguists have found that human languages share certain basic principles, and that variation is limited to a small set of specified parameters. The goal of this project was to provide a detailed and theoretically informed study of the structure and meaning of questions, a topic central to deep questions about human language and communication, and relevant to many fields, including computer science and cognitive psychology.  How the human brain formulates and processes questions, and how we identify appropriate answers to those quesitons, is a core topic in human-human interaction, and vital to effective human interaction with computer systems as well.  This project helped settle several open questions about this most human of processes.   Through a series of sentence processing experiments, one major accomplishment of this project has been to document how native speakers of English construct and interpret questions in real time, an issue that has not been well-studied in the past. In documenting this behavior, we were able to pinpoint systematic ways in which certain grammatical phenomena affect the interpretation of questions, allowing us to advance our syntactic and semantic analysis of interrogative constructions.
