<AbstractNarration>COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: ARCTIC DINOSAUR PALEOBIOLOGY: HYPOTHESIS TESTING THROUGH CROSS-LATITUDINAL COMPARISON &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principle Investigator: Patrick Druckenmiller, University of Alaska Fairbanks&lt;br/&gt;Co-Principle Investigator: Gregory M. Erickson, Florida State University, Tallahassee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polar dinosaurs endured intense seasonal conditions making them well suited to test major questions in dinosaur paleobiology pertaining to physiology, migration and distribution. This project will examine the most prolific, yet vastly understudied polar dinosaur fauna known, the Prince Creek Formation of northern Alaska. The research will entail collection, description, and assessment of species composition. These data will be compared to those of lower latitude formations affording the first comparison between a polar dinosaur fauna and typical lower latitude dinosaurian assemblages. The study will also document the influence of the Alaskan Arctic environment on dinosaur biology through analyses of bone and tooth growth rings.  Learning how dinosaurs occupied the Arctic will provide new insights into high latitudinal occupation by animals as a whole. This project will bring together a diverse team of scientists who will share new ideas and methodologies and contribute to the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students. Results will be submitted to scientific journals and presented publicly on the Internet. Visits will be made to rural, northern Alaskan K-12 schools to provide underserved Alaska Native students and teachers with an opportunity to learn about the fossils in their area and interact with NSF-sponsored researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes  In broad terms, we studied Arctic dinosaur paleobiology, based primarily on collections from the best known and most prolific high-latitude dinosaur-bearing unit known: the Prince Creek Formation (PCF) of Northern Alaska. The goals of this research are to use new and existing data on Arctic dinosaurs from Alaska to address larger long-standing questions relating to Cretaceous faunal provinciality in North America (i.e. was there a community of dinosaurs and other animals unique to the Arctic much like there are high latitude Arctic communities today compose of unique animals like musk oxen, caribou, Arctic foxes today), physiology (were dinosaurs warm-blooded), overwintering strategies and migration.  More specifically, the major goals of this research project were to:  1)    conduct fieldwork in northern Alaska to augment existing collections;  2)    conduct a survey of the faunal composition of the Prince Creek Formation in northern Alaska using modern techniques;  3)    compare the results of these faunal analyses with those of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which is an age-equivalent, contiguous, lower latitude assemblage;  4)    assess growth strategies in Cretaceous Arctic environments using bone microstructure that revealed annual (tree-ring-like) growth lines and allowed reconstruction of growth curves.   5) Provide an avenue for interdisciplinary scientific investigation, educational opportunities for students and teachers, and dissemination of findings in both professional and lay-public arenas including to Native Alaskan communities.   Our research on both the macro- and microfossils shows that new species of dinosaurs and other animals (birds, mammals) are present in the Prince Creek Formation and that the fauna is unique to the Arctic. A number of descriptions of new species were discovered. Our data on dinosaurian growth suggest these animals were not affected by the environment, were year-round occupants of the Arctic, and were probably warm-blooded.    Numerous students (including minorities and high school students) were involved in the research, advanced their learning skills and made strides toward professional careers in science. We have presented our results through publications and presentations in both professional and public venues (K-12 schools and Native Alaskan communities) leading to a more scientifically literate society.
