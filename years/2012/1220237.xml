<AbstractNarration>The dominant process in mountain building is shortening and thickening of the Earth?s crust across relatively narrow orogenic belts where tectonic plates converge. During the past two decades there has been growing appreciation of the importance of crustal extension occurring within mountain belts at the same time as shortening. Examples of such syn-convergent extension have been identified in active mountain belts including the Himalaya and Andes and many researchers have also found evidence for similar processes in rocks that formed in ancient mountain belts. The goal of this project is to document the mechanisms of ongoing syn-convergent extension within an active fault system that bounds the southwestern margin of the Cordillera Blanca in the Peruvian Andes. Data collected on this modern structure will help researchers interpret evidence for syn-convergent extension from ancient orogenic events as well as modern mountain belts. The Cordillera Blanca is the ideal structure to study these processes because extension is very recent (&lt; 6 million years), the regional tectonic regime has remained fairly constant during the evolution of the fault and the rocks in the footwall are similar along the entire 200 km length of the detachment. These factors will facilitate comparison of data from different parts of the detachment and allow us extrapolate processes and rates of deformation into the past.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Syn-convergent extension can be broadly divided into two general types according to the direction of extension relative to the mountain belt: orogen parallel extension involves stretching of the crust parallel to the trend of the mountain belt (perpendicular to the direction of shortening); transverse extension involves stretching across the trend of the mountain belt (parallel to the direction of shortening). Orogen parallel extension generally occurs on faults oriented perpendicular to the mountains while transverse extension occurs on structures parallel to the mountain belt. Transverse extension poses something of a conundrum: How can the crust shorten and extend at the same time and in the same direction? The answer seems to involve a partitioning of shortening and extension at different levels in the crust. By studying the evolution of the Cordillera Blanca through time as it is exhumed we will attempt to elucidate the conditions that allow extension while overall shortening continues across the Andes. This project will focus on shear-zone-scale processes including: (1) How have the thickness, strain rate, differential flow stress and temperature evolved during exhumation to shallower crustal levels, and (2) How is deformation on the master detachment related to slip on seismically active structures? By carefully integrating field mapping of structural geometry, kinematic studies, analysis of deformation mechanisms, temperature estimates and paleopiezometry, we hope to reconstruct a profile showing how the strength and mechanical behavior of the shear zone varied at different depths during deformation and exhumation of the Cordillera Blanca. Our research will provide results that will help researchers to better understand how extensional faults evolve during crustal extension in modern and ancient mountain belts.  The research represents a collaborative effort between researchers at the University of Kentucky Knoxville and Montana State University. In addition to the scientific goals of the project, the project is supporting the training of graduate and undergraduate students in an STEM discipline and contributing to public outreach efforts based on the research outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Active boundaries between tectonic plates are zones where energy in the Earth can accumulate.  In the case of collision between two continental plates with similar densities this energy can go into creating high topography in large mountain ranges such as the Himalayas.  Ongoing convergence between the Indian and Eurasian plates continues to drive the formation of the Himalayas as they are reduced by weathering, erosion, and faulting.   The Andes is an example of a mountain range that rises above a convergent plate boundary between oceanic crust that subducted beneath the less dense continental crust of the South America plate.  Although the dynamics of an Andean subduction boundary are different from continental collisions like the Himalaya, in some places, such as the highest elevations of the Peruvian Andes in the Cordillera Blanca, extension also occurs during continued convergence.  This research project focused on the record of extension during convergence as exposed in the Cordillera Blanca range, Peru. The Cordillera Blanca range is known to many geologists because it is a rare example of active extension in a convergent pate boundary. Faulting on the southwestern margin of the range includes brittle faulting as well as ductile deformation.  The southwestern margin of the Cordillera Blanca is also dissected by deep gorges that allow us to investigate different levels of deformation in the crust. Many samples collected at different positions across the faults are the foundation for the laboratory based competent of the project.  This sampling occurred over two field seasons.  Using the facilities at the University of Tennessee, hand samples were cut into specific orientations for use with microscopes. Characterizing the feldspar and quartz using microscopes allowed us to look at structures in the rock that record how the rocks were deformed.  These mechanisms can be used for many things such estimating the temperature of deformation. Looking for specific types of alignment of different minerals showed the record of displacement during ductile shearing.  The most promising of these samples were used for different analytical methods.   In collaboration with the Montana State University, a scanning electron microscope, equipped with a camera for electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD), was used to quantify the slip systems in quartz.  Additionally, this scanning electron microscope helped to measure the size and distribution of quartz grains.  These grain sizes are calibrated to various amounts of differential stress. Samples that included a particular type of feldspar were analyzed using an electron microprobe at the University of Tennessee.  These chemical data can be used to estimate temperatures that occurred during ductile shearing.    Data acquired using these instruments allowed us to estimate the paleostress as well as the temperatures of parts of the deformation history.  Paleostress from two transects range between 20-58 MPa (million pascals).  Estimates of deformation temperatures based on feldspar were 424-478 &ordm;C.  Because the transects are composed of the same granite, each segment across the fault can be compared to create a model for the strength of the brittle and ductile portions of crust.   The record of faulting that was the focus of this investigation includes processes of the upper crust and middle crust. This record is being exposed for our study of rheology of brittle and ductile deformation.  We are tying these results into the distribution of measured microseismicity and the regional geodynamic setting to learn about the interactions between brittle and ductile deformation.  This data is relevant to researchers who specialize in earthquakes. They are also useful as input into geodynamic models of convergent orogens.  Broader Impacts: A PhD student, Cameron Hughes, from the University of Tennessee (EPSCoR) was funded by this grant.  She joined two research expeditions to the range.  Cameron became a trained user of the electron microprobe at the University of Tennessee as well as the scanning electron microscope and EBSD system at Montana State University.  Our research group presented our results at national meetings and department seminars.  Four undergraduate students from the University of Tennessee were involved with research projects that were related to samples from the shear zone.  Four of them participated in the Exhibition of Undergraduate Research and Creative Achievement (EUReCA) at the University of Tennessee.  The students learned to write an abstract, compile their data, and create posters to showcase their study. During two different years, Cameron Hughes participated in the "Can You Dig It Day" at the McClung Museum by discussing her research) to K-12 students, pre-school children, and parents.  This project fostered a research collaboration between the University of Tennessee and Montana State University that included graduate and undergraduate mentoring.
