<AbstractNarration>This award focuses on a specific research program that will be using data from the neutron monitor at McMurdo (which will be then moved to Jang Bogo) and from other worldwide locations. The research program is based on a unique southward cosmic rays "viewing direction" of the subject monitor for comprehensive analyses of individual solar events by measuring three dimensional distribution functions of solar energetic particles. The long and complete database acquired by the McMurdo monitor over 50+ years also plays an important role in the studies of historical trends in "solar modulation" of galactic cosmic rays and the influence of solar magnetic activity on the radiation input into the Earth's atmosphere. The recent deep solar minimum and slow recovery to the maximum are unprecedented for the potentially new era in the studies of the Sun. To ensure continuity of the McMurdo long-term dataset, it is proposed to move the monitor to the new Korean station Jang Bogo, which is located in Terra Nova Bay and has the viewing direction nearly identical to that of McMurdo. Solid science, international partners, and travel to Antarctica provide an ideal opportunity to achieve excellent education and outreach goals. By providing undergraduates and two-year college students with Antarctic research experience, the proposal demonstrates how a future generation of scientists can make meaningful contributions to the cutting-edge research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The neutron monitor originally at McMurdo Station is arguably the longest continuously running science instrument in Antarctica.  Neutron monitors measure low energy cosmic rays and can be used to study solar storms.  The mechanisms that produce solar storms and accelerate particles are still an open science question.  A more immediate concern is the damage that can be done during intense solar storms to electronics and electrical systems on Earth.  A better understanding of the number and energy of the particles produced in extreme solar storms could help preparations to deal with these types of events.  The building that housed the neutron monitor at McMurdo Station, CosRay, is scheduled to be closed and removed.  We developed and carried out a plan to move the neutron monitor to the new Korean station, Jang Bogo, which has a viewing direction nearly identical to that of McMurdo. The goal was to ensure continuity of the data set, important for studies of the historical trends in solar modulation, the influence of solar magnetic activity on cosmic ray fluxes and radiation input to the Earth's atmosphere.  An important Broader Impacts goal of this project was to provide extensive research experiences for undergraduate students, targeting those from two-year colleges.
