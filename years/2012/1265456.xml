<AbstractNarration>The conference "Encounters in Geometry" will take place June 3 to 7, 2013 in Cabo Frio, Brazil.  We have selected three topics that have been particularly productive over the last few years, on which most talks will concentrate: 1) manifolds with lower curvature bounds, including non-negative and positive curvature; 2) Riemannian foliations, including the orbit geometry of group actions; 3) submanifold geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant will supply travel from the US to Rio de Janeiro for 10-15 graduate students  and 10-15 mathematicians from the US, with an emphasis on recent Ph.D.'s. Local support is paid for by Brazilian grants. Participation by women and minorities will be actively sought and encouraged. The conference will provide an environment for American graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s in which they can learn about new developments in geometry, through research talks by Brazilian and international experts. A second goal is to introduce geometers in Brazil to subjects currently active in the US.  The participants will also be given an an opportunity to present their results through talks and poster sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;URL: http://www.impa.br/opencms/pt/eventos/store/evento_1302</AbstractNarration>
