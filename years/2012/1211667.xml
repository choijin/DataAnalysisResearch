<AbstractNarration>A collisionless plasma is a fully ionized gas in which electromagnetic forces are &lt;br/&gt;strong enough to dominate collisional effects. The motion of a high temperature, &lt;br/&gt;low density collisionless plasma is described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this setting &lt;br/&gt;collisions are neglected while the charge and current densities, which drive the &lt;br/&gt;Maxwell system, are determined in a self-consistent manner from velocity &lt;br/&gt;moments of solutions to the Vlasov equation. The major question to be studied is &lt;br/&gt;this: are there shocks in a collisionless plasma? That is, could a singularity develop &lt;br/&gt;from smoothly prescribed initial values as time progresses? In some cases, such as &lt;br/&gt;in lower dimensional, relativistic formulations (e.g., one space and two velocity &lt;br/&gt;variables), smooth global solutions are known to exist.  Another problem to be &lt;br/&gt;investigated concerns the long-time behavior of the charge and current densities &lt;br/&gt;and electromagnetic fields in the system.  More specifically, do dispersive effects &lt;br/&gt;in the equations cause these quantities to decay over time, or is there sufficient &lt;br/&gt;interaction so as to sustain their strength even as time tends to infinity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kinetic Theory includes the study of the motion and properties of plasma. Plasmas &lt;br/&gt;are often referred to as the fourth state of matter (after solids, liquids and gases) &lt;br/&gt;and account for 99.99% of all material in the universe. They are of great practical &lt;br/&gt;interest because they are charged gases, and thus serve as excellent conductors of &lt;br/&gt;electricity. As an example, plasma engines have been developed by a number of &lt;br/&gt;space agencies and recently used to power some NASA spacecraft. Additionally, &lt;br/&gt;the use of plasmas through nuclear fusion as a source of clean energy is currently &lt;br/&gt;of immense scientific interest.  Notable examples of collisionless plasmas include &lt;br/&gt;the solar wind, the Earth's ionosphere, galactic nebulae, low-density fusion &lt;br/&gt;reactors, and comet tails. A complete understanding of the solar wind would also &lt;br/&gt;be extremely useful, as this natural phenomenon dictates the intensity of "space &lt;br/&gt;weather", which is often responsible for expensive damage to satellites orbiting &lt;br/&gt;the Earth. The motion of a plasma is described by a number of complicated &lt;br/&gt;differential equations dictated by physics. Among the goals of the current project &lt;br/&gt;are to show that these equations possess solutions (under appropriate conditions), &lt;br/&gt;determine their qualitative behavior, and approximate them computationally so &lt;br/&gt;that one can predict behavior in future situations with certainty.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Kinetic equations are ubiquitous throughout applied mathematics with a storied history dating back to Boltzmann, Grad, and the initial development of statistical mechanics. Today, Kinetic Theory is a rich field that possesses a variety of applications to gas dynamics, plasma physics, astrophysics, photonics, semiconductor theory, space physics, quantum mechanics, nuclear engineering, and clean energy research. The analytical and computational challenges inherent within these problems originate in the need to resolve particle motion in high-dimensional phase spaces and over large domains, which is usually analytically challenging and computationally prohibitive. The primary goal of the project was to obtain mathematically precise statements about these models by applying techniques from the realms of classical analysis, a priori estimation, and nonlinear differential equations. Such results impact the underlying physical science by validating or invalidating the models of interest, displaying limits on their range of applicability, producing qualitative estimates which aid in the construction and analysis of numerical methods, and increasing the scientific understanding of the phenomena of interest. These goals were overwhelmingly achieved as the PI, along with a variety of collaborators, developed several new analytical methods that are quite effective in the study of kinetic equations, especially for problems involving weak collisions as modeled by the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck operator.  To date, 15 journal articles have been published quoting partial support from this grant.  A few highlights of the major achievements include: (1) The first development of global smooth solutions to the fundamental non-relativistic model of plasma dynamics - the Vlasov-Maxwell system - in a reduced phase space. (2) Construction of the first global smooth solutions of both the relativistic and non-relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Fokker-Planck system in reduced phase space (3) The first study of the full three-dimensional Vlasov-Nordstrom-Fokker-Planck system resulting in the construction of spatially-homogeneous solutions and sharp estimates of their time-asymptotic behavior (4) Formulation of the first conditions to guarantee the nonlinear stability or instability of periodic BGK waves (steady, energy-focused solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system) under perturbations of the same period (5) The construction and implementation of new particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for the Vlasov-Maxwell system.  These methods are used to conduct a rigorous sensitivity analysis of solutions and their strict dependence on initial data and domain geometry Project results in these directions have been widely disseminated in the form of 25 seminars and colloquia presented by the PI and another 15 by collaborators, including students involved in the research developments. During the three years of this project, the PI trained a postdoctoral fellow, two Ph.D. students, three M.S. students, and five undergraduate students to perform extensive research in this area.  The postdoctoral fellow is now a tenure-track professor at New Mexico State University.  One Ph.D. student will finish her degree in the upcoming year, while the other will do so in two years.  Of the three M.S. students, one works in industry for an energy solutions corporation, while the other two are currently pursuing doctoral degrees at UCLA and the University of Minnesota, respectively.  Finally, four of the five undergraduates have graduated and are currently attending graduate school in either applied mathematics or physics, while the fifth will complete her B.S. this year. In summary, the thrust of our research involved the use mathematical tools to prove rigorous theorems that guide the design and analysis of advanced numerical algorithms for applications in plasma physics, stellar dynamics, nuclear engineering, and other fields.  In the future the results of this research will further enable accurate an...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
