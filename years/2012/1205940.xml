<AbstractNarration>Searches for evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model can be addressed through direct searches at the Energy Frontier at High Energy Colliding Beam Facilities such as the LHC and through a complementary technique of indirect searches at the Intensity Frontier, in experimental measurements of very-rare decay modes of known particles.  This project focuses on continued research with the NA62 experiment at CERN, which is a measurement of the rare decay of the charge K meson through the process, K+ -&gt; pi+ nu nubar.   This decay is well-predicted in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and a precision experimental measurement of the actual rate could provide evidence for new physics, if the observed rate differs significantly from the theoretical prediction.  The experimental challenge is occasioned by the very small branching fraction predicted by the Standard Model for this decay mode of 0.85 x 10-10.   Despite its small size, the GMU group is engaged in all aspects of  NA62,  with responsibilities in event trigger logic, trigger hardware and front-end electronics communication, slow controls, CEDAR (a special differential Cherenkov counter for the detection of kaons in the beam line, for which GMU has made significant contributions) and Muon Veto hardware components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The George Mason group is making an impressive effort in broadening the participation in fundamental research at the intensity frontier, through its participation in QuarkNet and through a separate NSF IRES (International Research Experience for Students) grant that brings up to five undergraduates to CERN each summer, with applicants selected from a consortium of universities and colleges in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area.</AbstractNarration>
