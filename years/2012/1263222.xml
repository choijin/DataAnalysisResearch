<AbstractNarration>Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs) are natural laboratories for investigating Earth surface processes mediated by fresh water in the zone extending from the top of the vegetation canopy to the base of groundwater, i.e. the Critical Zone. This award supports the participation of undergraduate students and teachers in research at two Critical Zone Observatories, the Susquehanna-Shale Hills Observatory (SSHO) in central Pennsylvania and the Christina River Basin (CRB) CZO in southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware. Pennsylvania State University is the lead institution of the SSHO and would collaborate with the Stroud Water Research Center (SWRC), a partner in the CRB CZO. The collaborative project will fund a total of 12 undergraduate students and 4 teachers at these sites per year, providing research experiences for undergraduates primarily interested in Earth Science careers and K-12 teachers who want to increase their content knowledge and resources for the classroom. At the CRB, participants will be involved in research investigating aspects of the impact of three centuries of human habitation on the carbon and water cycles. At the SSHO, participants will be involved in research to quantitatively predict the creation, evolution and structure of regolith as a function of the geochemical, hydrologic, biologic, and geomorphological processes operating in the temperate, forested landscape. After the summer experience, participants will prepare and give presentations at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union.  CZOs offer a unique opportunity for training undergraduate students and teachers via research experiences because of the broad array of environmental landscapes represented by the observatories and the interdisciplinary science achieved through the observatory framework.</AbstractNarration>

This project was a collaborative partnership between Penn State University (Susquehanna Shale Hills CZO) and Stroud Water Research Center (Christina River Basin CZO) in which 36 REU participants and 12 RET participants worked within research teams at these two CZOs. Participants from both institutions attended a joint 10-day orientation at the beginning of each summer program and presented their summer research at a national science meeting as a capstone event at the end of the summer.  In addition to posters, RETs were expected to develop curricular materials.  All posters and curricular materials are publically available at http://czo.stroudcenter.org/reu/completed-research/  and in news articles describing each summer program can be viewed at http://czo.stroudcenter.org/reu.
