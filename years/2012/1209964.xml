<AbstractNarration>This action funds Paul Taele of Texas A&amp;M University to conduct a research project, entitled "Enhancing natural user interaction for air-based sketching," during the summer of 2012 at the NTU Mobile, Social, and HCI Research Lab in National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan.  The host scientist is Dr. Mike Y. Chen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to investigate the types of gesture and sketch interactions that humans make with their hands and arms in the air, and to use that gained knowledge for enhancing natural user interfaces which exploit those types of interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal investigator (PI) participated in three diverse research projects with members of Dr. Mike Chen's NTU Mobile HCI Lab at National Taiwan University in Summer 2012, exploring creative solutions to topics that overlapped the research interests of both the PI and the host research lab.  Those three diverse research projects consisted of the following research works: iSpine, a motion-based edutainment interface for improving the spinal health awareness and fitness for children at high risk for the medical condition of scoliosis; iCAN, a tablet-based computer-assisted instructional interface for effectively improving the communications skills of Chinese Mandarin as a first language for children with autism with severe communications deficiencies; and iGrasp, a system for improving frequent physical interactions with mobile user interfaces on devices such as smartphones and tablets based on auxiliary information yielded on user's grasping of those devices.   The summer work conducted by the PI with the host research lab collaborators contributed successful results for each of the three different projects.  Findings from the iSpine project yielded rich feedback data from the target users of children indicating that they enjoyed various features of the system's game interface including: enjoyable in-game storyline, entertaining motion-based interaction that better described previously abstract concepts about the spine, and improved sense of responsibility through their care of in-game virtual characters tied to progress made in the game.  Findings from the iCAN project from collected evaluation scores and responses from caregivers of the children with autism yielded positive feedback on the system's ability to accommodate the children's communications needs, appealing to caregivers in reducing the burden of preparing the instructional material and motivating children through its intuitive touch-based interface.  Findings from the iGrasp project through evaluations showed promising numbers as viewing interactions showed noticeable improvements in various frequently-used mobile device tasks compared to existing related systems while users were viewing their mobile devices at various positions and orientations.   From these findings, the research projects demonstrate various broader impacts which allow for the systems generated from the conducted research work to improve learning in children of communications skills (I.e., iCAN) and specific concepts (i.e., iSpine), promoting teaching with instructors and caregivers through the use of novel educational interfaces on recent technologies (e.g., tablets with iCAN, Kinects with iSpine), and improving the conveniences of ubiquitous mobile devices through novel interaction techniques (i.e., iGrasp).  The subsequent aim is in disseminating the results from these research projects to the human-computer interaction research communities.
