<AbstractNarration>Influence of cell-cell signaling on microbial colonization of alternate hosts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vector-transmitted microbes cause many diseases that threaten human health and agricultural production. Vector transmitted microbes have complex but poorly understood density dependent cell-cell communication signals that alter trait expression to increase survival in different environments and to switch between hosts. To address this shortcoming, this project investigates the production of cell-cell communication signals by Xylella fastidiosa, an obligately insect transmitted plant pathogen, in response to host-specific chemical cues from plants and insects, and characterizes induced changes in microbial phenotype and consequences for insect vector and host plant colonization. X. fastidiosa has a reduced genome (~2.5Mb) and is only known to persist in plant xylem and leafhopper vector foregut, two environments composed of polysaccharides that are replicable in the lab. These factors make this natural system an ideal model for understanding regulation of complex microbial traits in alternate hosts and how these relate to transmission dynamics and broader disease epidemiology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives are to learn experimental methods for characterizing induced microbial phenotypes and computational methods to describe the underlying transcriptional changes. The project aims to increase participation in biology in the affected agricultural community, on the UC Berkeley campus, and with K-12 students at local schools. Locally, on-farm presentations will focus on biological factors mediating pathogen transmission and how to minimize the amount of conventional pesticides used. Undergraduate researchers will be recruited through the Cal Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program and trained in methods in microbiology, insect biology, and genomics. Curricula will be developed and presented at local schools focused on evaluating microbial biology issues in health and agriculture. The results generated from this project will be summarized in accessible language on the Xylella fastidiosa website (http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/xylella/) which is freely accessible to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this NSF Post Doctoral Research Fellowship was for the Principal Investigator to become trained in the rapidly developing field of microbial evolutionary and functional genomics, and to provide training opportunities for individuals from underrepresented minority groups.  The funding from this award supported the development of genomic and molecular tools to better understand the Erwinia tracheiphila pathosystem. E. tracheiphila is the etiological agent causing bacterial wilt of cucurbits, which is an ecologically and economically important pathogen affecting wild and cultivated cucurbits in the Midwestern and Northeastern United States. E. tracheiphila mostly affects introduced Cucumis spp. crop plants (cucumbers and melons) of Eurasian origin, but also causes losses in native Cucurbita spp. crops (zucchinis, squashes, pumpkins, and gourds). Despite its economic importance, the E. tracheiphila pathosystem is largely uncharacterized at almost all biological levels.  First, long read sequencing technology from Pacific Biosciences was utilized to create the first two reference genome sequences of strains isolated from a cucumber plant (Cucumis sativus) host and a gourd plant (Cucurbita pepo) host. These strains showed highly unusual genomic characteristics: 20% of the genes show evidence of being horizontally transferred into the E. tracheiphila genome, 20% of the genes showed signs of being nonfunctional (pseudogenized), and 20% of the genes were mobile DNA. Together, these genomic traits indicate that E. tracheiphila has undergone among the most rapid genomic change ever documented in a bacterial pathogen, and indicate that E. tracheiphila recently emerged into susceptible host populations.  Next, a strain collection of E. tracheiphila was sequenced with Illumina technology in collaboration with researchers at Iowa State University. These strains were collected from all susceptible host plants across the entire geographic range where E. tracheiphila occurs. These sequences show an incipient lineage split between strains collected from Cucumis spp. hosts vs. strains collected from Cucurbita spp. hosts. Further, the sequences show negligble levels of genetic variation within each clade despite the signs of rapid change documented in the reference genomes. Together, analysis of the reference genomes and the strain collection data indicate that E. tracheiphila is a newly emerged pathogen in agro-ecosystems, and is not an ancient pathogen that has been circulating in wild cucurbit populations.   This project has developed this pathosystem into a fully tractable model at both the geographic and molecular scale, with important implications for understanding the ecology and evolution of emerging infectious diseases important for both public health and food security. Despite the presence of susceptible host plants in the affected areas for millions of years, genomic data shows E. tracheiphila did not emerge as a pathogen until the introduction of foreign host plants, and widespread land use changes associated with rapid conversion of intact ecological habitat to simplified agro-ecosystems in the Eastern United States. On a conceptual level, this project has created a new approach to understanding the ecological and environmental factors contributing to the emergence of highly virulent pathogens into managed agro-ecosystems. A better understanding of the ecological factors making host populations susceptible to pathogen invasion is essential basic knowledge for creating food production systems robust to parasite and pathogen invasion, especially as an increasing percentage of the Earth's surface is converted to managed agroecosystems or pasturelands to feed a rapidly growing human population.  In addition to providing invaluable training in genomic data analysis and computer science using an ecologically and economically relevant system for the female PI, this project has created many additional training opportunities fo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
