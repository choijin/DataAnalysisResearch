<AbstractNarration>Carbon-based nano-materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and, more recently, graphene layers and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), have attracted strong interest as alternative device technologies for future nanoelectronics applications. This collaborative research project will potentially result in transformative advances required to harness the early science of these nano-materials into practical design technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, PIs will develop a multi-scale simulation framework that integrates quantum simulations with compact model development for CNT and GNR field-effect transistors (CNTFETs and GNRFETs).  They will develop ambipolar logic circuits and ultra-steep sub-threshold logic circuits as two promising candidate solutions with applications to both CNTFETs and GNRFETs.  PIs will identify, model, and explore the effect of different variability and defect mechanisms in these devices to provide expedient means to systematically understand and predict their effects on the performance and reliability of practical carbon-based circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will be disseminated through an integrated testbed for research and education in beyond-silicon computing, with an emphasis on carbon-based electronics. Through collaborations with a broad range of academic investigators as well as government and industry affiliates, this collaborative effort will strengthen ties between the device and CAD communities, help create links among them, and accelerate convergence to key design parameters essential for large scale integration of carbon-based electronics. Additionally, the development of learning modules, inter-disciplinary courses, and outreach efforts such as the Design Automation Summer School will bring the architectures, design tools and methodologies -- alongside fabrication and basic physics -- that will most likely define the first generation of nano-computing systems into the mainstream academic curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

This project explored ambipolar and ultra-steep sub-threshold circuits as two promising candidate solutions with applications to both CNTs and graphene.  Ambipolar and tunneling conduction, which stem from contact-limited transport and quantum effects, have been considered undesirable in the quest for traditional MOSFET-like behavior in next-generation devices. However, there is mounting evidence that the ability to control ambipolarity and tunneling presents new design opportunities for low-power design.  Our work with ambipolar circuits led to OR-XOR Boolean forms that are a super-set of traditional sum-of-product and Reed-Muller OR-XOR representations.  Further, since there is experimental evidence that ambipolarity can be controlled in the field, we are focused on the realization of manufacturable arrays of in-field reconfigurable universal logic, with an expressive power and performance superior to scaled CMOS technologies. Motivated by initial benchmarking results for ultra-steep sub-threshold circuits, we evaluated and reported the potential of these devices for dense, low-power memories as well as energy-constrained and burst-mode logic applications.  Graphene transistors are also widely recognized as next-generation candidates for analog, mixed-signal, and radio frequency (AMS/RF) systems serving the rapidly growing wireless communications market in the high-frequency (&gt; 60GHz), millimeter-wave domain.  We demonstrated a triple-mode ambipolar amplifier based on a single graphene transistor that can accomplish the modulation necessary for phase shift keying and frequency shift keying, which are widely used in wireless applications such as Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Compared with conventional designs for such applications, which use complex designs based on multiple unipolar transistors, the proposed amplifier has the advantages of a simplified structure with lower parasitics, larger bandwidth, and lower power.  The project supported multiple graduate students and a post-doc in an interdisciplinary, multi-university effort to investigate and advance the science of carbon-based transistors for next-generation electronics applications.
