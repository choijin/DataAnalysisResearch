<AbstractNarration>Marine ecosystems are characterized by complex interactions among biological components and within the physical setting. The complexity of these systems makes them difficult to understand or interpret based on either observations or models, both of which suffer from incomplete knowledge of the natural system. Of interest to many scientific questions and to management is the utility of broad, simplifying concepts about how such systems operate and how they change over time.  Among these concepts are bottom-up control (the idea that nutrient sources and lower trophic levels govern the ecosystem), top-down control (the idea that organisms at the highest trophic levels govern), and regime shifts (major restructuring of the system due to natural or anthropogenic, or combined, forcing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A basic tenet of biological oceanography is the coupling between physical processes and population dynamics. The study of these connections has been based on certain simplifications, particularly the emphasis on one, or very few, trophic components. The parallel development of trophic network models (e.g., ECOPATH) represents an effort to study the relationships between a more complete spectrum of trophic groups from an energy transfer and predator-prey perspective. Yet, ecosystem structure, function, and behavior depend on the physical context: mixing, advection, water residence time, and seasonality, especially for shelf ecosystems. These terms define production, recycling, and export rates and set the scope of benthic-pelagic coupling, but they are rarely incorporated into trophic network models. There is clear need to develop portable methods of analysis that can illuminate physical-biological interactions across a wide range of ecosystems and demonstrate their effects on system productivity and resilience at all trophic levels. However, there is a simultaneous risk of such models becoming so complex that untangling the mechanisms and artifacts of model dynamics quickly becomes intractable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A portable, coupled bio-physical model framework of intermediate trophic and physical resolution is a potential solution that will be developed in this project. The goal is to produce models simple enough to understand, but complex enough to be realistic. Thus, about 5 physical boxes and about 20 ecological compartments are expected to be included. The models will be developed for four contrasting, data-rich continental shelf ecosystems. This project will use the range of food webs and physical forcing characteristic of these four systems to do the following. 1. Assess the merits and disadvantages of studying community dynamics in terms of aggregated functional groups as the appropriate level of trophic resolution. 2. Compare the relative roles of physical processes and trophic network structure in determining system productivity, variability, and resilience across all trophic levels, including both pelagic and benthic food webs. 3. Test the applicability of broad concepts of ecosystem behavior such as bottom-up vs. top-down control of community dynamics, or of sudden regime shifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the education of future scientists through participation in active research. The public will be informed about ocean ecosystem issues through development of a museum exhibit. Model code will be provided to the community for further use and development.  Collaboration with NOAA scientists will foster application of project results to practical management issues.</AbstractNarration>

Approach:  Our first major activity was the development of a standardized multi-species ecosystem model platform, ECOTRAN, that could be applied to diverse shelf ecosystems.

Results and Impact:  ECOTRAN simulations provide information about ecosystem resilience and response to environmental change and resource management strategies, and these are of further value to economic and social sciences. Response times of different species following changes to plankton production are related to the time required for the plankton production rate to balance physical transport rates, the rate of detritus recycling back into the food web, and growth rates of higher trophic level consumers. Detritus recycling plays a major role in system dynamics since it affects both "bottom-up" fluxes through the food web and "top-down" pressures by predators. When detritus recycling is low, as in an upwelling system, response times are short and less sensitive to differences in physical transport rates. But when detritus recycling is high, as in a semi-enclosed basin, more production is recycled through longer-lived, higher trophic level consumers whose slow growth impose long response times.  Comparative analyses of different food webs within different physical settings tested the hypothesis that when nutrient supply and physical transport rates are standardized, there are no substantial differences in the dynamics within diverse food webs. With few specific exceptions, physical context played the greater role controlling dynamics. Exchange between shelf and ocean affected not only nutrient recycling but also trophic transfer efficiencies and the importance of pelagic vs. benthic components of the food web. Differences in plankton transport rates leads to apparent decoupling of lower trophic and upper trophic level production - reducing upper trophic production relative to plankton production (upwelling) or enhancing upper trophic level and benthos production (downwelling). Food web structure further affects dynamics within different physical contexts. Food webs with high intrinsic detritus production have especially productive benthos where physical conditions provide plankton subsidies.  Application of ECOTRAN to the Northern California Current allowed us to look at response to changes in upwelling. Dome-shaped relationships exist between upwelling strength and productivity across all trophic levels. Phytoplankton production is a balance between nutrient supply and physical export off the shelf. Productivity increases as phytoplankton take advantage of increasing nutrient rate, but as plankton export begins to exceed the ability of the phytoplankton community to utilize the increased nutrient supply, production declines with increasing upwelling intensity. Other researchers have proposed that global warming will lead to steeper temperature gradients between the ocean and the land, leading to greater alongshore wind-stress and increased upwelling intensity.
