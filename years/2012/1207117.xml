<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The study of inclusions suspended in liquid crystals can lead to important new insight about the viscoelastic and interfacial properties of these materials and can further create novel platforms for the manipulation and self-assembly of particles through unique anisotropic interactions engendered by the fluids.  In addition, particle-dispersed liquid crystals hold technological promise as composite materials with enhanced properties deriving from the coupling of the particles to the liquid crystalline order.  This work aims to advance substantially our fundamental understanding of and control over the behavior of inclusions in liquid crystals by investigating several promising new classes of systems and particle interactions.  Among the specific topics on which the research will focus include nanoparticle dispersions in smectic liquid crystals, particle- and defect-laden nematics flowing in microfluidic arrays, and anisotropic transport of particles and ions in liquid crystals.  The broader impacts of the project will include research training and education for graduate and undergraduate students in physics that will prepare them for careers in academia and industry.  The project will also enable continuation and expansion of a partnership with a local science magnet high school to provide talented Baltimore City students with opportunities for research internships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Liquid crystals are fluids composed of rod-shaped molecules in which the molecules arrange themselves to be more ordered than in an ordinary liquid but less so than in a crystalline solid.  Examples include nematic liquid crystals where the molecules orient along a common direction and smectic liquid crystals where the molecules form layers.  When an impurity like a small particle is suspended in such a fluid, it can disrupt this order leading to novel effects, such as the spontaneous assembly of the particles into patterns or the deflection of particles away from a force causing them to move.  The impurities can also endow the fluids with enhanced material characteristics, such as unique optical and magnetic properties.  This project will investigate experimentally several classes of inclusions in liquid crystals, including nanometer-scale particles and molecules that carry electrical current, which promise potentially significant impact on research and technology but which have been the subject of little previous study.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Liquid crystals are fluids composed of rod-shaped or disk-shaped molecules in which the molecules arrange themselves to be more ordered than in an ordinary liquid but less so than in a crystalline solid.  Examples include nematic liquid crystals where the molecules orient along a common direction and smectic liquid crystals where the molecules form layers.  This intermediate degree of order imparts to liquid crystals intriguing and technologically useful properties that are not seen in other states of matter.   When an impurity like a small particle is suspended in a liquid crystal, it can disturb the order leading to novel effects, such as the spontaneous assembly of the particles into patterns.  The impurities can also alter the characteristics of the fluids, for example enhancing their unique optical and magnetic properties.  This project investigated experimentally several classes of inclusions in liquid crystals, including nanometer-scale particles and aspherical particles, which promise potentially significant impact on research and technology but which had been the subject of little previous study.    One major thrust of the research was to investigate the mobility of particles in liquid crystals.  Because of the molecular ordering in a nematic liquid crystal, the fluids are anisotropic, and as a result a solid particle moves faster through the fluid when it is moving parallel to the direction of the order than when it moves perpendicular for the same driving force.  We demonstrated experimentally that a consequence of this anisotropy is the existence of a lift force that causes the particle to move at an angle to the force when the force is at an oblique angle to the nematic ordering direction.  Further, we found that the magnitude of the lift is sensitive to how the liquid-crystal molecules orient at the surface of the particle, introducing a new approach for separating nanometer- and micrometer-scale particles based on the chemical properties of their surfaces.   An integral feature of liquid crystals is the possibility for the presence of defects.  Defects are small regions in the fluid the shape of points or lines where the ordering of the molecules is disrupted.  Another major thrust of the work investigated how such defects can interact with suspended particles and alter the trajectories that they follow.  The work further demonstrated how one can engineer defects in pre-determined locations by patterning the ordering of a liquid crystal and thereby create environments that steer particles through prescribed paths.  Yet another thrust of the research employed x-rays to probe the ordering and formation of patterns by nanoparticles in liquid crystals.  By changing the temperature, we tuned the liquid crystals between nematic, smectic, and ordinary liquid states and investigated the behavior of the particles in each phase.  The nanoparticles, which were composed of gold or zirconia, had molecules attached to their surfaces that were similar the molecules comprising surrounding fluids.  When the fluids were an ordinarily liquid, the particles dispersed randomly, but upon cooling into the nematic and smectic phases they formed ordered structures, including stacking arrangements like the atoms in a crystal.  This ordering was reversible:  the particles would re-disperse upon heating the fluid back to the ordinary liquid phase.  These observations point toward employing these forces on inclusions in liquid crystals to create tunable nanostructured materials.   As part of the broader impacts of the project, the PI helped organize the annual Johns Hokins University "Physics Fair", which is held annually in April.  This event attracts more than 500 people to the JHU Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy for a day of interactive demonstrations, contests, physics shows, and other activities.  The students supported by the grant served as docents at the Fair, explaining to attendees various interactive demos related to sound, surface tension, angular momentum, and other physics phenomena.  The fair draws people from throughout the Baltimore area, offering a diverse group an entertaining introduction to science.
