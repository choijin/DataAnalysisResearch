<AbstractNarration>Efforts to broaden the reach of college instructor professional development will be more successful if the design of professional development services is informed by good evaluation evidence about whether and how it is working. While improving student learning is the ultimate goal of college level instructor professional development, measuring student outcomes directly is difficult and expensive as a means of evaluation. Moreover, there is often a long time lag between instructor participation and when a discernible impact on student outcomes can be detected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a more efficient and rapid way to evaluate the effectiveness of professional development and in particular to determine whether and how the instructors are changing their instruction as a result of participation. It is engaged in constructing and validating a self-report survey instrument that can be used to probe the initial classroom impact of professional development of college mathematics instructors, especially shifts in their use of class time and choice of instructional activities.  The PI team is aware of sources of potential bias in self-reported survey responses and is focused on developing an instrument that is as free as possible from incentives to provide biased responses.  Classroom observations are being compared with survey data from multiple sites to determine the conditions under which self-report accurately probes shifts in instructional practice that result from professional development. The goal is a validated survey instrument that will offer a general and inexpensive tool for measuring the impact of professional development in mathematics and, eventually, in science as well.</AbstractNarration>

To compare instructors' responses to what a neutral observer sees, we adapted the observation measures from protocols developed by other researchers for science classes, because we found that different teaching practices are common in mathematics. Importantly, our survey and observation instruments are well aligned with each other, something that has not always been the case in prior studies. Both focus on classroom behaviors, rather than effectiveness, because a change in classroom behaviors (e.g., how class time is spent) may be the first change detected after PD, before instructors are skilled at new practices. We collected survey and observation data from 34 courses, coding 297 class sessions (an average of 9 sessions per course) to make sure that our description of the course as a whole was based on an adequate number of class days.

Most statistical tests are designed for large numbers, but for observations, there is a challenge: the number of observations possible is limited by the high cost and effort to make them.  To compensate for small sample numbers, we have researched and applied a variety of sophisticated statistical techniques. We then assessed the criterion validity of our survey in two ways.  First, by comparing survey to observation data, we showed that instructors can make moderately accurate estimates of the type and amount of teaching and learning activities in their classroom.  This was especially true when we asked about identifiable activities such as group work or student presentations.   Instructors were less able to report on the interactivity of their lecture style, although this comparison was possibly confounded by difficulties creating reliable comparison criteria.   We established validity through comparing interactivity scales formed from the responses to multiple items on the survey (on one hand) to an interactivity scale formed from observational data.  Survey and observation scales correlated robustly with correlation coefficients between 0.45 and 0.64.  The creation of validated scales allows us to make a 'scorable' version of the survey for research and evaluation purposes. In exploring ways to make fair and useful comparisons of the data, we have also developed some rigorous metrics for analyzing these types of data, beyond simple means.
