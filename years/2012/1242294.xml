<AbstractNarration>Current approaches to predicting changes in community structure and function fail to consider relationships between species' attributes that affect their ecological function, genetic variation underlying those functional traits, and the dynamics of the communities of which they are part. This project will focus on Protea and Pelargonium, two South African plant genera that have undergone dramatic diversification and currently span two biodiversity hot spots, the fynbos and succulent karoo biomes in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GFCR). This project will develop an understanding of functional trait variation in both genetic and evolutionary contexts, allowing predictions of the characteristics of communities in which they occur and the resilience of those communities to climate change. The project will examine detailed relationships between functional traits, photosynthesis, water use efficiency and leaf life span, including the genetic basis of trait variation and rates of trait diversification. This information will be used to examine effects of taxonomic and trait diversity on ecosystem resilience in response to fire cycle interval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will expose postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, undergraduates and high school students to international research, including students actively recruited from underserved populations both in the US and South Africa. It will actively enhance conservation infrastructure by working closely in all aspects of the project with the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) to promote biodiversity science, policy and conservation action.</AbstractNarration>

Our goals were to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships and to understand how these two groups, Proteas and Pelargoniums, have evolved in response to past climate change in South Africa. With this knowledge, we hope to provide insight into both the evolutionary history of the diversification of the Cape flora, but also how it may change in response to ongoing climate change. We conducted extensive field work in South Africa to sample as many species of these two genera as possible. Data on leaf and plant characteristics were collected in the field to allow us to analyze relationships among traits, and between traits and environmental variables. Leaf samples of these species were collected to provide DNA for Next Generation sequencing. These sequence data allowed us to create a new phylogeny for each of these groups, and these phylogenies will form the basis for evaluating how ecologically relevant plant characteristics have changed over evolutionary time. We also conducted detailed analyses of genetic diversity on one species per genus - the widespread species Protea repens and Pelargonium scabrum. Analysis of multiple populations of each species indicates that there is widespread genetic variation in both, and that both neutral (isolation by distance) and non-neutral (natural selection) evolutionary processes have driven these genetic differences. For Pelargonium, we have documented extensive phenotypic variation among species for functional traits - i.e., those traits related to the plants' success in their local habitats. In the process we were able to test a widely held hypothesis about the relationships among plant traits. The Leaf Economic Spectrum hypothesis proposes that relationships among some plant functional traits are driven by fundamental tradeoffs that are independent of phylogeny. Our results clearly demonstrate that this is not true within the genus Pelargonium. In addition to these research results, we are also developing important research resources. A reference transcriptome has been published for Protea repens and transcriptome data is being collected for Pelargonium. We also have done full sequencing for one species in each genus, with the goal of assembling and annotating full genome sequences for each.   We trained 2 postdoctoral researchers and 4 graduate students during the course of the project. They participated in the field work in South Africa, and in the analysis and interpretation of the data we collected. They learned new skills related to genomics and data analysis.  Two papers on phylogenetic aspects of the project have been published, and a third is in review. Papers on the evolution of trait-trait and trait-environment relationships for each genus, as well as on the genomic resources, are forthcoming.  The production of clear phylogenies and the development of genomic and transcriptomic resources pave the way for more detailed study of character evolution as well as for analyses of the genetic basis of evolutionary change.
