<AbstractNarration>The causes of geographical gradients in biodiversity are not well understood, and remain a major scientific challenge. Many physical and biotic factors may influence the evolutionary diversification and species distribution dynamics that result in these gradients. This study examines an elevational gradient of tropical birds in Asia, where functional, genetic, and phylogenetic diversity of organisms are woefully understudied and underlying patterns provide a strong system for testing hypotheses about biodiversity along elevational gradients. The proposed research evaluates both traditional (physiological tolerance, competition, opposing boundaries) and novel (taxon age, adult survival, life history trade-offs) factors that vary along elevational gradients and integrates them with dispersal, genetic structure, and phylogenetic history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research partners will share samples and data, and collaborate in cross-disciplinary training of students, in pursuing tests of the proposed hypotheses. This integration will lead to a new mechanistic understanding and conceptual framework for the influence of physical climate gradients and biotic interactions on species distributions and the evolution of diversity. The project will provide extensive opportunities for the training of undergraduate and graduate students, including a unique cross-cultural life experience as well as hands-on educational and field experience. Public outreach includes work with high school students and teachers, museum exhibits, and development of an educational video on tropical bird nesting behaviors. Finally, this project has critical conservation ramifications, as tropical Asian forests are being lost at the fastest rate of any tropical forests in the world, and this research will provide critical information on possible climate change impacts that are of grave concern to extinction risks.</AbstractNarration>

We are currently assessing a hypothesis proposed in other systems that distributions of parasite species vary with elevation and may impact the elevational distribution of avian host species. We produced a new phylogeny for the songbird species on Borneo and showed that the phylogenetic composition and functional morphological traits of bird communities supported long-standing arguments that competition was more important in the species composition of lower elevation communities and physiological tolerances were more important in high elevation communities. Yet, contrary to long-standing arguments, playback experiments indicated that aggressive interactions, as a reflection of competition, did not explain elevational distributions of related species. Metabolic responses to decreasing temperatures indicated that physiological tolerances did not explain elevational distributions, contrary to expectations. Moreover, metabolic rates were not slower than north temperate species from Arizona, USA, contrary to long-standing hypotheses. However, metabolic rates were predicted by adult survival rates within each latitude, but not between latitudes. We showed that intensity of field methods had a major influence on accuracy of estimates and that the most extensively used methods were under-estimating survival in tropical birds. We used heating experiments to show that embryos were sensitive to temperature in their development rates and species differed in their sensitivity, but temperature sensitivities did not explain differences in elevational distributions. Parents were a critical modifier of temperatures to which embryos were exposed through incubation behaviors, and parents of species with higher survival and longer life put less effort into warming embryos and causing longer embryonic periods that exposed the embryos to higher risk of predation. Risk of predation among species influenced how fast the young grew after hatching, but we show that counter to long-standing perspectives, tropical species do not grow slower than temperate species when considered over the entire nestling period and, in fact, grow their wings faster than north temperate species. We also show for the first time that higher predation risk was associated with shorter periods in the nest which influenced locomotor performance at fledging (leaving the nest) which predicted the survival probability of young after leaving the nest.
