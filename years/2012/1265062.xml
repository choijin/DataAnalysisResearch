<AbstractNarration>1265062&lt;br/&gt;Tanguay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental goal of this potentially transformative research project is to investigate the feasibility of ultra compact optical imaging systems for ultraminiature cameras that are designed for chronic surgical implantation in the human body. Such ultraminiature cameras must be at once extremely small, very low mass, and very low power, as well as being both biocompatible and hermetically sealed for chronic implantation. Recent advances in biocompatible optical materials, optical systems design, and CMOS image sensor array technology potentially enable this extreme miniaturization. Biomedical imaging applications of such ultraminiature cameras include an intraocular camera for retinal prostheses, a wide field-of-view eye-tracked extraocular camera for retinal prostheses, a miniaturized eye-tracking camera, and bioimplantable cameras capable of post-surgical interrogation. In the intraocular camera application, the ultraminiature camera is designed for implantation within the human eye, with capability for partially restoring vision in those blinded by photoreceptor degenerating diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The intraocular camera is designed to couple directly to a pixellated microstimulator array that is proximity-coupled to the retinal surface. The development of such an ultraminiature intraocular camera (IOC) would eliminate the need for an external head-mounted or eyeglass-mounted camera in retinal prostheses, and provide for a completely implantable prosthetic device capable of restoring sight with foveation to the blind, at the same time relieving surgical complications.</AbstractNarration>

The potential impact of the successful development of an ultraminiature intraocular camera for retinal prostheses is significant, as the alleviation of blindness is a truly worthy goal.&nbsp; The development of a highly miniaturized intraocular camera will allow for the production of a completely surgically-implantable retinal prosthesis with procedures similar to those employed in cataract surgery, minimizing post-surgical complications and enhancing chronic toleration.&nbsp; The potential impact of such novel chronically implantable cameras is also evident in the potential for post-surgical examination of, for example, regions of tissue that may be susceptible to cancerous regrowth, or key regions of arthroscopically modified joints in full motion.&nbsp; The development of a highly miniaturized eye-tracked extraocular camera would provide an alternative strategy for the provision of foveation in retinal prosthesis patients by restoring the natural coupling of head and eye movements.&nbsp;

the incorporation of optimized imaging capability in such highly miniaturized optical systems by means of ultra-low form factor refractive and/or hybrid refractive/diffractive optical elements; the investigation of design principles for the development of low power, low form factor CMOS image sensor arrays that are optimized for biomedical imaging applications; the theoretical analysis, design, fabrication, and testing of ultraminiature wide field of view optical imaging systems; the integration of wide field of view imaging systems in both eye-tracked extraocular cameras and wearable visual aids; the assessment by means of visual psychophysics techniques of the importance of pre- and post-image filtering of pixellated images for biomedical applications, in order to establish appropriate design constraints for these novel optical imaging systems;
