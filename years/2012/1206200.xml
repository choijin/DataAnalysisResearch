<AbstractNarration>Technical Description: This GOALI project aims to create a robust and reproducible bandgap in graphene. To achieve this goal, superlattices of various geometries are studied, tailoring the band structure, the effective mass, carrier group velocity and other electronic properties of the metamaterials. The project involves collaboration between academia (Purdue University) and industry (IBM T.J. Watson Research Center). One of the experimental approaches is to use a nano-patterning mask to create graphene superlattices with aggressively scaled lattice dimensions and true periodicities. Another approach involves utilizing an external potential with a superlattice periodicity imprinted onto graphene. A comparison of the electronic properties of periodically patterned graphene metamaterials and gated graphene enables an in-depth study of the impact of edge states on the band structures of the metamaterials. The success of this research project can provide a general solution to fabricating superlattices in two-dimensional materials by nano-scale patterning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: This research project addresses one of the most pressing challenges in the graphene field: how to create a robust and reproducible bandgap to enable practical uses of graphene in analog and digital electronics. Through a joint study between Purdue University and IBM, novel patterning methods are investigated in order to achieve the periodic and reproducible features required for bandgap creation. In addition, this project provides opportunities for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in materials science, nano-patterning, and device engineering. The PI is also committed to participate in and contribute to educational outreach programs at Purdue University.</AbstractNarration>
