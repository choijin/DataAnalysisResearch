<AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to study the testing and diagnosis of children who are being considered for an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Since the early 1990s, there has been a huge upsurge in ASD diagnosis. Sociological and epidemiological studies can account for much of the increased prevalence. However, little attention has been paid to the concrete ways in which clinicians and the child are engaged in the examination process. Attention also needs to be given to what happens after completing the exams with a child; how clinicians consult with one another about their findings, determine a diagnosis, and present that diagnosis to parents and other caretakers. Such considerations should be extended to how family, legal, economic and other factors affect diagnosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three parts to our study corresponding to the three sets of concerns indicated above. The first aim is to do a sociology of testing, understanding the organized social interactions and collaborative skills by which clinicians and children engage in examination tasks. The second aim focuses on the narrations associated with what clinicians have found in testing, the discussion of those findings and attempts resolve any discrepancies among themselves, and the presentation of their diagnostic conclusions to family members and other caretakers such as educators. The third aim is to explore how, in their testing and diagnostic determinations, clinicians and caretakers may orient to social contexts surrounding autism diagnosis including family, legal, educational, administrative, and economic factors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study of interactions in the testing and diagnostic process potentially means better understanding of ability/disability and greater inclusion of ASD individuals in society. It additionally provides for the discovery of unanticipated avenues and future research into the causes, consequences and treatment of ASD. Finally, the project also involves the training of graduate student sociologists as Science and Technology Scholars concerned with ASD.</AbstractNarration>

Our sociology of testing has meant understanding the organized social interactions and collaborative skills by which clinicians and children engage in examination tasks. We have developed two&nbsp;interrelated concepts relevant to diagnostic testing. One is the &ldquo;interactional&nbsp;substrate,&rdquo; which refers to all the&nbsp;activities that a clinician and child&nbsp;engage in with one another to be able to generate a desired testing outcome&nbsp;(i.e. a score). The other is &ldquo;concrete competence,&rdquo; which&nbsp;refers to the&nbsp;practices that are part of the interactional substrate and indicate how a child&nbsp;orients to the tasks set before him or her. For the most part, concrete competence&nbsp;does not get measured, even though it&rsquo;s necessary for a child to deploy such&nbsp;competence in order to perform any task that the clinician and test require,&nbsp;and&nbsp;regardless of whether the child is able to perform the task (i.e., get it &ldquo;right&rdquo;).</p> <p>&nbsp;2. Our sociology of diagnosis show how, through narrating what their tests have found, and considering other sources of information on a child (such as interviews with parents), clinicians discuss findings and resolve any discrepancies among themselves, and then present their diagnostic conclusions to family members and other caretakers such as educators. We found that and analyze a narrative structure for determining ASD diagnosis. The narrative structure for diagnosis is depicted in Figure 1.</p> <p><strong>Figure 1 Narrative Structure for Diagnosis in Interaction</strong></p> <p>A.

For example, although both tendency and instantiation story types can be probative or evidential for autism diagnosis, instantiation stories have unique qualities that bear further investigation. In addition, although we have expertise in studying and analyzing the important details of social interaction, we lack&nbsp;the expertise to determine the relevance of interaction studies for enhancing diagnosis and the associated recommendations for a child and his or her experiences at home, school, or elsewhere. Consequently, we are partnering with scholars who have more clinical experience working with individuals on the autism spectrum, and others who have expertise in instrument design, to see how our research endeavors can have practical impacts and enlarge the capacities of both persons with ASD and the different social groupings to which they belong.</p> <p>As we continue, we also keep our sights on making our research relevant to science and technology studies, both theoretical and empirically.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/05/2018<br>      Modified by: Douglas&nbsp;W&nbsp;Maynard</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257065/1257065_10235973_1530829817597_ADOSTanner--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257065/1257065_10235973_1530829817597_ADOSTanner--rgov-800width.jpg" title="A Child Being Tested for ASD"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257065/1257065_10235973_1530829817597_ADOSTanner--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A Child Being Tested for ASD"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A psychologist administers the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule to a 6-year-old</div> <div class="imageCredit">Douglas Maynard</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Douglas&nbsp;W&nbsp;Maynard</div> <div class="imageTitle">A Child Being Tested for ASD</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257065/1257065_10235973_1530829916498_PreStaff_Tanner--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257065/1257065_10235973_1530829916498_PreStaff_Tanner--rgov-800width.jpg" title="&quot;Pre-staffing&quot; after testing is done"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257065/1257065_10235973_1530829916498_PreStaff_Tanner--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="&quot;Pre-staffing&quot; after testing is done"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The psychologist and a developmental pediatrician,who also examined the boy,discuss their findings anddecide on diagnosis.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Douglas Maynard</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Douglas&nbsp;W&nbsp;Maynard</div> <div class="imageTitle">"Pre-staffing" after testing is done</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257065/1257065_10235973_1530830046384_Staff_Tanner--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257065/1257065_10235973_1530830046384_Staff_Tanner--rgov-800width.jpg" title="&quot;Staffing&quot; or interview with parents"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257065/1257065_10235973_1530830046384_Staff_Tanner--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="&quot;Staffing&quot; or interview with parents"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The psychologist presents the results to the family.
