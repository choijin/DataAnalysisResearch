<AbstractNarration>The availability of landmass plays a key role in the diversification of terrestrial lineages through evolutionary time. How geological dynamism affects the inference of evolutionary history of a biogeographic theater is poorly understood. To address how geological history affects a specific function of phylogenetic informativeness that is required to infer evolutionary history, a combination of (1) modeling effects of geology on simulated phylogenies; and (2) empirical hypothesis testing with phylogenies drawn from a geologically dynamic theater, Southeast Asia, is proposed. Progress on this question will inform understanding of biotic distributions and elucidate methods by which informative phylogenetic markers can be identified for individual biogeographic theaters. The relationship between geological history and phylogenetic informativeness occurs at the intersection of biology, geology, and mathematics. Addressing this problem requires both biological expertise to understand the context (taxon distribution and phylogenetic inference) and mathematical training in numerical modes of analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include development of education material suitable for both undergraduates and school groups on phylogenetic reconstruction of evolutionary history, which will incorporate a perspective on geological history informed by the results of the proposed research. Modeling and biogeography teaching modules developed for an interdisciplinary undergraduate course in the third year of the program will be freely distributed through the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the City University of New York. The proposed modeling software will be distributed for students and researchers alike through the American Museum of Natural History to explore the effects of geological events on simulated phylogenies.</AbstractNarration>

In the course of the three years of this project, both simulation studies and empirical phylogenomic studies were undertaken to study how geology affects inference of range evolution.     Major scientific outcomes of the project:  1) A simulation study demonstrated that geological turbulence (e.g., marine incursions) have the potential to reduce the inferable crown group age of endemic groups, i.e., create "broomstick handle" taxa (groups with young crown ages and ancient origins, which can be problematic to place reliably in molecular phylogenies). Examples of such groups include horseshoe crabs and tuataras. This study bore directly on the biogeographic literature surrounding the age of New ZealandÆs biota; this work demonstrated that taxa with apparently young crown group ages, but pre-Oligocene origins, are not dispositive of a scenario of a young endemic biota (such taxa could represent remnants of an older biota that predates geological turbulence).  2) Empirical phylogenomic studies were undertaken for two major groups: the subphylum Chelicerata and the arachnid order Scorpiones, with the latter study constituting the first molecular phylogeny of all scorpions.
