<AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative project (1212806, Ross T. Whitaker, University of Utah; 1212501, Donald H. House, Clemson University; 1212577, Mary Hegarty, University of California-Santa Barbara; 1212790, Michael K. Lindell, Texas A&amp;M University Main Campus) is to establish the computational and cognitive foundations for capturing and conveying the uncertainty associated with predictive simulations, so that software tools for visualizing these forecasts can accurately and effectively present this information about to a wide range of users. Three demonstration applications are closely integrated into the research plan: one in air quality management, a second in wildfire hazard management, and a third in hurricane evacuation management. This project is the first large-scale effort to consider the visualization of uncertainty in a systematic, end-to-end manner, with the goal of developing a general set of principles as well as a set of tools for accurately and effectively conveying the appropriate level of uncertainties for a range of decision-making processes of national importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary impact of this work will be methods and tools for conveying the results of predictive simulations and their associated uncertainties, resulting in better informed public policy decisions in situations that rely on such forecasts.  Scientific contributions are expected in the areas of simulation and uncertainty quantification, visualization, perception and cognition, and decision making in the presence of uncertainty. Results will be broadly disseminated in a variety of ways across a wide range of academic disciplines and application areas, and will be available at the project Web site (http://visunc.sci.utah.edu).   The multidisciplinary nature of the research and the close integration of the participating research groups will provide a unique educational environment for graduate students and other trainees, while also broadening the participation in computer science beyond traditional boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has developed novel applications of cognitive theory for improving and evaluating human understanding of hurricane forecast visualizations. The investigators characterized how visual features of uncertainty displays influence decisions, including the effects of addition background knowledge. This greater understanding of the cognition of uncertainty visualization has the potential to inform principles of visualization design and affect the way complex weather forecasts are communicated to the public.  This project has also resulted in new knowledge about effective characteristics of color maps through observed discrepancies between visualization guidelines and what people do in practice. Specifically, work with meteorologists revealed extensive use of discrete color maps as well as spectral color schemes, both of which challenge existing visualization design dogma. Follow-up perceptual studies revealed benefits of discrete color maps for a number of data analysis tasks, as well as a more nuanced understanding of how people perceive rainbow color maps.      This project has made significant developments in new methods for the analysis and display of ensembles of complex data.   For this, the investigators have extended the notions of rank statistics and box plots to contours, curves, graphs, and high dimensional point sets.   This technology has applications in fields that make predictions under uncertainty, such as ensemble forecasting of weather, as in the case of hurricanes.   Figure 1 shows a curve box plot of an ensemble forecast of a hurricane track, which is an analytical alternative to the qualitative cone of uncertainty.        The ability to quantify the depth or centrality of a point within an ensemble has implications for a wide range of applications that entail analysis of large collections of data.  For instance, in social networks, investigators in security and social science often want to visualize how close (or connected) one person or actor is to another but also understand how central an actor is within a network.   By quantifying centrality (in the form of rank statistics) and including this quantity in graph layout people can see both central and well-connected actors. Figure 2 shows such a layout for a network of actors associated with the 2004 bombing plot in Spain.   Here we can see that the leaders of the network are interacting with (close to, in the graph) only a few people and that those people are, in turn, central in the graph, making them conduits through which information flows between other actors, such as suppliers and operatives.      Part of this project dealt with also risk assessment and how people interpret warnings.  The National Weather Service warns people at risk from tornadoes by using warning polygons that divide the map into two areas; people inside the polygon should shelter and people outside it should not. A series of studies has shown that people who are shown a warning polygon misinterpret the location of greatest danger as being at the polygon?s center rather than at the edge nearest the storm cell.   Experiments in this project found that people have more appropriate expectations of being struck by a tornado when warning polygons are shown in their natural context of radar images than when the warning polygons are presented in isolation (Figure 3). Gradient displays appear to provide no additional benefit because people naturally infer that the level of risk varies continuously with distance from the storm system even when the NWS polygons divide the risk area into two categories. The fact that people?s expectations of being struck by a tornado at different distances from the storm cell had positive correlations with both sheltering (a generally appropriate response) and evacuation (a generally inappropriate response), which provides experimental confirmation that people threatened by actual tornadoes are conflicted about which protective action to take.
