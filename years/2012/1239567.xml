<AbstractNarration>As computing devices continue to be embedded in more and more physical devices, they are now privy to the most confidential information about our lives. The ability to safely keep a secret in memory is central to the vast majority of security systems, but storing and erasing these secrets is a difficult problem in the face of an attacker who can obtain unrestricted physical access to these devices and the underlying hardware. Depending on the memory technology, the very act of storing a 1 instead of a 0 can have physical side effects measurable even after the power has been cut. Through the development of a new class of architectures that measurably increase the difficulty of physical analysis this project is enabling systems that can be trusted even when physical control of the system is ceded to an adversary. Initial results indicate that the creation of an efficient scheme for memory protection is possible under which, even if an adversary is able to inspect the value of a stored bit with a probabilistic error of only 5%, the system will be able to prevent that adversary from learning any information about the original un-coded bits with 99.9999999999% probability. Over the long term this research will help to create the skills and tools that cyber-physical system engineers will need to develop pervasive trustworthy systems, and to ease the development of those mission critical systems that we all depend on for our safety and livelihood.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  As computing devices continue to be embedded in more and more physical devices, they are now privy to the most confidential information about our lives including our personal lives, our medical history, and our finances. While smart phones, laptops, and smart cards are just a few of the devices that are expected to store and perform transactions on secret information on a daily basis, we are increasingly ceding control of our homes, our infrastructure, and our transport to machines.  As individual nodes in these complex networks are empowered to affect change with the intention of creating more efficient, safe, or affordable operation, the potential for compromised or counterfeit systems to do harm increases many fold. Furthermore, as computing devices leave the relative safety of our pockets and desks for the world at large they become susceptible to new and more poorly understood methods of compromise. The basic ability to operate on secret keys is central to vast majority of cyber-physical security schemes, but storing and erasing these secrets is a difficult problem in the face of an attacker who can obtain unrestricted physical access to the underlying hardware.  Digital memory stores values as either a "0" or a "1" and the system and typically one things that once the bits are deleted from the memory they are gone forever.  However, depending on the memory technology, the very act of storing a 1 instead of a 0 can have physical side effects measurable long in the future even if we expect that those values have been deleted. These side effects cannot be hidden easily, and if the secret stored on chip is of sufficient value (such as a special key that unlocks all your banking information or some bits used to lock a very secret file), an attacker may go to seemingly extraordinary means to learn even a few bits of that information.  If we are to create systems that can be safely and securely embedded into physical systems the world over, we need to be able to trust them even when we do not have the ability to physically monitor them continuously.  The primary outcome of this project was a careful characterization of these types of attacks and a set of new technologies that help thwart them.   However, solving this problem required a new class of computer systems that increase the difficulty of these attacks in a way that can be independently measured.  The creation of such a class of systems enables the computer system to be trusted even when the system is in the hands of an attacker (such as if an cell phone is stollen). The first step towards this goal was to focus on one of the two computational backbones of any cyber-physical system: memory (the other one being logic).  Building on a series of careful studies that helped the investigators understand memory error, a set of  "wear-out" attacks were measured with respect to the amount of leakage they have over time.  In addition to helping to train numerous graduate students in advanced cybersecurity techniques (where many of those graduate students are now gainfully employed bringing those techniques to practice in industry), the publication of several influential papers that help guide engineers toward more secure designs, a set of tools for designing and analyzing secure hardware was made available.
