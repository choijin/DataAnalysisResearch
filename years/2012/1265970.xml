<AbstractNarration>A new site is to be planned at Oregon State University for the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for e-Design. The I/UCRC for e-Design conducts research that supports a new design paradigm for the development of engineered products and systems that allows customer driven design and product realization and virtual simulation and prototyping that encompasses the entire product life cycle.  The planned Oregon State site will complement the existing center?s activities through focus in the following areas: 1) optimization of products and systems, 2) failure, reliability, and robustness analysis; 3) early stage design theories and methodologies, 4) manufacturing and lifecycle analysis, 5) cost and choice modeling; 6) design for sustainability; 7) computational design; and 8) design innovation education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The e-Design center addresses an area central to the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing.  The center site at Oregon State University has the potential to further expand the diversity of member companies in the overall center and expose all member firms to a broader base of discovery in the e-Design area.  Results of the site?s research efforts will be integrated into the educational curriculum in design, modeling and simulation, decision analysis, and optimization. Student engagement in center work will include laboratory and field studies, attendance of and presentations at interdisciplinary conferences and workshops, a design colloquium series, participation in interdisciplinary activities and journal publications, as well as training in the ethical conduct of research. The addition of Oregon State University to the Center contributes to the diversity of the Center, with the leadership team and 30% of participating faculty being women, typically underrepresented in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award was a planning grant to support for the addition of Oregon State University (OSU) as a full university member research site in the existing multi-university I/UCRC Center for e-Design.  The major goal of this planning grant was for OSU to plan and hold a meeting with a number of industrial, university, and government representatives with a purpose to inform participants about the benefits and policies of membership in the multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center.    The primary contribution of the OSU team will include be in the three following areas: 1) System Design Analysis and Optimization, 2) Decision Analysis; 3) Computational Design and Innovation.  From these areas, 15 potential projects have been selected initially (with more under discussion) that provided the basis for presentations and posters that will be presented at the planning meeting.  These projects draw on significant expertise and many build upon prior work with industry and agencies.  Review of the projects by the industry participants resulted in five of the 15 projects being rated as either High or Medium interest to the companies:  Digital Design and Manufacturing Failure-Resistant Design of Complex Systems Under Uncertainty Effectuation in New Product Development and Design Capturing Existing Corporate Knowledge for Computer-Directed Design Computer-Assisted Geometric Remediation of Part-to-Part Connectivity in the Design of Mechanical Assemblies Design Optimization using Adhesive Bonding   Of the ten industries that were represented at the meeting, five were recruited to join the OSU site of the Center for e-Design.
