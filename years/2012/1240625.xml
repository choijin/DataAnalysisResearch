<AbstractNarration>SRI International (SRI) will design, develop, and validate assessments of computational thinking (CT) for the high school Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum. Partners in this work are ECS developers and teachers, and other experts and stakeholders in computer science (CS), computer science education and assessment. In Year 1, SRI will apply evidence-centered design to refine an existing CT-practices assessment framework and design patterns; begin to design and develop ECS assessment tasks and scoring rubrics; convene an expert panel to review the correspondence between the assessment tasks and design documents; and pilot the tasks and scoring rubrics with a small number of teachers. In Year 2, SRI will use pilot results to design and develop a final set of tasks and to build forms of the unit and summative assessments; convene a second expert panel to review the unit and summative assessment forms; and field test the unit and summative assessment forms and scoring rubrics with a larger number of teachers. Both the pilot test and field test will include cognitive interviews with students to inform and evaluate definitions used in the design. SRI will use assessment scores, response processes, and other validity evidence from the field tests to conduct psychometric evaluation of the unit and summative assessments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ECS curriculum is being used to engage high school students in computer science across the country. As ECS expands to more locations and students, ECS teachers will need high-quality assessments to make valid inferences about students? computational thinking practices. By co-designing formative and summative assessment resources with ECS teachers, SRI will ensure that the resources are useful to teachers. High-quality CT assessment tools and resources will lower barriers for adopting and using the ECS curriculum, as well as other CS curricula, and will pave the way to reporting actionable evidence of student progress and readiness to engage in further learning in the CT practices domain. SRI also expects the PACT project to contribute more broadly to the CS 10K project by providing new CS teachers with accessible and adaptable resources for assessing their students? CT knowledge and skills.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An enduring problem in education is how to obtain accurate measures of student learning. The Principled Assessment of Computational Thinking (PACT) was a research project that designed and studied measures of important ideas and concepts in high school computer science. Led by SRI Education in partnership with the developers of the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) high school curriculum, the project laid the foundation for two strands of work: developing tests for the ECS curriculum and developing reusable templates to help design tests of important computational thinking practices for other middle and high school curricula.  The objectives of the research were to:  identify the concepts and principles for computational thinking in general and specifically for the ECS curriculum, identify the knowledge, skills, and other attributes that make up the concepts and principles of computational thinking practices, organize the concepts, principles, knowledge, skills, and other attributes into reusable design materials that can be used to develop assessments of computational thinking practices, and use the design materials to develop assessments of computational thinking practices taught in the ECS curriculum.  Computational thinking is a way of describing what computer scientists do in their work. Computer scientists represent information and processes symbolically, form abstract solutions to problems at different levels and scales, and apply techniques such as algorithmic thinking, automation, decomposition, modeling, and recursion. The idea of computational thinking goes beyond just programming computers: it requires creativity and critical analysis to design computing products to solve important problems in science and engineering. Computational thinking can help anyone describe a problem to solve or a design to make, and helps organize data, inputs, and outputs in a way that computers can manipulate them. Programming is used to make the solutions and designs operational. Computational thinking practices combine knowledge of computing concepts with application of computing skills. Assessing these practices in the classroom is not easy. To address this challenge, we designed tasks that provide evidence of studentsÆ ability to think computationally. Our method, principled assessment design, involves designing tasks for students in a way that makes it possible to trace what they do (observable behaviors) to claims about what they know and can do. These tasks are a primary outcome of the PACT project. The tasks are packaged into tests for the core units of ECS (Units 1-4) and a cumulative assessment over these 4 units. These assessments were created and piloted with ECS teachers during the 2013/14 and 2014/15 school years.

The assessments and instructions for scoring them will be available to ECS teachers via the CS10k community web site.  Another of PACTÆs important outcomes are design patterns or blueprints that can be used to guide assessment designers in creating new tasks for both the ECS curriculum and computational thinking practices in other curricula. These design patterns carefully define the important constituents of computational thinking, and document features of tasks that will test studentsÆ knowledge and practices gained from specific learning experiences. PACT has created two sets of design patterns. The first is for computational thinking practices in general and the second is specific to the ECS curriculum. Both sets of design patterns emphasize the practice aspects of computational thinking and were developed in consultation with the ECS curriculum authors and experts in assessment, computer science education, inquiry teaching, and t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
