<AbstractNarration>Wetland ecosystems are the largest natural source of methane, a potent and long lasting greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere. Wetland soils in northern latitudes are warming faster than those in temperate and tropical regions. An understanding of the influence and feedback that these northern wetland ecosystems play in the present and future climate is needed. Accomplishing this may only be done through linking newly developed technologies that measure and quantify the processes of methane emissions on a local scale with modeling efforts that scale from local studies to the region and continent. This project will collect new measurements and leverage long-term existing data on methane emissions from five well-studied research sites that span four northern climate zones. In addition, the project will use environmental and climate variables developed from remote sensing data collected by several satellites over vast areas of the far north. Using a unique scaling approach, the emissions from northern wetlands will be determined so that a global analysis can be performed. This project will implement new measurement technologies and enable more accurate representation of methane emissions on a global scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the scientific impacts of this project, it will also provide professional development opportunities for both undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers. These postdoctoral researchers will grow, not only as interdisciplinary scientists, but also as mentors and engaged community partners. Through a series of opportunities, the postdoctoral researchers will develop research, communication, leadership and mentoring skills. A partnership with the Northern Ecosystems Research for Undergraduates program (an NSF REU site) will enable the postdoctoral researchers to mentor two undergraduates in summer research experiences, under the guidance of the program director.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Collaborative Research: Investigating northern peatland methane dynamics by synthesizing measurements, remote sensing and modeling from local to regional to continental scales     Background   Wetland ecosystems are the largest natural source of methane (CH4), a strong contributor to greenhouse warming.  Of particular interest are northern wetlands, where peat below the land surface is thought to contain as much as 30% of the global soil carbon. Understanding not only how emissions of methane vary in space and time across these wetland systems, but the cause of those variations continues to be a challenge for modeling and predicting future climate. The goal of this project was to make progress on the general problem of how to better link long-term observations of methane flux to records of environmental and climate changes, in order to model (and hence predict) these emissions at large spatial scales.   Overall project accomplishments and their Intellectual merit   In order to accomplish this goal, our project used data from five well-studied wetland research sites (two core sites where we made many new measurements, plus three validation sites where we used existing data) in four climatic zones.  The five sites were:  (1) temperate: Sallie?s Fen (43.21&deg;N, 71.06&deg;W) in New Hampshire, USA; (2) boreal: Mer Bleue (45.4&deg;N 75.5&deg;W), in Ontario, CA; (3) subarctic: Stordalen Mire (68.37&deg;N, 19.05&deg;E) in Abisko, Sweden and APEX (64.8&deg;N, 148oW) in Fairbanks, AK; and (4) arctic: Zackenberg, Greenland (74.479oN, 20.555oW).    We used measurements (at the two core sites) of methane flux, together with measurements of different kinds (isotopes of 13C vs 12C) of carbon in that methane, to calibrate our process based model, Wetland-DeNitrification and DeComposition (Wetland-DNDC), to allow us to more accurately predict the variability in methane emissions to the atmosphere by better representing how methane is produced, consumed, and transported.  In addition, we used long-term records of methane flux, and environmental and climate data from the three validation sites to validate the model. We are now using the resultant model to scale up to the continent, using mapped biogeographic classes associated with the five focus sites, in concert with Wetland-DNDC environmental drivers (elevation, moisture, phenology), developed using remotely sensed data from satellites and drone flyovers. By integrating meteorological data, a digital map of land surface elevations (DEM), and remote sensing-based observations of soil moisture, we are using soil inundation scenarios at the targeted research sites to drive Wetland-DNDC for calculating CH4 emissions. Wetland-DNDC model runs across continental scales are now providing the first predictions at this large scale, and these are being checked further against atmospheric estimates of methane obtained from NOAA?s CarbonTracker CH4 data product.   Broader Impacts:    This project has trained students (graduate students and undergraduates at several different institutions) and early career scientists, including minorities and women. The project was a provided a solid foundation for a related NSF funded Research Experience for undergraduates program, that provided research experience for 40 undergraduates to do work in a foreign country (Sweden).  Results from this work have also been widely disseminated to communities of interest, through public media, scientific meetings and classrooms.
