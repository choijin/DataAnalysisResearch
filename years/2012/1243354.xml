<AbstractNarration>This research is a component of a broad community experiment named SOAS (Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study) designed to further investigate the photo-oxidation of the emissions (biogenic volatile organic compounds; BVOCs) of plants in the context of the atmospheric environment of the South East United States.  The overall project will investigate the photochemistry of the dominant biogenic alkenes and their oxidation products, during a collaborative field experiment planned for summer, 2013 in Alabama. This site was chosen as a region where substantial BVOCs from vegetation mix and interact with anthropogenic (pollution) compounds, synergistically resulting in the production of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Many questions remain regarding SOA, and how anthropogenic and biogenic compounds interact in its formation in rural atmospheres. For example, a major focus is to determine whether anthropogenic emissions enhance or inhibit biogenic SOA formation, as well as the extent to which either pathway takes place.  A range of advanced mass spectrometric and flow reactor techniques developed by these researchers are powerful tools with which to address such questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOA may compromise a major fraction of submicron sized aerosols, and thus may play important but poorly understood roles in climate forcing, atmospheric visibility, acid deposition, as well as in human health effects.</AbstractNarration>

At the core was participation in the Southern Oxidant &amp; Aerosol Study (SOAS) in Alabama, summer 2013. The site experiences biogenic VOC (BVOC) emissions (from trees) and varying degrees of anthropogenic emissions influence (e.g., NOx, SO2 from cars, power plants), making it an ideal location for studying these scientific questions. SOAS was a highly-collaborative campaign, one of the largest and comprehensive of its kind ever, involving research groups from throughout the US and Europe.  Our group focused on investigating three key aspects of this system: 1) The sources of OA and organic gases; 2) The potential of airmasses to form SOA; 3) The gas/particle partitioning and volatility of OA and organic gases. We deployed a large suite of state-of-the-art gas and aerosol instrumentation. The measurements and analyses spanned a large range conditions including BVOC concentrations, relative humidity, temperature, and key pollution components (VOC, NOx, SO2, acidity, NO3), making it possible to identify key precursors and factors controlling SOA.  To complement the field studies, we participated in a community environmental chamber study (at Caltech) that focused on simulating different aspects of the conditions found during SOAS to investigate chemical mechanisms important to BVOC oxidation, anthropogenic-biogenic interactions, SOA and ozone (O3) formation. We deployed an instrument similar to that used during SOAS, capable of quantifying difficult-to-measure gases important to SOA formation.  The field and laboratory deployment phases were very successful with excellent data quality. Due to the complexity of the data collected, major efforts focused on the quality-control and analysis. Next, the process of synthesis, scientific interpretation, presentation, and publication was pursued.           Key results and findings include:  Aerosol in the SE US summer is dominated by organic molecules and is acidic (due to SO2 emissions). Six OA sources were identified including from biomass burning and different BVOC. The variably in OA sources varied with changing influences of biogenic and anthropogenic emissions. Potential for aerosol formation was quantified for the three major atmospheric oxidants: OH, O3, NO3, all of which depend on anthropogenic emissions.  The first comprehensive comparison of real-time measurements of gas/particle partitioning was reported, and was shown to respond rapidly to temperature changes.  A global survey of a recently-discovered SOA source (IEPOX-SOA from isoprene, at low-NOx and on acidic aerosol) was conducted showing its global ubiquity in less-polluted forested areas. A new method to measure it with common instrumentation was developed. It was shown that IEPOX-SOA should have a long lifetime in the atmosphere ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
