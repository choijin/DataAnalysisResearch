<AbstractNarration>The award provides support to defray the expenses of  US participants in "The Corona Problem: Connections between Operator Theory, Function Theory and Geometry", which will be held June 18-22, 2012, at the Fields Institute for Research in the Mathematical Sciences in Toronto (Canada). The Corona Problem is a fundamental question in complex analysis that has connections with operator theory, function theory and geometry.  A version of the problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a collection of bounded analytic functions on a domain to generate the whole algebra as an ideal. Even though it is an abstract mathematical question, this problem has found interesting connections with questions in engineering via control theory.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funding for this conference will be used to pay for the expenses of US based participant support, with priority given to graduate students, post-docs, younger faculty, members of underrepresented groups, and those without their own source of funding.  This meeting will bring together researchers in operator theory, function theory, complex geometry and several complex variables to discuss recent advances related to Corona Problem and in particular the overlap between these areas of analysis. The workshop will be an opportunity to attract some of the leading experts in function theory, several complex variables and harmonic analysis together to discuss this question and related research questions of interest.  This workshop will create an environment in which students and early career researchers could profit from the interaction with such top experts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The scientific theme of the workshop ``The Corona Problem:  Connections between Operator Theory, Function Theory and Geometry'' centered around the corona problem and its interactions with the areas of analytic function theory, operator theory, harmonic analysis, several complex variables, and complex geometry.  In recent years, there has been a flurry of research activity on the corona problem, and this workshop provided a venue by which experts in the area could interact and has led to further collaborations and interactions among these areas.  Intellectual Merit  The last few years have seen tremendous progress on the corona problem in one and several variables.  The workshop was an opportunity to attract some of the leading experts in function theory, several complex variables and harmonic analysis together to discuss this question and related research questions of interest.  Finally, as the first workshop on this problem, it was possible to highlight numerous interactions between the corona problem and other areas of analysis.  Broader Impacts and Educational Benefits  The organizers of the conference were committed to supporting the participation of women, minorities, and young researchers.  This proposal provided participant support and funded advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D.s, allowing them to attend this major conference on analysis, discuss new ideas, and interact and learn from the many other mathematicians in attendance.  This workshop created an environment in which students and early career researchers were able to profit from interaction with such top experts.  As an example of the benefit of this interaction, Kelly Bickel has now been recruited to Georgia Tech as a postdoctoral fellow to work with PI Wick.   There are additional educational benefits that are an outgrowth of this workshop.  Results from this conference were disseminated via the Fields Institute website.  All conference presentations and lectures from this workshop were audio-taped and then posted on the web, together with scanned slides or powerpoint versions of the presentations (if available).  Moreover, the Organizers are currently preparing a conference proceedings based on the events of the workshop.  This proceedings will be submitted to the Communications in Mathematics series published by the Fields Institute.  A majority of the articles in this conference proceedings will be from participants in the corona workshop at Fields.    Additionally, the Organizers are writing a historical survey article about the corona problem.  Finally, the organizers are aware of at least one publication that has already been written because of the workshop at Fields.
