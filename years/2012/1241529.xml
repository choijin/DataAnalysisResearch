<AbstractNarration>The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) Project is designing and planning to construct and operate a 30-&lt;br/&gt;meter diameter optical/infrared telescope with fully integrated adaptive optics to lead the next generation&lt;br/&gt;of telescopes with observation at the diffraction limit of its large aperture. TMT science goals address the&lt;br/&gt;recommendations of the last two US decadal surveys of astronomy  and astrophysics that gave high priority to the science that can be accomplished by a giant segmented mirror telescope. Sited on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, TMT will be the only such telescope in the northern hemisphere. TMT is a collaboration of California Institute of Technology, University of California, the Association of Canadian Universities for Research in&lt;br/&gt;Astronomy, the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, a consortium of Chinese institutions led by&lt;br/&gt;the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and institutions in India&lt;br/&gt;supported by the Department of Science and Technology of India. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five-year planning activity supported by this award will lead to a US astronomy community science plan, an integrated science and education plan, proposals for US groups to collaborate in TMT science instruments, a US operations plan, and a US TMT data management plan. Activities under this award will include a series of joint TMT US-international Forums and annual workshops and Town Halls at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Three representatives of the NSF-supported astronomy community will become members of the TMT Collaborative Board, assuring a US role in shaping the project and its implementation. A US TMT Science Advisory Group will engage the US community in developing the science plan, and three members of the Group will join the TMT Science Advisory Committee, assuring input by the US community in guiding the TMT science program and interaction with other TMT astronomy communities. A TMT Education and Public Outreach Advisory Board will focus the broad expertise and interest in stakeholder communities in developing an integrated plan to leverage TMT science in education, work force development and other broader impacts of TMT in society.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TMT will engage the US astronomy community in their formulation of plans to exploit TMT scientific&lt;br/&gt;opportunities and to integrate TMT into the US optical/infrared observing system. By joining with TMT,&lt;br/&gt;the US astronomy community will be able to build on the substantial scientific synergy of national and&lt;br/&gt;international observatories already located on Mauna Kea and enjoy new opportunities to collaborate with&lt;br/&gt;the international astronomers participating in TMT. TMT will also benefit from the expertise of the US&lt;br/&gt;astronomy community in defining TMT technical systems and future science instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a leading national science resource, TMT will contribute excitement to its host community in&lt;br/&gt;Hawaii, as well as national significance in catalyzing public interest in astronomy, science and&lt;br/&gt;technology. Building upon the project's existing plans in Hawaii, TMT will engage the US community&lt;br/&gt;and education stakeholders in planning a broader US education and work force development program&lt;br/&gt;under the guidance of an Education and Public Outreach Advisory Board.  Sited in the center of the Pacific Ocean, TMT's unprecedented observational power will serve as a catalyst for collaboration among scientists in the Pacific Rim astronomy communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In response to solicitation NSF 12-526,  NSF will engage with the TMT Project to plan a partnership model for the TMT Observatory which, depending on circumstances, the NSF may join at some later date.</AbstractNarration>

The first activity of the CA was to establish a working partnership between TMT Observatory Corporation and the National Science Foundation?s (NSF?s) National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO).

An overarching theme of these activities has been to engage the wider US astronomy community in the TMT planning process and in the refinement of the TMT science case, with flow-down from research objectives to science requirements, and then further to engineering and technical requirements.  There have been a number of activities and outcomes associated with the CA:  Representation of the US community in TMT Project governance and scientific planning through membership in the TMT International Observatory (TIO) Board of Governors and the TMT Science Advisory Committee; Formation of a US TMT Science Working Group to provide an interface to the US at-large community and to represent its interests for participation models; Planning and execution of six TMT Science Forum meetings, with extensive participation by US-at-large community members supported by this CA; Participation in the TMT International Science Development Teams (ISDTs) by approximately 70 scientists from US institutions outside the current TMT partners; Engagement of US community scientists in writing a new TMT Detailed Science Case; Development of a draft Participation Plan and Business Plan that has been submitted to NSF; Participation in development of the TIO workforce development, education and public outreach and communications plan; Presentations at Splinter Sessions or Open Houses at six American Astronomical Society Winter Meetings; and Publication of numerous articles and status reports in the NOAO Newsletter.      The resulting scientific case for the TMT is documented in the TMT Detailed Science Case, in presentations at the TMT Forums, and in the Draft Participation Plan that was developed by the US TMT Science Working Group supported by this CA. The development of this case has involved more than 250 US astronomers and has significantly focused the identification of new capabilities and programs required to make breakthrough discoveries in a broad range of science fields. These new capabilities and programs are embedded in the planning for the TMT.  TMT Detailed Science Case  Much of the science case and capabilities planning that accompanied that development can be found the 2015 TMT Detailed Science Case:  Skidmore et al. 2015, RAA, 15, 1945 ? http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015RAA....15.1945S  AAS Meetings  TMT and NOAO have partnered to host a Splinter Meeting or Town Hall meeting at each of the winter meetings since 2013. The objectives were to inform the US astronomy community about the TMT status and science potential and to provide information and receive feedback about possibly models for broad US participation in the TMT partnership.  TMT Science Forum  A new activity that was an important part of this Cooperative Agreement was an annual meeting that brought the entire TIO partnership and the US at-large community to discuss significant aspects of the project and future science programs. This was called the TMT Science Forum. A total of six were carried out during the duration of the CA.
