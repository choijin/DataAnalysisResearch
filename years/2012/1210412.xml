<AbstractNarration>This dissertation research seeks to understand how brain anatomy correlates with task-specialization within ant societies. The research develops a model experimental system of acacia ants, which nest symbiotically in hollow spines of acacia plants, feed on food produced by the plant, and in return protect the plant. Acacia ants are ideal for this study because workers are similar in shape but exhibit distinct behavioral groups that are specialized on different tasks critical for the coordinated functioning of the society. The research specifically tests (1) whether task-specialization correlates with different brain structures; and (2) how society size affects the behavioral and neuro-anatomical specialization among workers. The research contributes to the understanding of animal sociality. The research will be the first to use multiple behavioral groups of an ant species to explore the links between brain and behavior, while controlling for worker morphology. The study will also provide insights into the poorly understood brain anatomy of ants that rely heavily on visual stimuli and visual communication. The investigations involve collaborating researchers in Panama, Costa Rica, and the USA, as well as field sites in Costa Rica and Panama. As part of the research, the doctoral trainee is supervising the Master's thesis of a female student from the Universidad de Costa Rica. Undergraduate students from the University of Texas and a high school student are digitally reconstructing brain anatomy. The trainee also disseminates research results through regular presentations to students, schoolteachers, park rangers, and naturalist guides.</AbstractNarration>
