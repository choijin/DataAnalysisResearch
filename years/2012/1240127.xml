<AbstractNarration>This San Diego State University (SDSU) Noyce Mathematics and Science Master-Teaching Fellowship Program represents a focused and concerted effort to identify effective mathematics and science teachers and provide them with professional development experiences designed to further empower them to improve their practices, serve as mentors for student teachers and novice teachers, and become leaders at their school sites and districts. The program supports the development of Master Teaching Fellows through three research-based phases: (a) the improvement of the Fellows' classroom practices, (b) the development of the Fellows' leadership skills, and (c) the opportunity for the Fellows to continue to grow while they serve as mentors and teacher leaders.  The partners are: SDSU College of Sciences, the SDSU College of Education, the nonprofit organization San Diego Science Alliance, three high-needs school districts  and a public-private venture with Qualcomm, Inc.'s commitment to support 10 of the 32 Master Teaching Fellows' $10,000 stipends resulting in a corporate-sponsored grant of $500,00 to the project. The Co-PIs support and investigate changes in the Master Teaching Fellows' classroom practices and development as teacher leaders. The project builds on previous work and is designed to support teachers in targeted ways through three research-based phases, recruitment of strong, effective mathematics and science teachers and investigate their changes in classroom practice and in becoming teacher leaders. Long range sustainability is programmed as SDSU's student teachers are to be placed with the Master Teaching Fellows, providing, year after year, opportunities for SDSU's student teachers (long after grant expiration) to receive support consistent with their credential programs.</AbstractNarration>

These Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) were chosen through a rigorous application and interview process. The project leaders aimed to inspire and support the MTFs in two key areas: improvement of classroom practices and development of leadership skills.&nbsp; The five-year fellowship met both goals as determined through analyses of measures of classroom teaching effectiveness and increases in the type and number of leadership activities of the MTFs. MTFs supported more than 150 student teachers in the teacher credential program at SDSU and collectively provided some form of teacher-leadership experience almost 500 times. By design, the program has had the intended far-reaching, multiplicative impact on the teaching of mathematics and science in the San&nbsp;Diego region. Over the 5-year fellowship, the MTFs and teachers who received their support reached more than 200,000 students through their mathematics and science teaching. The MTFs will continue to motivate an ever-growing circle of teachers and their students through providing inspirational, innovative programs.</p> <p>Teacher leaders are critical resources for improving schools because they support excellent teaching and promote exceptional student learning.

The MTFs exhibited statistically significant differences with large effect sizes on this major component of effective teaching: Professional Noticing of Students' Mathematical Thinking.

Teacher leaders are critical resources for improving schools because they support excellent teaching and promote exceptional student learning. We developed mathematics and science teacher leaders who now work to influence colleagues, principals, and other members of their school communities with an aim of increasing student learning.  Scope of Impact Local Educational Community  The MTFs in the Project LEARN program made, and will continue to make, a difference to an ever-growing circle of teachers and their students. MTFs served as guide teachers for more than 150 student teachers in the teacher credential program at SDSU.  MTFs collectively provided some form of professional development to more than 2,000 teachers across five high-needs districts. Over the 5-year fellowship, the MTFs and those teachers who received their support reached more than 200,000 students through their mathematics and science teaching. MTFs taught 24 university courses for prospective and practicing teachers, all while teaching full-time as K-12 classroom teachers.  Professional and Academic Community  MTFs presented their work more than 90 times at local, state, and national conferences. For example, several Science MTFs gave presentations at the National Science Teachers Association conference and several Math MTFs have presented at the California Mathematics Council Conference. Three PhD students participated in the project by producing original research, helping plan and present professional development, visiting the MTFs' classrooms, and speaking at conferences. Two of the students have graduated and their dissertation research was focused on the Master Teaching Fellows' classroom practices. The third graduate student is also planning her research around the Fellows' practices.  Leadership Successes  MTFs have served in leadership positions that include Department Chair, Science/Mathematics Resource Teacher, Support Provider for Beginning Teachers, MESA (Mathematics, Engineering and Science Achievement) Advisor, Curriculum-Writing Team Member, District Math Curriculum Specialist, TK-12 District Science Resource Teacher, District Standards Implementation Director, Research Partner to help increase the number of Latinas in STEM fields. MTFs have become teacher leaders who have collectively led almost 500 teacher-leadership experiences for prospective and practicing teachers. For example, two MTFs serve as school-site leaders, supporting all teachers at their site with ongoing professional development focused on Professional Noticing of Students' Content-Specific Ideas.  Measurable Growth  MTFs grew in many ways, and here we provide evidence of change with one especially critical teaching practice: Professional Noticing of Students' Mathematical Thinking.  Because of the well-established research base that teachers who make sense of and build on their students' ideas during instruction are better able than their peers to advance their students' mathematics learning, our leadership team focused much of its work on helping MTFs to attend to, interpret, and decide how to respond to their students' mathematical ideas.  Further, in a cross-sectional study, LaRochelle (2018) compared the Professional Noticing of a group of 30 experienced, practicing mathematics teachers to the Noyce Mathematics MTFs after 4 years of sustained professional development (see Image 1, Professional Noticing Comparison). The MTFs exhibited statistically significant differences with large effect sizes on this major component of effective teaching: Professional Noticing of Students' Mathematical Thinking. This cross-sectional finding is one of many that demonstrates that the MTFs' practices were more refined than their non-MTF peers on a meaningful classroom practice that supports students' mathematical learning. Program Sustainability  This program will have ongoing impact on teachers and students in the region because the MTFs will continue to serve their own students, support student teachers, and influence the teaching practices of colleagues and other school personnel across the region. These MTFs will continue to serve as thoughtful and effective teachers and teacher leaders for years to come.            Last Modified: 11/01/2019       Submitted by: Lisa L Lamb]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
