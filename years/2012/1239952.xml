<AbstractNarration>The College of Science and Technology, the College of Education, the Savannah-Chatham Public School System (SCCPSS) and the YMCA of Coastal Georgia are collaborating to recruit, build and support cohort communities of STEM undergraduate majors to become teachers using five strategies: 1) attracting and recruiting freshmen and sophomores into teaching, 2) holding workshops for STEM faculty to provide them with the expertise to advise students on the career of teaching, 3) providing scholarships for junior and senior STEM majors planning to become teachers, 4) creating future teacher professional learning communities (FTPLCs) focused on research and best practices in STEM education, and 5) supporting the accelerated MAT year leading to math or science certification at the Middle or Secondary level. The students teach in a high needs school for up to 6 years (2 years for each year of support) and serve as peer-leaders in learning communities at Armstrong and within their school environment. This project is producing 31 highly qualified MAT prepared science and math teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The shortage of math and science teachers in Georgia is critical. The projected need over the next five years is for 88 middle and 91 high school science/math teachers. This project is impacting the need for highly qualified science and math teachers to teach in high needs districts in Savannah and the surrounding areas of southeast Georgia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of Armstrong MASTERS, a collaboration between the College of Science and Technology, the College of Education and Savannah Chatham County Public Schools was to capture the interest of STEM majors and graduates in the field of teaching, develop them into high quality teachers through researched-based professional learning communities, and promote their role as teacher leaders.  Armstrong MASTERS produced 23 new science and math teachers in Southeast Georgia, each having a degree is a STEM field.  One graduated scholar reflects upon career plans.  I plan to make teaching a career. I am not sure if I will pursue becoming a college professor, an administrator, a career master teacher, or a curriculum specialist, but I know I will be one of those. I attribute these goals in part to Noyce and the experiences it helped craft.  Changes in teaching practice and preparation were also reported by scholars, teacher mentors and higher education faculty participants. Survey data revealed six themes connected to changes in classroom practice - 1) research informed teaching, 2) network and community, 3) classroom research, 4) lesson planning, 5) collaboration, and 6) engagement of underserved students.  Two of these themes were mentioned by more than half of all respondents - research informed teaching and collaboration.   Noyce also impacted educator professional practices. Noyce scholars mentioned network and community most often as the positive impact on their profession. Armstrong faculty pointed to involvement in educational research, and teachers most frequently mentioned new opportunities for advancement.   Armstrong MASTERS participation increased educator knowledge and skill. Over two thirds of participating scholars, teachers,  and faculty, indicated increases in each of  knowledge and use of research-based instructional practices, knowledge of educational research, and collaboration outside of their home institution. When disaggregated, scholars in particular reported an increase in three additional areas: understanding of issues affecting high needs districts, familiarity with requirements for teachers, and engagement in a community of teaching scholars.  One scholar reflects:  I developed an appreciation for collaboration and discovered that [it] is vital to teaching in the 21st century. Developing ideas as a group and implementing ideas in the classroom is the best way to address the needs of students ? particularly as those needs become more diverse.  The implementation of Armstrong MASTERS produced a replicable learning community model, Future Teacher Professional Learning Communities (FTPLC).   FTPLCs were built upon the characteristics of K-16 learning communities and enhanced with a focus on educational research and membership which included STEM and education faculty, public school teachers, and Noyce scholars.  This design promoted integration of content, pedagogy, teacher practice, and research into the development of the Noyce scholars. The sharable FTPLC model is comprised of a set of defining characteristics, specific goals, and an FTPLC Toolbox.                Defining Characteristics. FTPLCs were defined by the attributes of professional learning communities which most influence changes in classroom practice. These are: a supportive  environment, shared leadership, collaborative ways of working, effective classroom practice and educational research, and positive group interactions.    Four FTPLC Goals were established to help prepare talented STEM majors to become highly effective teachers and set them on a path for success in teaching in a high needs district through their FTPLC participation.  Engage in research about effective practices in STEM teaching. Observe best practices in action in SCCPSS and Armstrong classrooms. Develop classroom materials tied to curriculum and exhibiting the use of research based practices. Experience teacher/student interaction in a high needs district.   The FTPLC Toolbox supports implementation of the FTPLCs with tools which can be used to foster the development of professional skills, such as lesson planning, collaboration, and using research to inform teaching.   The Article Review Template facilitates skills in reviewing literature and can be used to facilitate a collaborative literature review. Scholars provide a proper citation, write a paragraph including purpose and key findings, document information most relevant to FTPLC work, note strengths and weaknesses, and characterize articles as research, case study, evaluation, review, meta-analysis, theory, application, or instrumentation.  The Classroom Observation Protocol gives direction to the scholars as they observe best practices in classrooms. Scholars document the use of technology, integration of authentic tasks, active learning environments, engagement of underrepresented groups, richness of content, and facilitation of metacognition.  The Noyce FTPLC Lesson Plan Cover Sheet as a checklist of required lesson plan components as well as a feedback mechanism for critical peer review.  This tool ensures the lesson plans describe the use of research-based practices, alignment of content and assessments, and connection to the curriculum standards.   FTPLCs adapted the K-16 Professional Learning Community Rubric, developed and validated by the PRISM project (EHR-0314953) to yield information on learning community maturity.  The rubric assesses progress along five characteristics mentioned above with assessment ratings of beginning, developing, emerging and accomplished.
