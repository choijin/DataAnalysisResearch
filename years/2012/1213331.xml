<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program and the Chemical Catalysis Program support the work of Professor Philip J. Costanzo of California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo towards the preparation of polymeric phase change materials based upon Diels-Alder chemistry.  This research focuses on developing and incorporating new Diels-Alder linkages into thermally-responsive matrix materials that will be used for multiple applications including, responsive guest-host systems, renewable resins and rheological modifiers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides interdisciplinary research training for graduate and undergraduate students.  Outreach programs, which intertwine undergraduate research and teaching, will impact undergraduate students, K-12 students and teachers.  Undergraduates will be involved in the creation and instruction of teaching modules for K-12 students. Through the outreach activities, K-12 participants will be exposed to material science which stimulates their curiosity for science.  The K-12 students are also exposed to a college experience, which can help encourage them to see themselves as college graduates. In addition, Cal Poly undergraduates are given an opportunity to have an early field experience using inquiry based tools. It will also help to refine their knowledge of material and polymer science. Finally, K-12 teachers may increase their content knowledge by attending workshops and increase their available resources via Cal Poly Science Kits for Teachers Library (SKTL), a durable-lending library.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research from the lab of Philip Costanzo at California Polytechnic State University, a primarily undergraduate institution has been supported by the MSN division.  The development of "smart" coatings allows for the fabrication of more functional materials which can reduce cost and waste. For example, the ability to reheal coatings can eliminate scratches which reduce points of corrosion. Additionally, the capacity to easily remove coatings allows for facile maintenance and cleaning.  One example from the research provided by this funding was the utilization of a renewable resource (soybean oil) to prepare an automotive top coat. This type of technology is paramount to reduce our impact upon the environment while still maintaining the advancement of materials for societal needs. We have modified soybean oil to contain Diels-Alder linkages which can be broken and reformed. Thus allowing for a scratch or deformation in a coating to be healed.  Other projects include the creation of materials with responsive and dynamic topology for the improved polymer processing. The ability to change and tune the polymers molecular weight created novel structures and allowed for the development of new materials.  A total of sixteen undergraduate and three MS graduate students completed work on this project including seven women. A total of seven of those students have continued onto PhD graduate programs, with seven other students expected to graduate wthin two years and attend graduate school.
