<AbstractNarration>This workshop, hosted by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and the Institute for Computing in Humanities, Arts and the Social Sciences (I-CHASS), convenes leading practitioners and scholars of innovation to collectively consider how education in the US might be reconfigured to both support and teach innovation as a core curriculum mission, with a focus on STEM education. Workshop participants identify and articulate strategies for creating and sustaining learning environments that promise the development of innovative thinking skills, behaviors and dispositions and that reward students, faculty and administrator for practicing and tuning these skills. A wiki or other private online space will be created where participants will be encouraged to continue discussions or comment further on ideas generated over the course of the workshop. Mapping social networks of and among participants provides insights into how innovation practices are shared and spread across relationships and networks.  Findings from the workshop will be made available to others through a public web site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Radical Innovation Summit brought together twenty-nine educators, researchers, and policy makers, along with several of their co-investigators, two keynote speakers and the Summit organizers for the purpose of brainstorming actionable ideas for "operationalizing innovation" in K&ndash;16 STEM education. The Summit was held in Washington, D.C., June 13-14, 2013. Participants came from across the U.S. and from the U.K., Belgium, Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago, and India.     Anne Balsamo, Dean of the College of Media at the New School for Social Research in New York City, served as facilitator of the Summit. Day one activities included two keynote talks and individual presentations by the participants, during which they shared the work they had been doing around innovation in education. On the second day, participants formed small working groups and spent the first part of the afternoon deliberating on what is radical innovation and what it might look like. Mid afternoon, the entire group came together and each group presented their work for discussion.     A summative evaluation of the event was created that analyzes the Radical Innovation Summit activities, interactions, documents, and outputs, with a focus on the Intellectual Merits and Broader Impacts that were identified in the Summit grant proposal. It describes the Summit format, participants, activities, and participantsÆ comments on these. The evaluation offers a pragmatic perspective on the SummitÆs effectiveness in achieving the organizersÆ goals, meeting participantsÆ expectations, and details its successes and challenges, based on several types of data. Five types of data were gathered and analyzed: (a) observations of Summit proceedings, (b) pre- and post surveys that were given to participants, (c) a Twitter feed during the conference and the Google group that was set up after the two day Summit, (d) social network maps and (e) official Summit documents.     The Summit was most successful in providing the setting for participants to share ideas and to explain to others their forays into creating innovative programs in education. There was a great deal of enthusiasm expressed for expanding on the dialogue begun at the Summit.  The report identifies three significant successes:     Participants came away with ideas to implement in their own teaching practices and, according to their Google Group postings, are becoming innovation evangelists by sharing what they learned with colleagues.  It appears that participants are taking steps towards becoming models or mentors to an extended network of educators, as teachers, researchers, or policy makers.  A third significant success was the cultural exchanges that the Summit made possible. Participants delved into exploring diverse views of what constitutes knowledge and learning, opened the field of who may be considered teachers or learners, and expanded their thinking about where and when learning happens.
