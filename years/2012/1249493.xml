<AbstractNarration>This project is partially supporting the HI-TEC national conference and special forums on technology education within the conference (http://www.highimpact-tec.org/). The forums focus on the identification of critical issues and the challenges of technology education. Importantly these forums are designed to provide necessary feedback to the NSF and other stakeholders to help shape initiatives in response to identified national and global challenges. The forums are expected to engage participants from the ranks of community college educators, technicians, and industry personnel in frank discussions designed to highlight challenges and priorities faced by modern technology education and provide stakeholders information on funding opportunities to support these challenges.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event significantly broadens the impact of the ATE program by engaging new constituencies in STEM and workforce education. One specific objective of this project is bringing students and technicians to the conference to broaden their experience and solicit their feedback concerning skills and competencies needed within the workplace. This conference, more than any other single event, is a highlight and showcase for the Foundation's long-standing efforts and initiatives to support technician education at community colleges.</AbstractNarration>

It attracted over 500 participants each year from 44 states. In a larger sense this project supported the development and production of the HI-TEC national conference on advanced technological education where secondary and post-secondary educators, counselors, industry professionals, trade organizations and technicians can update their knowledge and skills. Jointly produced by 31 ATE centers, the event focused on the preparation needed by the existing and future workforce for companies in the high tech sectors that drive our nation's economy.   Goals:  Provide      knowledge and insights on the current state and future of technological      education. Increase participation in the National      Science Foundation's programs. Showcase technicians from the ATE      program.   Activities:   During the HI-TEC conferences workshops and sessions were developed and presented to help the community be aware of the NSF programs that can support community college education and innovation to prepare the technican workforce  A special session featured technician professionals from different fields who provided insights into their technical education. ATE Centers, who were producers of the conference, were invited to nominate students and technicians for the fellowship support. These technicians and students spoke candidly about their skill preparation in a unique æfishbowl" format where the audience surrounded the seven technicians. The facilitator first drew out comments from each technician regarding their education and work experiences. In the second part the audience was actively engaged with questions and relevant comments.  Outcomes:  The project supported the conference overall. The High Impact Technology Exchange Conference (HI-TEC) is focused on community college educators and stakeholders seeking professional development opportunities, training materials, collaborative ventures, and insights into emerging market trends to develop and advance the technical workforce of the 21st Century. This event held annually, is technically focused and industry endorsed, providing the tools and knowledge required to be a guiding force for the new American workforce.

The conference provides a series of pre-conference workshops featuring hands- on knowledge and skill-building activities. The conference sessions, keynote speakers, awards program, and technology showcase exhibits are all designed to engage and update attendees in the convergence of scientific disciplines and technologies, such as:  Geographic      Information Systems and Agricultural Technology; Information      and Communications Technologies, Biotechnology, and Cyber Security; Manufacturing,      Engineering Technology, and Telecommunications;  Microsystems,      Nanotechnology, and Biotechnology.
