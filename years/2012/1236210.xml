<AbstractNarration>PI: Guliants, Vadim&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1236210&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Cincinnati Main Campus&lt;br/&gt;Title: Experimental and Theoretical Studies of Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis Steps to Produce Novel Liquid Fuels from Biomass&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop new catalytic technologies to produce novel liquid fuels, linear C5-C6 alcohols and ketones, by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived 2-methylfuran (2MF) and dimethylfuran (DMF). The project focuses on elucidating the fundamental relationships between the molecular structure and catalytic function of well-defined model Pt and Pd nanoparticles in 2MF and DMF hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps to produce linear C5-C6 alcohols and ketones selectively.  The research program will address the following fundamental issues: the importance of preferential exposure of specific crystal planes; the roles of crystal size, shape and defects; the nature and number of surface metal sites participating in 2MF and DMF hydrogenation; the influence of the reaction conditions (H2/furan ratio, temperature, pressure); role of catalytic support (e.g., carbon, Al2O3 and SiO2); the impact of equilibria between the ketones and corresponding alcohols on hydrogenation selectivity; the fundamental kinetics and surface reaction mechanism. Additional insights into the mechanism of 2MF and DMF hydrogenation will come from molecular modeling studies employing close-packed (111) and other dominant Pd and Pt surfaces. The molecular structure-reactivity relationships from this research will be used to develop fundamental mechanistic models for 2MF and DMF hydrogenation over metal catalysts, which will assist in the design of improved catalysts, both noble (e.g., Pt, Pd) and base (e.g., Cu, Ni).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will broadly impact on (1) society at large and (2) recruitment of undergraduate and underrepresented students. Society at large is expected to benefit from this research aimed at replacing nonrenewable, fossil fuels from unstable regions with renewable fuels from US-grown biomass. Recruitment of undergraduate and underrepresented students is an integral part of the proposed effort. Junior and senior students will take special project credits towards their technical elective requirements by performing research in the PI?s laboratory. The PI will continue to recruit women via Women in Science and Engineering Program (WISE) and Rowe Center for Women in Engineering at Cincinnati.</AbstractNarration>

We conducted hydrogenation of 2-methylfuran over a series of model catalysts, such as barium-?promoted copper chromite (Ba?/Cu?/Cr)?, Cu?/Cr?/Ni?/Zn?/Fe, copper-ruthenium, platinum, and palladium catalysts. The structural studies confirmed the formation of a mixed oxide in the copper-?chromite catalyst and the presence of small platinum and palladium crystals (&lt;5 nanometers) in the carbon-?supported catalysts.

On the other hand, the palladium catalyst was highly selective in 2-methylfuran ring saturation leading to 2-?methyltetrahydrofuran below 220&deg;C, whereas it became increasingly selective to 2-?pentanone, the ring opening product, at higher temperatures.  Further studies showed that the main reaction over platinum was furan ring opening leading to ketones, while cracked hydrocarbons were also observed. The platinum catalyst displayed high selectivity to 2-?hexanol during 2,5-dimethylfuran hydrogenation below 100&deg;C.  The palladium catalyst exhibited a completely different behavior: a high selectivity to furan ring saturation products and high cracking tendency even at low reaction temperatures.  We propose that the steric hindrance caused by an additional methyl group in the furan ring of 2,5-dimethylfuran affects the mode of furan ring adsorption on the catalytic surface causing a reduction in the extent of cracking reactions.  We also investigated the hydrogenation reaction using alcohols and ketones as a feed, which can be obtained as a result of 2-methylfuran and 2,5-dimethylfuran hydrogenation.  Lastly, the effects of crystal size and shape on the catalytic activity and selectivity were studied for a series of model nanoparticle platinum and palladium catalysts. Fundamental insights into the mechanim of 2-?methylfuran and 2,?5-?dimethylfuran hydrogenation over Pd and Pt catalysts at 90-?220&deg;C were obtained in studies employing deuterium isotope label.  Furan ring saturation over palladium occurred at low temperatures leding to tetrahydrofurans, followed by progressive D exchange in the tetrahydrofuran ring at higher temperatures.  Finally, H?/D exchange occurred in the methyl groups on the tetrahydrofuran ring.  Cleavage of the C-?O bond also occurred over a palladium catalyst at elevated temperatures, which resulted in deuterated ketones, for which all H atoms were exchanged for D.  Alcohols were produced over a platinum catalyst at low temperatures because they are more stable than the corresponding ketones.  D replaced H on all carbon atoms of the furan ring and saturated the O and C atoms of the broken C-?O bond in both deuterated 2-?pentanol and 2-?hexanol.  At low temperatures (90-?105 &deg;C)?, all H atoms in the deuterated alcohols were exchanged for D except for the last two hydrogen atoms on the methyl groups. Further improvements of selective hydrogenation of 2-methylfuran and 2,5-dimethylfuran to corresponding tetrahydrofurans, linear 2-ketones and alcohols were investigated for novel platinum catalysts prepared by atomic layer deposition on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and alumina. Atomic layer deposition is a novel and highly promising method of catalyst synthesis that allows to grow small platinum and other metal nanoparticles by depositing these metals layer by layer. The hydrogenation behavior of sub-nanometer platinum deposited on alumina was influenced by the support acidity. As compared to a commercial supported platinum catalyst, the Pt/MWCNT catalyst contained similarly sized Pt nanoparticles that displayed a broader size distribution and significantly greater catalytic activity leading mostly to n-alkanes rather than oxygenates during hydrogenation of these alkyl-substituted furans.
