<AbstractNarration>BLAST 2013, 2014, 2015&lt;br/&gt;The 2013-2015 BLAST conferences will be the fifth through eighth in a series of yearly meetings devoted to the foundations of mathematics, with the BLAST 2013 meeting being held during August 5 to 9 at Chapman University in Orange, California. The BLAST conference series focuses on Boolean algebra, lattice theory, algebraic logic, general algebra, set theory, and set-theoretic topology.New Mexico State University will host the 2014 meeting and the University of North Texas will host the 2015 meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year this grant will support the participation of 15-20 graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s and 12 speakers. Participation by women and minorities will be actively sought and encouraged. The conference series provides an environment for graduate students and young researchers to learn about new developments in several related areas of the foundations of mathematics and provides them with a venue to showcase their own work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website is at  http://euclid.colorado.edu/~kearnes/blast</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award BLAST 2013, 2014, 2015 supported three conferences in the Foundations of Mathematics in the Rocky Mountain/Western/Midwest United States during the years 2013, 2014 and 2015. The first conference in this grant cycle was held at Chapman University in Orange California. The second conference in this grant cycle was held at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces New Mexico. The third conference in this grant cycle was held at the University of North Texas in Denton Texas.     BLAST stands for Boolean algebra, algebraic Logic, universal Algebra, Set theory and set-theoretic Topology. The conference series, which started in 2007, focuses primarily on the interactions between algebra, logic and set theory. The meetings attract leading researchers from around the world, and they are an essential source of intellectual stimulation for reasearchers in the foundations of mathematics who work in or near the Rocky Mountain, Western, and Midwest areas of the United States.     The defining goals of the BLAST conference series are the following:  (1) Provide a forum for logicians in the mountain/western midwest region to disseminate their work to each other, providing opportunities for collaborations and new lines of research to be developed.  (2) Concentrate on the areas of logic on which researchers in these states work.  (3) Bring leaders in BLAST fields from around the world for the purpose of collaboration. Bring at least one specialist in each of the BLAST fields.  (4) Provide a conference accessible to graduate students and young researchers.  (5) Provide a venue for graduate students and young researchers to showcase their work, provide the opportunity for them to interact with leading researchers in the field, and provide exposure to other areas of logic early in their careers.  (6) Encourage and support participation of underrepresented groups whenever possible.     A unique feature of the BLAST conference series is that it brings together researchers from multiple disciplines within the foundations of mathematics, offers tutorials that acquaint each group with the work of the other groups, and then provides the intimate and friendly atmosphere necessary for true interaction and cross-fertilization of ideas. Each meeting is constructed around a model of 8 invited lecturers, 4 invited tutorial speakers, and typically 20-30 special session speakers. The meetings are attended by professional researchers from around the world, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and they are open to the public. The total number of participants is typically 50-70 persons per meeting.     The BLAST grant provides important financial support for the  participation of junior researchers, students, women, and  underrepresented groups. The BLAST Core Group, who decide the venue and  program each year, also provide professional support for these groups by  actively seeking their participation and by including them in the  program at all levels.     The web page for the BLAST conference series may be found at  http://math.colorado.edu/blast/     The web pages for BLAST 2013, 2014 and 2015 may be found at  https://www.chapman.edu/events/blast-2013/  http://sierra.nmsu.edu/blast2015/  http://math.unt.edu/research/conferences/blast2015unt  At these pages you will find lists of participants, speakers, titles, abstracts, and presentation slides.
