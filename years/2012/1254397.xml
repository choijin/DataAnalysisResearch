<AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Chemistry Division's Synthesis and Catalysis programs are supporting the research of Professor Jennifer M. Schomaker of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Professor Schomaker will develop new allene oxidation methodologies to permit the rapid and flexible syntheses of complex, enantioenriched and densely functionalized amine motifs that are important components of natural products, ligands for catalysis and probes of biological processes.  The first goal of this project is to develop reliable methods for regio- and stereocontrolled allene aziridination to reactive bicyclic methylene aziridine scaffolds.  Second, methods to transform these key intermediates into aminated stereotriads (compounds containing three consecutive heteroatom-bearing chiral carbons) will be developed, providing access to a diverse array of nitrogen-containing building blocks for synthesis.  Finally, the third goal of this project is to apply allene aziridination to the synthesis of jogyamycin, a complex aminocyclopentitol exhibiting potent antibiotic, antitumor, antiprotozoal and antimalarial activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for increasingly chemo- and stereoselective catalysis presents exciting challenges for the development of new synthetic organic methodologies.  Schomaker's work will identify new paradigms in catalysis for the chemoselective construction of carbon-nitrogen bonds. These new modes of catalysis will enable powerful approaches to the synthesis of biologically relevant molecules.  The broader impacts of her work will be realized through collaboration with the PEOPLE program (Pre-College Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence) at UW-Madison. She will identify economically disadvantaged local students early in their high school careers and provide mentored opportunities for research experiences focusing on the development of new synthetic methodologies. Students will have ample time to develop valuable laboratory skills, learn to communicate scientifically in both oral and written forms and participate in seminars to broaden their understanding of the role research plays in addressing important societal concerns.  Students will also employ social media to track their progress and share their experiences with family, friends and classmates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The potency and selectivity of medicinally important molecules relies on the proper spatial orientation of a specific combination of functional groups towards the intended biological target.

The funding from this grant award supported investigations into new, general and operationally simple synthetic methods to access stereochemically complex and densely functionalized amine building blocks from readily available hydrocarbons, thus addressing this challenging problem.     Intellectual merit was demonstrated through advances in our understanding of catalyst-controlled nitrene transfer reactions to enable allenes to be transformed into a diverse array of nitrogenated compounds through highly chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective nitrene transfer reactions as key steps. Tackling the long-standing challenge of accomplishing catalyst control over transition metal-catalyzed nitrene transfer processes led to the development of new classes of silver complexes supported by known and novel N-dentate ligand that were successful in achieving chemo-, site- and enantioselective aziridination and C-H bond amination reactions. The flexibility of the coordination environments available to silver(I) complexes, coupled with their dynamic behavior in solution, offered unique opportunities to both predict and tune which specific site of unsaturation of C-H bond could be converted to a new carbon-nitrogen bond, a step towards achieving the 'holy grail' of catalyst-controlled C-H functionalization.

In addition, allene amination methods have been engaged for the synthesis of modified aminosugars, unnatural amino acids, and analogues of jogyamycin, a natural product with potent anti-malarial and anti-protozoal activities.
