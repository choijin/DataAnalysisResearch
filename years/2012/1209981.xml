<AbstractNarration>This action funds Brian P. Setzler of Georgia Institute of Technology to conduct a research project, entitled "Improving performance and lifetime of automotive hydrogen fuel cells," during the summer of 2012 at Shizuoka University in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.  The host scientist is Dr. Masao Sudoh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to gain a fundamental understanding of the platinum dissolution process, which limits proton exchange membrane fuel cell lifetime and to characterize the transport properties of alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes to understand the impact on performance. The platinum dissolution process is being studied under transient conditions using the rotating ring disk electrode to detect the exact conditions that lead to dissolution. With this knowledge, control algorithms can be implemented to avoid these conditions when possible and maximize the lifetime of the fuel cell. The transport properties of alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes determine the performance of these fuel cells, but for many membranes these properties have not been rigorously studied. This project is determining important characteristics to guide the development of new and better performing membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Japan is a leader in fuel cell technology, and collaboration between U.S. and Japanese researchers will enhance research in both countries in an important field for the future of energy.</AbstractNarration>
