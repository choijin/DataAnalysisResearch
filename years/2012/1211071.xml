<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a next-generation socio-computational citizen science platform that combines the efforts of human classifiers with those of computational systems to maximize the efficiency with which human attention can be used. Dealing with the flood of digital data that confronts researchers is the fundamental challenge of twenty-first century research.  New techniques, tools and strategies for dealing with massive data sets, whether they consist of vast numbers of base-pair DNA sequences or terabytes of data from all-sky astronomical surveys, present an opportunity to establish a new paradigm of scientific discovery, but the task is not easy. In many areas of research, the relentless growth of data sets has led to the adoption of increasingly automated and unsupervised methods of classification. In many cases, this has led to degradation in classification quality, with machine learning and computer vision unable to replicate the successes of human pattern recognition. The growth of citizen science on the web has provided a temporary solution to this problem, demonstrating that it is possible to recruit hundreds of thousands of volunteers to make an authentic contribution to results, boosting human analysis through the collective wisdom of a crowd of classifiers. However, human classifiers alone will not be able to cope with expected flood of data from future scientific instruments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be carried out by a partnership between computer and social scientists, addressing research problems both in automated data analysis and social science through systems implementation, alongside field research and experiments with project participants.  The intellectual merit of this project lies in its contribution to advancing knowledge and understanding in multiple domains of science. First, the work will contribute to developing new methods of computational data analysis, initially with analysis of astronomical images, and later extending to additional fields. Second, the project includes social science research to test and apply theories of human motivation and learning in an online context, which can then be applied to a broad range of social-computational problems. By mixing human and computational elements, the planned system has the potential to transform the application of citizen science and its approach to data analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance science while promoting teaching, training and learning. One of the most significant broader impacts for its citizen science activities is enabling a community of hundreds of thousands of volunteers to participate in research, a powerful and rapidly developing form of informal science education.   By choosing the relatively generic topic of image classification, beginning with astronomy but not limited to that field of science, the techniques developed under this grant will be of significant value to future investigations in similar research areas, thus enhancing the infrastructure for research and education.</AbstractNarration>

Overall Project Goals accomplished in collaboration with collaborator PI Laura Trouille at Zooniverse:  Goal 1: Develop a new platform for humans and machines to work in concert.  Goal 2: Be more efficient with the human attention that we already receive.  Goal 3: Improve human performance.  Goal 4: Increase the number of contributors and their engagement.     This project has directly supported the publication of 25 peer-reviewed journal and conference proceedings and 2 dissertation projects. It has supported the training of 4 PhD students, 2 Master students and 4 REU Undergraduate students and given them all rich research experiences.  Intellectual Merit:  The project has contributed the field of information systems with a better understanding of the nature of technologies to support learning and motivation in citizen science in particular and online crowed sourced environments in general. The notion of practice proxies helps us explain how one can facilitate learning in online environment and virtual organizations where it is not possible to make all work by collaborators visible to newcomers. This will allow us to better structure the learning and socialization of new members in different virtual organizations where access to others people?s practices varies depending on the nature of work. Furthermore, out work with Zooniverse trace data has led to innovative blends of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, which has helped guide our ongoing analysis of new trace data and structure our analysis in the remainder of the project.   The project has developed design ideas for citizen science support systems that will be a contribution to the fields of computer-supported cooperative work, computer-supported cooperative learning, and sociotechnical studies. Our participant activity model (see Figure 1) and the notion of "practice proxies" help us understand learning trajectories in citizen science projects and the design features that contribute to their learning and motivation. Related concepts of legitimate peripheral participation and social translucence are used to further explore what tools shape learning and motivation among citizen science participants.    In short, the project has in close collaboration with Zooniverse create tools to support citizen science projects while answering theoretically interesting questions about how socio-computational systems can support learning and motivation in crowd sourced projects. We have developed a framework to understand learning in citizen science projects and outlined a number of behavior experiments that will be developed to answer these questions. Furthermore, our framework and findings has contributed directly to the design and implementation of new tools in the Zooniverse citizen science alliance.   Broader Impact:  Through its engagement of over 1 million citizen scientists, the Zooniverse has always facilitated the meaningful participation of non-academics in the scientific process. This enriches the public?s understanding not only of scientific facts but the scientific process. Our study of the motivation and learning among Zooniverse participants facilitate system improvements and the design of future system features. Furthermore, we have involved more people in science research through our recruitment of participants to Zoonivese, public lectures and improvements to Zoonivese.org.
