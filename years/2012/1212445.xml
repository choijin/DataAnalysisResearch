<AbstractNarration>Quantum information science (QIS) is the interdisciplinary field that investigates how to use systems obeying the laws of quantum mechanics to perform information-processing tasks. This research project provides the core funding for the Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC), based at the University of New Mexico (UNM), with a major component of experimental research at the University of Arizona (UA). CQuIC brings a quantum-information perspective to physics-based research. In particular, research within CQuIC applies the new ideas and techniques of QIS to the state-of-the-art laboratory tasks of controlling the behavior of quantum systems, so these systems can be engineered to do what scientists want them to do, instead of doing only what comes naturally, and of making high-precision, quantum-limited measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CQuIC specializes in the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows for research careers in QIS. Students at UNM and UA are exposed to a full range of courses and other activities, which provide an interdisciplinary integration of information-theoretic and physics perspectives. CQuIC partners with six external institutions: Sandia National Laboratories; Los Alamos National Laboratory; the Joint Quantum Institute at the University of Maryland, the Australian Centre for Engineered Quantum Systems, headquartered at the University of Queensland; Caltech's Institute for Quantum Information and Matter; and the Brazilian National Institute of Science and Technology for Quantum Information. These partnerships provide a two-way flow of ideas and people and thus expand the theoretical and experimental capabilities available to CQuIC and the partnering institutions. CQuIC is the administrative home for the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology (SQuInT) Network. A consortium of 22 node institutions, including research universities, undergraduate colleges, national and industrial laboratories, and international centers for QIS, SQuInT promotes QIS research at and collaborations among its node institutions.</AbstractNarration>

This NSF award was the second center-wide grant to the Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC), which is based at the University of New Mexico (UNM), with an experimental-physics research node at the Optical Sciences Center of the University of Arizona (UA).  The award began on August 1, 2012, and ran through July 31, 2016.  Quantum mechanics is the framework within which the behavior of all physical systems is described, but the odd effects of quantum mechanics manifest themselves mainly in the behavior of systems at the atomic scale.  Larger systems, often called classical systems, tend to behave in ways that are consistent with what is called classical physics, which is a set of rules that are consistent with what we experience in our everyday lives.  Systems that behave according to the rules of quantum mechanics act quite differently from what we would expect from ordinary experience.  Research at CQuIC focuses on harnessing the new ideas and new techniques of QIS to the physics tasks of controlling the behavior of quantum systems and measuring that behavior precisely to determine that the system has done what is desired and to detect external influences on the system.  Research under this award focused on three major questions:  control of quantum systems and dynamics, (ii) high-precision measurements and quantum metrology, and (iii) physical foundations of quantum information.   The key research outcomes over the course of the award are described briefly here.  Development and experimental implementation of unique protocols for quantum state tomography based on continuous measurement and dynamical control.   These tomography protocols were implemented in the experimental testbed at the University of Arizona, specifically, in the 16-dimensional ground manifold of ultracold cesium atoms in our experimental testbed at the University of Arizona.   Development and implantation of protocols for optimal control in the 16-dimensional ground manifold of cesium.  Control tasks ranging from state maps and partial isometries to unitary transformations on the entire space were implemented and tested in the laboratory.  Theoretical analysis of the role played by the positivity of density operators in compressed-sensing versions of quantum tomography.  We showed that compressed-sensing advantages for the tomography of quantum systems are essentially guaranteed by the fact that quantum states are described by density operators with nonnegative eigenvalues.  These results led to new notions of informationally complete measurements, applicable for quantum tomography of states that are close to pure.  New protocols for collective spin squeezing.  Theoretical studies included a phase-matched spin squeezing protocol based on coherent-feedback and quantum erasure, a novel scheme to enhance atom-light entanglement through control of the atomic internal state, and the role played by decoherence and diffraction in realistic 3-dimensional geometries.  Experiments achieved up to 4dB of metrological spin squeezing for the collective spin-angular momentum of cesium atoms in our Arizona testbed.  No-go theorem for probabilistic, post-selected quantum metrology.  Detailed analysis of protocols that use post-selected states for performing parameter estimation probabilistically showed that the post-selection in these protocols can never improve sensitivity.   Determination of the full quantum limits on phase-preserving linear amplifiers, including nonGaussian amplifiers, and on probabilistic linear amplifiers.  The latter work showed that probabilistic linear amplifiers are essentially useless for amplifying a signal with minimal degradation of signal-to-noise.  Critical assessment of the efficacy of weak-value amplification.  We analyzed parameter estimation in the context of weak-value amplification, demonstrating that the post-selection used for weak-value amplification is not useful for parameter estimation.  We formulated classical coin-flipping analogues to weak values, which indicated that the weak-value effect is not a quantum-mechanical phenomenon.  Conditions for classical simulation of quantum-optical experiments.  We found sufficient conditions for efficient classical simulation of sampling from the output distribution when bosonic modes undergo an arbitrary quantum process and are measured at the output.  The conditions were applied to boson-sampling protocols and showed that the chief challenge for experiments of interesting size is mode mismatching that leaves distinguishable photons incident on the photodetectors at the output.  Quantum information processing with dressed Rydberg atoms.  We developed and implemented a new approach to quantum computing with Rydberg atoms based on adiabatic dressed states, in collaboration with researchers at Sandia National Laboratories.  CQuIC is the administrative home for the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology (SQuInT) network, a consortium of research groups at 27 institutions, located mainly in the US Southwest.
