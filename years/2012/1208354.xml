<AbstractNarration>This project will develop computationally efficient estimation methods with accompanying theory for the problem of identifying low-dimensional structure in point-cloud data, both low and high dimensional.  A canonical example is a noisy sample from a manifold. The investigators will develop minimax lower bounds for the estimation problem and construct estimators that achieve these lower bounds. They will then implement these methods in a practically useful form nd apply them to several important scientific problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Datasets sometimes contain hidden, low-dimensional structure such as clusters, filaments and low dimensional surfaces. The goal of this project to develop rigorously justified, computationally efficient methods for extracting such structure from data.  The developed methods will be applied to a diverse set of problems in astrophysics,seismology, biology, and neuroscience.  The project will advance knowledge in several fields including computational geometry, machine learning, and statistics.</AbstractNarration>

These structures can take many possible forms: clusters, manifolds, intersecting manifolds and ridges. Finding structure is important for many sciences such as astronomy, and as a mechanism for reducing the dimension of data.   As an ilulstraive example, consider the "Italy olive oil" data set. Each data point consists of 11 chemical measurements characterizing olive oil properties. Thus the data can be viewed as points in an 11 ddimensional space. Our analysis of the data aims to identyfing a simpler, lower dimensional representation that can be easily visualized and understood. We used our procedures for investigating if and how the data cluster together. Nine clusters were found, that succinctly summarized the data. The clusters nicely correspond to olive oil production in Italy?s geographical regions but this geographical information was not used in our analysis. In other words, the data analysis methods discovered the two-dimensional geographical information automatically. At the same time, the procedure identifies which are the important chemical variables in olive oil produc- tion for each region. Results of this analysis are displied in figure 1 and 2. The lines between the clusters show the most strongly connected, regions, with line widths indicating a measure of connectivity.  Our methods go well beyond this simple clustering example. For example, together with colleagues in physics, we have used our techniques to find filamentary structure in the Universe. See Figure 3.      Consider data Y = (Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n), where each Y_i  is a vector in a D-dimensional space. Subsets of the data might concentrate near smaller dimension (d &lt; D) structures, like the clusters we identified in the olive oil example. Identifying and estimating these structures leads to dimension reduction that helps improve statistical inference. The structures may be of intrinsic interest.   Structures of dimension d = 0 are modes and correspond to clusters. When d = 1, the structure is a one dimensional object, denoted as "filament", that supports points concentrated along its edge. A sheet is a structure of dimension d = 2, and a hypersheet has dimension d &gt; 2. More generally these structures are denoted as "ridges".     In this award we extended previous theoretical results by Genovese et al.(2016a) and Genovese et al. (2016b), developing ways for finding clusters hidden in D-dimensional spaces. These procedures were also expanded to deal with ridges of arbitrary dimension. We developed limiting distributions and a bootstrap method for quantifying the uncertainty of ridges estimators.  We also investigated issues related to separating ridges of increasing dimensions. We explored ways to resolve the "dimensional leakage" problem, linked to the fact that the same structure can show up in different dimensions.
