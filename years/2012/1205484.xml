<AbstractNarration>This Computing Research Infrastructure planning grant addresses two challenges for automatic systems performing deep semantic processing: identifying the context-appropriate sense of polysemous words and interpreting the meanings and interrelations of verbs and nouns in event-denoting phrases. Preliminary steps are taken for aligning and linking four existing widely used lexical resources (WordNet, FrameNet, PropBank and VerbNet) with different but complementary contents and coverage. Methods for completing current cross-resource links and full transitive closure are explored and tested. The resulting infrastructure (LexLink) is designed to make the resources fully interoperable, capitalizing on their particular strengths with respect to word sense disambiguation and Semantic Role labeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four activities are carried out in the context of planning LexLink. First, a workshop is held where key representatives of the Natural Language Processing and computational semantics communities articulate needs and requirements for the planned resource and offer advice on algorithms, annotation techniques and evaluation. Second, a subsection of cross-resource links for word senses and Semantic Role labels (Agent, Instrument, etc.) resulting from the automatic transitive closure is evaluated, yielding estimates for the error rate and leading to fine-tuning of algorithms. Third, current best performing mapping algorithms for  word senses and Semantic Role labels are evaluated against a human-annotated Gold Standard. Fourth, new Gold Standard data are created for additional training and testing and to refine existing algorithms. As a whole, the work provides a solid foundation for a resource with significant beneficial impact on a range of natural language applications, including machine translation, text summarization and sentiment analysis affecting areas such as health care, marketing, and education.</AbstractNarration>

Major Activities  A workshop was held on May 26, 2012 in Istanbul, Turkey, coinciding with the 8th Language Resource and Evaluation Conference (LREC). The workshop gathered representative members of the broader NLP community to discuss the contents, design and availability of the proposed infrastructure. Researchers, developers and users from academe and industry attended, gave presentations and shared in the discussions. We presented our vision for LexLink as described in the proposal, along with some preliminary alignment work towards creating a larger manually annotated Gold Standard as well as results from our evaluation of manual and automatic alignment algorithms. Colleagues who had independently undertaken automatic mappings of resources presented and compared their approaches and algorithms.  SemLink, a manual mapping of PropBank, grouped WordNet senses, FrameNet and VerbNet for the Wall Street Journal corpus was described, as was UBY, a German Lexical Resource, which has built on SemLink by extending it with automatic mappings and additional resources.     We collaborated with Professors Eneko Agirre and Mona Diab for the *SEM ("star sem") Shared Task sponsored by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) special interest groups SIGLEX and SIGSEM. *SEM is the joint conference on lexical and computational semantics that aims to provide a forum for NLP researchers working on different aspects of semantic processing.
