<AbstractNarration>Upward revision of global marine denitrification has led to speculation that there may be a large imbalance in the marine nitrogen cycle. In addition, the discovery of a new pathway (anaerobic ammonium oxidation, i.e., anammox) that leads to the removal of fixed nitrogen from marine sediments and anoxic regions of the water column has shaken long-held perceptions of the marine nitrogen cycle. As with denitrification, anammox converts fixed nitrogen to nitrogen gas, but does so without dissolved N2O as an intermediate stage. Large uncertainties remain in our knowledge of the rates and magnitudes of these N-loss pathways in oceanic oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) thus hampering efforts to constrain the marine nitrogen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a research team at the University of Washington will address this question:  What is the in-situ rate and magnitude of oxygen utilization, denitrification, and anammox in the oxygen minimum zone of the Eastern Tropical South Pacific?  They will approach this problem by making three significant oceanographic measurements that can be combined with an existing process study in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific aimed at distinguishing and identifying controls on anammox and denitrification in this region. First, they will measure water column distributions of dissolved nutrients along the hydrographic sections to help characterize nutrient sources and sinks in the oxygen minimum zone. Second, they will measure, to unprecedented coverage, dissolved N2O along the hydrographic sections as a diagnostic tracer for denitrification. Finally, they will measure transient anthropogenic tracers (CFCs and SF6) to quantify ventilation and circulation timescales within the OMZ. The tracer-derived timescales will be combined with measurements of dissolved oxygen and nutrients to quantify in situ rates of oxygen utilization and nutrient removal/regeneration. These rates will provide benchmarks to the rates determined in-vitro during shipboard incubation studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.   This project will support an undergraduate participant through the Joint Institute for Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) summer internship program. JISAO typically supports 5-8 undergraduates to spend summer quarter in Seattle participating in atmospheric and oceanic research;a project such as this would be attractive to oceanography and chemistry majors in its technical aspects, and to journalism students in its outreach activities.   One of the principal investigators will work with KUOW, the University of Washington public radio station, to design brief public interest stories on ocean science. The intern's final project will involve preparation of a brief radio segment for broadcast on KUOW on the background, significance and findings of the first year's research efforts, and participation in a scientific poster session with the other undergraduate interns at JISAO.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Observations indicate that oceanic oxygen deficient zones (ODZs:  mid-depth regions where oxygen concentrations are low) have expanded over the past few decades.  Most climate models indicate that this expansion has been due to a slowdown in ocean circulation (which supplies oxygen to the ocean interior) caused by warming at the sea surface, and further that the expansion is likely to continue under continued global warming.  Oceanic ODZs are important because they represent a major sink for fixed Nitrogen (Nitrogen that is readily bioavailable and not in the form of N2) in the environment, and because ODZs are the major source of gaseous nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas, from the ocean to the atmosphere.  It is important to understand how continuing expansion of oceanic ODZs in the future will impact the global supply of fixed Nitrogen to organisms in the environment, and how atmospheric nitrous oxide concentrations will evolve.  Our effort was an accompaniment to a biological process study conducted in the ODZ of the Eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETSP), offshore Chile/Peru (72-86 degrees West longitude, 12-23 degrees South latitude).  The process study overall sought to study the specific biological/metabolic pathways leading to fixed Nitrogen removal and nitrous oxide production in this region.  We provided critical oxygen, nutrient (including N-species) measurements on the water samples collected during this study.  The measurements provided a critical underpinning to the biological studies conducted in the region, which targeted controls on the metabolic pathways controlling fixed-N and nitrous oxide removal and cycling in the region.  Another component of our work involved quantifying the rate at which oxygen is re-supplied to the ODZ from the atmosphere by the ocean circulation, a process called ?ventilation?.  Quantifying the timescales over which the ODZ?s oxygen is re-supplied is important to establishing whether the ODZ exists as a result of slow ventilation (low oxygen supply), or as a result of very high oxygen consumption rates in the region from elevated biological productivity.   To answer this question we measured dissolved chlorofluorocarbon&ndash;12 (CFC-12) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) in water samples during the ETSP study.  CFC-12 and SF6 are man-made gases whose atmospheric concentrations started to increase significantly in the 1940s and 1970s, respectively.  Because their atmospheric levels have been closely monitored, concentrations in the ocean interior can be used to estimate a date that a subsurface water sample was last at the sea surface.  This was done by measuring the CFC-12 or SF6 concentration in water samples collected at depth, and comparing those concentrations with the known history of these gases at the sea surface.  Our measurements indicated that CFC-12 had, in 2013, penetrated all the way through the ODZ of the ETSP, and thus that the ODZ communicates with the atmosphere, or ventilates, on timescales &lt; 50 years.  We combined our CFC and SF6 &ndash; derived ventilation rates with the oxygen and nutrient measurements to estimate the oxygen and N-consumption rates in the ETSP.  In the thin water layer above the ODZ (80-120m depth) we found oxygen consumption rates that, while elevated, were no higher than observed in open ocean regions where overlying biological productivity is relatively low and oxygen is abundant at depth.  In the ODZ itself, where oxygen was not detectable, we found fixed-N consumption rates that were either very low, or were (usually) not detectable.  The decadal-scale ventilation and the low bio-cycling rates implied by the CFC-12 and SF6 and oxygen/nutrient measurements indicate that the ODZ is not maintained by elevated biological productivity in the location of our cruise track, nor is it due to slow ventilation. The lack of significant fixed-N consumption in our dataset, collected offshore of the Chilean/Peruvian shelf, supports a body of work that the N-deficits observed in the region are a relic (or, inherited) signal from high productivity and N-removal rates that are occurring in adjacent Peruvian/Chilean coastal waters.   This project provided critical support for development of nitrous oxide measurement capability on the same samples where we already routinely measure oceanic CFCs and SF6 worldwide as part of the CLIVAR program.  This will allow for a global nitrous oxide dataset to be collected in the oceans virtually free of charge.  Establishment of the global nitrous oxide distribution in the ocean will be important to understanding its sources in the ocean, and for future monitoring of changes in the oceanic production of nitrous oxide.  The project also provided a 3-month internship for an undergraduate who measured nitrous oxide in a local seasonally anoxic fjord and examined nitrous oxide?s relations with dissolved oxygen concentrations.  That student is now pursuing graduate school in oceanography.                                  Last Modified: 12/11/2017       Submitted by: Rolf E Sonnerup]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
