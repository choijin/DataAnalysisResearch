<AbstractNarration>The standard approaches to the Lefschetz fixed point theorem and its converse have focused on integer valued invariants: the Lefschetz number and Nielsen number. These invariants are easy to define but very difficult to generalize. The PI has developed an approach that produces invariants that are elements of stable homotopy groups of spheres and twisted loop spaces, as well as more algebraic targets. These invariants readily generalize and agree with the integer valued invariants in the classical cases. In this project the PI proposes further generalizations to coincidences and periodic points. She also plans to explore extensions of important classical properties of fixed point invariants to generalizations such as equivariant and fiberwise fixed point invariants. The PI intends to mentor graduate students and graduate school bound undergraduates, expand graduate student participation in the topology seminar and facilitate greater interaction between students and external visitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fixed points arises in many different areas of mathematics and have a variety of applications. In some cases fixed points are very well understood, but there are also many important questions that have not been resolved. The goal of this project is to use tools from algebraic topology to define new invariants that detect fixed points and their generalizations and to provide a better understanding of the structure of an important collection of fixed point invariants. This project involves new approaches to a classical area of algebraic topology that should be amenable to doing computations. Students at different levels will be involved in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In many contexts it is very important to be able to understand and describe fixed points of functions.  These types of questions arise in many different ways and there is a corresponding range of approaches.  The approaches that rely on techniques from algebraic topology provide relatively complete information, and so require the development of tools to make them easier to understand and compute.  This project focused on developing approaches to additivity and multiplicativity for these types of fixed point invariants that apply to both classical invariants and those with greater structure.  The approaches developed in this project are very general and apply outside of the original motivating fixed point theory questions.   Additivity and multiplicativity results have been essential for many of the known computations of these types of fixed point invariants and they are the most significant tools currently available in this area.  The existing results had significant restrictions:  some applied only to the identity function, others required very restrictive hypotheses on the topological spaces considered.   Most of these results also used techniques that were closely tied to the original topological motivation.  This connection leads to some of the restrictions in previous results. This project developed understandings for additivity and multiplicativity results starting from a description of fixed point invariants as a particular example of a more general invariant - the categorical trace.  This approach bypasses some of the challenges of previous approaches and produces results that are much more general than previously known results.  It removed restrictive hypotheses in classical versions of these results and also produced corresponding results in other fixed point settings.    Another aspect of this project focused on developing a better understanding of fixed points for functions that respect additional structure such as symmetry.  For these questions it was very helpful to have a more complete, and more general, understanding of the classical computational tools.   This project also provided mentoring opportunities through the PIs involvement with the local student chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics and the Women in Topology Workshop at the Banff International Research Station.
