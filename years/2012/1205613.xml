<AbstractNarration>This is an Institutional Infrastructure proposal to build a GPU cluster to support research in data-parallel code development and optimization, as well as research applications, in three scientific domains, namely, seismology, biology and astrophysics. These goals build on a close collaboration with an expert team in GPU computing from computer science. The proposed cluster will serve not only as an invaluable resource for computation, but will also aid cross-fostering of techniques and concepts between disciplines and will be used to stimulate collaboration and synergistic research activity in a wide range of areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though domain scientists are increasingly dependent on computation to achieve their research goals, most are not experts in parallel programming or GPU architectures. The difficulty of parallel programming for GPU clusters is an impediment to scientific progress. In order to relieve scientists of the burdens of parallel programming, computer scientists at Princeton have developed systems for automatically parallelizing programs for GPU. Building on this success, the PIs plan to extend these techniques to GPU clusters and work closely with the seismologists, biologists and astrophysicists to accelerate the pace of science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded the acquisition of a GPU cluster to support data-parallel code development and optimization, as well as research applications in three scientific domains, namely, seismology, biology and astrophysics. The cluster was not only an invaluable resource for computation, but it also aided cross-fostering of techniques and concepts between disciplines and was used to stimulate collaboration and synergistic research activity across the Princeton University campus.  The GPU cluster of 52 accelerator nodes was integrated with an existing cluster and brought online on April 24, 2013.  Since then, it has provided the computational capabilities needed to allow researchers to elucidate new paradigms within and across disciplines, from MHD simulations of a variety of astrophysical systems to seismic and ecological forecasting. Related software development was optimized through close collaborations between computer scientists and domain scientists.     Broader impacts of the supported work included open-source GPU-enabled software packages (CUDA and OpenCL) for simulations in seismology, biology and astrophysics.  Related educational outreach initiatives involved formal courses and "minicourses", and vibrant outreach programs via the ShakeMovie website, the OpenSwarm initiative and shows at the Hayden Planetarium. The computational resources were made available to the Princeton Computational Science &amp; Engineering research community, and involve a number of international collaborations.
