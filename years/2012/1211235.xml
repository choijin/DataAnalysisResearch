<AbstractNarration>This project analyzes climate change impacts, adaptation opportunities, and associated risks for communities of the Blue Nile headwaters (BNH) region in Ethiopia. Here, climate change is defined to include gradual changes in the average conditions and evolving patterns of climate variability, such as extreme events, on the interannual to decadal timescale. Climate change may affect hydrology, land quality, crop yields and diversity, as well as altering existing social and economic systems. The project will evaluate all impacts at the level of the agroecosystem.  The agroecosystem is the intersection of a climatic ecological zone with a set of land management and cropping practices that derive from geographic, ecologic, economic, and cultural conditions. Adaptation is a function of internal adaptive capacity, rate of change, potential for informed investment, and socio-cultural and biophysical constraints. In order to address coupled adaptation processes in a comprehensive manner, we will generate probabilistic agroecological scenarios based on patterns of past climate variability and social response (1980-2010), projected future climate impacts and response (2010-2040), household-level analysis of adaptation capacity in BNH communities, and conduct interactive planning sessions in which information on projected risks and uncertainties is used to inform climate adaptation decisions. We will partner with community members participating in a network of Climate Innovation Platforms, allowing us to assess how probabilistic projections of change derived from state of the art climate, crop, and hydrological models can be integrated into adaptation planning. In turn, this allows us to assess how adaptive actions might maximize resilience - the ability to withstand or recover from climate-induced stress - and break the coupled cycle of land degradation and poverty that affects the region today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will examine issues at the core of food security, and water security, and stability in the Nile region.  The Blue Nile Headwaters are a vital water tower of Africa, giving rise to a river that is the lifeblood of downstream populations in Sudan and Egypt. Within the headwaters region itself, however, connected processes of low investment capacity and land degradation drive a cycle of depressed agricultural yields and persistent poverty, making the region especially vulnerable to climate change impacts.  This cycle is reinforced by the dramatic interannual climate variability experienced in the region, and there is reason for concern that conditions will deteriorate in coming decades - both because climate change may bring more frequent drought and more intense rains and because land use pressures are increasing under rapid population growth. These changes have implications for food and water security throughout the region. However, the same coupling of natural and human systems that currently reinforces poverty in this region also offers opportunity. Vulnerability to climate change is determined by the magnitude of that change, the sensitivity of human and natural systems to change, and the capacity of communities to adapt in ways that reduce impacts. The proposed research approach combines best-available scientific tools for monitoring and projecting climate impacts with an unprecedented community-driven evaluation of potential adaptation strategies across a physically and culturally diverse landscape. As such, the study will advance understanding of how vulnerable communities can best make use of uncertain climate projections for future planning. More generally, the development of climate impacts scenarios at the level of the agricultural ecosystems represents a new approach to climate impacts analysis that will be broadly applicable in the U.S. and elsewhere.</AbstractNarration>

Some of the key challenges that motivated the research were realized during the project period, as portions of the Blue Nile Headwaters suffered through extreme drought during the El Nino of 2015, while negotiations over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD)&mdash;Ethiopia&rsquo;s massive new hydropower project on the Blue Nile&mdash;struggled against political tensions even as construction of the dam neared completion.</p> <p>In this context, our project contributed to both basic and applied understanding of how water, land, people, and policy are interacting to shape the future of the region. We identified key drivers of climate variability affecting the Blue Nile and examined their representation in global climate models, which led us to emphasize uncertainty in projections of future rainfall that are sometimes underplayed in studies that focus on the cross-model average projection that rainfall will increase in the basin. Looking at the land, we generated a new land cover map of the Blue Nile Headwaters that was applied to identify zones of high erosion potential, and we mapped agroecosystems&mdash;intersections of climate, soil, and agricultural practice&mdash;that we used to map out climate vulnerability patterns. These analyses have been applied by partners in Ethiopia to frame development priorities and have also been utilized by collaborators studying risks to child nutrition across the region. Our climate, hydrology, and land analyses were then combined with local household and agronomic survey to quantify the benefits of various climate resilience strategies to village level well-being, and they were also combined with nationally consistent data on crop yield and economic outcomes to assess macroscale risks and opportunities associated with climate variability. Looking to the future, we calibrated process-based crop models for local varieties in order to project future changes in potential yield, and we found shifting patterns of optimal cropping zones: hot and semi-arid portions of the highlands are expected to see declining output of their current staple crops, while the cold high elevation zones might see increased yield and the potential to switch to higher value crops.</p> <p>Placing these local analyses to the basin context, we implemented a hydropower model that simulates GERD operations in a changing climate.

These farmer-driven innovation platforms are designed to encourage early adoption of market-oriented climate resilient agriculture strategies. Working with the CSV, we have developed a menu of locally endorsed strategies related to cropping practices, processing and storage, use of off-grid energy, and expansion of home gardens for nutritional security and market opportunities. The implications of such strategies for soil conservation and economic returns in a changing climate were discussed in CSV sessions and in more technical trainings with agricultural extension experts. This engagement has had a demonstrable local impact, as findings from our studies have encouraged formalization and expansion of the CSV model. As this project concludes, our team continues to engage with local partners to implement resilience-building interventions in this climate vulnerable but rapidly developing region.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/13/2017<br>      Modified by: Ben&nbsp;Zaitchik</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1211235/1211235_10216839_1507890076945_IMG_3715--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1211235/1211235_10216839_1507890076945_IMG_3715--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Climate Smart Village meeting"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1211235/1211235_10216839_1507890076945_IMG_3715--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Climate Smart Village meeting"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Meeting of one of the Climate Smart Village councils, attended by US graduate students participating in the CNH project.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Luke MacDonald, JHU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ben&nbsp;Zaitchik</div> <div class="imageTitle">Climate Smart Village meeting</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1211235/1211235_10216839_1507889880086_Choke_AES_3d--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1211235/1211235_10216839_1507889880086_Choke_AES_3d--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Agroecosystems of Choke Mountain, in the Blue Nile Highlands"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1211235/1211235_10216839_1507889880086_Choke_AES_3d--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Agroecosystems of Choke Mountain, in the Blue Nile Highlands"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Map of the dominant agroecosystems of Choke Mountain, located in the middle of the Blue Nile Highlands.
