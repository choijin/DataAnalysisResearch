<AbstractNarration>The University of Cincinnati Center for Field Studies (UCCFS) has been awarded a grant to support vital infrastructural and research needs. The major improvements include: internet connectivity with appreciable bandwidth, two weather stations, power and water service for the east side of the campus, solar panels and two essential research instruments that will be housed in a recently constructed laboratory facility. UCCFS was established in 2008 through an agreement with the Hamilton County Park District (HCPD). This 17-acre tract, formerly a Shaker farm, is in the middle of Miami Whitewater Forest (MWF), a 4,000-acre preserve located 12 miles to the west of the university.  This property, which lies between the Great Miami and Whitewater Rivers, includes wetland habitats, restored prairie and mixed mesophytic eastern deciduous forest with a mosaic of climax beech-maple and oak-hickory forests. The setting of UCCFS is unique because it is one of the relatively few field stations located near a major urban center. The station has a considerable history of environmental data recorded for this area including intensive studies of the parks in the Cincinnati area by UC botanist E. Lucy Braun in the 1920s. Many others have followed in her footsteps, so there is a long record of ecological observations and species inventories from these sites that can be paired with more modern data collections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the principal objectives of the UC Center for Field Studies is to promote rigorous and sophisticated research programs designed to meet six of the major challenges of our national research agenda. Accordingly, investigations focus on: 1) biological diversity, species composition and ecosystem function; 2) ecological aspects of biogeochemical cycles; 3) ecological implications of climate change; 4) land use dynamics and habitat alteration; 5) the impact and control of invasive species; and 6) hydrologic forecasting. Research activities  are integrated with educational programs to achieve multiple goals: 1) advance discovery in the environmental sciences while promoting hands-on training, teaching and learning; 2) broaden participation from underrepresented groups in science by offering opportunities for field research to urban scholars; 3) accrue benefits to society through the generation of advanced understanding of environmental issues through the training of a diverse cadre of new scientists who will become the leaders and teachers of tomorrow; and 4) engage the public in discussions and hands-on scientific study through involvement in research projects and the participation of research scientists in community activities.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this NSF-FSML grant was to improve the infrastructure of the University of Cincinnati field station by making it more sustainable and provide the resources and equipment that will enhance both learning and research capabilities for students and scientists alike. The main goals of the project were to: 1) obtain reliable internet service for the renovated farmhouse and the newly-constructed laboratory facility, 2) purchase and install solar panels to help produce power independently for the field station and reduce costs, 3) provide a water source and electrical service to the eastern side of the field station campus, 4) obtain weather stations that will record and automatically transmit local climatic data on a near real-time basis, 5) purchase other essential equipment, such as two research-grade stereomicroscopes, a server, water sondes, and a Li-Cor area meter for the rapid measurement of leaf area and other kinds of morphological features, and 6) develop environmental pods that measure and record basic weather data along with air quality features.</p> <p>The first goal was realized through the installation of a fiber optic cable in both the farmhouse, which includes a classroom (Fig.1) and a virtual library, and the new laboratory building (constructed in 2013). This may sound like a routine service procurement, but the field station is in a remote area with no internet service anywhere nearby. Cincinnati Bell brought in a fiber optic cable especially for us from several miles away. This involved installing many new phone poles and, when the cable got close to the field station, they had to bury the cable underground to preserve the historic sight lines of our facility (we are on the National Register of Historic Places).</p> <p>The solar panels were placed on the roof of the new laboratory building (Fig. 2). The lab was designed as a sustainable structure (Silver LEED) and faces south in anticipation of adding solar panels. The solar panels &nbsp;and other added features improved the sustainability rating, greatly reduced our power bills, and the whole structure stands as a model of sustainable construction for our students and visitors. In this way we can not only talk about the principles of energy conservation, but our students see and utilize a functioning model of sustainability.</p> <p>The east side of our field station campus is where we have space for common gardens, experimental plots, and a staging area for green roof experiments. We also have plans to build a greenhouse and a butterfly house in this area. A major impediment to all of these activities is that there was no electrical service or water availability on this side of Oxford Road. Funds from the NSF-FSML grant allowed us to drill a water well in this area and bring in a power cable (Fig. 3). Because of the availability of these utilities, the University of Cincinnati was able to attract a new faculty member, Dr. Patrick Guerra, who is a specialist in monarch butterfly neurobiology and flight path recognition capabilities. We now have the space and the utilities to construct the facilities he needs for his research.</p> <p>The new weather stations are a huge improvement over what we had previously. The old stations had to be physically visited to download accumulated weather data every 6 months. If something went wrong during that time, we could lose weeks or months of valuable information resulting in large gaps in our data. The new stations transmit climatic data automatically through cell phone lines so we can access the data from any internet-connected computer and we know right away if there is a problem.&nbsp; This has resulted in much more useful and reliable datasets.&nbsp;</p> <p>The microscopes and area meter we purchased add basic equipment to our research capabilities. The water sondes work similarly to the weather stations, except they record environmental data from nearby streams. The environmental pod (Fig. 4) was designed and built by a local tech company, Measurenet Technology, Ltd. The pod has sensors to record temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels. We have found that the data generated by the pod has been a useful teaching tool for our students. The server is used to store data from the sondes, weather stations, and the environmental pod.</p> <p>In summary, the NSF-FSML grant has added critical components to our field station. Our students and researchers have benefitted greatly from the improvements.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2016<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lentz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1226891/1226891_10198889_1480453766724_StudentsOnlineInClass--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1226891/1226891_10198889_1480453766724_StudentsOnlineInClass--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 1.
