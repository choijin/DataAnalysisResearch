<AbstractNarration>The workshop "Syzygies in Berlin" will take place in Berlin, Germany on May 27-31, 2013 and will bring together early-stage and senior mathematicians to study classical results and open problems surrounding free resolutions, regularity, and syzygies. This classical area has undergone a renaissance in the past decade, aided in large part by computer algebra calculations, especially with the NSF funded computer algebra package Macaulay2. The workshop's will center around a trio of short courses, led by D. Eisenbud (Berkeley), H. Schenck  (Urbana-Champaign), and F.-O. Schreyer (Saarlandes). These leading experts are also well known for their enthusiasm and effectiveness as teachers. In addition to the short courses above, three invited lectures will highlight recent developments in the field. Potential speakers for these lectures are: Christine Berkesch (Duke University), Diane Maclagan (Warwick University, England), and Irena Peeva (Cornell University).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together young researchers and senior leaders in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is a field which studies the interplay between polynomial equations and the geometric objects which constitute the solutions to the equations: a familiar example might be the equation y=x^2, whose set of solutions forms a parabola in the plane. The field of algebraic geometry plays a prominent role in both pure and applied mathematics, appearing in problems ranging from the purely theoretical (string theory) to applied (signal processing, geometric modeling and computer aided design). The NSF funding for the proposal matches support provided by the German Mathematical Association, and provides travel support for ten Ph.D. students and postdocs, as well as support for lodging for fifteen participants, as well as travel and lodging support for two of the invited lecturers.
