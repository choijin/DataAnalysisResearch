<AbstractNarration>The need for increased RF spectrum access for wireless broadband applications continues within the commercial and government user domains. Since the usable RF spectrum is fully allocated, the only options available are to: a) increase the efficiency of current spectrum uses; b) re-purpose spectrum to higher value uses; or c) institute spectrum sharing. While the FCC has a database of authorized, licensed spectrum users, the ultimate success of any of these options depends on knowledge of actual RF spectrum utilization in time, frequency, and space. While snap-shot surveys of RF utilization have been performed, and long-term observations of RF use have been made at single locations, the impact of incorporating the spatial dimension to both improve the accuracy of these estimates and model medium-scale geographic variations has not been fully explored. Given the need to obtain mappings and models of the temporal and spatial variations of the RF environment with sufficiently high fidelity to estimate, characterize, and model spectrum utilization, the resulting research objectives are: 1) create a sufficiently low-cost and scalable approach to generating and accessing the necessary high quality RF dataset; 2) provide new methods for analyzing, modeling, and visualizing the resulting large, multi-dimensional information base; and 3) model spectrum activity to test the feasibility of spectrum sharing in candidate bands in order to facilitate decision making and innovation in spectrum repurposing and sharing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project represents a significant step forward in the evolution of low-cost, spectrum observation and assessment.  This is an important research step toward the vision of creating a national network of Spectrum Observatories that would be employed to understand the spectrum utilization across the nation and in particular in the congested urban centers of the country.  This understand would in turn be utilized to facilitate dynamic sharing of the spectrum with a goal of improving our nation's utilization of this scarce natural resource.  The specific implementation under this program at the Wireless Network and Communication Research Center (WiNCom) at Illinois Institute of Technology focused on gaining an enhanced understanding of the use of spectrum in the Chicago urban center.  Specifically, three fixed, geographically dispersed (East, West and South of the Chicago Loop), long-term Spectrum Observatory sites were established through the program (see photos of Spectrum Observatory Core Components).  These sites were identified after the completion of a nine site spectrum observation campaign by the WiNCom research assistants (see attachment for photos of the campaign equipment both at IIT and at one of the remote locations). The data from the spectrum analyzers at these sites was translated into a standardized HDF5 format, permanently stored in a newly established research data center and utilized by various existing, enhanced and new analytical tools.   One of the highlights of the project was the development and deployment of an enhanced visualization system called the International Spectrum Observation Center (ISOC - see accompanying photos).  This system assisted the team in gaining an improved understanding of the collected spectrum data in both raw and analyzed formats.  In particular, this system enables the visual fusion of the real-time and stored inputs from the geographically dispersed Spectrum Observatories along with associated metadata to enhance the over-all understanding of the data and the refinement of the measurement system approach.   Finally, the combination of the network of Spectrum Observatory systems, the storage system, our enhanced analytical tools and our newly established visualization capabilities (ISOC) were applied to the task of assessing the potential for the 2.7-2.9 GHz Weather Radar band to be utilized in a dynamic spectrum sharing environment.  The selection of this band was itself the subject of months of discussion and analysis followed by considerable internal debate, but it ultimately was a very good choice.  Based on careful observations, the slow (many hours to many days) changes in the utilization of the spectrum by the weather radar systems and the significant spectral gaps that exist between the utilized regions of the spectrum, it was determined that barring other obstacles, this band would be a good candidate for dynamic spectrum sharing.  The means by which this shared could occur might be through the employment of a Spectrum Allocation System (SAS) such as the ones being developed by companies for deployment in the 3.5 GHz band.     The combination of the successful deployment of most elements of the program as described above (though we ideally would have liked to deploy two more Spectrum Observatory sites), and the ultimate success in utilizing the system as a basis for our analysis of and recommendations concerning the 2.7-2.9 GHz band helped us feel very good about the success of this program.  We greatly appreciated the opportunity to pursue this research effort provided by the National Science Foundation.
