<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1207655, Principal Investigator: Benjamin Schmidt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will study the rigidity and deformation properties of curvature and geodesics in Riemannian manifolds.  A specific goal is to classify the Riemannian manifolds having all sectional curvatures greater than or equal to one and with positive spherical rank.  Conjecturally, these manifolds are isometric to compact rank one symmetric spaces.  Another broad goal is to investigate the structure of constant vector curvature manifolds in dimensions four and higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objects in nature with a high degree of symmetry are quite often structurally rigid.  When highly symmetric spaces are altered, numerical measurements of the way light propagates and the way space bends can be used to quantify changes.  The principal investigator will study the influence of Riemannian curvature, a numerical measurement of bending, on the way that highly symmetric spaces can and cannot be perturbed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funded research projects aimed to characterize spaces and dynamical systems that exhibit a large amount of symmetry in terms of numerical characteristics that quatify geometric properties such as curvature or dynamical properties such as entropy.     The actual world is never perfectly symmetric -- understanding ways to quantify the extent to which models arising from the real world fail to adhere to the ideal symmetric models in mathematics provides a starting point for deriving new and more predicative matematical models for our reality.     The Pi completed a number of projects focused on quantifying symmetry in the context of curved spaces with a particular emphasis on spaces in dimension three.  For instance, constant curvature three-manifolds are now completely classified.  The PI and collaborators initiatied the study of constant vector curvature three manifolds  Algebraially, these spaces are the spaces closest to the constant-curvature spaces without actually having constant curvature.  These results led to new insights regarding spaces having higher geomtric rank, a geometric version of the classically defined algebraic notion of rank for algebraic systems modeling symmetry.     The PI has trained two Ph.D. students during the course of this grant.  The first is expectd to graduate this spring and has focused on topics immediately derived from the funde topics.  The second is expected to graduat next year -- his focus lies more in the algebraic study of symmetry.  Although not directly tied to the funded reserach, this student's research topic fits the theme of "understand symmetry as much as possible as a means to better understand the real-world non-symmetric deformations of the models".
