<AbstractNarration>The investigator is mainly working on following  projects. The first is to prove a precise relation between the Falltings' height of a CM cycle (with respect to certain Arakelov divisor)  on a Shimura variety of unitary type (n, 1) and the central derivative of certain Rankin-Selberg L-function. Along the way, the PI will give two ways to construct the Arakelov divisor  from a cusp form of weight n+1 and prove them to be equal. The second project is to use the result in the first project to prove a Gross-Zagier formula  for the first Chow group over  the Shimura variety of unitary type (n, 1). The third project is to understand the Rankin-Selberg  integral appeared in the first project  in more detail.  The fourth project is to prove variants   of Gross-Zagier-Zhang  formula over a totally real number field for Shimura curve using our method in the second project.  The fifth project is to study special endomorphisms of CM Abelian varieties. Other projects   include   pull-back of arithmetic theta functions, and genus two curve computations. Some of these projects are joint projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI investigates the deep relation between two different aspects of the same object. The object is the so-called Shimura  variety, a special type of polynomial equations with a lot of special symmetries. On the one side, one would like to know naturally its arithmetics, e.g., rational points  and divisors (one extra equation) on the varieties. On the other hand, there are also various analytic objects such as L-functions and Eisenstein series floating around. In addition,  associated to the Shimura varieties are  group theoretic objects  such that automorphic representations. The PI investigates the deep relations among them. In particular, the PI is interested in some natural generalization of the well-known Gross-Zagier type of formulas, which has very significant implication to the even more popular  Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture (one of the million dollar problems). In addition to its importance in mathematics, this research has also potentially  very important application to telecommunication and cryptography.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For this project, I have made some significant discoveries, resulting 11 publications, including  one 95 page paper ( joint   with Bruinier and Howard) published in one of 2-3 most presitgious journals ` Invent.

My joint work with Bruinier and Howard on high dimensional analogue of the deep and famous Gross-Zagier formula was published  at {\bf Invent. Math.}, 201(2015)1--95.

In this work, we proved an arithmetic Siegel-Weil formula  over a real quadratic field. In  a joint work with Bruinier and Kudla&pound;&not; we gave a nice formula for big CM values of some Borcherds products.  Combining these two results, we can give a new proof of the Colmez conjecture for all CM quartic fields, which was first proved by myself using a different method.   I have also had successful collaboration with K.  Lauter and her research group on application of number theory to genus two cryptography, resulting three very research papers with interest both from number theory and cryptography point of view.    I  have also had successful collaborating with my visiting student Hongbo Yin (from Shandong University), one about non-congruence subgroups and about Yui-Zagier conjecture and related CM values of difference of some modular functions.    I have started a new joint project with Yueke Hu and Hongbo Yin to prove or disapprove that certain special divisors on a Picard modular surfaces are cohomologicaly trivial.   I graduated 3 PhD students during this period and has one postdoc.       Last Modified: 09/30/2016       Submitted by: Tonghai Yang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
