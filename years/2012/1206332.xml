<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences contribute funds to this award. This award supports theoretical research at the intersection of condensed matter physics, membrane biology, and structural biology. The PI will explore the physical principles underlying the spatial organization and biological function of cell membranes. Cell membranes exhibit a complex organization of lipids and membrane proteins, and play an integral role in many cellular processes. The functional properties of membrane proteins are not purely determined by protein structure but, rather, membrane proteins act in concert with the surrounding lipid bilayer. The overall objective of this project is to relate recent insights into the molecular structure of membrane components, which have resulted from a number of seminal breakthroughs in structural biology, to the coarse-grained description of cell membranes in terms of continuum elasticity theory, thereby providing a bridge between the structure of membrane proteins and the organization and biological function of cell membranes.&lt;br/&gt;Linking membrane mechanics to membrane protein structure requires a theoretical approach going beyond previous elastic models of membranes, which have mostly focused on cylindrical or conical membrane inclusions at large separations. Cell membranes are crowded, with the size and spacing of membrane proteins both being of the order of a few nanometers, and membrane proteins are found to exhibit a rich variety of hydrophobic shapes. The PI aims to develop a versatile elastic description of cell membranes allowing for the complex shapes of membrane proteins obtained from structural biology, and permitting the analysis of interactions among a large number of membrane inclusions in close proximity, which is the experimental scenario most relevant for the crowded membrane environment provided by living cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general theoretical concepts developed through this project will be employed to address specific biological questions in three model systems. First, the functional characteristics associated with the various reported oligomeric states and structures of mechanosensitive ion channels will be predicted in the form of channel gating curves with varying membrane tension. Second, the minimum energy shapes of membrane protein polyhedra - faceted bilayer vesicles of well-defined polyhedral symmetry - will be related to the properties of the constituent lipids and membrane proteins. Third, the planned research will explore the impact of membrane-mediated elastic interactions on the spatial organization and cooperative signaling exhibited by chemoreceptor lattices. These three case studies will enable the systematic exploration of the relationship between the structure of membrane components and the spatial organization and functional properties of cell membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supports educational activities across a range of age groups, including two graduate students who will (1) help to mentor undergraduate research assistants, (2) participate in outreach activities to local high schools, (3) collaborate closely with researchers across different academic departments and institutions, (4) engage in minority outreach programs, and (5) participate in the development and teaching of a new course at the interface of physics and biology. This project supports high school science education in central Los Angeles through the organization of workshops for inner-city high school science teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences contribute funds to this award. This project explores the physical principles underlying the biological function of proteins embedded in cell membranes, and supports research at the intersection of condensed matter physics, membrane biology, and structural biology. Membrane proteins are an abundant and important class of molecules that play critical roles in many human diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's. Recent years have seen several major breakthroughs in the structural elucidation and biophysical characterization of membrane components. The biological function of membrane proteins is generally determined by a complex interplay between protein structure and the properties of the surrounding lipid bilayer, a major component of the membrane. This leads to a deformation of the membrane from its unperturbed state which can be described quantitatively using the theory of continuum elasticity, which has been studied widely in the context of materials research. This project develops the continuum elasticity theory of membranes as a bridge connecting the structure of membrane components to the organization and biological function of cell membranes in vivo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general theoretical concepts developed in this project will be employed to address specific biological questions in three model systems. The first of these model systems concerns mechanosensitive ion channels, which are membrane proteins that can respond to mechanical stimuli and constitute and form the basis for the sense of touch, for example. The second model system concerns membrane protein polyhedra, which have been proposed as a novel tool for the structural study of membrane proteins. Finally, the third model system concerns chemoreceptors which form the basis for the sense of smell, for example. Chemoreceptors provide a widely-studied example of membrane proteins able to transmit signals across cell membranes, and which have been shown recently to exhibit an intriguing spatial organization into regular lattice structures. These three case studies represent model systems of high experimental interest, and will allow the systematic exploration of the relationship between the structure of membrane components and the spatial organization and functional properties of cell membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goals of this project are complemented by a range of educational activities which will (1) support graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, (2) lead to the development of a new course at the interface of physics and biology, and (3) support high school science education in central Los Angeles through the organization of workshops for inner-city high school science teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Proteins are the molecular workhorses of life. A central paradigm of biology holds that the biological function of proteins follows from their molecular structure. In keeping with this paradigm, cell membranes have long been conceptualized as passive envelopes in which proteins randomly diffuse in a sea of lipids, much like icebergs float in the ocean. Membrane protein structure then fully determines how cell membranes control the flow of molecules and signals between cells and their environment, as well as between different intracellular compartments, which is of fundamental importance to all organisms.</p> <p>Following seminal breakthroughs in superresolution light microscopy, electron cryo-tomography, protein crystallography, and other experimental techniques for the quantitative characterization of cell membranes, the above model of cell membranes has been undergoing a radical revision. It is now widely appreciated that the biological functions of many membrane proteins do not simply follow from the structure of individual, isolated membrane proteins but, rather, emerge from protein structure together with interactions between the proteins and the surrounding lipid bilayer membrane as well as other proteins in the cell membrane.</p> <p>In particular, the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer couples to the hydrophobic regions of integral membrane proteins such as ion channels and receptor proteins. Since membrane proteins are generally much more rigid than lipid bilayers, the lipid bilayer membrane tends to deform, in the vicinity of membrane proteins, from its energetically preferred, unperturbed state so as to accommodate a particular protein structure. As a result, the energy cost of accommodating a membrane protein within the lipid bilayer depends on the protein conformational state, which, depending on the mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer, can stabilize particular protein conformations (e.g., the closed or open state of an ion channel) and, in turn, drive particular cellular processes. Furthermore, in the crowded membrane environments provided by living cells, protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations due to neighboring membrane proteins generally overlap, allowing proteins to &ldquo;sense&rdquo; other nearby proteins and resulting in lipid-bilayer-mediated interactions between membrane proteins.</p> <p>As outlined above, protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations are thought to provide a general mechanism for regulation of membrane protein function as well as cooperativity among interacting membrane proteins, with membrane proteins not acting individually but as collective units. The overall objective of this project was to employ theoretical approaches developed originally in the context of condensed matter physics and materials science to provide a bridge connecting the structure of membrane proteins to the energy cost of protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations, bilayer-mediated protein interactions in the crowded membrane environments most relevant for living cells, and regulation of membrane protein function. Over the course of this project we have succeeded in formulating and verifying such a novel methodology linking membrane mechanics to membrane protein structure (see Fig. 1). Implementation of our methodology for specific experimental model systems has allowed us to discover novel physical mechanisms and principles underlying various biological functions of cell membranes.
