<AbstractNarration>This award supports the conference Seminar on Stochastic Processes(SSP) 2013 to be held at Duke University Campus and jointly hosted by Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on March 14-16, 2013. These seminars have been held annually since 1981; they have become the most important regular conference series for probabilists in North America. They bring together a diverse group of accomplished researchers and young investigators in probability and stochastic processes. The primary goal is to provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent significant progress in research, and to enable participants to discuss their work in an informal atmosphere. Starting in 2013, SSP will include additional activities for new researchers to be held the day before the main Seminar talks. In 2013 these will take the form of a tutorial delivered by a speaker selected by the Probability Subcommittee of the IMS New Researchers Committee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seminar on Stochastic Processes is a fixture in probability, and many of the most prominent probabilists make a habit of attending it every year. The morning invited presentations provide a platform for the latest developments in the field. Moreover, the informal format of the afternoon sessions gives graduate students and young researchers a unique opportunity to expose themselves to the most recent research trends by engaging in high level open discussions, and by offering the opportunity to present their own research to leaders in their field. The synergy made possible by this original formula is very rarely found in more traditional meetings. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Conference information can be found at http://sites.duke.edu/ssp2013/.</AbstractNarration>
