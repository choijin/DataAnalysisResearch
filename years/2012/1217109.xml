<AbstractNarration>Research in string theory in the past three decades has led to exciting new insights in physics and mathematics. Considering string propagation in nontrivial backgrounds produces physical interpretations for mathematical structures in spacetime. The interplay between mathematical and physical intuitions and techniques has enriched both fields. A notable example of this is the discovery and the many applications of mirror symmetry. The research described here will build on these results and on recent progress in both fields to pursue these studies in new regimes. One aim is to improve our understanding of the geometry and physics of heterotic string compactifications using a variety of approaches. These models can describe universes similar to ours with such features as nonabelian gauge symmetry and chiral matter content. In addition an investigation of extremal transitions in M-theory compactifications using insights from geometry and field theory will be carried out to learn about the possible dynamics. This work is expected to lead to a better understanding of the physics of string theory, as well as to insight into the mathematics of CalabiYau spaces.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This work will be done in collaboration with physicists and mathematicians around the world, enhancing interdisciplinary cooperation. Experience shows that such collaborations in this field have been productive , as new physics insights and new results in pure mathematics go hand-in-hand. The PI will also train graduate students and involve undergraduate students in the research. He will also enhance his program of outreach activities. This includes collaborations with local public schools to enhance science teaching and generate enthusiasm for science in young people by visits to the classroom by the PI and/or by students trained by the PI to present specific curriculum materials developed in concert with the schools. These curriculum materials are made broadly available for use elsewhere. The regular public stargazing events conducted by the PI for the past decade will be enhanced by including astrophotography capabilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported research on the interplay of geometry and physics in the study of string theory (and M-theory) models in which d of theten (11) dimensions describe a compact "internal" space.  The geometry ofthis internal space controls the physics observed in the effective 10-d(11-d) dimensional spacetime.  Our understanding of these models in generaldepends upon the existence of an unbroken supersymmetry, which in turn restricts the internal compact space. The relation between the geometry of suitable spaces and the physics they determine can lead to novel insights in both pure geometry and physics.   In this project, several approaches to this were pursued, and new results were obtained on several issues of outstanding interest, including:  - Mirror symmetry is a surprising phenomenon relating two topologically distinct spaces that lead to identical physics when used as the internal space for a string compactification.  We studied carefully a family of models for which an explicit mirror construction is known and proposed a condition determining a class of models to which the construction can apply.  We also studied a conjecture giving a more directly geometric relation between a space and its mirror and the way this could work in a set of examples (a subset of the class studied in the previous work).  - Heterotic strings compactified to four spacetime dimensions on a suitable space produce vacua with minimal supersymmetry - the most general models for which supersymmetry affords the simplifications that allow their detailed study. In a set of papers we studied several important issues in the dynamics of the associated two-dimensional superconformal field theories.   - M-theory compactified to three dimensions on a suitable space leads to a theory with the same amount of supersymmetry.  Such theories are under intense study, and we studied the way in which interesting theories arise when the internal space displays suitable singular behavior.  - Superconformal field theories in six spacetime dimensions are a novel discovery, and comprise a rich source of insight into dynamics in lower spacetime dimensions. The general structure of such theories, specifically of their symmetry properties, was undertaken from several approaches.  These results were shared in eight publications, posted on arXiv and published in professional journals, as well as presentations at conferences and workshops.  This project supported one graduate student, Marco Bertolini, through his studies for a PhD in physics.  Marco collaborated on five of the publications produced under this project, completed his PhD and accepted a prestigious postdoctoral position.  While supported by this grant, the PI continued his work on science outreach, creating positive and informative experiences with science for non-scientists. These included regular stargazing activities at the Duke Teaching Observatory and a massive open online course (MOOC) offered freely through Coursera.
