<AbstractNarration>Because of its potential as a tracer of ocean mixing and transport, 227Ac (22 year half-life) has been identified as a parameter of interest for the International GEOTRACES Program, a multi-national effort to map and study the geochemical behavior of a suite of trace elements and isotopes in the global ocean.  Quantifying the biogeochemical dynamics of the deep sea is necessary for understanding the oceanic cycling of carbon and other materials.  Defining these dynamics requires knowledge of mixing and advective transport rates that can be applied to interpret concentration fields of biogeochemically important solutes.  Despite having a half-life that is well suited for the study of both vertical and lateral transport in the deep ocean, few 227Ac measurements have been made in the deep sea.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a research team at the University of Southern California will make measurements of 227Ac water column profiles on the 2013 US GEOTRACES Pacific transect, a section from Peru to Tahiti, one of several American contributions to the International GEOTRACES effort.  The team will also do analyses of archived sediments to constrain the regional benthic flux of this isotope and provide a boundary condition for interpreting its water column distribution.  Recent advances in instrumentation facilitate this analysis, and the synergy provided by the GEOTRACES program will provide an ideal opportunity to obtain additional data that will serve two purposes.  First, 227Ac will be of value in defining the spatial variability of mixing rates in the deep South Pacific, particularly when combined with estimates based on 228Ra (6 year half-life), a tracer field that a collaborating GEOTRACES proposal seeks to determine.  Second, the mixing and transport rates defined by this tracer pair will be useful for deducing the transport and the dynamics of other solutes measured by GEOTRACES in deep waters.  Solute transport is due to both mixing and advection.  By using multiple tracers with different half-lives, the separate roles of these processes may be distinguished, allowing a more complete understanding of the dynamics of solute behaviors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  As part of this effort, at least one undergraduate and one high school student will have the opportunity to participate in the research experience, gaining insight into the possibilities of careers in this area and learning the approaches taken in scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Actinium-227 (227Ac) is a naturally-occurring radioisotope with a 22 year half life.  It enters deep ocean waters by escaping from sediments, where it is produced.  As 227Ac mixes upwards, it undergoes radioactive decay, and its distribution provides information about mixing and solute transport in the deep ocean.  Radioactive decay provides a natural clock to calculate these rates of transport.  Very few measurements of this isotope have been made previously, because this isotope is not very abundant, so large quantities of water must be processed to make measurements.  The NSF-funded GEOTRACES program offered an opportunity to collect the large samples needed, and combine this measurement with other efforts to simultaneously determine the distribution of many biologically-active trace metals and nutrients.  The objective of this proposal was to characterize 227Ac distribution in deep waters (&gt;1000 km) along the GEOTRACES cruise track from Peru to Tahiti, and use this distribution to estimate solute transport rates of metals and nutrients that are required by ocean phytoplankton.  These phytoplankton play a central role in the behavior of the ocean carbon cycle.  In turn, the ocean carbon cycle plays a major role in the behavior of atmospheric CO2, a critical component of the Earth?s climate system.  Results of this project indicated some expected outcomes, as well as others that were pleasant surprises.  One result that we anticipated was that vertical mixing rates decrease with increasing distance from the sea floor, as the water column stratification becomes more pronounced.  One unanticipated result was that hot, hydrothermal vents on mid-ocean ridges introduce a significant quantity of 227Ac, a new finding of this project.  The introduction of this tracer into the hydrothermal plume of metal-rich water escaping from the East Pacific Rise introduced a clock that could be used to calculate the velocity of the westward movement of this plume (see figure showing the ratio of 227Ac to 3He, a non-radioactive tracer emanating from the plume).  The estimated plume velocity of 0.4 cm/s refined a previous estimate of 0.1-0.5 cm/s that had been made based on calculations of flow from measurements of temperature and salinity profiles. This also provides a time scale for the removal rate of dissolved metals emanating from the hydrothermal vents.  As the data base for 227Ac distribution in different parts of the deep sea grows, this isotope will be quite useful in calibrating ocean circulation models that describe transport rates of solutes in various ocean basins.  These transport models will improve our understanding of the roles of ocean circulation and biology in regulating the behavior of the ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle.
