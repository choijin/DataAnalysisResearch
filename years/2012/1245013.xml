<AbstractNarration>There is a solid body of evidence documenting significant misconceptions about evolution among college students before and even after instruction in the life sciences. Researchers have attempted to evaluate and address such misconceptions in evolution-based courses at the college level, but only with mixed success. There is still a need to develop and test tools and methods to help students gain an accurate understanding of evolution. This project is creating, using, and evaluating an innovative laboratory curriculum for an introductory biological anthropology course to address and correct misconceptions about evolution. It is using a student-centered and inquiry-based approach that challenges students to apply the core theory and concepts of evolution and biological anthropology specifically, and to engage actively in solving problems using scientific methods. The project is teaching evolution as an active process. This approach is designed to help students understand how evolution occurs in a human context. The project is engaging students actively with DNA /molecular and other laboratory evidence that are integrated with other course materials.  This approach embeds evolutionary challenges fully and explicitly throughout the semester and focuses almost entirely on human examples as appropriate to biological anthropology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is well-documented that there is significant misunderstanding about evolution and how it works among the general public in the United States.  Even among college students, evolution-related misconceptions exist and may persist after they take courses in the life sciences, for which evolution is a foundational theory &ndash; including biological anthropology.  At West Chester University (WCU), a team of scientists developed and evaluated an innovative, inquiry-based laboratory curriculum intended to help introductory biological anthropology students learn evolution concepts more effectively, and how to think like scientists and explore questions using the scientific method. This approach challenges students to solve guided inquiries that encourage them to pose hypotheses or predictions, apply methodologies that they have been taught, present their results, and interpret them for each lab, regardless of whether it is about bones or DNA.   In comparison with students taking more traditionally structured introductory courses, both at WCU and at several other universities, students studying the new, student-centered curriculum at WCU demonstrated better understanding of evolution concepts by the end of the course. While in all of the courses students? evolution understanding improved by the end of the relevant semester, at WCU the improvement was greater.  WCU students also gained confidence in their understanding of and ability to use the scientific method over the semesters of the project; this gain was greater during the new curriculum than before that implementation.    The broader mission of this project is to contribute to the transformation of undergraduate science education, specifically by adding to knowledge of how to teach important science concepts in ways that help students grasp them more readily.  While inquiry-based and other student-centered approaches to teaching have been gaining traction in other life sciences over the last couple of decades, biological anthropology has not been as involved in that movement to date. Thus, an additional goal of this project is to disseminate the project?s successes in teaching evolution and the scientific method to a wider audience of university faculty in biological anthropology and beyond.  The project team is developing open-access web resources to make the curriculum widely available and has been presenting at scientific conferences and developing publications for scientific journals.  Ultimately, it is the project team?s hope that students who have gained a better understanding of science, and of evolution in particular, will contribute to increasing the overall level of public acceptance and understanding of evolution and of science as a way of comprehending the natural world.
