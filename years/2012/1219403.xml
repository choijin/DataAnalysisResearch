<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this workshop, being held in Shanghai, China, 23-25 July 2012, are (i) to scope new opportunities and challenges in simulation research related to new emerging computing technologies and application areas, and brainstorm how to successfully approach them; and (ii) to promote simulation research in East Asia and foster international collaborations.  New emerging computing technologies bring new paradigms to simulation methodology, changing traditional ways of implementing input modeling, output analysis, and simulation optimization. The new technologies also give enormous opportunities for the simulation community to grow further by expanding application areas and providing fast/efficient/reliable decision support tools for large-scale simulations in the new application areas. The meeting will help define new directions in research and applications of simulation with respect to new computing technologies and emerging application areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast to other operations research methodologies, stochastic simulation has been relatively underused outside of North American and Western Europe, due to limited computational resources, as complex large-scale simulation models are computationally intensive. If successful, this workshop will enable and foster long-term cooperation and collaboration on simulation research that will exploit new emerging computing technologies such as parallel and cloud computing and lead to wide use in applications from healthcare to energy to telecommunications to transportation.</AbstractNarration>

The purpose of the workshop was to scope new opportunities and challenges in simulation research related to new emerging computing technologies and application areas, and brainstorm how to successfully approach them. Also, the workshop was to promote simulation research in East Asia and foster international collaborations.  With new technologies, such as parallel computing, graphic processing units (GPUs), and cloud computing, and emerging areas, such as health systems and environmental systems, there are opportunities for the simulation community to broaden and advance research and applications. Thus, there is a need for identifying new opportunities and challenges in research related to emerging technologies and application areas. More specifically, emerging computing technologies and application areas include    Parallel computing environments, GPUs and sensors, Cloud computing, Financial engineering, Healthcare and health system, and Environmental system.    Research questions related to the above items, for example, can be   How can we effectively use parallel computing environments and GPUs for large-scale simulation or large-scale optimization? How can we effectively use cloud computing for a general simulation model and simulation optimization? How do they affect optimization with high-dimensional decision variables? What are new simulation and input modeling skills that we need in order to take advantages of the new computing technologies?    In addition, compared to other areas of operations research, the simulation community is small in China and many other countries in East Asia. The workshop will help promote simulation research attracting more researchers to the field and build international collaborations.
