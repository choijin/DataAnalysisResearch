<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project goal is to produce GaSb photovoltaic devices of multicell (MIM) construction for TPV use.   Current devices use single cell.  MIM devices have significant advantages over single cell in efficiency and cost. A MIM device is composed of many sub-cells physically isolated on the same substrate.  This proportionally increases output voltage and decreases output current resulting in lower internal power loss.   To date there have been no publications describing MIM Ge or GaSb  MIM devices.  The Phase I Program demonstrated that high lifetime GaSb can be epitaxially grown on semi insulating GaAs and an IR&amp;D program demonstrated that 50 subcell MIM devices can be fabricated from epitaxial germanium on semi insulating GaAs.  Combining these elements will produce an ideal device. Although the Ge MiM is suitable for TPV a GaSb MIM would give a three to tenfold improvement in performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to economically &amp; efficiently recover waste heat as electricity.  57% of all power generated in the US is rejected as waste heat, however, to date there have been no successful attempts to recover this heat as electricity as opposed to steam for heating purposes. MTPV is developing a thermophotovoltaic solution to address this problem and is a pioneer in the use of near-field evanescent coupling to dramatically increase the power density obtainable from a heat source at a given temperature.   MTPV has published a clear demonstration of this phenomenon and is engaged in commercializing its use.    Silicon emitter chips designed to transfer energy from a heat source in such a manner as to facilitate the formation of a sub-micron gap are currently being produced in a foundry as well as both single cell and MIM Ge devices.  The unique housing that is required to contain these chips and allow insertion into an 1100 degree C furnace is designed/ fabricated at MTPV?s facility where power generation tests are conducted.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main purpose of this NSF SBIR Phase II program was to develop a Micron-Gap-Thermo-Photo-Voltaic multi-cell structure that can be used for the direct conversion of the emission of a radiating heat source into electric energy when placed at submicron distances from the heat source. In the first part of the Phase II program, a diffusion process that provided P+ and N+ regions within a semiconducting device with adequate electrical characteristics for good performance GaSb cells was developed.  In part two of the program, InGaAs photovoltaic devices that generated on the order of 0.4 W/cm2 when exposed to black body radiation in the range of 800&deg;C to 900&deg;C were developed. When augmented with anti-reflective coatings and when combined with appropriate thermal control, InGaAs multi-cell structures built upon InP or GaAs substrates were shown to provide a promising route to thermo-photovoltaic devices with the potential for commercial, industrial and scientific uses. Pursuit of an even higher power path was conducted by down-selecting through a combination of InGaAs photovoltaic chip processing options, including exploration of the use of lower 0.55 eV bandgap material, epitaxial growth on InP substrates, and the use of advanced anti-reflective coatings.  In all, the demonstrated overall improvement in power under benchmark source temperatures was demonstrated to be in excess of 30%.
