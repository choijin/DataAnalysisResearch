<AbstractNarration>An individual's preferences can be complicated.  &lt;br/&gt;The project investigates whether people's preferences do, in fact, conform to the CP-net (conditional preference network) formalism, how such preferences can be combined according to different voting methods, and how vulnerable those methods are to manipulation or "strategic voting."  Finally, the very large corpus of preference data from the Netflix Challenge is used to build statistical models of the efficiency of manipulation algorithms and to compare the performance of different consensus methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory experiments will check whether people exhibit preferences that can be modeled by CP-nets. The project extends ideas from aggregation in Bayesian networks (models of conditional probabilities) to aggregation in CP-nets (models of conditional preferences).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team investigates how statistical inference from noisy data relates to or interacts with strategic manipulability and bribery. The project extends behavioral social choice and computational social choice on voting systems, and the manipulation thereof, from preferences expressed as ratings, rankings, or subsets to preferences expressed as CP-nets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team investigates the performance of voting methods and the efficiency of manipulation schemes on real preference data from the Netflix challenge data set.  These data, namely hundreds of thousands of (slightly perturbed) personal rankings of movies, were released several years ago for data-mining purposes.  One can extract individual "elections" based on the rankings of a small set of movies, evaluate and compare various aggregation methods and empirically characterize voting scenarios that are especially susceptible or especially resilient to strategic manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the broader impacts of the research, beyond the integration and cross-fertilization of several distinct research areas spanning several scientific disciplines, are the development of more adequate individual and collective decision making tools, that will help individuals, groups, organizations, and society to improve decision making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The underlying questions explored under this grant are about computational representations and reasoning about preferences.  This included questions about how to represent and reason with an individual's preferences when those preferences are conditional.   For instance, when choosing, say, a cell phone, preferences about size might be dependent on the quality of games available and the cost of a data plan sufficient for streaming video.  (I might prefer the larger phone only if I can afford to stream video on it or I want to play sufficiently complex games on it.) The research also looked at preference aggregation, both in the form of voting systems and of more complex representations of group preferences.  Generally, there is a trade off between the expressivity of preference representations and the computational complexity of reasoning with those representations.  When we allow preferences about features to be conditioned on the value of other features, we introduce complexity to the problem of comparing two items and determining which is preferred.  We began work on heuristic algorithms for the comparison problem for preferences represented as conditional preference networks (CP-nets).   We have also developed algorithms for generating all CP-nets of a given size, or uniformly (or approximately uniformly, for larger instances) randomly generating a set of CP-nets.  This allows us to generate "profiles" of preferences, so we can experimentally explore properties of CP-nets and of voting algorithms based on CP-nets.  While the blulk of computer science related work was either led or run by the University of Kentucky team, the University of Illnois team developed experiments to determine whether individuals make choices (mostly) consistent with a CP-net, or perhaps a small set of CP-nets. This involved substantial challenges, e.g., of a logistic nature because the team decided to motivate experiment participants with real world rewards, specifically restaurant meals in an experiment studying their decision process when choosing a meal, and retail products when making purchase decisions. For example, when deciding between various possible dinner menus, respondents were given one of their choices as a realy meal in a local restaurant, but this required a workable and sifficiently simple system to pay for the meal while also ensuring that the participant received exactly the menu items that they had indeed chosen in the lab.

This required balancing the amount of effort as well as the amount repetition with a suitable amount of variety in the stimuli we used.  The teams also looked at the benefits and drawbacks of using data such as the Netflix Data Set to reason about voting systems.  For instance, we can show that certain voting paradoxes occur very rarely, when we treat movie ratings as votes.  On the other hand, we can show that the way we handle missing data (movies not ranked by an individual) has important effects on the outcomes of votes, and on other properties of vote profiles.  Dr. Mattei, who has been serving as a consultant on this grant, has developed and posted a library of preference data and related algorithms at PrefLib.org. Some of these data were obtained by the Illinois team. This library will have the broadest impact on the study of preferences and voting systems of all our work. The intellectual merit of this work lies in the models of preferences and preference aggregation schemes that we have introduced; the complexity analysis of reasoning with these representations and aggregation schemes,  the algorithms, both optimal and heuristic, that we have developed, as well as the major strides in developing more realistc decision making experiments in the laboratory. The societal relevance of this work is extremely broad. Helping people express their preferences, helping p...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
