<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to obtain  quantitative correlations between the structure and function of G-proteins.  Obtaining a reliable detailed molecular description of the action of G-proteins can have a far reaching impact on the understanding key processes in the cell, by providing a more quantitative picture on the communication of information in the cell. Previous studies conducted in this project developed computer simulation methods to study GTP hydrolysis that is controlled by G-proteins. These simulations explored the key role of protein residues whose mutations lead to major change in activity and indicated that these residues act by modulating the coupling between the barrier for the chemical step and structural changes.  This idea has been further validated by studies of the activation of the EF-Tu protein, which is involved in the elongation of the amino acid chain during protein synthesis. Attempts to confirm the above findings and to reach more unique conclusions involved systematic quantum mechanical ab initio studies of phosphate hydrolysis in solution, as well as a preliminary combined quantum (ab initio) / molecular mechanics (QM/MM) study of the activation of the protein Ras by the protein GAP. These studies reproduced key experimental findings while giving new insights into the nature of the free energy surface of the reaction. Further advances have been made in studying the conversion of chemical energy to work by the protein F1-ATPase and in studies of the unique unidirectional motions in this and in related systems. This project is placed now at a pivotal point, where it is poised to exploit the above progress and to move in parallel on the following fronts: (i) Further exploration of the activation of EF-Tu and the related protein EF-G , during the protein synthesis process. (ii) Continuing the studies of the chemical and conformational coupling in F1-ATPase. (iv) Exploring the action of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are responsible for the majority of cellular response to hormones and neurotransmitters. (iii) Conducting comparative studies of the action of different G-proteins and determining both the common and different catalytic factors (v) Exploring the information transfer in RasAGP and related systems by double mutations analysis (vi) Pushing for a consensus on the nature of the GTPase reactions by systematic ab initio QM/MM free energy calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advances in the above research will be integrated into teaching and training programs.  The PI will develop a computer-modeling course for students.    Movies that illustrate the process of cellular signal transduction and its molecular foundations will be produced. The movies will be distributed to high schools, where they should encourage young people to pursue research in this field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided? The postdocs involved in these projects, and supported by this grant, have learned to  simulate phosphate hydrolysis in G-proteins and ATPase by the EVB approach and by  ab initio QM/MM approaches. Additionally, we provided unique training in obtaining the landscape for the action of molecular machines and how to simulate vectorial motions by our CG models and to model vectorial processes. The graduate student involved in this project learned to perform EVB simulations of G proteins.   How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest? The Ras and ATPase reaction is now presented at USC's 105B and 115B courses, in the chapter  about chemical kinetics. A movie of the Ras reaction has been placed on our website. Other  professors at USC have been using this presentation.     What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?  The proposed projects include the following:  (i)   We will extend our studies of EF-Tu, focusing on mutational and pH dependence. These studies will also be conducted on models of EF-G, with experimental collaboration).  (ii)  We will put a major effort on simulating the experimental single molecule studies of myosin V and in exploring explore the force dependence.  (iii)  We will continue to explore the energy transduction in ATPase, focusing on the torque generation in different mutants as well as the alteration in motor efficiency leakages and slippages due to mutations.  (iv) We will explore the effect of GPCR on the binding of GDP and GTP to G-Proteins.  (v) We will continue our effort to obtain a consensus about the GTPase reaction in solution and in G-proteins by comparing the results of different ab initio QM/MM free energy calculations and by analyzing key experiments using ab initio QM/MM calculations.
