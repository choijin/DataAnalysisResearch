<AbstractNarration>The project is developing a multidisciplinary, multi-campus program minor in 'energy science, technology, and policy', through a unique regional partnership consisting of public and private four-year and two-year colleges. Project objectives include: 1) successful design and implementation of a multi-institution energy education program that is leveraging institutional academic strengths and access to student populations at the different campuses; 2) design of a program valuable for students in both technical (i.e. architecture, engineering, and science) and non-technical (i.e. business, accounting, and general studies) majors, at both two-year and four-year colleges; 3) enhancement of STEM learning through multidisciplinary curricula, experiential learning through internships and research, and incorporation of stakeholder input in course and program development; and 4) recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented and underserved populations. Third party evaluation involving peer review and an outside evaluator are used for evaluation and assessment of the project outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is enhancing collaboration with STEM education community and  is helping to promote the two- to four-year college transition and beyond. By coordinating the program across multiple campuses, the project is facilitating articulation among institutions. Several of the schools involved have large populations of students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields, and all have significant programs aimed at recruitment and retention. The project is working to increase participation from those groups significantly.</AbstractNarration>

The program leveraged events which showcased undergraduate participation in internships, research and design activities, all of which served to further promote student learning opportunities.&nbsp; The study also revealed challenges related to institutional concerns about curriculum design and control, transfer agreements, cross-registration, and other procedural and assessment challenges which require the sustained commitment of educators and administrators and the channeling of external industrial, economic and political driving forces to develop effective programs.</p> <p>Broader impact:&nbsp;
