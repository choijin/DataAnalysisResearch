<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project transforms learning in introductory biology courses through a technology-supported, active-learning pedagogy that is informed by theory and evidence about learning systems. Specifically, this project overcomes students' problems in understanding complex biological systems and distributes learning in a way that actively engages students in and out of class. This project evaluates the effectiveness of the pedagogy, provides research on how introductory biology students articulate complex processes within and across biological systems, and investigates development of reflective and deep learning approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project results from a technology-rich approach, allowing instructors to communicate selected content outside of class and replacing traditional lectures with promising active learning strategies in class. An approach adapted from engineering that analyzes systems in terms of their Structure, Behavior, and Function is the theoretical framework employed to facilitate learning and understanding of biological systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project creates broader impacts by building and strengthening community within and across institutions. At the collaborating institutions alone, several hundred students are expected to benefit from the enhanced instructional framework. Dissemination of practices and curricular materials should impact students at multiple institutions and levels in the biology curriculum. Research findings are expected to be disseminated as oral and poster communication at local and national meetings of professional societies. Further, outcomes of this research are also expected to be disseminated via manuscripts targeted for science education journals. Contributions to the STEM education research literature should yield insights to the broader academic and science education research communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  With this project, Distributing the Load, we aimed to design instruction that would engage introductory biology students in active, model-based learning in and out of the classroom.    Outcome 1: Instructional design Using Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) theory (Goel et al., 1996) as our organizing framework, we developed a highly structured, model-based pedagogy that distributes and connects in- and out-of-class learning activities for an array of courses, including Introductory Biology, General Ecology, and Genetics. Using a theoretical framework developed for design-based systems enabled us to organize course content and to structure biology learning activities in ways that take into account the complexity of biological systems and the challenges inherent to learning about systems. We created, implemented and refined instructional materials including screencasts, reading guides, case studies, homework, in-class assignments, and a suite of assessment items. Across the life of the grant, our pedagogy has been implemented in five different courses over six semesters at two institutions. We estimate that well over 1000 students, to date, have been impacted by this instructional approach. To evaluate the redesigned pedagogy, we compared learning outcomes on identical final exam questions (knowledge and comprehension questions from published concept inventories) across multiple sections of the same course. Our data indicate that students in the redesigned course sections performed at least as well as students in traditional (comparison) course sections, when controlling for baseline knowledge. Furthermore, students in the redesigned sections reported being more engaged in the classroom, and (when not engaged) they were significantly more likely to assume responsibility for their lack of engagement (data presented at SABER, 2014 and 2015).        Direct outgrowths of this project have been: 1. the development of a series of rubrics that support the rapid generation of feedback on students? conceptual models, coupled with instructional activities to help students make use of that feedback; and, 2. the engagement of undergraduate learning assistants (LAs) to support highly structured pedagogy and active learning. LAs support collaborative learning in class, but also interact with students outside of the classroom, helping students work through homework activities, review graded assignments and exams, interpret rubrics, and more generally develop productive study habits.   Outcome 2: Research on student understanding of complex biological systems. Learning in the course was documented by collecting student responses to formative and summative assessments. We focused in particular on students? ability to reason about complex biological process and systems by scaffolding their learning in the context of systems-thinking abilities (Reinagel and Bray Speth, 2016). We also collected and analyzed students? conceptual models (of gene-to-phenotype, gene-to-evolution and carbon cycling) to begin exploring how these change over the course of one semester in response to rubric-based instructor feedback.        Outcome 3: Research on study strategies and self-regulated learning.  In a highly structured course, where many learning activities occur outside the classroom, students need to assume a great deal of responsibility and control. We hypothesized that students? ability to self-regulate their learning would be an important contributing factor to their outcomes in the course. We analyzed student learning outcomes (measured as exam grades) in relation to their reported use of self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies. This research has identified what SRL strategies our introductory biology students reported using when studying for exams, and which strategies are associated with better exam grades in our course (Sebesta and Bray Speth, 2017). Students who achieved better exam grades, and students who improved their grades over time in our course, also reported adopting metacognitive practices (self-evaluation and critical analysis of their own graded work). These findings suggest that the metacognitive component of self-regulation is particularly important in a highly structured learning environment, where the student needs to engage deeply and actively with their learning.
