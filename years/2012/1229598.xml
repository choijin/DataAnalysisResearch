<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this research are to develop a smart grid laboratory for modeling the power grid as integrated system of systems and analyzing its capability to transform into next generation sustainable energy infrastructure. The approach is to develop a research laboratory centered on the acquired real-time digital simulator that can perform scalable hardware-in-the-loop simulations with real-time power grid data and provide a platform for, device functionality and system integration testing, real-time power system studies, and conducting educational activities to develop next-generation workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is that this instrument acquisition will advance science and technology in the field, and enable students to grasp the physics behind power system dynamic phenomena. For example, real-time modeling and simulation can help to identify the effect of increased penetration of renewables on power system dynamics and methodology for improving power system reliability. The test bed provides rapid prototyping capability and allows hands-on research and training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is that this instrument acquisition will stand as backbone for a unique infrastructure for research and education, enabling sustainable and resilient modern smart power grid studies in the region, nationally and internationally. This acquisition will enhance economic growth, stimulating interdisciplinary research opportunities with increase participation of women and underrepresented groups, efficient transfer of research to the shop floor, and by developing highly trained workforce through real-time training of power grid professionals. Also, the proposed research and training activities will contribute to the power system security and strongly benefit our national agenda of power grid modernization.</AbstractNarration>

The laboratory is a unique state-of-the-art facility designed to perform advanced studies and tests in modern power and energy systems. The facility includes a real-time digital simulation test-bed that can perform smart grid device functional testing, system integration, real-time power system analysis, under and post-graduate education and professional training in grid modernization. Several hardware components for grid level studies, such as generator exciters, protection relays, power inverters, Smart Meters, etc. can be tested under real grid conditions in this facility. Power amplifiers are used to perform power hardware-in-the-loop testing and control hardware and software devices are used for testing and evaluating device functionality, high speed communications and real-time system studies. A server backbone, using powerful high performance servers, is interfaced with this facility to make it a unique power analysis laboratory. During 2012-2016 all the equipment has been purchased and the laboratory has been established in the EPIC building. Several research and education proposals have been written and several projects are currently successfully supported in the lab. From all the funding sources, Duke Energy, UNC Charlotte, EPIC, SEL and NSF-MRI, NSF-EPAS, DOE, Weaverly Lab, AREVA , Southern California Edison, OSIsoft and others around $ 5M has been invested in this lab up to date. Around 10 faculty members and 2 post-doc researchers are currently using the lab with expertise ranging from power system, communication, control, and computing. Over the last 4 years around 30 undergraduate, 50 graduate students and several interns have performed senior design, MS and PhD projects in the lab. Furthermore 2-4 under- and graduate classes are run in the lab on an annual basis. Currently, the lab is fully functional and sustainable with research projects. Lab manuals for experiments and operational and safety procedures have been developed and the lab is managed by a lab manager. We have developed a lab website where the models and experiments can be shared with power and energy community via a web portal. The MRI acquisition has provided us to develop a unique lab environment in the US that is internationally known.</strong></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/01/2016<br>      Modified by: Sukumar&nbsp;Kamalasadan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1229598/1229598_10200533_1457928332507_desgl--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1229598/1229598_10200533_1457928332507_desgl--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Smart Grid Lab"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1229598/1229598_10200533_1457928332507_desgl--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Smart Grid Lab"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Lab Set up based on MRI grant</div> <div class="imageCredit">UNCC</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sukumar&nbsp;Kamalasadan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Smart Grid Lab</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
