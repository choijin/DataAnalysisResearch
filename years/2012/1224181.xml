<AbstractNarration>The proposed research focuses on developing a mixed methods approach to research into the complex social, economic and environmental issues facing the Pribilof Islands. The student, Lyons, proposes using a place-making approach to understanding community instead of a more standard development approach. Lyons is a NSF-funded Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) student at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, and her research focuses on integrating ecological and anthropological data into tools that can inform fisheries and management decisions in the fishery-dependent communities of St. Paul and St. George in the Pribilof Islands of Alaska. With the use of a social-ecological system framework (that refers to complex interactions between the social and ecological environments) in which she highlights the notion of "place-making (in which a community establishes a coherent sense of place), this dissertation research attempts to develop techniques that can integrate the detailed ethnographic data collected by social scientists into management and policy decision-making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this grant fall into three categories: professional development, scholarship, and delivered products.     Professional development  Courtney Lyons, the graduate student funded on this grant, gained invaluable practical research experience. This experience served as the basis of her doctoral dissertation, which she successfully defended in May 2015, before graduating in August 2015. She has spent the past year working as a post-doctoral research associate at Washington State University.     Scholarship  The research conducted under this grant provided further insight into a pair of rural, resource-dependent, Alaska Native communities. In these communities fishing rights are devolved to corporations who manage these rights on behalf of residents. In St. George, residents and corporate decision-makers understand the role of fisheries within the community differently. These different narratives around place, or place-frames, cause conflict. However, in St. Paul, the corporation is run on-island, by residents, reducing the opportunity for conflict and empowering locals. This research indicates that development initiatives must take into account local place-frames if they are to be successful.     Products  In addition to a doctoral dissertation, this grant led to three publications:  Lyons, C., Carothers, C., and Reedy, K. 2016.
