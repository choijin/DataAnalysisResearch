<AbstractNarration>The UC Davis ADVANCE program utilizes a four-pronged approach to increasing the participation and advancement of women in the STEM fields. This approach includes: establishment of a Center for Advancing Multi-Cultural Perspectives on Science (CAMPOS), implementation of programs to reduce the impact of unconscious bias, empowerment of STEM women faculty, and a rigorous social science research and evaluation program that is designed to both inform and assess the innovative approach being utilized to create and sustain an inclusive STEM environment.  Underlying this multi-faceted approach is a keen focus on the recruitment, retention and advancement of Latina STEM faculty and the development of a STEM workforce that more closely resembles the region.  To that end, it is expected that this project will provide much-needed nuance to the understanding of how race, ethnicity and cultural differences interact with personal, familial, institutional, mentorship, and network influences to impact the attractiveness of the academic career path and the professional trajectories of Latina STEM faculty.  Given the vast network of UC campuses and innovative dissemination methods, the ADVANCE program at UC Davis will seminally impact the region and other universities nationwide.  As such, UC Davis will drive institutional change toward gender equity in numerous institutions of higher education, while promoting the career success of underrepresented STEM faculty and enhancing the potential of academic science through the inclusion of previously underrepresented perspectives.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The UC Davis ADVANCE program was funded by the National Science Foundation as an Institutional Transformation project to increase recruitment, retention and advancement of female STEM ladder rank faculty, with an emphasis on Latinas, in order to develop a more innovative STEM workforce that reflects the populations it serves. To reach its objectives, UC Davis ADVANCE created six initiatives:  Center for the Advancement of Multicultural Perspectives on Science (CAMPOS)   The goal of CAMPOS was to support discovery of knowledge by promoting women and underrepresented identities in science, starting with Latina STEM scholars, through an inclusive environment that is diversity-driven, mentorship-grounded, and career success-focused.  CAMPOS met its goal through the following accomplishment: Recruited 25 CAMPOS Faculty Scholars (including 15 Latina faculty) who are new STEM faculty who are engaged in promoting diversity in STEM through their research, teaching or service to the university.  Mentorship and Networking Initiative (MNI)   The goal of MNI was to provide information, guidance and networking opportunities for research and career success of women in STEM fields through both informal and formal programs.  MNI met its goal through the following accomplishments: 1) Mentored 43 new faculty (including 19 women STEM faculty) through development of LAUNCH committees, 2) Created the ADVANCE Scholar Award and Lecture Series to recognize faculty in STEM who are stellar scientists and mentors committed to creating an inclusive campus environment, 3) Promoted institutional membership in  the National Center for Faculty Diversity and Development so all faculty and graduate students have access to their resources and programs.  Inclusive Campus Climate Initiative (ICCI)  The goal of ICCI was to design and implement programs that will generate a more equitable assessment of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. More specifically, to develop and implement culturally-nuanced, evidence-based programs to (a) raise awareness of unconscious and institutional bias and (b) generate greater understanding of the ways in which STEM research communities can benefit from the contribution of greater diversity.  ICCI met its goals through the following accomplishments: 1) Created an institution-wide, faculty-led implicit bias training, Strength through Equity and Diversity (STEAD), mandatory for search committee members involved in faculty recruitment, 2) Trained over 1,450 faculty and graduate students, serving on search committees, on implicit bias and best practices for new faculty recruitment.  Policy and Practices Recruitment Initiative (PPRI)   The goal of PPRI was to conduct a systematic review of policies and procedures that impact recruitment, retention and career progress of faculty, and propose changes to policies and practices in order to eradicate implicit bias, promote diversity and eliminate inconsistency in implementation.  PPRI met its goals through the following accomplishments: 1) Implemented the use of Diversity Statements in faculty job applications, 2) Disseminated research findings and diversity best practices at many national and international meetings, including an invited presentation at the 2017 STEM Congress on Gender Equity in Berlin, 3) Engaged national groups working toward greater diversity in STEM; assisted UC Davis in applying for and being awarded as one of three founding institutions for the AAAS SEA Change Bronze Award in 2019, 4) Advised on the development of  family-friendly policies and recruitment strategies for improving diversity in candidate pools.  Capital Resource Network (CRN)  The CRN?s goal was to enhance support for the recruitment and retention of dual-career faculty beyond immediate campus programs to regional external employers and formalizing access to the labor market in the Davis-Sacramento region.  The CRN met its goal through the following accomplishments: 1) Launched a dual-career and integration program to improve recruitment and retention and assist prospective and new faculty, staff, and their families, 2) Provided employment consultations over 139 client referrals to date.  Social Sciences Research Initiative (SSRI)   The goals of SSRI were to conduct integrated empirical studies and data analyses that inform the program activities aimed at improving the recruitment and retention of Latina and other women STEM faculty at UC Davis, examine the impact of those interventions on the career progress of Latina and other women STEM faculty, and conduct a systematic study of the factors influencing the career paths of Latina scholars from faculty recruitment through mid-career.  SSRI met its goals through the following accomplishments: 1) Conducted qualitative interviews and coded data of past University of California President?s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program award recipients, Latina STEM faculty members from across the U.S., and CAMPOS Faculty Scholars, 2) Findings from SSRI interviews informed programmatic activities on the academic and career trajectories of Latinas and about moderating factors that influence how Latina STEM faculty have increased their success in academia, as well as potential barriers.
