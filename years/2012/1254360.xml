<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award from the Chemical Synthesis Program in the Division of Chemistry supports the work of Professor Donald A. Watson of the University of Delaware. Professor Watson will develop catalytic methods for the introduction of silicon groups into unsaturated hydrocarbon frameworks using silyl-Heck-type reactions. These new reactions will allow for the conversion of a variety of simple and widely available alkenes and dienes into high value organosilanes, which have broad applications in chemical synthesis of both materials and biologically active molecules. In addition, Professor Watson will conduct experiments directed at understanding the mechanisms of silyl-Heck reactions, both to increase fundamental understanding of these processes and to aid in developing improved reaction conditions for these and related transformations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful development of this research program is expected to have positive impact on a wide range of endeavors requiring the preparation of synthetic organic compounds, including pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials industries, as well as biological and chemical research.  Professor Watson will also develop an integrated undergraduate research program directed at involving underrepresented minority students in cutting-edge chemical research. The goal of this educational component of his research is to provide encouragement and opportunities to students who have traditionally not participated in undergraduate research. This is expected to benefit participating students through increased connection to their field of study, development of mentoring relationships, and building of critical thinking and research skills, all of which are expected to increase retention of these students in sciences and provide critical training for future employment or graduate studies.</AbstractNarration>
