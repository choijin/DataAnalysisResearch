<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to make contributions to statistical science in the areas of spatial statistics, network analysis, and Bayesian parametric and nonparametric modeling.  Underlying the methodological aspects of the research is a particular area of application, contextual effects and exposure analysis research.  Statistical methodology will be developed to improve the ability to characterize human activity patterns and social networks using state-of-the-art large-scale sample survey data. Specific contributions include the development of novel Bayesian stochastic models for multivariate spatial point patterns based on dependent nonparametric latent intensity functions. Statistical models will also be developed for spatially-referenced social networks; these models describe relational ties based on proximity in a random deformation of geographic space. Both classes of models will be thoroughly studied from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The statistical research focus of this project is deeply rooted in an area of application bridging the social, geographic, and health sciences.  Research on contextual effects aims to understand the consequences of social and environmental exposures on individual outcomes.  Efforts to quantify the influence of the multiple contexts to which individuals are exposed are limited due the inherent complexities of existing data sources, as well as those currently being collected using state-of-the-art GPS-based technologies.  This project aims to overcome these data challenges by introducing novel statistical methods and is expected to contribute generally to the field of statistics, as well as the motivating area of application.  Educational and training components of the project will reflect this multidisciplinary research setting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual Merit  Motivated by various areas of application in the social, environmental, and health sciences, this project supported the development of novel statistical methods and associated computational tools for data analysis.  In particular, we developed statistical models to uncover patterns in a particular type of data known as two-mode networks.  These networks capture connections between entities of two different types (e.g., ties between people and places they spend time as part of their routine activities).  We also introduced tools for comparing networks that differ in size and demonstrated that failing to account for size differences in statistical analyses of networks can produce erroneous conclusions.  Finally, we proposed new statistical models for spatial data in which the strength of spatial dependence varies across space.      In addition to contributing to the statistics literature, the project supported substantive investigations on topics such as the mirroring of income and educational inequality in the routine activity locations of individuals residing in the same neighborhood and the consequences of overlapping routine activities of neighborhood residents on neighborhood levels of crime.     Broader Impacts     In addition to supporting research on topics of great importance to society (e.g., adolescent health, crime), the broader impacts of this project included the training of several statistics graduate students in interdisciplinary research.  Weekly group meetings and informal seminar series allowed for regular interactions from project participants and others.  The results of this study have been broadly disseminated to the statistics and other scientific communities.
