<AbstractNarration>****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is the demonstration of an elementary quantum interface between two spatially separated solid-state quantum systems by using resonant light scattering, with the purpose of producing entanglement. It will be shown that InAs quantum dot nanostructures, with outstanding quantum-coherent optical properties, can generate single photons suitably-tailored for this purpose. In a phased approach indistinguishable photons from remotely located quantum dots will be produced using monochromatic continuous-wave, multichromatic and finally pulsed laser excitation. A tomographic analysis will be implemented to verify the generation of entanglement once a sufficiently large degree of two-photon interference has been obtained. Unique advantages of this approach lie in the relaxed requirements for frequency matching of photons as well as in reduced dephasing when compared to non-resonant excitation. A quantitative understanding of phenomena expected to hinder the manifestation of entanglement, in particular spectral diffusion, will be sought out. This research which lies at the boundary of condensed matter physics, nanoscience, and quantum optics will be an invaluable multidisciplinary experience for graduate and undergraduate students. A comprehensive outreach effort is designed to disseminate excitement and knowledge to a larger public by organizing professional development for teachers, high school senior student projects, campus tours, and classroom demonstrations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Quantum mechanical methods to encode, process and transmit information are expected to replace one day the current classical architecture of information technology. Quantum mechanical states produced by or encoded in condensed matter systems are particularly attractive to achieve this goal because of their intrinsic scalability and compatibility with existing micro and nanofabrication technology. The goal of this project is to use resonant light scattering from laser-driven InAs quantum dot nanostructures for the purpose of creating quantum mechanical superposition states between remotely located entities. The resulting quantum entanglement, in which the measurement of the state of one entity determines with certainty the outcome of the measurement of the state of the other entity, is a central resource in quantum information science. This project provides a previously unexplored route to entanglement in solids, relying on a resonant light generation mechanism that produces indistinguishable photons. Combining unique expertise from materials science, quantum optics and photonics engineering, this work will offer hands-on research experience to undergraduate and graduate students in a multidisciplinary environment. The project includes a comprehensive plan to make this knowledge accessible to a larger pubic, via professional development for teachers, high school senior project student participation, campus tours, and classroom demonstrations.</AbstractNarration>
