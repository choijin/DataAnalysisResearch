<AbstractNarration>1229258&lt;br/&gt;Gillikin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS)  equipped with multiple collectors, a high temperature pyrolysis system and automated sample introduction system for the Geology Department at Union College.  The instrument will support a range of research and research training in paleoclimatology and paleoceanography that requires analysis of stable isotope ratios recorded in marine and freshwater bivalves and in marine and lacustrine sediments.  The instrument will also support isotopic investigations of natural waters, glacial ice and plant materials for paleoenvironmental and paleoecological studies of climate dynamics and the global carbon cycle.   Union College in a non-Ph.D. granting institution and has a strong commitment to involving a diverse body of undergraduate students in faculty-mentored research.  Union College is a member of the Keck Geology Consortium and the instrument will serve students and faculty from several affiliated Keck institutions.  The PIs plans K-12 outreach activities aimed at at-risk and underrepresented youth for topical regional investigations of immediate societal relevance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>NSF-MRI funds were used to install a Thermo Scientific Delta advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) along with a Costech elemental analyzer (EA), Thermo Scientific Conflo, high temperature conversion elemental analyzer (TC/EA), Gas Bench II, and Sartaurius micro-balance at Union College. The instrumentation has been installed and is in operation since March 2013. The instrumentation has been used by 16 undergraduates in senior thesis research, three undergraduate independent research projects, as well as by three graduate students from three different universities. This resulted in 20 published abstracts presented at scientific meetings (largely by undergraduates) and one peer reviewed publication (the lead author was an undergraduate). Nine classes from three departments at Union and two classes from Vassar College used the instrumentation exposing an additional 160 students to the laboratory. We have developed several analytical protocols in the laboratory, some of which are on the cutting edge of science (e.g., N and H isotopes in biological carbonates). A two-day workshop exposed educators to the use of stable isotope geochemistry in their classes and research. Several collaborations have stemmed from this workshop. Several projects involving many avenues of isotope research are ongoing in the lab. The lab has become a regional center of stable isotope research. In total, the lab has run over 3,000 standards and nearly 7,000 samples in the past 2.5 years (despite several months of downtime due to a flood in the building and much time spent developing&nbsp;methods). In conclusion, this has been a very successful project.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/09/2015<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;P&nbsp;Gillikin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1229258/1229258_10216863_1447092108273_GBII--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1229258/1229258_10216863_1447092108273_GBII--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Union College's Stable Isotope Lab"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1229258/1229258_10216863_1447092108273_GBII--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Union College's Stable Isotope Lab"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Undergraduate student loads samples in the Gas Bench.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gillikin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;P&nbsp;Gillikin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Union College's Stable Isotope Lab</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
