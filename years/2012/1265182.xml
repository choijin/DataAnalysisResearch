<AbstractNarration>The work aims to substantially increase our knowledge of wintertime Pacific jet variability through a combination of statistical, synoptic-climatological and case study analyses. As the primary phenomenon at the interface between synoptic-scale weather systems and the large-scale circulation, upper tropospheric jets are particularly strong governors of regional climate. Despite the substantial influence that the wintertime Pacific jet has on both sensible weather and large-scale circulation within and beyond the Pacific basin, current understanding of its intraseasonal variability is far from complete. In prior work the team has identified two leading modes of this variability. In this project the team will identify preferred transitions between the leading modes of variability of the Pacific jet; the results of this will inform construction of composites of the basin-wide structure, evolution and weather features associated with each species of preferred transition.  Using the phase space analysis to expand the jet retraction climatology, the relationship between the areal extent of lower tropospheric cold air over the Siberia/Eurasia sector and the zonal extent of the Pacific jet will be examined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the Pacific jet is a hybrid of the polar and subtropical jets, reanalysis data will also be used to examine the behavior of these two components in identified cases of jet retraction as a first step toward segregating the population of retraction events into those forced primarily by extratropical and tropical variability, respectively. Finally, in order to better understand their underlying large- and synoptic-scale dynamics, detailed case study analyses of two representative cases of jet retraction employing output from fine-scale numerical simulations of the selected cases will be undertaken using the NCAR Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. This project will shed insights into wintertime Pacific jet variability; this has implications for improved prediction for the state of Hawaii as well as the west coast. Thus the broader impacts of this project are substantial.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Much of the work we just completed has involved gaining new understandings of aspects of the narrow, high-level wind speed maxima known as the jet stream.   We have examined the vertical superposition of the usually separate polar and subtropical jet streams and the influence that superposition has on producing severe weather both in the warm season (Winters and Martin 2014) and the cold season (Winters and Martin 2016, 2017).  We have also produced a climatology of the polar, subtropical and superposed jets in the Northern Hemisphere cold season (NDJFM) (Christenson et al. 2017).  The two leading types of variability of the Pacific jet are 1) extension/retraction wherein the jet extends eastward or retracts westward, and 2) north/south shift.  Griffin and Martin (2017) found that fluctuations between these types of variability are associated with significant temperature variations over North America during wintertime.  These results even suggested some utility for medium range (5-15 days) forecasting.  Handlos and Martin (2016) found that the large-scale environments that support Pacific basin jet superposition have many similarities to those associated with East Asian Winter Monsoon cold surges suggesting that the unusually strong jet streams may be a function of the winter monsoon. Finally, observational data to examine the distribution of lower level (850 hPa) temperatures, Martin (2015) documented a systematic contraction of the areal extent of the Northern Hemisphere wintertime (DJF) cold pool over the past seven decades.  The analysis suggests that the year-to-year variability of the areal extent of the cold pool is unrelated to variations in hemispheric snow cover, the Arctic Oscillation, or the phase and intensity of ENSO.  A modest statistical correlation with the East Asian winter monsoon does, however, appear to exist.  Overall the work has led to 7 publications, 2 Ph.D degrees and 3 Master of Science degrees.          Last Modified: 01/30/2018       Submitted by: Jonathan E Martin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
