<AbstractNarration>Experts in informal science education, citizen science, bats, and computer science are developing and evaluating, at Mammoth Cave National Park, a hybrid onsite/online proof-of-concept program for citizen scientists to observe and record (tag) roosting behaviors of Rafinesque's big-eared bats via streaming video. Participants are helping bat researchers document bat behaviors that provide insights into the benefits of communal roosting and interactions that serve to create or maintain social bonds and spread disease. The project is also developing a proof-of-concept mobile kiosk that links the citizen science bat study program to other exhibits at Mammoth Cave. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project personnel are conducting evaluation studies to identify best practices for engaging underserved populations and professional scientists in the study of bat behavior, and developing plans for scaling up the program to include video and educational resources from other bat sites around the country. Lessons learned from the project will inform development of a new, nationwide, online citizen science program focused on bat behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual merit:</strong></p> <p>The project outcomes related to intellectual merits include:</p> <p>1) Creating a successful proof-of-concept citizen science project to study bat behaviors using archived videos.The primary goal of this project was to design a proof-of-concept, online, citizen science project that uses archived videos to study bat behavior. The original plan was to use videos from a maternity colony of Rafinesque&rsquo;s big-eared bats (<em>Corynorhinus rafinesquii</em>) at Mammoth Cave National Park. However, multiple technical difficulties related to the Mammoth Cave National Park videos resulted in the need to find and use bat videos from another location. Therefore, videos of lesser long-nosed bats (<em>Leptonycteris yerbabuenae</em>) flying around a roost in Coronado National Memorial were used instead. Arizona BatWatch (www.arizonabatwatch.org) was launched in October 2016 as part of the Zooniverse platform. By the end of 2017, more than 3,000 people from across the world had made more than 70,000 classifications.</p> <p>2) Developing a method to statistically analyze data to ensure data quality in situations where inter-observer variability is high regardless of the observer&rsquo;s expertise.During beta testing of the project, the researchers discovered that sometimes the experts disagreed about whether a rare or hard to identify behavior was present when they watched the videos independently. With most of the videos containing multiple bats, all doing different things at the same time, it was easy for any individual, regardless of expertise, to miss a behavior. However, by looking at the aggregate of data individually collected by multiple people, most behaviors in the videos were identified by at least one individual within the group. Therefore, statistical analysis of the beta test data focused on two questions.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. Can a group of citizen scientists with a wide variety of experience levels code the videos as accurately as a group of bat researchers?</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;b. If so, how many citizen scientists need to watch each video to get results as good as the group of experts?This line of thinking turned out to be relatively innovative. A method, therefore, had to be developed to determine the answers to those two questions. This method can be used by other citizen science projects where inter-observer variability is high regardless of the observer&rsquo;s expertise. In the case of this project, six citizen scientists could code the videos as accurately as our team of six bat experts.&nbsp;<br /><br />3) Providing researchers and resource managers with data to help them better understand the behaviors of lesser long-nosed bats at a roost.The classifications made through Arizona BatWatch can help bat researchers gain a better understanding of the behaviors of bats as they fly around a roost. They can also help resource managers at Coronado National Memorial gain a better understanding of how the bats are interacting with the gate and answer other management questions they have regarding this colony of bats.</p> <p>4) Documenting a new species for Coronado National Memorial.An exciting and unexpected discovery resulted from the project when several participants spotted two small mammals near one of the gates. The small mammals were identified by Coronado National Memorial staff as long-tailed weasels (<em>Mustela frenata</em>). This was the first documented sighting of a long-tailed weasel in the park. Thanks to this project and the citizen scientists who participated in it, Coronado National Memorial now has a new species on its list of animals that call the park home.</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts:</strong></p> <p>The project outcomes related to broader impacts center on increases in public knowledge, attitudes, and skills.Citizen science engages the public in scientific research.
