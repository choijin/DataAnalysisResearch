<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program award is to investigate the relationships between transportation networks of different scales/sizes, learn how to quantify these relationships, and discover the implications for transportation planning. The research focuses on three examples where scale and size are important issues: freight models where a multistate or national scale is considered in addition to a local scale, allocation of transportation funds within a region, and transportation networks that change rapidly with time (e.g., due to accidents or other disruptions). Current multi-scale models are often constructed in an ad hoc manner, without understanding the fundamental connections between the models. The research investigation in this grant will be guided by the conjecture that "mixing" models incorporating simplified versions of one model into another, rather than separating them completely is the key to efficiently finding consistent solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this work will allow network models to represent much larger regions, specifically supporting improved transportation planning, but also contributing to multi-scale network models in other domains. A complementary education and outreach plan to the research plan has four major components. First, active-learning curricula will be developed for transportation engineering and network analysis courses, building on recent pedagogical research. Second, a library of state-of-the-art transportation algorithm codes will be made public, allowing students to work with large-scale practical data in course projects and allowing practitioners to experiment with state-of-the-art models, facilitating technology transfer. Both the code and curriculum materials will be released in open-access form, free of charge. Third, the PI will actively recruit and mentor undergraduate and graduate researchers, interfacing with university programs to identify talented students from underrepresented groups. Finally, a new course in multi-scale modeling will be developed, based on the research results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Network models are used to forecast how transportation systems will evolve in the future, and how we should best plan for them in the present.  There is a tradeoff between modeling small areas (a single corridor or neighborhood) at a high level of detail, or large areas (metropolitan regions) in a more approximate manner.  The theme of this project is developing methods to coordinate both types of models, integrating them in a consistent way to achieve more useful results for planning.  We term such models "multiresolution."  Over the course of the project, this theme was explored in several ways.  Most significantly, we developed a new algorithm (DSTAP) which allows large regional networks to be "partitioned" into smaller pieces and solved independently, with mathematical proofs of correctness (no error in the solution).  Our experiments in the Austin network show considerable reductions in the time needed to solve such models, which is critical for multiresolution models.  Other research highlights include multiresolution approaches for forecasting the impacts of connected and automated vehicles, and for dynamic traffic control (such as managed lanes).Among these results, we showed that while automated vehicles can potentially increase roadway capacity at a local level (by driving more efficiently or coordinating at intersections), there is a risk that they may actually reduce overall system performance due to interactions between different intersections and routing decisions.  This "paradoxical" finding suggests that automated vehicles should be introduced carefully and thoughtfully, and are not a "cure-all" solution for traffic problems.  The project also led to several advances in engineering education and curriculum.  A new, freely-available textbook was produced in the area of transportation network analysis (the first in thirty years).  The first-year civil engineering course at UT Austin was redesigned around a semester-long project to introduce students to the field, and to engineering design at an appropriate level.  New curricula were produced for three other courses, focusing on computer programming skills, and all are made publicly available online.  The project supported and mentored many graduate and undergraduate students over its duration.  Several of these students are now faculty members nationally and internationally, leading their own research in transportation engineering; many others are currently working in engineering practice.
