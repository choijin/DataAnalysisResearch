<AbstractNarration>Large comparative studies of fly genes are currently limited to mosquitoes and the Drosophila (fruit fly) complex. Drosophila belongs to Schizophora, a group of flies with over 50,000 species that includes model organisms, disease vectors, and agricultural pests. Schizophoran phylogenetic relationships are poorly understood because flies diversified very rapidly in the past, leaving few genetic clues to decipher relationships.  The investigators will use a new and innovative approach that harnesses the power of transcriptome DNA sequencing to reveal thousands of genetic clues to decipher this rapid radiation of species.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will generate an ortholog database that will allow other insect researchers to study genes across a wide diversity of insects. The study will advance our understanding of insect evolution by exploring the evolution of a wider range of genes. The researchers will also provide comprehensive training to a PhD student and several undergraduates in modern evolutionary research. Fly biodiversity and evolution-based outreach will be developed and presented through collaboration with Nature Research Center in Raleigh, NC. Results of the study will be used in educational materials to promote research, the understanding of evolution, and species conservation to the public and k-16.</AbstractNarration>
