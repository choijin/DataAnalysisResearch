<AbstractNarration>Over the last several years, Georgetown University has espoused a&lt;br/&gt;policy of growth for its science departments.  This project supports&lt;br/&gt;Georgetown University's growth goals by positing a multifaceted&lt;br/&gt;research program that explores new techniques for processing large&lt;br/&gt;collections of text data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project examines how both new and existing text processing methods&lt;br/&gt;may be applied to a variety of open problems across different&lt;br/&gt;disciplines within computer science.  Research activities include text&lt;br/&gt;mining for large-scale document collections; machine learning&lt;br/&gt;techniques for detecting malicious executables; information retrieval&lt;br/&gt;methods for performing proactive digital forensic investigations; text&lt;br/&gt;processing approaches for preventing privacy breaches in encrypted&lt;br/&gt;voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication; and data mining and sentiment&lt;br/&gt;detection methods for automated content analysis of large quantities&lt;br/&gt;of political science texts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To support these goals, the project includes the creation of a&lt;br/&gt;next-generation infrastructure for large-scale text processing.&lt;br/&gt;Data-intensive tasks will use interconnected front-end systems,&lt;br/&gt;connected via high-speed networking to scalable back-end storage&lt;br/&gt;solutions.  The infrastructure supports the development and testing of&lt;br/&gt;novel text processing algorithms on very large corpora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's themes of text processing and information assurance have&lt;br/&gt;been integrated into the undergraduate and graduate curricula at&lt;br/&gt;Georgetown University.  More broadly, the project benefits society by&lt;br/&gt;improving the ability to (1) process large quantities of information,&lt;br/&gt;(2) identify malicious applications, and (3) improve the resiliency of&lt;br/&gt;digital communication networks to eavesdropping attacks.  The project&lt;br/&gt;broadens the participation in research through the University's Summer&lt;br/&gt;Programs for High School Students and the Center for Multicultural&lt;br/&gt;Equity and Access.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The key goal of the project was to provide the needed infrastructure for text related research.  Prior to the granting of this proposal, the infrastructure needed to conduct such research was unavailable at Georgetown University.  We compared multiple architectures proposed by multiple vendors and identified the equipment to be purchased; we then purchased and installed the selected equipment.  Although the proposal contained an itemized list of proposed equipment, we conducted a more recent study of available equipment prior to committing to purchase.  The proposed list was a year old by the time of the proposal award.  We acquired equipment similar in cost to the equipment initially proposed; however, the equipment obtained was vastly superior (faster and a greater number of processors, greater storage, faster interconnect) to that proposed.  Discounts and equipment enhancements were obtained due to timing and acquisition incentives.   Research projects supported by the equipment acquired via the funds provided by this award included: text mining research involving sentiment analysis, text extraction, and other natural language processing; user readability targeting in medical searching; research in machine learning applications; and security research including data forensics, attack defenses, and law-enforcement wiretap data auditing services.  Faculty members and industrial researchers, in addition to the proposal investigators, have used the installed equipment.  High school, undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students participated in research efforts using the equipment acquired by the funds provided by this grant.  Multi-disciplinary teams were created to support the research efforts proposed.  Additionally, the equipment purchased by this award resulted in serendipitous collaboration.
