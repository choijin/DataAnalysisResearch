<AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place July 2013 at the Universidad del Valle in Guatemala.  Organized by Dr. Marshall S. Poole, Professor in the Department of Communications at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, the PASI aims to introduce junior researchers to methods in computation-based discovery (CBD).  In searching for  solutions to major problems (e.g., biodiversity, modeling of natural systems, water ecology, and others), researchers across the natural and social sciences as well as the humanities and arts are generating massive and/or highly complex data sets that extend well-beyond humans' capacities to perceive or analyze without sophisticated technological augmentation.  CBD allows researchers to gather, transform, and analyze data from a range of sources, including, for example, sensors, video archives, telescopes, and supercomputers.  Thus, access to advanced computational resources and also to sophisticated skills in data acquisition, management, transformation, visualization, analytics, and preservation, are highly valued by researchers.  For example, sophisticated visualization tools and techniques enhance human understanding of extreme, complex and/or abstract data sets, making it easier to see patterns and relationships and to form or test hypotheses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Institute will focus on CBD technical and analytical methods and help investigators apply these to their own research.  Key goals are to (1) expand participants' knowledge of high performance computing (HPC) and specialized tools and techniques that support CBD involving massive or complex data sets; (2) provide hands-on experience in exploring large and complex data sets using easily accessible desktop open source tools; (3) bring researchers from underrepresented populations into the CBD field; and (4) foster new collegial partnerships that stimulate both national and international co-operative research among the presenters and attendees.  In addition, the PASI will also provide up-to-date information on the deliberations of the PASI to a wider audience through a web page to disseminate results and reports of the meeting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute: Methods in Computation-Based Discovery   On July 15 through 26, 2013, 30 graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty from all over the Americas attended the Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) on Methods in Computation-Based Discovery.  The PASI, held at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, in Guatemala City, was supported by the Office of International Studies and Education of the National Science Foundation. The main objectives of the PASI were to expand participants' knowledge of high performance computing and theory and methods of data driven discovery and to allow them to foster new collegial networks to stimulate both national and international cooperative partnerships. The PASI brought together scholars from a number of nations, including Canada, Columbia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, and the U.S.  They formed a vibrant group that addressed major research challenges using advanced technologies.  The group was highly interdisciplinary, representing fields as diverse as Astrophysics, Computer Science, Sociology, Chemistry, History, and Information Science. The PASI was a collaboration of the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, the Institute for Computing in Humanities,Arts, and Social Science (I-CHASS) at the University of Illinois, the Organization of American States (OAS), the  Advanced Research and Technology Collaboratory of the Americas (ARTCA), the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois, the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), and RedClara, Latin America's largest academic computing network with membership of more than 1200 universities.  The online application services were provided by the National University Community Research Institute. The curriculum was designed to present lectures in the morning, followed by hands-on labs and group project sessions in the afternoons.  Instructors included:   Luis Furlan, Center for Studies in Applied Informatics, Universidad del Valle de Guatemala   Cinda Hereen, Computer Science, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign   Alan Craig, Human-Computer Interaction, I-CHASS, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign   Jose Castro, Computer Research Center, Costa Rica Institute of Technology   Donna Cox, eDream, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign  Robert Patterson, eDream, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Luis Nunez, Computational Physics, Universidad de los Andes, Columbia; Academic Relations Manager for RedCLARA Mauricio Carillo-Tripp, Cinestav, Mexico Jame Ernesto Forero-Romero, Universidad de los Andes, Columbia Alvaro de la Ossa, Computer Science and Cognitive Science, University of Costa Rica and National Center for Advanced Technology Studies (CENAT), Costa Rica Richard Marciano, School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Marshall Scott Poole, I-CHASS and Communication, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign      Topics of the workshops included:  Foundations of Data Science Augmented Reality Data Visualization 3D Molecular Analysis Using Large Databases to Understand the Structure of the Universe Machine Learning (Supervised and Unsupervised) Multi-Agent Systems Creating and Managing Large Record Databases Foundations of Computational Social Science   The course was supported by a Moodle which provided online resources and enabled group conferencing.  In addition to the workshops and group work, participants also had the opportunity to visit the faculty and facilities of the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, including its Chemical Engineering Lab, the Center for Environmental Studies and Biodiversity, and the Center for Research in Botanics.  They also took several field trips to local points of interest including a trip to Antigua-Guatemala's former capital and to Lake Atitlan in the Guate...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
