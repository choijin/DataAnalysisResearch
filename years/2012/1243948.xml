<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program (A) of the Division of Chemistry, the Molecular Biophysics Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Physics of Living Systems Program of the Division of Physics, Prof. Paul M. Champion at Northeastern University will use modern, ultrafast laser methods to study the ways in which biomolecular systems use thermal energy to carry out and control biochemical reactions.  In particular, Prof. Champion and his research group will use vibrational coherence spectroscopy (VCS) and femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering (FSRS) will be used to probe the ways in which low-frequency vibrations of complex biomolecules influence or modify the reactivity of large biomolecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the chemical reactivity of biomolecular systems is critical towards understanding the way that biological systems operate at the macroscopic scale.  Advances in this field will yield advances in medicine and biotechnology.  The undergraduate and graduate students working with Prof. Champion will receive excellent training in cutting-edge science at the intersection of Biology and the Physical Sciences.  Prof. Champion is also actively collaborating with scientists from underrepresented groups at Northeastern as well as in Puerto Rico.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have studied the response of proteins to very short laser light pulses. These laser pulses can be used to interrogate the structural dynamics of the proteins and the chemical reactions that they catalyze. Because the pulses of light are so short (10-100 femtoseconds, or 10-14 -10-13 s), they contain many electromagnetic frequencies.  These different frequencies excite the motions of the biomolecule by either a Raman process or by initiating a very fast chemical reaction. We observed and studied, for the first time, certain key low-frequency coherent motions of heme proteins. These coherent motions (or "vibrational modes") are functionally important in directing the ligand binding and electron transport roles of these proteins. The energies of these motions are less than thermal energy at room (or body) temperature so, in living systems, these modes are actively excited by the transfer of thermal energy from the surroundings into the protein. From these studies, we are learning how biological molecules extract energy from the environment and transform it for use to perform biochemical work.  The very short laser pulses also allow us to probe the population kinetics of biomolecules. We can (perhaps uniquely) do this as a function of temperature (from 20 K to 300 K) over a very wide dynamic range in time (9 orders of magnitude) and with extremely high signal-to-noise. In such studies, we found that heme proteins bind ligands in a process that is very different from what was thought to be the case theoretically.  Because the iron atom of the heme system changes its "spin" from S=2 to S=0 as a ligand binds, it was thought that the reaction was "spin-forbidden" and classified theoretically as a "non-adiabatic" reaction (where excited-state electronic surfaces must participate as the system passes over the reaction barrier).  In contrast, we found experimentally that spin-selection does not play a role in the reaction and that the various spin states of the iron atom must be "entangled", which allows an adiabatic ligand binding reaction to take place involving only the ground electronic-state surface.  In other kinetic studies, we determined that proton transfer along "wires" within proteins can take place on the 400 ps time-scale and that quantum mechanical "tunneling" can be a major proton transport channel, even at room temperature. Tunneling is a phenomenon that allows electrons and protons to move to different locations and break and form bonds without having to surmount potential energy barriers. It is kind of like moving a massive object through a hill rather than over a hill. Quantum mechanics allows this to happen even though it might seem impossible at first. Our experimental studies have led to a proposal on how quantum mechanical tunneling of protons can help "pump" them across the mitochondrial membrane, even against a negative gradient of protons. This leads to kinetic trapping of the proton charges, which are then used as the power source for ATP production in living systems. In the process of our studies, we also improved on theoretical models that describe proton tunneling and applied them to enzymatic reactions that abstract hydrogen from carbon atoms through a key biologically important proton-coupled electron transfer reaction.
