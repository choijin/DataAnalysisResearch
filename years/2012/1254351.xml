<AbstractNarration>PI: Li, Fanxing&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1254351&lt;br/&gt;Institution: North Carolina State University&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER:Bi-Functional Redox Materials with Facilitated Oxygen Transport for Catalytic Conditioning of Biomass-Derived Syngas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biomass can be converted into electricity, hydrogen, and liquid fuels through gasification.  However, the removal of tars represents a critical challenge to biomass gasification. The existing tar removal catalysts are only active for tar reforming and/or partial oxidation in the presence of an external oxidant, the redox catalyst.  This project will develop a catalyst that also functions as a oxidant. The redox catalyst is composed of a primary metal oxide for oxygen storage, a mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC) support for O2- transport, and a catalytically active surface for tar reforming/oxidation. The embedded oxygen can make the catalyst more active by participating in tar oxidation reactions. The catalyst will be operated under a cyclic redox mode for lattice oxygen replenishment. This project will investigate (i) lattice O2- migration in the redox catalyst and the effect of MIEC support on catalyst activity; (ii) the effect of catalyst surface on its activity and the surface reaction scheme for tar oxidation; (iii) redox catalyst optimization strategy and performance evaluations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The project will devote a concerted effort towards understanding the surface reaction and O2- conduction schemes of the unique redox catalyst, which can be highly effective for tar removal. Besides acting as an active catalyst, the embedded lattice oxygen can be shuttled to the catalyst surface, by the MIEC support, for tar oxidation.  The MIEC support will also increase the catalyst's sintering resistance by creating a solid-state O2- pathway even at low porosity. The lattice oxygen can also increase the catalyst lifetime by retarding coke formation and sulfur poisoning. The research will provide essential guidance on redox catalyst design and optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;Development of an effective and robust tar removal catalyst can be a key enabling step for the deployment of gasification based biomass-to-liquid fuel processes. This project will provide fundamental insights for designing an optimized catalyst. The unique concept coupled with the carefully designed research plan will likely to result in a viable catalyst for sustainable biomass conversion through gasification. The PI will also integrate his research with education. To inspire K12 students' interest in STEM and sustainable energy, the PI will develop and present an interactive module named "Engineering Our Way out of Global Warming" to both national and international audiences. A parallel Apple/Android App, "Engineer's Toolbox for Global Warming" will also be launched in collaboration with NC State Computer Science Department and Argonne National Lab.</AbstractNarration>
