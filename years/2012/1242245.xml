<AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place on January 2-15, 2013 at the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María in Valparaiso, Chile.  Organized by Dr. Lorena Barba, an assistant professor in Mechanical Engineering at Boston University, the institute will consist of a series of advanced lectures and hands-on tutorials on the mathematical models that describe our understanding of ocean phenomena affecting coastal areas, and the use of state-of-the-art computer simulations of these physical processes to predict their effects.  The PASI will bring together distinguished scientists in applied mathematics, ocean dynamics, physical oceanography, atmospheric and ocean coupled phenomena, computer science, and civil engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this PASI is to train a cohort of young scientists in this rapidly growing field, providing a solid foundation for their involvement in active research in tsunami and storm-surge simulation.  In addition to the exposure and mentoring of young scientists to state-of-the-art methods in modeling, this PASI will foster international collaboration among researchers from the US and the Americas.  Dr. Barba will lead mentoring activities for the young researchers attending, and strive for broad participation by leading efforts to recruit student participants from underrepresented groups.  The dissemination plan for this PASI includes the production of videos and materials that will be made freely available online.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) is an instructional event of several days duration aimed at the advanced graduate, post-doctoral and junior faculty level. This PASI, titled "The science of predicting and understanding tsunamis, storm surges, and tidal phenomena", was held on January 2&ndash;3, 2013 at Universidad T&eacute;cnica Federico Santa Mar&iacute;a, in Valpara&iacute;so, Chile. The awarded funding permitted 8 world-renowned scientist to deliver multi-day courses on the field of modeling wave and ocean phenomena. Travel funding was provided to 16 participants from the US and 9 participants from Latin America (with additional support from the Santiago office of ONR Global). Local support was made available for an additional 12 local participants, and 4 participants were self-funded. The project provided training to more than 40 participants at the postgraduate level. In the last few years, several devastating events have been due to tsunamis and storm surges, including the deadly Indian Ocean Tsunami (2004), hurricane Katrina (2005), tropical cyclone Nargis in Burma (2008), and the tsunamis of Chile (2010) and Tohoku, Japan (2011). These natural disasters have cost hundreds of thousands of lives and billions of dollars in losses, and brought to the peak of global consciousness the need to increase our understanding of the natural phenomena that caused them. With todayÆs high-performance computing (HPC) capacity reaching levels that allow realistic simulations at a global scale, the prospect of using modeling and simulation with predictive capacity seems at last achievable.  On the other hand, the international reach of these natural events calls for developing strong ties of collaboration. This PASI is thus timely, of international relevance, and can be a catalyst for much-needed collaboration across the Americas.  This PASI aimed to be a catalyst for collaboration and provide training to a top-class set of young researchers throughout the Americas. The PASI consisted of talks, tutorials and hands-on sessions in a computer lab. It had the following sessions:    Mathematical foundations Finite-volume solutions Lab session: Using GeoClaw Theory and modeling of coastal hazards Large-scale, wave-driven problems Lab session: COMCOT and COULWAVE Modeling tides and storm surges Discontinuous Galerkin models  In addition, there were the following invited talks:  Keynote Lecture tiled "Crustal Deformations Associated with Earthquakes," by Prof. Sergio Barrientos, Scientific Director of the Seismological Service of the University of Chile. Invited Talk titled "Nonlinear Propagation of Storm Waves: Infragravity Wave Generation and Dynamics," by Prof. Rodrigo Cienfuegos, of Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica de Chile.  The courses covered the numerical methods used to discretize and solve problems by computer simulation, and also covered community codes used in the field, such as:    COMCOT, the Cornell multi-grid coupled tsunami model COULWAVE, the Cornell University long and intermediate wave modeling package GeoClaw, the two-dimensional depth-averaged finite-volume code from the University of Washington tsunami modeling group COAMPS, the coupled ocean/atmosphere prediction system of the Naval Research Laboratory ADCIRC, the US NavyÆs finite-element coastal circulation model FVCOM, the 3D coastal ocean circulation model developed by University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. FVCOM is being used in 38 countries by more than 1000 registered users and institutions.      The survey of participants scored (on a scale of 1 to 5) the logistical success with a 4.62, the overall experience with 4.81 and the lab experience with a 4.63.  All participants had the opportunity to interact with world-leading researchers in the subjects of tsunami, storm surges and ocean phenomena.
