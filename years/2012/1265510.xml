<AbstractNarration>The award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in "A Conference on Hilbert Function Spaces" that will be held May 20-24, 2013, in Gargnano, Italy, at a facility that belongs to the University of Milan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event is intended to furnish a venue in which the relevant international mathematical community is able to assess the "state of the art" in an important and active area of mathematics. The theory of Hilbert function spaces lies at the crossroads of complex analysis and operator theory, with emerging ties to other disciplinary areas (e.g., probability). The participants include most of the recognized world leaders in the area. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
