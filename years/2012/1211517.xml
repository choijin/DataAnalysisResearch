<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on the free boundary problems that arise in the description of phase transitions. One project is to develop a unified well-posedness framework for the Stefan problem in both presence and absence of surface tension. In the latter case, we will show how the regularity of the boundary is naturally tied to the norms weighted by the Neumann derivatives of the temperature. After obtaining the (singular) vanishing surface tension limit, we will understand the long-term non-linear behavior of initially small solutions in the absence of surface tension, combining the energy methods and  Harnack-type bounds to obtain sharp lower bounds for the time-decay of Neumann derivatives. We also focus on the dynamic instabilities arising in the Stefan problem with surface tension. In particular, we will try to rigorously describe the melting rates for the cavity-filling parabolic free-boundary flows, exploiting their connection to their natural scaling laws and developing robust energy techniques to perform the non-linear analysis.  Moreover, we will study the continuum limit behavior of the Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA), a probabilistic lattice model giving rise to various morphological patterns associated with the ill-posed nature of the Hele-Shaw problem with external injection. Finally, we will examine the dynamic stability of galaxies as described by the spherically symmetric Einstein-Vlasov system, where the associated ADM-mass will be shown to be coercive on the set of measure preserving perturbations of galaxies with suitably small central red-shift, upon which we will investigate the full non-linear&lt;br/&gt;stability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free boundaries are ubiquitous in the description of various physical phenomena, such as melting, crystal growth, shocks, and nucleation. A detailed phenomenological understanding of instabilities, morphological changes, or stable regimes in such problems is thus of fundamental importance.The proposed investigation of the vanishing surface tension limit will establish a rigorous link between the micro-and the macro-scale version of the Stefan problem, while the study of long-term behavior of solutions will reveal an intricate stabilizing mechanism for parabolic phase transitions in absence of surface tension. The study of melting rates for the Stefan and Hele-Shaw problem aims at clarifying the link to their natural scaling invariances.  Moreover, inspired by the work of physicists Witten and Sander from 1980's, we will investigate the link between the lattice probabilistic evolution mentioned above, and its ill-posed continuum analog. DLA grows unstable patterns, that exhibit certain statistical universality typical of crystal growth---and it presents a challenge for a good continuum model description. The study of galaxy dynamics strives to rigorously confirm the stability scenario conjectured by the astrophysicist Zel'dovitch et al. back in the 1960's.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The PI left the USA to assume an academic position in the UK in  September 2013.  Prior to leaving he filed a grant transfer request.   Since then, the transfer request was never resolved,  despite numerous  attempts to do so,  which included email correspondence  to the Program Manager.  In meanwhile, after leaving the US,  the PI did  not use the grant funds and  therefore there is nothing to report. Please see below correspondence: From: msteuerw@nsf.gov  Sent: 20 August 2015 21:54 To: Hadzic, MahirCc: msteuerw@nsf.gov Subject: Re: grant report 1211517  Dear Mahir,Thanks for your email.For the time being,   please just ignore the report reminders.  The change of PI request has not been acted on.    In light ofthe nature of the work to be done on this grant,   the resourcesremaining in the grant, the resources available to Jared then,  and the Career proposal he planned, it seemed sensible to waita bit.    As you can see from public information, Jared did get aCareer grant.    What it covers seems to preclude the possibilityof a change of PI.    If that turns out to be the case, the changerequest will be declined   and we'll ask to have the final reportwaived.    I will discuss this with the program officer for theCareer grant when he returns. On the other hand, if a change of PI makes sense and is recommended,   then the grant would have tobe extended in duration,   and in connection with that I would askthat an annual report for the   past year be waived, and Jaredwould have to write the next report.  Ignore the Project Outcomes Report requests also.    I don't know whether NSF has any procedure for that report if the project  doesn't run to completion.  I'll tell you if I find out.    All thereport reminders are generated automatically by NSF's   softwaresystems that track reports.  So there is no person here   who issending reminders or getting upset by no response.  I'm sorry to reply late.  It has been a Chinese-curse interestingyear.    I hope all is well with you.  Best,Mike          Last Modified: 02/26/2016       Submitted by: Mahir Hadzic]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
