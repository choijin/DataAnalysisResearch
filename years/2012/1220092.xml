<AbstractNarration>This study examines the impact of the newly revised Advanced Placement (AP) Biology and Chemistry courses on students' understanding of and ability to apply scientific inquiry, on students' confidence in successfully engaging in college-level material, and on students? enrollment and persistence in college STEM majors. AP Biology and Chemistry courses represent an important educational program that operates at a large scale across the country. The extent to which the AP curricula vary in implementation across the schools in the study is also examined to determine the range of students' opportunity to learn the disciplinary content and the knowledge and skills necessary to engage in inquiry in science. Schools that are newly implementing AP courses are participants in this research and the challenges and successes that they experience are also a component of the research plan. Researchers at the University of Washington, George Washington University and SRI International are conducting the study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research design for this study includes both formative components and a randomized control experiment. Formative elements include observations, interviews and surveys of teachers and students in the AP courses studied. The experimental design includes the random assignment of students to the AP offered and follows the performances of the treatment and control students in two cohorts into their matriculation into postsecondary educational experiences. Surveys measure students' experiences in the AP courses, their motivations to study AP science, the level of stress they experience in their high school coursework and their scientific inquiry skills and depth of disciplinary knowledge. The study examines the majors chosen by those students who enter into colleges and universities to ascertain the extent to which they continue in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project informs educators about the challenges and successes schools encounter when they expand access to AP courses. The experiences of the teachers who will be teaching students with variable preparation inform future needs for professional development and support. The project provides estimates of the impact of students' AP-course taking on their progress into postsecondary educational experiences and their intent to continue to prepare to be future engineers and scientists. It informs policy efforts to improve the access to more rigorous advanced courses in STEM and provides strong experimental evidence of the impact of AP course taking.  The project has the potential to demonstrate to educational researchers how to study an educational program that operates at scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study contains the first experimental evaluation of the Advanced Placement (AP) program, the most widely-implemented advanced curriculum in US secondary schools.  We recruited 23 schools in 11 school districts from across the United States.  Eligible schools included ones that had not offered AP Biology or AP Chemistry in recent years; were willing to add such a course and comply with study protocol; and had more students that were deemed by the school to be eligible to take this AP science course than could be served in one class so as to supply a sufficiently-sized control group. Of the 23 schools, 12 schools added AP Chemistry, 10 schools added AP Biology, and 1 school added both courses. The study includes two waves of schools (those that offered the course for the first time in 2013 and those that offered it for the first time in 2014), with the earlier-joining schools offering the course to multiple cohorts. The study includes 47 school by cohort groups.  Participating districts included Anaheim Union High School District, California; East Side Union High School District, California; Lynwood Unified School District, California; Jefferson Parish, Louisiana; Education Achievement Authority, Michigan; Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, North Carolina; Winston- Salem/Forsyth Schools, North Carolina; Cranston Public Schools, Rhode Island; El Paso Independent School District, Texas; Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, Tennessee; and Richmond Public Schools, Virginia.  Each participating school identified students that the school deemed eligible to take the new AP Biology or Chemistry course in the spring of the prior year. We treated all eligible students who assented to participate in the study and who obtained consent from their parent or guardian as study participants. Upon receipt of signed consent/assent forms, we randomly offered a subset of participating students enrollment in the newly-offered course. The study includes a total of 27 teachers and 1,820 students (with an average of approximately 19 students per AP class).  We developed, validated, and administered an end-of-year assessment that measures students' scientific inquiry skills. Importantly, this instrument was administered to students in both treatment and control groups and is designed to measure general inquiry skills (e.g., how to analyze data) rather than test specific content knowledge in Biology or Chemistry.  We also administered a questionnaire administered concurrently with the assessment that asks students' a number of questions about their most recent science class, their confidence and interest in science, and the impact that their most recent science course had on their physical and emotional health (a frequently-used technique for measuring perceived stress), among other outcomes of interest.  We are in the process of completing analysis of the results of the study (i.e., the formative and summative analyses) and will be publishing our results in peer-reviewed journal articles.  We found large positive effects of taking an AP science course on students' skill in science, with treatment members scoring one-quarter of a standard deviation higher than control group members on measures of science skill. Taking AP science also increased students' interest in pursuing a STEM major, yet decreased their confidence in their ability to complete college courses in science, their grades, and their self-reported physical and emotional health.  We find some evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effects.  For example, the estimated impact of taking AP science on science skill is much stronger for those who took the recommended prerequisite courses (0.31 s.d.) than those who did not (0.05 s.d.), and those with better prior math skills experienced greater impacts in their science skill, with AP science raising science skill (up 0.38 s.d.) for those with above median math scores (among students in the study), and insignificantly raising science skills (up 0.11 s.d.) for those below median scores.  Finally, we find that all of the positive impact on interest in pursuing a STEM degree is coming from underrepresented minorities (i.e., students who were Black, Hispanic, Native-American, or Multiracial) (URMs): STEM interest increases 23 percentage points for underrepresented minorities and insignificantly decreases for non-URMs by 8 percentage points. This difference in impacts, would serve to more than eliminate the baseline difference in STEM degree interest (69 percent for non-URMs versus 57 percent for URMs).
