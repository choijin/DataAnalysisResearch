<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Scholars Program is supporting three cohorts of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need in attaining baccalaureate degrees in chemistry, environmental forest biology, environmental resources engineering and environmental science at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry. In addition to scholarship aid, the project is engaging scholars through a series of activities with a unifying theme of global environmental change, including cross-disciplinary and career-preparation seminars, service-learning projects which emphasize science communication, and capstone research experiences. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its comprehensive plan to support scholars through a rigorous cross-disciplinary academic program in an area of national need. Broader impacts include leveraging partnerships to support energetic recruiting for a diverse talent pool and to provide internship and career-advancement opportunities to connect graduates with the STEM workforce and graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>
