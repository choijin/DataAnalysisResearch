<AbstractNarration>This project will further understanding of ocean-ice-atmosphere interaction around the Jakobshavn Isbrae and Disko Bay region of west Greenland, with a particular focus on the role of sea surface temperature and sea ice variability in modulating past outlet glacier behavior and ice sheet/cap mass balance (snowfall and melt) over the past two centuries.  The PIs will reconstruct past environmental conditions in the Disko and Baffin Bay region based on new glaciochemical and stratigraphic records from three 100-m deep ice cores, several firn cores, and geophysical studies from three sites surrounding Disko Bay.  Their field activities will commence in 2013 with the primary ice coring activity in 2014 and lab and computation work following to derive climate reconstructions from the cores.  The results will complement recent glaciological studies of regional ice dynamic behavior, as well as recent paleoceanographic and glacial geologic reconstructions of conditions from this area and era.  Das and Frey will each supervise a full-time PhD student, and Evans will supervise undergraduate research assistants and senior theses.  A high school science teacher will also participate in the field work and interact with students at his school in Massachusetts as well as from the ice.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Ice Sheets gain mass each year through snowfall and lose mass each year through a combination of meltwater runoff and iceberg calving from outlet glaciers. Up to the 1990?s, the Greenland Ice Sheet was largely in balance, with little change in overall mass.  Since that time, surface melting has increased and numerous outlet glaciers have dramatically increased in speed, leading to an overall loss of ice mass, and a positive contribution to sea level.  One area particularly impacted is around Disko Bay and the Jakobsahvn Outlet glacier in west central Greenland.  The processes driving these changes are poorly known.  This project is part of a collaborative effort to use records of distinct chemical signatures in ice cores collected around Disko Bay to reconstruct past environmental conditions (sea-ice cover, sea surface temperature) to better constrain and understand the controls on ice mass loss over the last 200 years.     Wheaton College?s portion of this project involved chemical analyses of ice core samples.  We analyzed over 5000 discrete ice core samples from five cores (Figure 1) of various lengths.  The results of our chemical analyses will be combined with high-resolution satellite data to develop a proxy for local sea-ice extent.  Most important for the development of that proxy is the time-resolved record of methanesulfonic acid (MSA) deposition in cores.  Briefly, MSA is produced in the atmosphere from the oxidation of dimethylsulfide (DMS).  DMS is produced during the life-cycle of phytoplankton, which can only thrive when the ocean is ice-free.  This means we can relate MSA concentration in ice cores with sea-ice cover back through time.  Figure 2 shows our full MSA record for one of our ice cores.  The regular seasonality of the record indicates that MSA is high in the summer, and low in the winter, and should make a viable sea-ice extent proxy.  This is a unique and important finding for our assessment of how sea-ice impacts ice-mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet.  Integration of our chemical data with satellite and geophysical data is on-going with colleagues at institutions also involved in this project (WHOI, Clark Univeristy, and University of Washington)     Broader Impacts  Undergraduates have been an integral part of this research at Wheaton College.  Nine undergraduate students took part in the laboratory portion of this collaborative project, including six female students.  Two 2-semester undergraduate theses were completed.  Wheaton College does not have a geology program, so our chemistry-trained students have gained an opportunity to apply their skills to Earth Science problems.  In addition, we worked closely with high school teacher Matthew Bingham, who with his students, kept a blog of research and field activities (http://www.miltonacademy.info/science/outreach/), and worked with a small hand-augered core and presented their findings at the Fall AGU meeting in 2016.  The project has allowed training and interaction for students and faculty across all levels of institution.          Last Modified: 04/03/2017       Submitted by: Matthew J Evans]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
