<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site is led by Professors Kenneth L. Brown and Graham F. Peaslee at Hope College. The research projects supported at this Site entitled "Achieving the Next Level: Research Experiences for Underserved Populations", is dedicated to recruiting and training underrepresented minority students and students from nearby 2-Year Community Colleges (2YCs). The collaboration with the 2YCs involves a pre-training program which will allow students to work on research projects during the academic year prior to starting the summer research experience. The improved professional development activities supplement the diversity of research projects. For example, the REU Site will be supported by the on-campus career services office in helping students to develop a resume portfolio. In addition, continued support from the previously established Student Advisory Board, consisting of professionals from local industry, medical doctors, and attorneys, will provide students with access to a broad range of expertise in career planning. The research projects for this REU site are innovative and quite capable of being completed by undergraduate students. The students involved in the research enterprise receive a full complement of experiences in literature review, hands-on training with modern chemical instrumentation, data analysis, and in the dissemination of results through group meetings and formal oral and poster presentations. The projects span a wide range of areas from designing electrochemical sensors and understanding biochemical mechanisms of gene regulation, to designing polymer coatings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the REU students will have access to an intensive and transformative research experience that prepares them to enter competitive STEM fields. This REU Site is focused on increasing the number of minority students and students from 2YCs entering graduate school to pursue an advanced degree in the STEM fields. Hence, all of these enhanced initiatives will help these underserved populations achieve the next level of success in their chosen STEM discipline. The research activities described in this proposal will help to build a cohesive community of researchers who are equipped with the research skills needed to solve current and challenging research problems that have local and global implications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Major Outcomes:  Research and Professional Development During the lifetime of this NSF-REU site award (1263097), we established collaborations with the City Colleges of Chicago and Grand Rapids Community College.  Formalizing these collaborations were key to the success of this REU site. Two publications have been produced thus far with student co-authors.  Several of the co-authors were students at Grand Rapids Community College (GRCC) and are now in graduate school.  In addition, one paper has been submitted for publication on Simplex Optimization for designing polymer films, and two more manuscripts are currently being prepared for publication.  All of the manuscripts in print and those currently being drafted are based on the collaborations with GRCC.  Research topics for the REU participants included:  Exploring Hydrophobicity in Halogen Substituted EDOT Films Applications of Simplex Optimization in Analytical Chemistry The Electrochemistry of Tris[5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline]Iron(II) The Preparation of Diketopyrrolopyrrole Functionilized EDOT Compounds for Electrode Modification Sediment Fingerprinting in the Lake Macatawa Watershed   Students worked on the projects listed above using the following instrumentation or techniques:  Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Flow Injection Analysis Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Lasers High Performance Liquid Chromatography with UV-Vis and Electrochemical detection Liquid and Gas Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry Detection Atomic Force Microscope Particle Accelerator   Providing support for underrepresented minority and non-traditional students has also been key for this REU site.   Eighteen different students were supported through this REU site.  Six of these students were underrepresented minority and twelve were from community colleges. Students were involved in the following professional development activities in addition to conducting research in the labs:  Training in Research Ethics Graduate School Discussion  How to Prepare a Resume and Cover letter Workshop Industrial Tours  Dissemination of Results   All participants had the opportunity to present their research results during Wednesday morning seminars to their peers and faculty and at the summer research symposium.  Furthermore, six of the REU participants will present their results in an upcoming national meeting in North Carolina:  The National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers. This is the largest number of students attending this national conference in the last several years from Hope College.  Several manuscripts have been submitted for publication based on a collaboration with GRCC.  1.  Optimization of Ruthenium-&shy;Based Films of Tris[5&shy;-amino&shy;-1,10&shy;  phenanthroline] Using the Simplex Method  2.  Development and Optimization of Amperometric Glucose Biosensors Based on Glucose Oxidase and Tris[5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline] Iron(II) Polymer Films  3.  Spectroelectrochemical and Electrochemical Impedance Studies of Electropolymerized Films Based on Tris [5&shy;-amino&shy;-1,10&shy;phenanthroline] Ruthenium (II)  Other Outcomes:  Based on the research results of the glucose biosensor project (Development and Optimization of Amperometric Glucose Biosensors Based on Glucose Oxidase and Iron(II)-5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline Polymer Films)  Professor Brown gave an invited lecture for Professor Moore at the University of Wisconsin in Madison in the Spring of 2016.   This lecture is now being used to introduce the topic of electrochemistry to chemistry majors.  From this REU site, thirteen participants from community colleges have transferred to a four-year institution to complete a B.S. degree in Chemistry.   Overall, this REU site has provided transformative research experiences for students and have further prepared them for graduate school, professional school, or industrial employment.  During the recent academic year (2016-2017), one student continued to work on the glucose biosensor project.  As a result of this work, a manuscript has been submitted to Analytical Letters for possible publication.  In addition, this research is now being directed towards developing paper-based glucose test strips.                  Last Modified: 08/31/2017       Submitted by: Kenneth L Brown]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
