<AbstractNarration>Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are two very important processing elements for computation. FPGAs are very attractive because of their lower design cost and shorter time-to-market compared to ASICs.  Still, the marketshare of FPGAs remains less than a fifth of that of ASICs because ASICs enjoy an advantage over FPGAs in terms of circuit area, power consumption, and delay.  The objective of the proposed work is to significantly reduce these area/power/delay gaps through a new dynamically reconfigurable FPGA design and thus enable FPGAs to become much more competitive with ASICs. Continued scaling of bulk CMOS technology faces significant hurdles. To alleviate these problems, Intel and TSMC have already announced a switch to multi-gate field-effect transistors, e.g., Trigate and FinFETs, at the upcoming semiconductor technology nodes.  Another important trend is towards 3D integrated circuits (ICs), in which multiple die layers are stacked on top of each other.  3D ICs promise a revolution in so called ``More than Moore" computing.  The proposed work aims to take advantage of the multi-gate and 3D IC technologies to further reduce the gaps mentioned above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed FPGA architecture significantly deviates from the conventional island-style FPGA architecture by enabling the logic element to either perform computation or local communication or both.  It is aided by the key concept of temporal logic folding that allows a circuit to be drastically folded, aided by on-chip reconfiguration memory, before being mapped to the FPGA. It attacks the main reason for the area/power/delay gaps -- the vast amount of chip resources allocated to reconfigurable interconnects in FPGAs.  Logic folding makes the communication local, thus making it possible to reduce the amount of resources devoted to interconnects very significantly. The work entails design space exploration of the different components of the architecture, investigation of novel multi-gate computation/communication structures, and algorithms and design automation tools to map arbitrary circuits to the FPGA architecture. It is expected to yield a well-characterized and highly versatile family of 3D multi-gate transistor based FPGAs that are competitive with ASICs.  Work on various design methodologies and tools developed in this research will be disseminated through conference and journal articles.  Technology transfer will be done through companies interested in using such FPGAs as accelerators. The material will be included in a senior-level course on Design with Nanotechnologies and a graduate-level course on Low Power IC and System Design introduced by the PI. Female and minority students will be attracted to this research through Princeton's Presidential Fellowship Program.</AbstractNarration>

The objective of the proposed work was to significantly reduce these area/power/delay gaps through a new dynamically reconfigurable FPGA design and thus enable FPGAs to become much more competitive with ASICs.   Intellectual contributions:  We achieved the above objective by exploiting the concept of temporal logic folding, which enabled us to attack the main reason for the area/power/delay gaps -- the vast amount of chip resources (80-90%) allocated to reconfigurable interconnects in FPGAs.  Temporal logic folding allows a circuit to be folded a large number of times (by more than an order of magnitude) before being mapped to the FPGA -- all folds being implemented on the same set of logic elements (LEs) through fine-grain dynamic reconfiguration using on-chip configuration memory. The latency of dynamic reconfiguration is hidden by overlapping reconfiguration with computation.  Logic folding makes inter-LE communication local, thus making it possible to reduce the amount of resources devoted to interconnects very significantly.  We developed a series of fine-grain (i.e., cycle-level) dynamically reconfigurable architectures, called FDR, FDR 2.0, and FDR 3.0, to achieve our goal. Experimental results with the most advanced of these architectures, FDR 3.0, indicate that the delay, area, dynamic power, and leakage power gaps between Stratix V FPGA and ASIC are 3.23X, 25.18X, 3.72X, and 23.29X, respectively. FDR 3.0 is able to reduce these gaps to 2.70X, 5.10X, 3.01X, and 5.48X, respectively. Thus, FDR 3.0 is an attractive alternative to currently available FPGAs.This also makes FDR 3.0 attractive for inclusion as accelerators in modern multicore designs.  Broader Impacts:  If adopted as accelerators in multicore designs, FDR 3.0 has the potential for significant industrial impact.  The research results were disseminated through prestigious journals and invited talks.  Four PhD students were trained in this important research area: one of them a female.  Research material was incorporated as a course module in a course taught by the Principal Investigator (PI).  Efforts are being made for commercialization of FDR 3.0.  As the Associate Director for Education at the Andlinger Center at Princeton, the PI supervised outreach to high school students and undergraduates in energy-related fields.
