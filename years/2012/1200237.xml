<AbstractNarration>An innovative new self-centering truss moment resisting frame (SC-TMRF) is devised to make building frames more resilient to earthquakes and reduce associated damage. The SC-TMRF consists of a truss with an assembly of concentric tubes at the bottom chord that creates restoring force in conjunction with post-tensioning strands. Conventional seismic force resisting systems use inelasticity in structural members and connections to dissipate seismic energy and protect buildings against collapse.  However, the structural damage distributed throughout a building and related permanent residual drifts can make a conventional structure financially unreasonable to repair following a large earthquake.  Recently developed seismic systems that mitigate residual drifts suffer from difficult or complex field construction, large cost premiums, and challenges associated with deformation compatibility.  The unique configuration of the SC-TMRF solves many of these problems.  Furthermore, steel plates with cut-outs leaving butterfly shaped links act as structural fuses, dissipate seismic energy, and can be readily replaced if necessary.  The research project will develop the SC-TMRF concept through component testing, large-scale system experimentation, computational simulation, and the creation of proven set of design guidelines that will allow the application of the SC-TMRF concept in practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SC-TMRF uses common materials in an innovative configuration.  Preliminary design and analyses suggest that the SC-TMRF virtually eliminates permanent drifts, concentrates structural damage in structural fuses that can be easily replaced after severe earthquakes, can be shop fabricated allowing conventional field construction methods, and utilizes approximately the same amount of steel as conventional moment resisting frames.  Because the SC-TMRF is a self-centering seismic force resisting system that is expected to be competitive with traditional systems, the SC-TMRF is a transformative new technology that has the potential to significantly reduce the economic losses due to earthquakes through a competitive building system that may not require structural repair after most earthquakes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  A new type of structural system was created for buildings that can eliminate permanent horizontal displacements after earthquakes, concentrates structural damage in elements that can easily be replaced, and uses conventional materials and field construction methods.  The self-centering beam moment frame utilizes beams with specially designed self-centering mechanisms consisting of post-tensioned concentric steel tubes.  Steel fuse elements absorb seismic energy and can be replaced after severe earthquakes.     A research program was conducted to develop validated concepts, mechanics, detailing, and understanding required to implement this structural system in practice.  The research program consisted of deriving equations to describe expected behavior, performing computational simulation on subassemblies and full building frames, carrying out small-scale experiments on components of the system, and conducting large-scale experiments on full self-centering beam moment frames.  In specific, the phases of the project and related contributions to the field of structural engineering include:   1.  Concepts were developed for self-centering beams.  An investigation was conducted into the potential configurations and types of energy dissipating structural fuses.  Equations were derived to predict the strength, deformation capability, and ability to bring the frame back to plumb.  The concepts and equations can be applied to a range of structural configurations and thus can be useful in proportioning and designing these types of structural systems.   2.  A set of 60 experiments were conducted on high-strength post-tensioning strands.  The testing program included post-tensioning systems used in several self-centering seismic structural systems, not just the self-centering beam moment frame, and involved cyclic testing protocols not unlike those imposed by earthquakes.  The results of these tests are being disseminated and are important for predicting collapse behavior of many types of self-centering seismic systems.  Recommended deformation limits were provided based on a statistical evaluation of the test data.   3.  An energy dissipating structural fuse was developed that resembles a small buckling restrained brace.  A set of nine tests were conducted on the structural fuse including different gage lengths which provide different levels of deformation capacity.  Through careful literature review, calculations, and the testing program, a viable fuse element was created that is capable of significant energy dissipation without instability.  These structural fuse elements could be used in a wide array of structural configurations whether or not they are coupled with self-centering systems.   4.  Five large-scale tests were conducted on self-centering beam moment frames.  The large-scale tests simulated a one-story twenty foot wide bay of structural framing.  Specimens represented approximately two thirds scale relative to a prototype building.  The large-scale experimental program produced considerable useful information related to the detailing and design of a self-centering beam as well as producing a wealth of data related to the behavior and performance of the system.   5.  Computational models have been created to simulate the behavior of the self-centering beam moment frame.  Results from computational simulation have led to improved understanding of the behavior of the system and they have also led to an understanding of how buildings utilizing the system will perform during earthquakes.   Recent earthquakes have demonstrated that although modern seismic codes prevent building collapse in most cases, that the economic losses due to earthquakes can be devastating.  Conventional seismic systems experience distributed structural damage and residual drifts that can make a building uneconomical to repair, or if repairable, require significant business downtime because of the condition of the structure.
