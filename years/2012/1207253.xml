<AbstractNarration>The Pierre Auger Observatory is the world's largest experiment to measure the properties of cosmic rays with energies above 10^20 eV. The origin of these cosmic rays remains a profound and compelling mystery in particle astrophysics. Auger is a hybrid detector consisting of two coincident but distinct detector systems: (1) an array of 1,660 water-Cherenkov Surface Detector stations spread over an area of 3,000 square kilometers for detecting air shower particles on the ground; and (2) a set of four Fluorescence Detector telescopes which provide calorimetric measurements of the development of cosmic ray showers as they propagate through the atmosphere.  During the past few years, Auger has reported several important results that place significant constraints on theory and provide essential clues as to the origin and nature of the highest energy cosmic rays. This award will support the research activities of the High Energy Particle Astrophysics (HEA) group at Case Western Reserve University.  The group has central responsibility for GPS event timing and calibration, and for monitoring the performance of the telecommunications system on a daily basis. The PI also serves on the Auger Observatory Technical Board as Task Leader for telecommunications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  &lt;br/&gt;The group's expertise in custom wireless communication systems, non-imaging optical systems, and precise nanosecond GPS timing has led to several methods and instrumentation that may have applications to other scientific, technical and industrial fields.  The group has worked with approximately 30 undergraduate research assistants over the past nine years. The PI is also active in a variety of education and outreach programs such as after school programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  This award supported the participation of members of the High Energy Astrophysics (HEA) group at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) as a member intuition of the Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest experiment to detect the highest energy particles in the universe.  Working with other US and international collaborators, the group at CWRU group has applied the Auger Observatory to measure the arrival directions, energy, and elemental composition of these most energetic particles, called cosmic rays, and to use these measurements to infer the nature and origin of these particles: Where do they come from?

Specific contributions of the CWRU group during this grant award include daily monitoring of the wireless communication system for control and data acquisition for the Auger Observatory, design, development and testing of new methods of accurate GPS time-tagging, and the deployment of a new detector calibration system made from Auger cosmic ray detectors that now operates within the Telescope Array cosmic ray experiment in Utah.

The work of the CWRU group in partnership with collaborators has resulted in the publications of dozens of peer-reviewed journal articles reporting major results ranging from the energy spectrum of cosmic rays to searches for potential correlations with more exotic particles, including neutrinos.  Altogether, the results from Auger have significantly moved our understanding of cosmic rays forward.  Broader Impacts:  The broader impact of the work includes cross-disciplinary impacts on a variety of connected sub-fields including particle astrophysics and elementary particle physics.  The team at CWRU has also been active in a variety of educational and outreach activities including demonstrations of how Einstein's Relativity is critical for the performance of GPS navigation.  Furthermore instrumental innovations developed for the Auger project at CWRU have potential industrial applications including a new portable system which can measure the absolute arrival time of arriving electronic signal pulses to an accuracy of better than five nanoseconds.
