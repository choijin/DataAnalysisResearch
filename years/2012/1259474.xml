<AbstractNarration>This project provides scholarships to enable 16 academically talented and financially needy engineering students at Elizabethtown College to obtain baccalaureate degrees and enter the STEM workforce. It builds on partnerships with Project Forward Leap, a non-profit organization that supports educational achievement for students in inner city or underperforming school districts, with STEM-UP PA, an NSF-funded program that promotes advancement of women in STEM disciplines, and with local industries to create a comprehensive program for recruitment and academic enhancement of scholars, along with mentoring support for transition to the workforce. Scholars are supported through such high-impact practices as a living-learning community, focused mentoring, and participation in undergraduate research. The project is having a positive impact in an area of national need, both through direct support of scholars and by creating a pathway model that can be sustained into the future.</AbstractNarration>

At the end of this grant we have roughly doubled the number of women (22%) and underrepresented minority students (13%) in the engineering program. This is comparable to the 2016 national average of 20.9% women and 20.6% underrepresented minority bachelors graduates in engineering. We have also remained at a consistently high level of low-income students (18% Pell eligible) and increased the proportion of first-generation college students (34% to 40%). 83% of the scholars have been retained in the engineering program or have graduated with an engineering degree, which is above the institutional and national average. The remaining scholars transferred to another major but have been retained at the institution. All of the scholars participated in a living-learning community, tutoring, focused mentoring, and a women engineers club. Almost all participated in a pre-matriculation program. 17% of the scholars additionally had multiple undergraduate research experience and 28% studied abroad. 90% of the scholars had engineering workforce jobs or graduate school acceptances at the time of graduation, with one exception due to COVID circumstances. This program successfully increased the population of underrepresented minority, low-income, and first-generation women entering the engineering workforce.
