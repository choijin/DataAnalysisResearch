<AbstractNarration>This action funds Trevor William Currie of California Institute of Technology to conduct a research project, entitled "Exploring Friction's Relationship to Fault Stress through Long-term Earthquake Cycle Simulations," during the summer of 2012 at University of Tokyo in Tokyo.  The host scientist is Takahiro Hatano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in its exploration of the role and understanding of friction laws on a fault during its lifetime, the evolution of the stress state of the fault's material, and the long-term statistics of event magnitude distribution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
