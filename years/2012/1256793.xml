<AbstractNarration>This research will combine the skills of a comparative physiologist, an engineer, and a systematist to unravel the performance, design principals, and evolution of the sucker disk that allows some fishes to cling to rocks.  These fishes, called clingfish, adhere to fouled, irregular substrates in pounding surf and while launching feeding attacks to pry limpets from the rocks.  The work will involve a field component to measure the irregularity of substrates in the field, a pure modeling component that seeks to understand the effects of disk shape and material properties on suction, and a phylogenetic survey component.  In the survey the suction abilities of clingfishes from all over the world will be quantified and the relationships among clingfish species will be determined using phylogenetic methods.  The shape and underlying structure of the disk will also be investigated.  The results of these studies will be deposited in several public databases, including Genbank, Tree of Life, and a custom database for morphological data such as CT scans.  Other broader impacts of the grant include the development of biomimetic suction systems that could be used in surgical or robotic settings, development of tools for modeling soft matter interactions, education and outreach at the K12 and undergraduate level, and support of graduate education.</AbstractNarration>

A small number inhabit   freshwater streams in the Caribbean and tropical Central/South America.   Clingfishes are famous for a unique ventral adhesive disc (formed from   the paired fins) which allows them to adhere to a variety of  substrates.

Field work  was conducted in five  countries (4 international) resulting in the  discovery of 9 new species  and 3 new genera of clingfishes. Detailed  morphological work resulted in  the discovery of a novel, potentially  toxin producing gland associated  with a sharp subopercular spine in  certain Caribbean clingfishes.
