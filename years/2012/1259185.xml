<AbstractNarration>This award is one key segment of a larger effort centered on the Ontario Winter (OW) Lake-effect Systems (LeS) field project, to be conducted December 2013-January 2014.  OWLeS will focus on two complementary lines of research, each tracing to a preferred wind regime over the U.S. Great lakes region and corresponding distinct mesoscale mode of winter storm organization.  Activities led by this group will focus on so-called "long-fetch" storm events, for which low-level winds are aligned approximately parallel to Lake Ontario's long axis.  Observational assets to be employed during OWLeS include the University of Wyoming King Air instrumented aircraft, the CSWR Doppler on Wheels (DOW) mobile radars, multiple mobile rawinsounding systems, the Millersville University Profiling System, the UAH Mobile Integrated Profiling System, and a variety of other deployable surface measurement systems.  These researchers contend that predictions of the amounts and inland extent of LeS snowfall remain poor, due in part to fine-scale variations in upwind planetary boundary layer structure and poor representation of cloud microphysical, dynamical, and surface processes.  To address these shortcomings, the intellectual merits of this research will derive from improved understanding of:  1) How long-fetch LeS intensify and evolve downwind of the lake, where prolonged heavy snowfall rates are particularly impactful; 2) how cloud and dynamical processes may contribute to cloud electrification and to lightning, as occasionally observed in long-fetch LeS heavy precipitation cells; and 3) how dual-polarimetric (and in select regions, dual-Doppler) radar measurements at X- and S-band wavelengths as utilized by mobile-DOW and operational National Weather Service WSR-88D radars, respectively, may reveal detailed precipitation processes in LeS.  Through detailed comparisons with in-situ aircraft measurements, evaluations dual-polarimetric particle identification and quantitative precipitation estimate (QPE) algorithms will extend the utility of remote-sensing observations in this unique cool-season environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts will include experience infield campaign planning, hands-on data collection and data analysis for a notably large number of undergraduate as well as graduate students.  A desirable mix of junior and senior principal investigators will facilitate exchange of established and complex project design and observing methodologies, and foster improved field observing techniques tailored to severe winter weather conditions.  Outreach efforts will extend to K-12 students and college students enrolled at nearby institutes of higher learning.  Given the significant impacts of lake effect snowfall on public safety and economic activity along the populous shores of the U.S. Great Lakes, improved understanding of lake-effect systems should foster refined models and forecasting techniques that will address a longer-term societal need.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Ontario Winter Lake-Effect Systems (OWLeS) project was an observational study of lake effect snow bands.  OWLeS collected data during December 2013 and January 2014 in order to increase predictability of lake-effect snow events.  This OWLeS grant focused on gaining a better understanding of the internal structure of intense lake effect snow bands and how this structure relates to snow band intensity and longevity.  College and graduate students were active participants in both data collection and subsequent analyses.      The principle investigators (PIs) were involved actively in education and outreach, engaging both the general public and the student participants.  Prior to the start of the project, the PIs organized an open house at a local airport, which gave local residents an opportunity to explore cutting-edge OWLeS instrumentation, including the Doppler On Wheels (DOW) and a research aircraft, and to talk with the scientists and students about their research.  Interviews with the local and national media by the PIs increased general awareness of OWLeS research.  During the data collection period, the PIs fielded the DOW mobile radars, mobile mesonets, and deployable surface weather stations and, trained and supervised students from several universities in mobile radar and mobile mesonet operations.  Students were the primary instrument operators.   After the completion of the data collection period, the PIs continued their educational efforts by serving on a master?s thesis committee and training students on dual-Doppler radar analysis techniques.     A significant scientific result from this grant is the finding that the majority of snow bands that form parallel to the southern coast of Lake Ontario contain a line of tornado-scale vortices that produce locally intense gusty winds, enhancing the impact of the falling snow.  The majority of these vortices likely form as a result of a shearing instability, similar to the genesis mechanism responsible for landspouts and waterspouts.  In depth analysis of a characteristic snow band revealed the stronger vortices were coincident with the increase in shear associated with a nearby cold front.  For this case, evaluation of the hydrometeor identification algorithm used for the DOWs matched well with the S-band WSR-88D algorithm, as well as surface observations of precipitation type.      Results have been presented at conferences, college seminars, and published in a trade journal.           Last Modified: 10/01/2017       Submitted by: Karen Kosiba]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
