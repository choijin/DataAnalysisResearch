<AbstractNarration>Beginning in the 1980s, Dr. David Barker theorized that conditions and exposures during early development may relate to epigenetic modifications that effect outcomes in later life. This view has permeated scientific literature and practice, precipitating a new field of basic science and capturing public attention. Drawing on in-depth interviews with scientists working in this area, fieldwork in basic science settings, and a content analysis of scientific literature and popular media coverage, this research examines this scientific development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As scientific debates and public conversations about genetics continue, a fuller understanding of the ascendant epigenetic paradigm will assist broader understandings of determinants of health and disease. With growing concern about the prevalence of chronic diseases, this emergent science engages pressing health concerns.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project sought to analyze the scientific, social, and policy dimensions of the field of reproductive epigenetics, an emerging area of scientific investigation that has not been systematically studied by social scientists. Specifically, the project aimed to trace discursive and methodological strategies used over time in the area of reproductive epigenetics in scientific publications, popular media reports, and public policy documents. In addition, a major component of this postdoctoral fellowship provided the opportunity for the co-PI to pursue additional training in the history of science and in population studies.  While the study remains ongoing, it has yielded several findings thus far. The co-PIÆs project, in addition to the co-PIÆs continuing collaborative work, has revealed that three themes of determinism emerge in both scientific and popular discussions around reproductive epigenetics: the notion of genetic control of epigenetic regulation, the concept of developmental programming, and the discussion of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. These findings contributed to the development of the notion of "epigenetic determinism," a concept defined as the belief that epigenetic mechanisms determine the expression of human traits and behaviors. This research has implications for conceptualizations &ndash; in both science and society &ndash; of the impact of biology and society on population health.  This project adds to a better understanding of how a new research paradigm permeates scientific research and public discourse. The notion of epigenetic determinism has the potential to influence understandings of the ways in which reproductive epigenetics is taken up by publics, organizations, physicians, and scientists, especially on questions related to the determinants of health and illness, and crucially engages with the broader public and policy impact of new directions in epigenetics research.
