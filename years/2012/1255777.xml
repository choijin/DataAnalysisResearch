<AbstractNarration>When unique  but related species overlap geographically with one another, there are specific conditions that determine whether they will fuse into one species (a form of extinction), or will be able to evolve mechanisms to prevent the exchange of genes between them. This research investigates conditions that allow a third possibility, that two species may reach a stable state where they still exchange some genes, but are yet able to retain their specific identities. The research team will expand upon initial models that identified the existence of these stable states of partial isolation, using mathematical models that exactly replicate the effects of migration between populations, differential survival, and mate choice. Specifically, initial models by the PI and others will be extended in several ways to allow for additional phenomena that greatly extend their applicability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delineating the conditions that can lead to partial isolation is important both in developing a basic understanding of how species can remain distinct from one another, and in comprehending the possible consequences of the breakdown of geographic barriers between species, an increasingly common occurrence under human disturbance. As part of this project, the PI will continue to develop a "mathematical track" in an introductory biology course at UNC, which uses a variety of techniques to reduce math anxiety, a problem documented to disproportionally affect the performance of women. This track thus promotes both the participation of women in the mathematical sciences and more generally addresses the need to integrate math into the undergraduate biology curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most important intellectual challenges in modern studies of biological diversity is how to explain the coexistence of the vast number of species that we see today. The puzzle is that species that are otherwise similar can, at least often, coexist as separate species, even when they encounter one another geographically and hence have the capability of hybridizing extensively. At other times, in contrast, extensive hybridization can occur, even to the point where the two species fuse into a single species with mixed ancestry. The determinant of whether or not species can maintain separate gene pools is whether they have evolved sufficiently strong reproductive isolation between them &shy;&ndash; either postmating isolation, which means that hybrids are inviable or sterile (preventing backcrossing), or premating isolation, which means that mating between the different species does not occur. One of the most powerful mechanisms of isolation between species in animals is mate choice.     The current project has expanded our knowledge of the conditions under which evolutionary forces that are otherwise thought to drive speciation can instead result in stable intermediate levels of differentiation between populations &ndash; these are intermediate in the sense that hybridization is still expected to occur at a steady, significant rate. Such intermediate levels of differentiation would arise because mating preferences for mates of an individual?s own species would be selected to evolve to intermediate strengths, rather than to become successively stronger.  In other words, incomplete premating isolation would evolve, in these cases as an evolutionary optimum. Specifically, the work from this grant shows that this outcome is expected under a broad range of conditions, but not universally.  These conditions include 1) very asymmetric or unidirectional migration patterns, as could result when there is speciation of a peripheral population, as well as with symmetric migration, 2) whether a mating preference and/or trait is obtained by a form of learning called imprinting, as has been found to occur in birds, fish, and mammals, 3) whether there are a limited portion of matings in the population that occur in a common mating pool, which allows an element of sympatric divergence into the models (meaning that divergence occurs despite a lack of geographic isolation), and 4) whether there are several (but not too many) genetic loci underlying the trait.  The work has also included a thorough exploration of the differences between assortative mating with a "phenotype matching" mating system (where the choosing sex uses their own traits as a template for what to prefer in a mate) versus with genetically separate mating preferences and traits, in systems with separate populations exchanging migrants.  The project has lead to 10 published papers and 7 more submitted or in preparation.     The broader impacts of this project have included 1) further development of a "Mathematical Track" in the Evoluiton core course at the University of North Carolina, with the goal of building quantitative modeling skills in the undergraduate majors, to two stand-alone courses, 2) the publishing of two papers designed to explore the connection between theoretical and empirical research with the goal of fostering an understanding of theory and its role in evolutionary biology, and 3) training of graduate students, undergraduates and postdoctoral researchers, and 4) the dissemination of research through seminars and conference talks          Last Modified: 11/21/2017       Submitted by: Maria R Servedio]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
