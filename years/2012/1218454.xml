<AbstractNarration>Inverse problems like parameter estimation, data assimilation, optimal&lt;br/&gt;engineering design, and optimal control of large scale systems governed by&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations,  are of considerable importance in many&lt;br/&gt;fields including atmospheric science and oceanography, aerospace&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and fluid and structural mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State-of-the-art solvers for large scale partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;adaptively refine the time step and the mesh, and adjust the computational&lt;br/&gt;pattern according to the features of the solution. Adaptivity is necessary&lt;br/&gt;to control the numerical errors introduced by temporal and spatial&lt;br/&gt;discretizations and to preserve the qualitative features of the solution&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., avoid the formation of spurious wiggles). In contrast, most inverse&lt;br/&gt;problems to date have been solved using non-adaptive methods (e.g., fixed&lt;br/&gt;grids and timesteps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a fully discrete framework for solving inverse&lt;br/&gt;problems in the context of adaptive models. The framework fills the gap&lt;br/&gt;between the state-of-the-art adaptive methods used in (forward)&lt;br/&gt;simulations and the computational tools currently available for the&lt;br/&gt;solution of inverse problems. The specific research objectives are to&lt;br/&gt;develop discrete algorithms for inverse problems with models that employ&lt;br/&gt;refinement of the spatial discretization, and adaptive time stepping, to&lt;br/&gt;guarantee that the discrete inversion process leads to convergent&lt;br/&gt;numerical approximations, and to control the accuracy of the inverse&lt;br/&gt;solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this work are general algorithms and methodologies that&lt;br/&gt;will advance the field of inverse problems by developing the capability to&lt;br/&gt;adapt time steps, grid sizes, and computational patterns, such as to&lt;br/&gt;control the quality and accuracy of the inverse solutions.  These results&lt;br/&gt;have the potential to impact any mature&lt;br/&gt;field which relies on adaptive simulations, such as data assimilation in&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric sciences, oceanography, and environmental sciences; optimal&lt;br/&gt;control of flows, and optimal engineering design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithmic and software tools developed during this research will be&lt;br/&gt;largely disseminated through specialized journals and conferences. This&lt;br/&gt;project provides an excellent opportunity for training graduate students in&lt;br/&gt;the areas  of inverse problems and adaptive computations.</AbstractNarration>
