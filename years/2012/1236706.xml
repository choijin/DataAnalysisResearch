<AbstractNarration>Energy production, transportation and utilization are ubiquitous in the United States. They encompass nuclear and chemical processes that are subject to a multitude of failure mechanisms that can be the result of poor design, human error or acts of nature or terrorism than can have catastrophic impact of life and property. The disaster mitigation system being constructed in this activity is a system of systems that provides emergency response staff with both training and planning as well as real time guidance on effective strategies to protect the general public and first responders. The system uses computational fluid dynamics to predict toxic plume evolution and an intelligent agent based model of the impacted population operating within an intelligent traffic management system. Cognitive algorithms are being developed to analyze the output data and dissect it to channel necessary information and guidance to the appropriate people. These analyses use high performance parallel computing to create the necessary integrated solutions and exploit many of the features of the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) network. This will result in simulation based information and guidance that can be quickly, and reliably, transmitted to an emergency operations center and first responders in the event of a large toxic material release in an urban area. A pilot exercise will be performed in collaboration with an urban emergency response team to demonstrate and explore what might be achieved during an emergency to mitigate adverse effects using such emerging advanced computing and networking capabilities and thus encourage their use.</AbstractNarration>
