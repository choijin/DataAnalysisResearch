<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 12-29316&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Katti, Dinesh R; Denton, Anne M; Khan, Samee U; Ossowski, Martin M; Sun, Wenfang;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: North Dakota State University Fargo&lt;br/&gt;Title:    MRI/Acq.: Data-Intensive Cyberinfrastructure for Research and Education (DICRE) at NDStU &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project from an EPSCoR state, acquiring a storage-heavy Beowulf cluster with an HDD storage appliance and a tape storage subsystem for archival purposes, enables a variety of research projects in experimental HPC and applications in bioinformatics, data-aware materials modeling, and others, all of which will both increase the institution?s resources for scientific computing and build a dataset to assist their HPC research projects. Within the state and beyond, the proposed instrument is expected to break barriers to research in the areas of computational materials science and chemistry, computational mechanics and biomechanics, data informatics, and data-aware scalable computational sciences where ?big-data? increasingly complicates traditional computational workflows and paradigms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Due to a convincing educational and outreach plans, as well as expected scientific discoveries in the areas of science proposed, the proposal showcases strong broader impacts. The programs to enrich broader impact aspects will not only be felt locally, but will also help ensure that the nation maintains leadership and innovation within the addressed research domains.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project "MRI: Acquisition of Data-Intensive Cyberinfrastructure for Research and Education (DICRE) at North Dakota State University" was aimed to provide North Dakota State University (NDSU) with state-of-the-art high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure used for a broad spectrum of research, outreach and education activities.  The new HPC system is the most advanced computational system dedicated to research and education on NDSU campus and possibly in the state of North Dakota.

Communication layers include FDR InfiniBand, 10 GigE, and 1 GigE.    DICRE is NDSUÆs environment of choice to process and store "big data" but it also serves as a powerful auxiliary modeling and simulation tool.  The system has a modular design for easy on-demand expansion.  At the end of the grant, DICRE was used by 39 researchers from science, engineering, agriculture and business fields.  New users are continually being added to DICRE as are researchersÆ private "condominiums."  The MRI DICRE team has developed a number of HPC teaching modules that have been used in a series of hands-on HPC outreach activities.  Although another cluster computer was used for the exercises, DICRE is scheduled to replace this resource in the future outreach and education activities.   This system will help researchers in conducting cutting-edge scientific research at NDSU. The system will also serve as an educational platform for graduate and undergraduate students. The system will also be used as an outreach tool to attract students, especially women, and minorities into STEM areas. The results of the scientific research conducted on the new HPC platform is likely to have a positive impact on the society. Already, some of the research being conducted using the system such as tissue regeneration, oil shale, bone health, aneurysm, UAV wings, battery storage, etc. will have a lasting societal impact not just in the region, but around the world.
