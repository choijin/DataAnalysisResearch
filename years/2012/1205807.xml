<AbstractNarration>Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the most powerful events in the Universe. With this award the Georgia Tech group will use HAWC and IceCube data to study high-energy gamma ray and neutrino emission from GRBs. The HAWC observatory, currently under construction in Mexico, will be at an order of magnitude more sensitive to GRB emission than previous ground-based instruments. The group will play an important role in the design and construction of HAWC, particularly in the electronics and software related to the study of GRBs. The HAWC data may teach us about the highest energy particles accelerated by GRBs and may reveal details about the relativistic jets that power a GRB.  IceCube is a high-energy neutrino telescope in operation at the South Pole. The group will use data collected by DeepCore, a low energy extension of IceCube, to search for transient bursts of neutrinos.  To enhance DeepCore's sensitivity they will collect data with a new, looser vetoing technique.  They will study the connection between core collapse supernovae (SNe) and GRBs and the hypothesis that many core collapse SNe have hidden or choked jets. The discovery of neutrinos in coincidence with core collapse SNe would prove that they and GRBs are part of continuous class of astrophysical objects.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The Georgia Tech group will report HAWC observations promptly to enable multi-messenger follow up with neutrinos (notably IceCube/DeepCore), gravitational waves, X-rays, etc., thus extending the scientific range of the experiments. In collaboration with CEISMC at Georgia Tech the PI and members of his group will continue their program of lectures and hands on demonstrations in the areas of particle and nuclear physics and astrophysics. Demonstrations include devices such as a cloud chamber and a Geiger counter. The high schools targeted have a large Hispanic population, for which the PI, born in Latin America, has a natural connection.</AbstractNarration>
