<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award centers on the development of a geometric theory of reaction front propagation in advection-reaction-diffusion dynamics.  In particular, work will focus on extending the well-known constructs of invariant manifolds and Lagrangian coherent structures - valuable for passive advection - to the case of front propagation in advecting media.  The viability of such an approach has recently been experimentally and theoretically demonstrated by the existence of burning invariant manifolds (BIMs).  BIMs generalize the concept of invariant manifolds in passive advection to the case of front propagation.  (Here, burning refers generally to any kind of front propagation.)  BIMs create local barriers to front evolution, analogous to their advective counterparts.  A central objective of this award is thus to develop a comprehensive framework for front propagation based on the BIMs. Specific consideration will be given to the technique of lobe dynamics, to mode-locking of reaction fronts, to topological dynamics, to three-dimensional fluid flows, and to time-aperiodic fluid flows (utilizing finite-time Lyapunov exponents and Lagrangian coherent structures).  Furthermore, BIMs will be applied to the control of reaction fronts in chaotic flows.  The theoretical work under this award will benefit from a close collaboration with the experimental group of Prof. Tom Solomon at Bucknell University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many physical processes combine fluid motion with the propagation, or growth, of a front separating two different media.  Important examples include flame fronts in an airflow, chemical reactions in microfluidic devices, plankton blooms in ocean currents, or even epidemics in moving biological populations.  The results of this research will improve the geometric understanding of a broad class of such processes.  A potential application would be to study the growth of invasive plankton blooms in coastal waters.  Furthermore, by better understanding geometric constraints on front propagation, one can engineer better control mechanisms.  For example, mechanisms derived from this work could be applied to control chemical reactions in lab-on-a-chip applications.  Through graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral research experiences, this work will also help train the next generation of scientists and help to nurture the newly established campus of the University of California at Merced (UC Merced).  UC Merced was opened in 2005 and has already made a significant impact on the economy and education in California's Great Central Valley, the agricultural heart of the state.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit.  Many physical phenomena exhibit fronts that separate distinct phases of matter.  In some circumstances these fronts propagate through a flowing fluid medium.  Examples of both fundamental and applied interest include chemical reactions in microfluidic devices (important for lab-on-a-chip applications), plankton blooms in ocean currents, waves within ionized gases, epidemics in migrating populations, flame fronts in combustion, growth of the atmospheric ozone hole, and phase transitions in liquid crystals.  Furthermore, a growing number of scientific research labs are performing direct experiments on chemical-reaction-front propagation in laboratory-scale flows.  All such phenomena, which combine front propagation with fluid flow, can develop intricate patterns among the various regions separated by the fronts.  The main success of this funded research is the development of a mathematical theory and numerical tools that explain, and allow one to compute, the patterns formed by such processes.  A total of five peer-reviewed studies were published in prominent scientific journals.   The key idea behind this research is that certain geometric curves used to understand passive mixing in a fluid (i.e. the mixing of particles, pollutants, dyes, or anything else that is swept along with the fluid) can be generalized to understand front propagation within a fluid.  This fluid can be either flowing steadily or flowing with periodic oscillations in time.  These curves are called burning invariant manifolds, or BIMs. The most important property of BIMs is that they form prominent one-way barriers to front propagation; fronts can pass through a BIM in one direction, but not the other.  These barriers are themselves either time-independent or time-periodic, depending on the motion of the fluid.  BIMs are also attracting shapes---an initial reaction catalyzed near a BIM ultimately creates a reaction front in the fluid that mimics the BIM profile.  For these reasons, BIMs are critical for understanding the patterns formed by reaction fronts in fluid flows.   Our initial foundational studies on BIMs showed how they could be examined using the mathematical tools of dynamical systems theory.  We showed that our results agreed with earlier "grid-based" theoretical approaches, and we developed mathematical criteria to describe the conditions under which BIMs form.  Importantly, we successfully used our theory to better understand experiments performed by Prof. Tom Solomon at Bucknell University.       We next developed an explanation for how a reaction front could propagate past a BIM in periodically oscillating flows.  This work was based on the idea of "turnstiles", a mechanism by which a "lobe" of reacted material can propagate past a BIM, thereby invading a new region of the fluid.  As an application, we invented a lobe-based treatment protocol for protecting an ocean bay from an invading algae bloom.   In related work, we developed an understanding of when the front motion can settle down in to a steady state, in which the front appears "frozen" in place, not moving.  Such frozen fronts are important because the reacted and unreacted domains remain separated for all time.  We developed a set of geometric criteria on BIMs that show when they form frozen fronts.  We also developed an explanation for the transition that leads from a nonfrozen state to a frozen state, as well as transitions that change the basic shape of the frozen front.       Finally, we extended our work to fluid flows that are neither steady nor periodic in time, but which can have arbitrary time-dependence.  This is important because real flows in nature typically have complicated dependence on time.  For such systems, we again identified prominent one-way barriers to reaction fronts, barriers which again control the patterns seen in such systems.  We called these barriers burning Lagrangian coherent structures (bLCSs).  The bLCSs are closely related to the BIMs.  In fact, we validated that a bLCS closely mimics a BIM for the special case of a steady flow.   Broader impact.  This research has helped to establish a brand-new university (the University of California, Merced, was founded in 2005) in the Central Valley of California.  This is particularly important because the Central Valley is one of the most diverse, yet economically and educationally disadvantaged, regions of the country.
