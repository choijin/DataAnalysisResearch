<AbstractNarration>Memories on the time scale of seconds to tens of seconds are stored as patterns of neural activity that persist long after the offset of a stimulus. This persistent neural activity is believed to be critical for processing new information and forming cognitive perceptions. Recent studies suggest that purely circuit-based mechanisms are insufficient to explain the robustness of persistent activity to biological noise and perturbation. This proposal will test the hypothesis that persistent activity is maintained by a hybrid cellular/circuit mechanism in which circuit level feedback mediates the activation of memory processes in a neuron's dendrites known as plateau potentials. To quantitatively understand how active dendritic properties contribute to persistent activity, a new modeling framework will be developed to directly and simultaneously fit a memory network to data from a diverse set of experiments characterizing intrinsic excitability, anatomical connectivity, neural coding, and response to perturbations. These models will be used to predict the patterns of dendritic activity that can be seen with fluorescence calcium imaging. To test these predictions, the zebrafish preparation will be used to directly measure dendritic activity during eye movement behavior from cells storing a memory of desired eye position. Two-photon imaging of calcium indicators will be used to measure spatiotemporal patterns of activity in the dendritic neuropil, and separately in individual dendritic branchlets, to determine the presence of plateau potentials. Together, these computational and experimental results will help determine how cellular and circuit properties work in concert to generate one of the most important brain dynamics, persistent neural activity.</AbstractNarration>

This persistent neural activity is believed to be critical for processing new information and forming cognitive perceptions. Past studies suggest that purely circuit-based mechanisms are insufficient to explain the robustness of persistent activity to biological noise and perturbation.

To test this idea, we used the zebrafish model to directly measure dendritic activity during eye movement behavior from cells storing a memory of desired eye position. Dendritic activity was monitored using two-photon imaging of calcium indicators targeted to individual position neurons. The most extensive dendritic arbors were found on excitatory position neurons with axonal branchings that likely serve as a conduit for positive feedback within this circuit (<em>Lee et al., Journal of Neuroscience 2015</em>). Numerous active regions were identified throughout the arbor of individual neurons. Dendritic activity was generally well-correlated to eye position, but with variation from region to region in the time scales of relaxation following stimulation. Switch-like transitions were not observed under conditions where the inputs to the neurons were expected to be constant or smoothly varying. The regional variation in dynamics seen in the dendritic arbor was more restricted than a broader variation observed across the network in the dynamics of persistent firing (<em>Daie et al., Neuron 2015</em>). Placing these data in the context of a modeling framework developed to bridge between the cellular and network levels of investigation (<em>Fisher et al., Neuron 2013</em>) suggests these patterns arise when chain-like motifs of connectivity are present in the network. Thus, these data place constraints on the role of plateau potentials in generating robust persistent firing and argue that specialized circuit motifs may have been selected for this purpose (<em>Cannon and Robinson, Biological Cybernetics, 1983</em>).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/30/2015<br>      Modified by: Emre&nbsp;Aksay</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
