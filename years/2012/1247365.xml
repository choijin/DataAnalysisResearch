<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for a satellite workshop to the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), to be held in Dallas, TX on August 4-9, 2013.  The goal of the workshop is to explore subfields in cognitive science that hold the most promise for increasing our understanding of neural networks and computational intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IJCNN explores the theoretical and computational understanding of the brain in order to develop new and more effective forms of machine intelligence. Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and mental processes. The workshop is intended to foster  more effective integration between the two communities. The  workshop will provide a venue in which neural network researchers and students can learn more about the state of the art in cognitive science and its interface with computational intelligence. The broader impacts of the workshop include fostering new collaborations between neural network researchers and those working in other areas of cognitive science. In addition, it provides for reduced registration for women and other scientists underrepresented in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) is the premiere international conference for researchers in neural networks and related area. We got funding for an IJCNN Program called Cognitive Science: the Computational Paradigm. Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind and intelligence, integrating philosophy, psychology, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, linguistics, and anthropology, and recently also engineering. While not all cognitive scientists would agree that cognition is  inherently computational, the approach is massively popular.    We had  a workshop with twelve speakaers, and a panel discussion about educational aspects.   IJCNN is generally a conference for individuals interested in a theoretical and computational understanding of the brain and applying that knowledge to develop new and more effective forms of machine intelligence.  Cognitive science, of course, is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and mental processes, ant it has its own institutions, conferences etc. While it would be natural to have a significant overlap between the two communities, our perception is that this is overlap much smaller than we would like to see. Our main goal was with the workshop is to increase the efficiency of the information transfer from the cognitive science community towards the participants of IJCNN.  The workshop certainly provided an excellent opportunity to support the interaction.   Just one example: Paul Thagard, a leading figure of cognitive science, presented a new neural network model, i.e.  neural architecture for biological cognition, elaborate in Waterloo, Canada, Ont. We also learned about Integrating Cognition and Emotion from a lecture of Dr. Luiz Pessoa (U. Maryland). The workshop helped "out of the box" thinking.
