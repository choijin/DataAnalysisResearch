<AbstractNarration>PI: Jhon, Myung &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1225183&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Carnegie-Mellon University &lt;br/&gt;Title: The Ninth U.S.-Korea Forum on Nanotechnology: Exploring New Directions for Convergence of Nanoscience to Technology and Applications &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will organize the ninth forum on nanotechnology between the United States and Korea, to be held on June 4th and 5th 2012 in Seoul, Korea. This Forum is not only a continuation of the previous eight Forums on nanotechnology but also an opportunity to forecast advances in nanoscience and technology during the coming decade. The Forums organized in the past decade focused in establishing the budding role of transformative nanotechnology in the convergence of a broad range of scientific and engineering areas (NANO1) including active nano-devices and systems, sustainable nanomanufacturing, education, nano-energy, nano-biotechnology, and nano-electronics. The eighth Forum held in 2011 focused on nanotechnology convergence in sustainability with an emphasis on environmentally friendly technologies for the future; the Forum highlighted new horizons in nanotechnology for the next decade (NAN02) by addressing complex problems faced by an ever increasing global population. The proposed Forum will further establish a common platform for scientists and engineers from both countries by focusing on new R&amp;D directions in the next decade (NAN02), where nanotechnology will have dramatic impacts. The Forum will provide recommendations for new priorities and establish milestones for NAN02 regarding topics such as nano-fundamentals for convergence technologies, sustainability, nano-electronics, and biomedical processes. The PI will be the organizer for the U.S. participation, which will include one keynote speaker, 10 senior presenters and six early-career participants.  Roughly equal numbers of Korean presenters selected by Korean organizers will also participate. The Forum proceedings and findings will be published on Carnegie Mellon's website and will be available to a scientific community via a special issue in technical journals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novel contribution of this Forum, in contrast to previous Forums, is integrating the achievements in NANO 1 into future applications and identifying critical topics and benefits in NAN02 for the next decade. This Forum will also promote the exchange of research, education, and policy issues between the two countries in the emerging area of NAN02. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the exchange of ideas among the leading scientists and engineers in nanotechnology area, this Forum will recommend new paradigms in this field for the next decade and promote collaborative initiatives between the two countries. The Forum will make a significant contribution to society and the global environment in a broader sense by bringing NAN02 to the public. To achieve these goals, the PI will publish the content of the Forum in a special issue of a technical journal for extensive outreach to scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
