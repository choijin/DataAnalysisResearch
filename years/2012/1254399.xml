<AbstractNarration>1254399 - Singamaneni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plasmonic sensors hold enormous potential for the development of low-cost, label-free, point-of-care biodiagnostics, rapid chemical detection and environmental monitoring. However, two major challenges need to be overcome to reap the benefits of this class of biosensors: (i) state-of-theart plasmonic biosensors either offer limited sensitivity or are impractical for real-world applications due to their poor stability and excessive cost; (ii) these biosensors rely on natural antibodies, which are high-cost and impose severe limitations in handling, storage and device integration. We propose to realize highly sensitive and inexpensive plasmonic sensors. The focus of the proposed effort will be hierarchically ordered, self-assembled arrays of chemically synthesized plasmonic nanostructures. We will incorporate artificial monoclonal antibodies and demonstrate these to be a highly sensitive, specific, stable and low-cost biodiagnostic platform. This will be achieved through orientation-controlled molecular imprinting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will lead to development of simpler and more robust biosensors for detection of multiple important compounds.  This will be achieved by replacing antibodies - complicated, expensive and unstable molecules - with artificial equivalents based on less expensive and more stable materials.  In addition, novel nanotechnology approaches will be used for detection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project established the theoretical framework and experimental demonstration of plasmonic biosensors based on molecularly imprinted polymers.  The project provided a comprehensive comparison of the sensitivity and stability of plasmonic biosensors based on natural and artificial antibodies.  Although the natural antibody-based plasmonic biosensors exhibited superior sensitivity, their stability (temporal, thermal and chemical) was found to be vastly inferior to those based on artificial antibodies.  Using atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy, we have unveiled single molecular pair-wise interaction force between artificial (and natural) antibody and antigen.  We found that the rupture force associated with natural antibody and antigen is higher compared to artificial antibody and antigen.  Furthermore, our single molecule force spectroscopy study revealed that the natural antibody-antigen complex exhibited a higher binding stability compared to artificial antibody-antigen complex.  These fine differences at single molecular level manifested into the significantly different biosensing characteristics of plasmonic biosensors based on natural and artificial antibodies.  The AFM-based force spectroscopy-based approach proved to be a powerful tool to rationalize and guide the design of synthetic biorecogniton elements and relevant highly sensitive biosensors for resource-limited environments.  In an attempt to improve the binding affinity of the artificial antibody and antigen, we have optimized the chemical composition of the imprinted polymer. We have demonstrated that tailoring the monomer composition of molecular imprinted polymer based on the amino acid content of the target protein can improve the sensitivity of the plasmonic biosensors based on artificial antibodies.  For example, selectivity and sensitivity enhancement due to the presence of aromatic groups in imprinted polymer matrix was found to be higher for target proteins with higher aromatic amino acid content. We have also demonstrated a universal method, namely, PEGylation of the non-cavity regions of the imprinted polymer, to minimize the non-specific binding and significantly improve the selectivity and limit-of-detection of the molecular imprinted plasmonic biosensors.  The non-specific binding upon exposure to common interfering proteins was found to be more than 10-fold lower compared to the non-PEGylated counterparts.   The implications of our findings are far reaching.  We have introduced a number of methods to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of molecular imprinted polymers, which are broadly applicable across various transduction methods. In particular, plasmonic biosensors based on artificial antibodies offer numerous advantages compared to natural antibodies, such as: (i) greater long-term and environmental stability; (ii) resistance to biofouling; (iii) selective receptors without the need to inoculate laboratory animals (a significant reduction in cost); (iv) potentially higher safety than antibodies (provided the materials used are not intrinsically toxic);? and (v) reusability.    Ultimately, these advances are expected to result in printable plasmonic biosensors for diagnostic applications in resource-limited and point-of-care settings.
