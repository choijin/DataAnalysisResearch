<AbstractNarration>This project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Stacey Bent of Stanford University will carry out studies to better understand the mechanisms of nucleation and growth in molecular-layer deposition (MLD) and to develop new coupling chemistries for the process. Fundamental mechanistic studies will be carried out using well-defined surfaces, in situ and ex situ surface spectroscopies, and carefully chosen molecular systems. Studies are designed to investigate the relationship between competing effects, such as site nucleation and chain termination, in determining how nanoscale organic films grow in MLD and to expand the types of coupling chemistries that allow both monolayer and multilayer film formation at important surfaces. The results will inform molecular and nanoscale surface functionalization for future applications.  The broader impacts involve training a diverse group of graduate students, undergraduate researchers, high school teachers and community college interns; broadly disseminating research concepts and results to the scientific community, to the public, and to students; and the potential impacts of MLD research on molecular and nanoscale surface functionalization for applications in electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coating solid materials with organic films as thin as a few nanometers (about 10,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair) is a useful way to modify the properties of the solid and to introduce new behavior. The composition of the nanometer-thin coatings can be controlled by a method in which different organic molecules are deposited onto the surface of the solid in a layer-by-layer fashion. This layer-by-layer method of forming organic films is being explored for a range of applications including integrated circuits, protective coatings, lithographic patterning, and solar cells. A deeper understanding of this process is needed to gain better molecular-level precision and control. This project will study how nanometer-thin organic films grow using these methods and will also develop new chemistries to form the films.</AbstractNarration>
