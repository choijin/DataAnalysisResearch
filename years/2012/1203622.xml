<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of Florida to curate 33 collections of mollusks and other marine invertebrates totaling about 65,000 specimen lots (~400,000 specimens) of about 10,000 species.  The bulk of this material consists of donated, private, quality shell collections; the remainder is collections of reef-associated invertebrates.  Specimens will be made available to all interested at the Florida Museum of Natural History, and associated data (identifications, collection data, coordinates for Google Earth or other GIS systems) will be made broadly available via the Internet. The museum will also sponsor yearly workshops on mollusks and marine invertebrates, to engage and empower interested public, especially "shellers" and high school biology classes, in documenting and appreciating biodiversity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collections represent the library of life on Earth, in a rapidly changing world. The targeted collections were assembled mostly through the second half of the 20th century, often from habitats and populations that no longer persist.  They provide a rich record of land snails, marine mollusks and other invertebrates from American and tropical locations, documenting biodiversity and the changing land and seascape.  Disseminating information through the Internet and workshops will enable important scientific research and engage the general public in better understanding and valuing the natural world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding the diversity and distribution of life on Earth depends on taxonomic research, which in turn relies on specimens.  Museums, as the primary repositories of specimens, serve as libraries of biodiversity. Accurately identified specimens, together with the information about the time, place, habitat, and other ecological and biological information associated with the specimens, provide a wealth of information about species and diversity.  In order to study, identify, and document specimens, they need to be physically accessible to researchers.  In turn, identifications made by researchers, combined with information associated with specimens, should be made broadly available online to all interested.  Summed over specimens and species, millions of records from natural history collections provide a powerful resource for studying and learning about the biosphere.      Intellectual Merit  Many collections in private and public hands lack long-term security and are not readily accessible physically or online.  The Invertebrate Zoology division of the Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH-IZ) accepts scientifically-valuable collections from private collectors and public institutions that can no longer take care of them.  The primary objective of this project was to curate 13 larger (&gt;2000 specimen lots each) and 20 smaller collections, so that they become physically and digitally accessible.  These collections hold &gt;60,000 specimen lots (a lot is one or more specimens from the same time and place) of mollusks, corals, crustaceans, and other invertebrates, representing a total of ~400,000 specimens.  Highlights among the collections include the Simpson land snail collection from the 19th century that includes numerous now extinct species and extirpated populations, the Johnson-Williams freshwater mussel collection, the most significant fluid-preserved and associated tissue collection for this endangered freshwater group, and the Paulay coral collection, one of the most extensive coral collections from Oceania.  In addition to these collections another &gt;25,000 specimen lots from field work and research projects were also curated and made physically and digitally accessible during this project.  About 15,000 tissue samples associated with these two sets of collections, as well as &gt;78,000 images of living/fresh specimens were also curated.  The increased accessibility of these collections have led to substantial increases of collection use: visitors to the collection increased by 37%, loans of specimens by 36%, and publications on the collection by 30% over the course of the project.     Broader Impacts  Natural history collections have broad uses, well beyond their core disciplines of taxonomy, systematics, biogeography, and evolution.  Examples of such diverse uses of the FLMNH-IZ collection include using isotopic signatures in shells to study climate change; comparisons of species ranges over time based to follow distributional changes resulting from global change and human impact; testing sponge spicules as additives to concrete; identifying invasive species; etc.   This project trained ten undergraduate and two graduate students in specimens-based curation, biodiversity research, bioinformatics, and invertebrate zoology.  Four of the students employed also pursued independent research projects separate from this grant, at FLMNH-IZ.  The students employed by the project have all gone on or have been accepted to MS and PhD programs in the sciences, medical school, or are working in biomedical and veterinary jobs, and one is now practicing law.   As part of the broader impacts for this project, a workshop on marine biodiversity was designed for high school science teachers.  Three workshops were carried out at the Whitney Marine Lab, Citrus County Marine Science Station, and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute for teachers in those areas.  These weekend workshops alternated field, lecture, and lab-modules th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
