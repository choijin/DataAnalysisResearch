<AbstractNarration>The project by Metropolitan State University of Denver and its sister institutions Community College of Denver and University of Colorado-Denver, is integrating a 300 MHz FT-NMR (Fourier Transform-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectrometer into the organic laboratory.  The incorporation of modern spectroscopic techniques is enhancing the skill set students need for success in STEM careers.  The high resolution, sophisticated pulse sequences, and dramatically improved throughput of the FT-NMR is allowing a shift to inquiry- and discovery-based teaching laboratory experiences which in turn, is driving improvements in students' ability to reach valid conclusions from data, in their scientific literacy, and in their technical writing.  The project builds on preliminary data which demonstrates that students learn more and are more prepared for STEM careers and graduate study, when exposed to authentic research as opposed to traditional recipe/verification laboratory curriculum.  In addition to the incorporation of effective, evidenced-based teaching practices in the organic laboratories of the three institutions, the students will produce a dynamic, web-based lab manual wherein they are the primary contributors, the development of which enhances student literacy skills, research ethics, laboratory stewardship, and experimental design.  The project will lead to broadening participation in the sciences since the three institutions serve a large number of Colorado's underrepresented-in-STEM student population as well as numerous students who transfer from community colleges.</AbstractNarration>

Faculty and students have contributed to dynamic web-based lab manuals, with multiple contributors. This approach elevated the expectations placed on students and the performance and motivation of students to meet those expectations. As a result, undergraduate students learned skills related to science literacy, research ethics, laboratory stewardship, experimental design and dissemination of results. The laboratory manuals are an ongoing body of work, and will continue into the future. Over the next five years, the partners using this instrumentation expect to invite other peer PUI institutions to participate in efforts to provide a platform for the publication of undergraduate research projects. These projects will hopefully lead to an editorial board of faculty and undergraduate students. During the project, nascent development of modules for the laboratory manuals in the area of soft skills&mdash;presenting data, working in teams, establishing professional values has been developed. Instructional interventions have been implemented at Metro State based on the grant&rsquo;s external review (October 2015) from the University of Wisconsin.

In addition, the number of students for whom opportunities to work with faculty on teaching and learning for their peers went from 8/year (all at UCD) to greater than 25/year. An image of one student leader using the NMR is provided in this report. This funding led to a dramatic shift in the culture of undergraduate science education at Metro State, impacting far more students as it became institutionalized and threaded into other chemistry courses. This project led to two book chapters, one peer-reviewed paper in an undergraduate journal, and more than a dozen presentations at national, international, regional, and local research meetings. The TUES project interfaced with two other federally-funded grants, 1) STEPS (Strides Toward Encouraging Professions in Science), an NIH project managed by one of the co-PIs, and 2) DMCS (Denver Metro Chemistry Scholars), an NSF S-Stem grant. These three overlapping grants demonstrated success in increasing the number of minority students pursuing science degrees.
