<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports collaborative research between Professor Robert Bartynski of Rutgers University at New Brunswick and Professor Elena Galoppini at Rutgers University at Newark on the synthesis and characterization of tunable linker dipoles for improved solar energy conversion devices. This research, which brings together a synthetic chemist and a surface physicist, aims to achieve precise control of the electronic properties of the interface between an organic molecule and a semiconductor by tailoring the properties of the organic overlayer at the molecular level. Ultimately, this work will enhance the fundamental understanding and performance of organic-inorganic and organic-organic hybrid materials that are used in a wide variety of application areas including molecular electronics and photovoltaics. By molecular design of a variety of functional organic compounds, the research team will modify molecular energy levels (HOMO-LUMO) alignment, tune the donation and withdrawal of charge, and influence molecule bonding geometries at organic molecule/semiconductor interfaces. This will be accomplished using compounds with a Head-Linker-Anchor (HLA) configuration bound to metal oxide (TiO2 and ZnO) or organic (rubrene) semiconductor surfaces. The head groups (H) will be either organic chromophores or electron donor or acceptor groups, and the linker units (L) will contain an internal molecular dipole. The rigid linkers will be designed to bind at a well-defined orientation and distance from the semiconducting organic or inorganic surfaces. The electronic structure, dye-oxide energy level alignment, binding geometry, and effects of intermolecular interactions of HLA compounds on semiconductor substrates will be studied using a wide array, state-of-the-art ultrahigh vacuum-based surface characterization techniques. Spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements will complement the surface studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research, derived mainly from molecular level control of the organic/semiconductor interface, will touch many areas of science and technology including photocatalytic materials, photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and other devices. The educational component of the program will generate two innovative research modules where students gain hands-on experience that will solidify the connection between basic scientific research and technological advances that benefit society. Students will build simple solar cells based on molecules similar to those used in this research, but found in everyday items. The modules are easily adaptable for undergraduate laboratories at the two Rutgers campuses, and for demonstrations that will involve K-12 students. These activities will target underrepresented groups including high-school students from the Newark urban area. Student exchanges and co-advising of Ph.D. theses are integral to the program and the interdisciplinary collaboration between a synthetic chemist and a physicist will broaden the scientific education and training of the students from both laboratories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview of the Project and Objectives This project involves a collaboration between a surface physicist (Bartynski, Rutgers University-New Brunswick, NJ)  and a synthetic organic chemist (Galoppini, Rutgers University-Newark, NJ). The objective of this interdisciplinary research is to develop controlled, tunable,  and modular methodologies to decorate the surface of nanostructured or crystalline inorganic semiconductors  (i.e. metal oxides such as titanium dioxide) as well as single-crystal organic semiconductors (polyaromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs,  such as rubrene).  The electronic properties of these solid materials, and their ability to transport an electron or a hole, are influenced by  the presence of molecules bound their surface.  These organic/organic or organic/inorganic hybrid materials are important to develop  emerging types optoelectronic devices including  solar cells, sensors or  organic electronics.   The research is based on the hypothesis that designing the organic/semiconductor interfaces at the molecular level will enable the control of energy level alignment, interfacial chemistry, and allows to tune charge donation and withdrawal of the semiconductor. To this end, the team, together with international collaborators from Germany and Italy, has explored fundamental aspects of the bonding between organic molecules and the semiconducting substrates (i.e. the metal oxides or the PAHs) and has tested new concepts of surface modification.     Highlights of this work include the encapsulation of dye molecules into large molecular hosts, which are in turn bound onto the surface of the  semiconductors, the exploration of an unprecedented step-by-step process to decorate the surface of PAHs crystals, and the study of interactions and reactions of molecules on metal surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum environment.   Intellectual Merit:  This work   underpins the two groups long-term  efforts to enhance the fundamental understanding and performance of organic-organic hybrid materials that are used in a wide variety of application areas including organic semiconductor devices and photovoltaics.   Determining the fundamental principles that govern the bonding and electronic interactions between molecules and semiconductor substrates will facilitate significant advancements in these important technologies.  Effective ways to functionalize the surfaces and to tune interfacial properties of the semiconductors explored in this research are still little developed, and the NSF-sponsored research effort has  addressed  this need through new creative approaches.    Broader Impacts:  The proposed research, though fundamental in scope,  will impact fundamental research in areas of science and technology beyond the specific properties of molecule-semiconductor materials  that were  measured in this work. For instance, organic semiconductors are already finding applications in printed electronics, sensors, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and other devices. Critical device functions depend on material characteristics, such as charge carrier mobility, which in turn depend on the semiconductor surface properties.

Presentations at open houses and during outreach to local high  schools offered the opportunity to describe this work to the broader public.  The work is still in progress, as two more students will defend their thesis based on this work, and both  teams continues to publish and collaborate internationally.
