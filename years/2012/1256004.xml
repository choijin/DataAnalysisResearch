<AbstractNarration>The Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment (KLEE) was established in 1995 to examine the separate and combined effects of livestock and wildlife on each other and on the land they share.  This controlled exclusion of cattle, wildlife, and large herbivores provides a unique experimental setting in which to answer basic and applied questions about the ecology, conservation, and management of semi-arid ecosystems. Data collected over the next five years will enhance understanding of soil, plant, and herbivore responses to multi-year weather cycles, with an emphasis on variation in rainfall. Additional experiments will determine the causes and consequences of variation in tree densities and include both eco-hydrological and eco-physiological studies. Continuation of this long-term experiment is necessary to capture the slowly-developing processes and interannual variation that are critical to ecosystem function in savanna landscapes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Globally, the goals of rangeland management and biodiversity conservation collide with increasing frequency, as wildlife become more dependent on rangeland for survival. By examining the conditions under which wildlife and livestock co-exist, results from this project directly inform a reconciliation of these conflicting goals. The study attracts collaborating scientists from multiple institutions and trains both Kenyan and US students in research. The study plots host undergraduate research projects and class visits from Kenya, the United States, and other international collaborating countries.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment (KLEE) is a large-scale factorial experiment established in 1995 that has been investigating the effects of native and domestic herbivores (and now, fire) on each other and on their shared savanna landscape (Figure 1). The KLEE experiment allows us to examine the separate and combined effects of domestic livestock (cattle) and two native herbivore guilds (meso- and mega-herbivores) within a savanna ecosystem to answer a wide variety of fundamental and applied questions. This experiment can be thought of as either a) a comparison of different land uses (e.g., livestock production, wildlife reserve, or mixed use), or b) escalating extinction scenarios (loss of mega-herbivores, loss of other wildlife, replacement by cattle).<strong> </strong>We continue to attract other research groups whose work depends on our experimental plots. In the 20+ years that NSF has been supporting the KLEE project, we and our collaborators have published 122 peer-reviewed papers from the overall study, and 84 from the exclosures themselves, making <strong>KLEE the most productive field experiment ever carried out on the continent of Africa</strong>. The project has also produced 26 outreach publications and supported 27 masters and doctoral dissertations, more than half of which were carried out by Kenyan students. An additional Broader Impact has been our commitment to using the KLEE study to inform livestock management and wildlife conservation in multi-use landscapes, through peer-reviewed publications, outreach publications, and direct stakeholder engagement. Our latest NSF LTREB grant (DEB 12-56004) achieved its stated objectives with respect to: 1) multiple drought monitoring and analysis, 2) trophic cascades<sup> </sup>(Figure 2), 3) context-dependence, 4) woody layer dynamics, 5) landscape heterogeneity, and 6) ecosystem ecophysiology/ ecohydrology effects. In particular, during the duration of this latest five-year grant, we have published 42 peer-reviewed papers, including three synthetic reviews. Our studies of multiple trophic cascades<sup> </sup>include disease vectors and pathogens. Several of these studies are part of our integration of the KLEE experiments with broader landscape land-use analyses. The long-term exclusion of large mammalian herbivores is beginning to result in differences in soil chemistry. We also have explored herbivore impacts on soil cracking and hydrology<sup> </sup>and the dynamics of soil microbes and carbon sequestration.</p> <p>Our analysis of long-term data from KLEE demonstrated that the most important axis of variation in rangeland plant community structure is driven by overall grazing pressure, regardless of whether this is from cattle or wildlife. Similarly, we used both remote-sensing and field-based assessments to demonstrate that herbivory by cattle and/or wildlife increases ecosystem primary productivity (stimulation of grass growth by herbivory), except at the highest herbivory levels. Livestock and wildlife, however, do differ in their effects on NPP variability. We have also begun to use the long-term data to explore changes in community stability and resilience in this system, in the face of multiple interacting stressors.</p> <p>In 2013, we carried out 18 controlled burns within our KLEE rangeland plots. These fire experiments are revealing complex interactions among rangeland drivers, including clear demonstrations of strong synergy (context-dependence) between fire and herbivory and subsequent trophic cascades involving both livestock and native biodiversity. In 2018, we re-burned these 18 subplots, and carried out 18 more (36 burns in 2018), demonstrating significant year effects (fires behave differently in different years), effects of single vs. multiple burns, and the effects of past burn x herbivore interactions on fire behavior and its consequences. One fascinating result is that the flush of regrowth after local fires attracts intense herbivory by both livestock and wildlife, which reduces the amount of grass (fuels) available for subsequent fires.</p> <p>In summary, the KLEE project is continuing to be very productive. Recurring themes include strong competition between different herbivores (including between livestock and wildlife), but also fascinating pathways of positive interactions, confirming the potential for coexistence with biodiversity at moderate livestock densities. The trophic cascades initiated by large herbivores (both cattle and wildlife) are deep and impactful, including their effects on disease vectors and pathogens. All of these are effected by fire, often in complex and surprising ways.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/07/2019<br>      Modified by: Kari&nbsp;E&nbsp;Veblen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1256004/1256004_10229672_1569862090497_kleeschem--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1256004/1256004_10229672_1569862090497_kleeschem--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1.
