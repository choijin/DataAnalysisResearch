<AbstractNarration>Biodiversity comprises all variations of life at all levels of biological organization, most of which arise from genomic diversity. As genomic technologies become available across the biological sciences, a full characterization of biodiversity demands a full characterization of genomes. Similarly, data synthesis across the full range of biodiversity research domains demands development, implementation, integration and harmonization of data exchange standards. Such interoperable informatics would be transformational for our understanding of biology, with consequent impact on environmental and conservation policy. Adding to the transformational potential is the fact that the microbial world represents half of the world's biomass and nearly all of its biodiversity, yet is still effectively invisible and intractable to traditional biodiversity research. Metagenomic data are not amenable to the concepts, standards, semantics, and methods of traditional eukaryotic biodiversity, and therefore, require an alternate informatics framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EAGER will transform the collaborations between two previously separate research communities: the informaticists of the traditional biodiversity community, who employ the Darwin Core (DwC) as a standard, and the informaticists of the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC), who have developed the Minimal Information about any Sequence (MIxS) standard for genomics, metagenomics and marker genes. Together, these groups will engage in a unified informatics effort to develop three layers of interoperability. The EAGER will harmonize the observational (DwC) and genomic (MIxS) standards, building on a community dialogue and interdisciplinary networking hosted and established under an NSF Research Coordination Network. Standards interoperability is the basis for the next two layers. Syntactic interoperability (in the context of Internet APIs and a database Reference Model) will be supported. The EAGER will assemble experts from the two communities to (a) devise a database Reference Model that integrates the DwC and GSC MIxS standards; and (b) for effective data management, create specific implementations for different database platforms to foster adoption. The practical implementation of the reference model on/for different database systems will allow, for the first time, systematic comparative testing of technical performance and of use cases (e.g., which implementation best serves which complex data query). The EAGER will create task groups to establish the infrastructure for managing ontologies, and to construct a reference model on the purely semantic level in order to fuse the two worlds of data standards, both of which are advanced enough to engage in useful interoperability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In developing an interdisciplinary information infrastructure to achieve data interoperability across domains, this EAGER would advance understanding of complex environmental phenomena and, thereby, inform future policy decisions. Indeed, by leading to an informatics standards platform to conceive a novel conceptual and theoretical framework for the world of microbial ?dark matter,? the EAGER would have a transformational impact beyond science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over this concluding performance period, this award supported the planning and execution of a community meeting, entitled ?New Opportunities to Study Origins of the Eukaryotic Cell.? This meeting was conducted at the Janelia Research Campus over the days spanning April 15-18, 2018.  This award further supported the generation of a summary report on the outcomes of the meeting.  This meeting brought together thought leaders to discuss how eukaryotes evolved and to explore new opportunities to accelerate understanding of their evolution. Meeting participants explored how the study of non-eukaryotic cells and basal eukaryotes can provide insight into the origins of eukaryotic cellular organization, organelles, and eukaryote-specific molecular pathways. Attendees shared key data emerging from genomics, proteomics, informatics, computational biology, structural biology and microscopy, highlighting the most exciting opportunities for future research. Participants further discussed gaps in our knowledge and identified specific research areas where the development of new strategies, new methods and new tools would most rapidly propel our understanding of the origins and diversity of eukaryotic cellular processes. The program was comprised of short (15 min) talks, poster sessions and breakout sessions to explore sub-topics in greater depth. Participants and organizers further produced a written summary of the opportunities and potential strategies to accelerate research on the evolution of eukaryotes (to be published in 2019 or 2020). The key outcome of this meeting was the identification of 3 organizing research priorities (and recommended approaches and associated disciplines) to drive deeper understanding of eukaryotic origins.  These priorities are summarized as follows:   1. Explore and Classify Earth?s Biodiversity   &rarr; What is the full extent of Earth?s biodiversity? Are substantial branches of the phylogenetic tree of life missing that would reveal key links between Archaea and Eukaryotes? Based on combined metabolic / phylogenetic trees and physiological inferences, can we reconstruct the eukaryotic common ancestor?     Potential Approaches:  1) Continue to explore and analyze microbial diversity, ecophysiology, and structure across as wide a range of environments as possible.  2) Using new and existing genomic and proteomic data, build robust phylogenetic trees that incorporate physiological data to clarify evolutionary relationships and characterize missing branches.  3) Reconstruct the eukaryotic ancestor?s physiological and structural traits.     Key Disciplines: Environmental microbiology, Fluorescence Microscopy, Meta-omics, Genetics, Computational Biology, Electron Microscopy, Phylogenetics.   2. Clarify the Evolutionary History and Fundamental Principles of the Eukaryotic Cell     &rarr; What was the sequence of events that gave rise to eukaryotic cells? Where did the organelles come from? Which features are necessary and/or sufficient for a eukaryotic cell (e.g., genome size, organelle complement) and what are its constraints (e.g., size, metabolism)? Are evolutionary pressures for prokaryotes and eukaryotes different? Do they respond differently?     Potential Approaches:  1) Examine how the environment exerts its influence on cells and how evolutionary pressures may have contributed to eukaryogenesis  2) Delineate the path(s) to eukaryogenesis  3) Determine the limits of eukaryotic life, in comparison to prokaryotes     Key Disciplines: Evolutionary Biology, Geobiology, Cell Biology, Statistics, Molecular Biology, Mass Spectrometry, Synthetic Biology, Genetic Engineering, Analytical Chemistry   3. Study Microbial Communities to Develop Key Principles of Inter-Organism Interactions     &rarr; What drives interspecies interactions, and how does the polarity of metabolic interactions shift under different conditions? Which aspects of collaboration are generalizable? What enables the transition to multicellularity, and how can multi-component communities inform this investigation?     Potential Approaches:  1) Probe interspecies interactions under environmentally relevant conditions to understand how partnerships expand habitable zones, enable energetic complexity, and drive evolution.  2) Build microbial interactions from co-cultures and model systems in the lab, using known settings and controlled manipulation to rigorously evaluate behaviors and responses under distinct conditions.  3) Integrate empirical data with modeling approaches to understand the fundamental principles at play.     Key Disciplines: Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering, Biochemistry, Marine Microbiology, Meta-omics, Culturing, Modeling          Last Modified: 05/30/2019       Submitted by: Mark H Ellisman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
