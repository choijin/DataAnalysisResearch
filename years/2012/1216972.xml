<AbstractNarration>The overall objective of this research is to develop numerical models and efficient energy-consistent methods for simulation of complex fluid systems and to obtain physically-accurate solutions for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems, in particular. This work focuses on minimizing the computational cost of approximating solutions to these systems in order to develop practical simulations for this type of problem. The bottom line is to further develop discretization and solution algorithms that yield the most accuracy per computational cost. This is achieved by deriving discrete energy laws for MHD systems and proving that they are consistent with the continuous mathematical model. The investigators accomplish this by using the Energetic-Variational Approach (EVA) to further investigate the MHD model itself and determining which "flavor" of the MHD equations is the simplest model that captures the relevant physics. One of the main issues with using finite-element methods for solving complex fluid and electromagnetic problems has been the precise preservation of divergence-free solutions. Here, the investigators analyze discretization methods that satisfy these quantities accurately, while remaining amenable to efficient solution.  Finally, the main bottleneck in the discretization methods used so far is the slow convergence of the linear solvers. By further developing multigrid methods for systems of partial differential equations, the investigators create a robust and efficient algorithm for these complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of an efficient simulation framework for MHD systems has a major impact on the study of fusion energy, as this model is used to describe various phenomena that occur in fusion reactors, including tearing mode and sawtooth instabilities. With projects such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France and the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Lab attempting to obtain sustainable fusion energy, scientific computing in fields related to these projects is critical. In addition, the numerical tools being developed, such as energy-preserving finite-element discretizations and optimal multigrid solvers for systems of PDEs, are applicable to a wide variety of other problems in multi-physics and multi-scale systems.  Finally, the project supports a graduate student, training and exposing them to the latest scientific findings and tools related to modeling, discretization, and solution of problems in the computational modeling of plasma physics and complex fluids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall objective of this research was to develop numerical models and efficient energy-consistent methods for the simulation of complex multi-scale physical systems, particularly those of plasma physics described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These models are described by coupled systems of time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations and present many interesting challenges common to models used in physics, mathematics, and more generally in the numerical simulation and analysis of physical phenomena. The resulting outcomes of this project addressed several important aspects of these challenges. Namely, the PIs were able to develop numerical models that preserve important physical quantities of such systems, and were capable of analyzing and implementing solution methods that simulated these models efficiently.    Working on this project, the PIs addressed both the computational modeling (discretization methods) and the solution algorithms (nonlinear and linear solvers) to simulate these models.  Specifically, the PIs analyzed and developed discretization methods that preserve the inherent energy laws of such systems.  It was shown that not only do the developed methods preserve such energy laws, they do so with higher accuracy than would be expected.  Along the way, the PIs were able to use some of the results and apply them to other problems.  This included the development of techniques to address problems that involve very small parameters.  While standard methods become less robust when the parameter becomes small, the approach developed under this project is capable of efficiently solving such problems independently of the parameter size.  Additionally, the PIs developed methods to address other physical properties of the given system, including various conservation laws.  By modifying existing methods to consider the constraints exactly, an approach was developed that preserved the conservation laws, without losing advantageous properties of the discretization.     Regarding the solution methods, developed under this project, the PIs specifically addressed the development of multilevel iterative solvers that preserve the important properties of the physical and computational model (such as incompressibility), while also using a minimal amount of computational resources.  Solvers were developed originally for the MHD system that was under consideration, but were easily adapted to other coupled-physics problems, where such methods would prove to be useful.  These include applications in liquid crystals.    In accomplishing all of these outcomes, the results were disseminated via several publications, as well as conference talks.  Additionally, a major product of this project included the development of a software package to implement the multilevel solvers.  This package is currently being used to perform experiments to back up the theory developed under this project, but also has been successfully used on other application areas, including simulations of static liquid crystals.   A major impact of this project has been the professional development of a graduate research assistant (GRA) and a postdoctoral scholar.  The GRAdeveloped an in depth background in numerical analysis and computational science.  In addition, he was given the opportunity to present his work at several conferences throughout his tenure on the grant, both domestically and internationally.  The GRA was a lead author on several of the publications produced by this project, and successfully defended his thesis in 2015. In the final year of the project, the PIs also supported a postdoctoral scholar, who was trained in various computational methods and helped produced some of the final results of the project.        Finally, the advancement of techniques developed under this project to solve the MHD equations impact several scientific fields including fusion energy. It is crucial to study the instabilities that can arise in a multi-billion dollar experiment such as the ITER project before it goes on line. Sophisticated simulations of these processes will have significant impact on the design of experiments that are conducted under the project. In addition, the new multilevel iterative solvers can have a large impact on the scientific community and can be generalized to other application areas, as is shown for liquid crystal simulations.
