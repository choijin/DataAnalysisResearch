<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reconstruction and repair of ceramic and glass artifacts has long been a central part of art conservation in museums around the world.   Rejoining fragments into whole artifacts is important to understanding the original function of artifacts and for providing meaningful displays with which to educate the public.   Polymeric adhesives, such as acrylics and epoxies, can be successfully used to join fragments together, but are difficult to remove making correction of reconstructive errors difficult and leaving polymeric contamination to interfere with future microscopic and chemical analyses of the artifacts.  The objective of this project is to study the use of thermally- and photochemically reversible epoxies as adhesives that can be use to bond fragments together, but that can be reworked or even removed entirely with minimal adverse affects.  These epoxies are composed of a liquid epoxy resin and a liquid curing agent that react to afford a highly cross-linked polymer with the same mechanical properties of traditional epoxies.   However, whereas traditional epoxies irreversibly cure into an intractable material, these epoxies will have thermal or photochemical weak-links built into every resin component that will allow for their triggered conversion with exposure to heat (&gt; 90 °C) or ultraviolet light back into liquid constituents.   The thermal weak-link will be the Diels Alder cycloadduct of a maleimide and furan that is known to form at room temperature but reverts to its constituents at temperatures above 90 °C.   The photochemical weak-link will be the cyclodimer of a coumarin derivative that forms with exposure to long wave ultraviolet and is cleaved by shortwave ultraviolet light.   The epoxy adhesives built with these weak-links will be used to bond glass or ceramic fragments together.   Mechanical testing will be conducted to compare these materials with commercial epoxy adhesives then the thermal or photochemical degradation of the adhesive bonds and the efficacy of removing the oligomeric residues will be evaluated.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is directed at development and application of new adhesives that can be used to repair artifacts or assemble fragments into whole pieces, but can be readily removed by heating above 90 °C or with exposure to ultraviolet light.   Restoration and preservation of art and artifacts often requires adhesives, but many are difficult, if not impossible to remove without damaging the artwork that it was meant to preserve or repair.   This project will include the development of the thermally or photochemically removable adhesives and testing their application as adhesives to join ceramics and glass and demonstration the reversibility of the adhesive bonding with the application of heat or light.    Success will provide a new, important tool for conservators and museums for repairing or reconstructing artifacts.   These removable adhesives will also prove valuable to any application needing a high performance adhesive that can readily removed or reset, including microelectronics manufacturing, aerospace composites, and medical prostheses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction              Adhesives are used to repair broken items by gluing the pieces together using a kind of plastic.  One of the best types of adhesives is called an epoxy.   Epoxy adhesives are formed by mixing two liquids together then applying the mixture to the surfaces of the broken item. The liquid mixture becomes a hard, tough plastic called a thermoset.   Because the epoxy is strong and adheres well to surfaces, it is widely used, even by museums, for repairing wooden, plastic, glass, metal or ceramic items.  However, epoxy adhesives cannot be removed except by physically grinding the glue away or by burning it.  Epoxies do not dissolve in any solvent.  Museums sometimes need to remove the adhesive from an artifact in their collections, so it is desirable for the epoxy adhesives to be removable or reworkable.   The objective of this project was to develop new epoxies that could be removed by means other than physical grinding or breaking which oftentimes damages the artifact being repaired.  We have developed new epoxy adhesives that can be applied like commercially available epoxies, yet can be removed by heating to above 90 &deg;C.  We also developed another class of epoxies that can be removed by exposing them to ultraviolet light (UV).   In the process, we also invented a new UV fluorescent dye that could be used to help identify where an epoxy adhesive has been applied (Figure 1).  This new fluorescent dye can be added to any commercial epoxy to make it fluoresce blue with ultraviolet light.  Intellectual Merit.              This project met and exceeded its goals in developing new epoxy adhesives that can be removed with heat or ultraviolet light.  We developed several new, colorless epoxy adhesives and demonstrated that they were as strong as comparable commercial epoxies and that, unlike commercial epoxies, they could be softened and removed with heating above 90 &deg;C.   To accomplish this we had to design the epoxy to fall apart with heat, then reform after being cooled below 90 &deg;C.  We were able to demonstrate that the epoxies could be used to repair ceramics, glass or metal items and be completely removed with heating and washing with solvent.              Epoxies that would soften with UV were desired for repairing artifacts in museums that could not be heated, but that were unaffected by UV.   To accomplish this we invented three new classes of adhesives based, in part, on naturally occurring dyes found in parsley.   These adhesives are applied to a surface then long wave UV light sets or cures the adhesive into a hard thermoset.  To soften the adhesive, it is exposed to shortwave UV that breaks it back down into a liquid.   The same plant based dye used to prepare these UV cleavable adhesives, was used to make commercial epoxies fluoresce under UV, to help identify where the adhesive had been applied.  The dye is chemically connected to the thermoset so it will not leach out into liquids.     Broad Impact.              This project?s broad impact was in 1) training graduate students to create and test new adhesives, 2) educating undergraduates and students in Tucson, Arizona schools about polymers and adhesives, and 3) creating new thermally and photochemically reworkable adhesives that have potential applications beyond their use in museums by conservationists.  These new adhesives may have uses in microelectronics manufacturing, dental composites, and for use by consumers.  In addition to helping art conservationists identify repair work, the fluorescent additive could also be used for fluorescent paint, and security tagging without risk of any chemicals leaching from the material. The project led to six invention disclosures and 3 patent applications. Its results were widely communicated through academic publications and presentations at National scientific meetings.
