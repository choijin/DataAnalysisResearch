<AbstractNarration>The overarching goal of this award is to study, together with the other coordinated PENGUIn projects, the multi-scale, complex global solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere electrodynamic natural system that can impact a variety of human technological systems in space and on the ground. To forecast and thus mitigate that impact, it is necessary to develop accurate physical models of the Sun-Earth system, which is a major goal of the National Space Weather Program. This goal is hampered, however, by the lack of sufficient data to validate global models, particularly in the Southern hemisphere. Therefore, deploying closely-spaced chain of geophysical instruments in the Antarctic makes possible geomagnetically conjugate multi-instrument studies utilizing data with high temporal and spatial resolution from both the Southern and Northern hemispheres. Important aspects of this investigation include (1) the utilization of a collaborative federation of space research instrument operators in both polar regions to improve spatial coverage and access to global data sets, (2) the deployment of autonomous low-power instrument systems along the 40 degree geomagnetic meridian in the Antarctic to improve the spatial distribution of the federated instrument arrays, and (3) near real-time access to the remote Antarctic station measurements through satellite telemetry. The developed technology could be used to support measurement programs in other geophysical disciplines. The project's data are important to several major research initiatives of national importance, including the NSF's GEM and CEDAR programs, the NASA's "Living With a Star" and THEMIS satellite programs, as well as the National Space Weather Program. The data sets will be made available to scientists worldwide via the World Wide Web access while stored in the PENGUIn program and THEMIS satellite databases. The project will train graduate students and post-docs with the development and operation of the deployed instruments, as well as with space weather science investigations. Use of these data to validate space weather models can provide benefit to society as a whole as it aides to protect various navigation, communications, and defense technologies from severe space weather events.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The investigations supported by this project are relevant to understanding the complex interactions of the solar wind with the Earth?s magnetosphere and ionosphere that lead, in turn, to various space weather phenomena.  These include: the development of electrical current systems in space and in the ionosphere that carry over a million amperes of current; the energization of charged particles that can damage satellite electronics in space; and the production of density irregularities in the high latitude ionosphere that can disrupt communication and navigation systems.  The Antarctic stations established and operated through the support of this project monitor the region where the geomagnetic field lines that first encounter the solar wind intersect the dayside high latitude ionosphere, thus enabling investigation of the processes that couple energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere and ionosphere.  The Antarctic stations are specifically located along the 40-degree magnetic meridian to be magnetically conjugate to a chain of stations in the northern hemisphere along the west coast of Greenland.  Thus, it is possible to measure simultaneously the phenomena in both hemispheres that result from the coupling of energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere.  The solar wind is a highly conducting gas of protons and electrons flowing supersonically from the Sun.  Because of the high conductivity, the magnetic field of the Sun is ?frozen? into the gas and is pulled outward with the flow.  Because the solar wind is composed of charged particles, a planetary magnetic field appears as an obstacle to the solar wind flow. Various processes can couple energy from the solar wind flow into the magnetosphere and produce what we now call space weather.   These processes can drive electrical currents that carry millions of amperes through the magnetosphere and into the conducting layer of the upper atmosphere called the ionosphere.  These currents are one form of space weather, and variations of these currents can have serious impacts on electrical power distribution systems and long distance pipelines on the surface of the Earth.  Changes in solar wind dynamic pressure can also produce impulsive events within the magnetosphere, and there are many other complex phenomena that can occur within this system.  The primary purpose of this project is to measure the electromagnetic consequences of these processes on the dayside of the Earth, where the solar wind first encounters the Earth?s magnetic field.  The magnetic field lines that first encounter the solar wind map to high latitudes in both northern and southern hemispheres.  Electrical currents flow along magnetic field lines into the northern and southern hemispheres in response to changes in the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field.  To fully understand the coupling processes and the evolution of the space weather that results, it is necessary to observe simultaneously in both hemispheres due to various asymmetries.   For example, one hemisphere is in summer (highly conductive ionosphere produced by sunlight) and the other hemisphere is in darkness so less conductivity.  The Earth?s magnetic field is best represented by a tilted dipole magnet offset from the center of the Earth.   Thus, the magnetic field in the southern hemisphere is weaker than the field in the northern hemisphere.   It is necessary to understand the consequences of these asymmetries on the coupling processes in order to develop and validate space weather models.  Supported by this project, we have deployed a chain of autonomous magnetometer stations along the 40-degree magnetic meridian to be magnetically conjugate to an existing chain of stations along the west coast of Greenland.  We have operated the Antarctic stations, obtained the at a via Iridium satellite link and have investigated the data together with the Greenland observations.   Several scientific papers have been published to report the results of our investigations during the period of this project.
