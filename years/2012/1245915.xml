<AbstractNarration>Hamilton/1246400&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports an integrated field observation, remote sensing and numerical modeling study of the McMurdo Shear Zone (SZ). The SZ is a 5-10 km wide strip of heavily crevassed ice that separates the McMurdo and Ross ice shelves, and is an important region of lateral support for the Ross Ice Shelf. Previous radar and remote sensing studies reveal an enigmatic picture of the SZ in which crevasses detected at depth have no apparent surface expression, and have orientations which are possibly inconsistent with the observed flow field. In the proposed work, we seek to test the hypothesis that the SZ is a zone of chaotic Lagrangian mixing with (intersecting) buried crevasses which leads to rheological instability, potentially allowing large scale velocity discontinuities. The work will involve detailed field-based observations of crevasse distributions and structure using ground-penetrating radar, and GPS and remote sensing observations of the flow and stress field in the SZ. Because of the hazardous nature of the SZ, the radar surveys will be conducted largely with the aid of a lightweight robotic vehicle. Observations will be used to develop a finite element model of ice shelf shear margin behavior.  The intellectual merit of this project is an increased understanding of ice shelf shear margin dynamics. Shear margins play a key role in ice shelf stability, and ice shelves in turn modulate the flux of ice from the ice sheet across the grounding line to the ocean. Insights from this project will improve large-scale models being developed to predict ice sheet evolution and future rates of sea level rise, which are topics of enormous societal concern.  The broader impacts of the project include an improved basis for US Antarctic Program logistics planning as well as numerous opportunities to engage K-12 students in scientific discovery. Intensified crevassing in the shear zone between the Ross and McMurdo ice shelves would preclude surface crossing by heavy traverse vehicles which would lead to increased costs of delivering fuel to South Pole and a concomitant loss of flight time provided by heavy-lift aircraft for science missions on the continent. Our multidisciplinary research combining glaciology, numerical modeling, and robotics engineering is an engaging way to show how robotics can assist scientists in collecting hazardous field measurements. Our outreach activities will leverage Dartmouth's current NSF GK-12 program, build on faculty-educator relationships established during University of Maine's recent GK-12 program, and incorporate project results into University of Maine's IDEAS initiative, which integrates computational modeling with the existing science curriculum at the middle school level. This award has field work in Antarctica.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The McMurdo Shear Zone (SZ) is a five kilometer wide swath of crevassed ice that defines a boundary between the faster moving Ross Ice Shelf (RIS) and the slower moving McMurdo Ice Shelf (MIS).  It is visually identified by severe crevassing, or cracks, in the firn.  The SZ is over 200 km long and up to ~200 m thick. Ice Shelves in Antarctica bolster glaciers, ice streams and ice sheets where they drain the continent.  If they break up then it becomes easier for the ice to drain, resulting in sea level rise.  Ice shelves can break up by decaying in place and by breaking any attachments to land or other ice bodies along their edges. Shear zones in ice sheets have velocity gradients that cause stresses leading fracture, crevassing and folds.  Crevasses are well known in shear zones, and when they extend through the ice shelf it indicates that disintegration and break up is underway. This project aimed to answer questions regarding the present and future stability of the McMurdo Shear Zone through an integrated study combining three field seasons of observation and development of a model of the stress fields in the shear zone that lead to crevassing and folds.  Using radar towed by an autonomous robot, we imaged a 5 km by 5.7 km region of the shear zone in two consecutive years.  We imaged the ice from the surface to a marine ice layer frozen to the bottom of the ice shelf (over 160 m) to determine whether the crevasses extend to the bottom of the ice, or if crevasses extend significantly (a third to half of the ice shelf thickness) up from the ice bottom.
