<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to defray the expenses of participants in a week-long summer symposium on recent advances in real analysis that will be take place from July 25-30, 2012, at the Berks College campus of the Pennsylvania State University. Much of the funding will be directed toward the goal of disseminating knowledge to and the inclusion of underrepresented minorities and women mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the thirty-sixth in a long-running series of real analysis summer symposia. The past decade has witnessed a resurgence, on both the national and international scenes, of research activity in the classical area of real analysis, a resurgence driven in part by the ever-growing importance of real analysis for many other mathematical disciplines. This trend is typified by the work of the three plenary speakers at the 2012 event: Zoltan Buczolich, Emma D'Aniello, and Yang Wang. The Summer Symposium, which throughout its existence has attracted a large international audience, will play a central role in future developments in the field. The conference will offer researchers the opportunity to hear and share the newest findings in the field of real analysis.</AbstractNarration>
