<AbstractNarration>The National Association of Biology Teachers is holding a Professional Development Summit meeting for two-year and four-year college faculty at its annual Professional Development Conference in Dallas in November, 2012.  The topic will be propagating the "change" implicit in the document Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action.  The day-long Summit features plenary sessions with noted speakers and leaders in education reform.  It includes an interactive workshop on "Classroom Integration in the Introductory Biology Classroom," demonstrating practical management of this new approach to science education.  Interested participants then constitute a corps of faculty activated to transform aspects of their teaching during the following year, assisted by mentors from among the speakers.  This process gives visibility to the Vision and Change movement and a ripe audience to disseminate its mandates.</AbstractNarration>

A 2011 report prepared by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), "Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action" proposed a number of goals for biology education to best prepare students for the complex, science- and technology-driven society of the 21st century.
