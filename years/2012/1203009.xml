<AbstractNarration>The Network of Cooperative Science Centers (CSCs) and High Schools for Training High School Students in Geosciences is a Track 2 program designed to create an effective pipeline for recruiting high school students and preparing them for transition through undergraduate and graduate programs to the workforce in geosciences. The program has two major components, Outreach to High Schools, and a 6-week's summer program. Through the outreach program, geoscience recruitment materials are disseminated to teachers and counselors.  In addition, selected high schools are visited to make presentations to more than 500 juniors and seniors nationwide. Students are provided information about undergraduate and graduate degree programs in geosciences available at the more than 20 institutions that make up the four CSCs. They also receive information about the existing opportunities for financial support, mentoring and research in geosciences at the bachelors, masters and doctoral levels. The outreach program helps to increase students' access to learning about Earth System Science, and recruitment into geoscience degree programs or related sciences in the universities. Thirteen (13) high school seniors preparing to enter college are recruited into the 6-weeks summer geoscience bridge program each year. The program uses an Earth System Science approach, enhances the quantitative skills of the students, and exposes them to workforce needs and careers in geosciences.  It also creates opportunities for students to work in a culturally diverse environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to create an effective pipeline for recruiting high school students and preparing them for transition through undergraduate and graduate programs to the workforce in geosciences.  Funding from NSF and resources at four geoscience NOAA Cooperative Science Centers (CSCs) were leveraged to execute the project.  The program had two major components, outreach to high schools, and a 6-week's summer bridge program.  Through the outreach program, geoscience recruitment materials were disseminated to high school science teachers and counselors.  The 6-weeks summer program provided the students rigorous education in Earth System Science via lectures and hands-on laboratory and field activities.  There were also field trips that fostered cohesion among students, while providing an educationally enriching experience, as well as lectures, and tutorials in math to strengthen their quantitative skills.  Students enrolled in DNSC 100, a freshman seminar course designed to facilitate the adjustment of freshman science majors to college life.  A total of fifty-one (51) students participated in the program from 2012 to 2015 of which 88% belonged to underrepresented minority groups and 54% were females.  The students enrolled as undergraduates at various universities and colleges after participating in the program.  They were prepared for success in college in the STEM areas which increased their likelihood of being retained, and graduating in STEM disciplines, particularly geosciences.  More than 500 high school students were reached with geoscience career information.  Geoscience training modules were developed that will be shared with individuals who may be interested in establishing other geoscience bridge programs.  The collaborating NOAA CSC institutions benefited from the program through the enrollment of the majority of the students into the institutions' undergraduate geosciences or related programs.
