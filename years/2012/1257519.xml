<AbstractNarration>The investigators will develop an automated system for continuously running a research-based, observation-driven, real-time simulation of the solar corona and inner heliosphere at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC). Every day, or more frequently, the system will automatically restart a new simulation of the state of the solar corona using the latest solar magnetogram as the input and the result of the previous simulation as the initial condition for the new one. A prediction of the realistic three-dimensional (3D) and time-dependent distributions of the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind parameters throughout the solar corona and inner heliosphere is one of the most challenging scientific problems in space physics. The task becomes even more difficult if the simulation is routinely performed in real-time, on a daily basis, with the latest magnetogram data incorporated as an input for the model together with the capability to validate the model using a continuous flow of observational data. The Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) model of the solar corona, already available in the CCMC, will be used for the effort. To validate the model, synthetic extreme ultraviolet images will be produced to compare with the images as observed with NASA satellite instruments. The coupled model prediction will be continuously validated with the solar wind parameters measured by the ACE satellite. The intellectual merit of the research is the development of a research-based model that can be used to better understand the propagation of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), both in real-time when CME signatures are observed in coronograph images, and for historical analysis and research of interesting events. The broader impact of the project is that a new generation of global models of the Sun-heliosphere system will be delivered to the CCMC to enable broad use by the solar-heliophysics community. The project will involve the training of a junior female postdoctoral researcher and will enhance infrastructure for research and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main outcome from the project is that we created a system to simulate the current state of the solar corona and inner heliosphere in the real time.   As the prototype we have used the existing and operating WSA-ENLIL real-time simulation system, which is successfully employed for years to describe the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field in the inner heliosphere (above the heliocentric distances of 0.1 AU to 3-5 AU).  Based on the existing infrastructure developed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center at the Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA), which allows us regularly (once a day or more frequently) download the latest GONG magnetigram and automatically run the simulation code daily with the use of the latest magnetogram as the boundary condition at the photosphere level, we developed a new fully automatic simulation system.   The distinctive features of the newly developed system are the following:  - It describes not only the Inner Heliosphere (IH), but also the Solar Corona (SC) with the SC module, the Alfven-Wave-turbulence-based Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM), of the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) of the University of Michigan.  -In time-dependent mode it works faster-than-Real time (AWSoM-R) using a specially developed Field-Line-Threaded model for the Low Solar Corona,  -It describes self-consistently the evolution and absorption of the Alfven Wave turbulence throughout the Solar Corona and conversion of its energy into coronal heating and powering and accelerating the solar wind. If desired, in the Inner heliosphere, in parallel with the ENLIL or instead of it, the IH may be also simulated with the AWSoM module of the SWMF, just extending the quantitative and self-consistent description of the Alfven Wave turbulence to the IH domain.  -It allows, if desired, to superpose the observed Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on the background evolving solution in real time, using the Eruptive Event Generator based on the Gibson-Low configuration (EEGGL)   Some technical detail may be provided. The simulation restarts daily using the simulated state of the SC and IH obtained the day before as the initial condition. The latest GONG magnetogram is used as the boundary condition. The update to the state corresponding to the time of the used magnetogram requires ~13 hours of simulation on cluster hilo-x at the CCMC (about 160 processors are used).
