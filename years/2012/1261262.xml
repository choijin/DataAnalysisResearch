<AbstractNarration>This proposal aims to investigate several aspects of the interplay between combinatorics and representation theory.  First, the PI will investigate the enumerative cyclic sieving phenomenon introduced by Reiner, Stanton, and White as it applies to combinatorial actions on the cluster complexes of Fomin and Zelevinsky as well as actions on tableaux arising from the theory of crystals.  The PI will use objects from representation theory such as Kazhdan-Lusztig bases and cluster algebras to investigate these combinatorial problems. Second, the PI will investigate connections between hyperplane arrangements and the Hilbert series of certain rings related to the diagonal coinvariant module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enumeration of objects in a finite set is the fundamental problem of combinatorics and has many scientific applications outside of pure mathematics.  Symmetry groups were introduced by the ancient Greeks and are the primary motivation for the study of representation theory.  So, the study of enumeration up to symmetry is of paramount importance in combinatorial representation theory and algebraic combinatorics.  This project uses representation theory to indirectly count the elements of finite sets, yielding a deeper and more elegant understanding of their enumeration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded research in algebraic combinatorics.  There have been 12 preprints and papers as a result of this award including new constructions and results in the fields of Coxeter-Catalan combinatorics, rational Catalan theory, and cyclic sieving.  Of these, 9 have been published in international peer-reviewed mathematics journals and 3 are currently undergoing peer review.  Among the outcomes of this research are a new notion of "parking structure" attached to reflection groups which specializes to a classical construction arising in the field of hashing in computer science.  The PI has given 20 research presentations about these results at academic seminars and colloquia, international conferences, and industry seminars.  These have included a plenary lecture at an American Mathematical Society meeting in Las Vegas in April 2015.  The PI has been actively involved in mentoring young mathematicians, including those from groups which are underrepresented in mathematics.  In the Summers of 2014 and 2015, the PI was in charge of curriculum development for the first NSF funded undergraduate research program at UC-San Diego.  A total of 8 undergraduates performed research, of whom 3 were female.  The PI also did a separate solo research project with an undergraduate in Summer 2014.  Moreover, the PI has a PhD student (Michelle Bodnar) who is doing research in cyclic sieving and rational Catalan theory.
