<AbstractNarration>In suspension bridges the main cables, with many thousands of steel wires compacted together, are crucial for the overall safety; they transfer the entire load--more than several thousand tons-- including the weight of the bridge deck and of any traffic that might be on it, the wind induced forces, etc. to the towers and to the anchorage blocks. If the cable fails, the entire bridge is lost.  Full inspection of cables during service is not feasible; assessing the strength of a main cable is accomplished through partial inspections and numerical models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to provide bridge engineers with experimental and numerical tools to assess the remaining strength of suspension bridge cables. The experimental part of the study will use deeply-penetrating, non-destructive, neutron beams to measure position-specific stress/strain data from model bridge cable strands under realistic boundary conditions. &lt;br/&gt;These data will, then, be used to develop numerical and theoretical models for predicting the load carrying capacity, safety factors and reliability, as well as service life, of parallel-wire suspension bridge cables, both under design and currently in service. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In neutron diffraction the lattice parameter of the steel is utilized as an internal strain gage.  The change in this parameter as a function of applied load yields the elastic strain. In the experimental phase focussed neutron beams will be used to measure the strain partitioning within individual wires of model cables while they are loaded past failure. Thermal neutrons can easily penetrate 45 mm of steel and, thus, measurement of the local strains within the inner wires is possible. The experiments will be carried out for various bundle configurations with selected lubricant/corrosion preventative treatments. The data obtained from the experiments will then be utilized in an extended 3-D finite element model being developed on the supercomputing facilities available at Columbia University.  Once finished, this model is expected to yield accurate predictions on the load carrying capabilities of parallel wires and can be extendable to the assessment of the ultimate strength of the overall main cable in a suspension bridge.</AbstractNarration>

Noyan, R. Betti, H. Waizman</p> <p>A.

Suspension bridge cables consist of many thousands of 5mm diameter high-strength steel wires arranged in 128-wire bundles (strands) and compacted together with wire-wrap and cable bands; the bridge deck is suspended from the cable bands via suspender cables. Quantitatively understanding the degree of compaction achieved under cable bands, and the distribution of the bridge load between individual wires and bundles within the cable, are critical to suspension bridge design. The behavior of wires within existing cables which fracture during service is another important question since this is critical to assessing the load-carrying ability and remaining-lifetime of the cable. While&nbsp; it is well known that broken wires take up their share of the load at some distance away from fracture sites, &nbsp;the exact mechanisms by which a given broken wire regains its load-carrying capacity were not fully clear. Experimental analysis using traditional techniques could not be used to address these issues since these techniques could not characterize wires buried within a cable.</p> <p>The Columbia researchers &nbsp;used deeply-penetrating neutrons to interrogate the load transfer to broken wires within model bundles. These experiments were conducted on neutron diffractometers equipped with &nbsp;in-situ tensile testers. Two systems, at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, respectively, were used. Measurements showed that broken &nbsp;individual wires resumed their load-carrying capacity at much shorter distances from the breaking point than traditionally assumed&mdash;this implies that older suspension bridges probably have more life left in them than was originally assumed.</p> <p>In the second phase of the experiment distribution of clamping forces in 19 and 61-wire model strands were measured and compared to finite element modelling predictions. The&nbsp; experimental results showed that manufacturing tolerances of clamps and wires prevented radial clamping and created &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; pockets, within which some wires were not experiencing the full clamping load.</p> <p>These findings have both scientific and practical implications. In terms of scientific impact, this study has developed and verified a precise procedure which leverages the Nation&rsquo;s investment in neutron sources and engineering diffractometers for testing realistic civil-engineering samples. Further, by using this approach it was shown for the first time that:</p> <p>1-The minimum symmetry element of parallel-wire suspension cable strands, the seven-wire strands (commonly used in generating data for finite element models), is not adequate for this purpose. 19 wire samples are the minimum acceptable size which provide realistic constraint.</p> <p>2-Friction and mechanical interference between wires, hitherto neglected in FEM simulations of these systems, are quite important in load transfer to broken wires. These mechanisms are of approximately equal importance.</p> <p>3-The macroscopic (radial) symmetry of the cable strands and up-down clamps used in confining them is not observed in the confined strand due to local variations in wire diameter. Even though these variations are within manufacturing tolerances, they are sufficient to form effective load transfer paths through certain wires within the clamped strand cross-section such that certain wires are subjected to significantly less constraint. In fact, some wires can be completely constraint-free. These observations verified, experimentally, a three decade-old postulate by Prof. A. Gjelsvik of Columbia Unversity.</p> <p>The practical utility of these results is also significant. The findings listed above will be integrated into the computations for bridge cable design and will contribute to making our bridges safer in the coming decades.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/11/2017<br>      Modified by: Ismail&nbsp;C&nbsp;Noyan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1233885/1233885_10189997_1507755794044_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1233885/1233885_10189997_1507755794044_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Suspension-Bridge-Basics"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1233885/1233885_10189997_1507755794044_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Suspension-Bridge-Basics"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: (a-d) Schematic elevation view of a suspension bridge with major structural elements highlighted: cable bands/suspenders (b); main cable cross-section and clamp (c);  one strand (d).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Adrian Brugger thesis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ismail&nbsp;C&nbsp;Noyan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Suspension-Bridge-Basics</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1233885/1233885_10189997_1507757189015_IMG_0116--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1233885/1233885_10189997_1507757189015_IMG_0116--rgov-800width.jpg" title="clamped wire strand detail"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1233885/1233885_10189997_1507757189015_IMG_0116--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="clamped wire strand detail"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cloes-up of the clamped section of the 61-wire strand.
