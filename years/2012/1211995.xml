<AbstractNarration>This project will carry out a detailed study of the globular cluster (GC) populations of elliptical and lenticular galaxies in order to address key questions in galaxy structure and formation, specifically: (i) What are the masses, angular momenta, orbital structures, and metallicities of early-type galaxies? (ii) What is the distribution of dark matter associated with them? (iii) How are their inner and outer regions assembled, and are these processes decoupled? (iv) How does their assembly depend on mass and environment? (v) Do the observations agree with theoretical models of galaxy formation? And, (vi) can the primordial formation sites of GCs be identified? The study will be comprised of (1) a detailed, systematic observational survey of 25 early-type galaxies and their GC systems out to very large galactocentric radii, complemented with field star and planetary nebulae data; (2) dynamical modeling to recover mass and orbital information; and (3) comparisons to cosmological simulations of galaxy and GC formation. The project will support the work and professional mentoring of a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher. The proposing team will release the data and survey results as a publicly accessible database, and will also continue and expand their education and public outreach partnership with the Science Buddies organization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied the properties of giant elliptical and lenticular galaxies in the nearby Universe, with the "SLUGGS" (SAGES Lecacy Unifying Globulars and GalaxieS) survey of twenty-five galaxies as the main focal point and accomplishment.  Using large optical telescopes on Hawaii, the diffuse starlight and globular star clusters of these galaxies were analyzed out into their faint peripheries, which contain key clues about their growth histories.  In particular, the motions of stars were used to infer their orbits as well as the distribution of dark matter within their host galaxies.  The abundance of iron relative to other elements was used as an additional indicator of star formation histories.  Multiple characteristics of the observed galaxies were compared to computer simulations to yield specific formation scenarios.  Additional methods were developed for studying galaxy formation beyond the scope of the SLUGGS survey, including the use of spectroscopy on satellite galaxies undergoing disruption by gravitational tides.  A public database was produced from SLUGGS of globular cluster velocities and metal content.  Collaboration with the website "Science Buddies" promoted general public awareness of science, and reached a very large and diverse number of primary and secondary level students with hands-on science project engagement, and with career-planning resources.
