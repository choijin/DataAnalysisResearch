<AbstractNarration>Hall/1246170&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to reconstruct past ice-surface elevations from detailed glacial mapping and dating of moraines (using 14C dates of algae from former ice-marginal ponds and 10Be surface exposure ages) in the region of the Darwin-Hatherton Glaciers in Antarctica in order to try and resolve very different interpretations that currently exist about the glacial history in the region. The results will be integrated with existing climate and geophysical data into a flow-line model to gain insight into glacier response to climate and ice-dynamics perturbations during the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM) in Antarctica. The work will contribute to a better understanding of both LGM ice thickness and whether or not there is any evidence that Antarctica contributed to Meltwater Pulse (MWP)-1A a very controversial topic in Antarctic glacial geology.  The intellectual merit of the work relates to the fact that reconstructing past fluctuations of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is critical for understanding the sensitivity of ice volume to sea-level and climatic change. Constraints on past behavior help put ongoing changes into context and provide a basis for predicting future sea-level rise. Broader impacts include the support of two graduate and two undergraduate students, as well as a female early-career investigator. Graduate students will be involved in all stages of the project from planning and field mapping to geochronological analyses, interpretation, synthesis and reporting. Two undergraduates will work on lab-based research from the project. The project also will include visits to K-12 classrooms to talk about glaciers and climate change, correspondence with teachers and students from the field, and web-based outreach.  This award has field work in Antarctica.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Understanding past behaviors of the Antarctic Ice Sheet is key for developing realistic continent-scale ice sheet models needed to predict its responses to future possible environmental change. Surface exposure age measurements on glacial deposits and bedrock are currently the best land-based data available to constrain histories of ice thickness during the last ice age and the Holocene deglaciation. Many of these geologic constraints come from the margins of outlet glaciers that drain the interior ice, but the spatial resolution of existing continent-scale models is too large to resolve important but relatively small-scale outlet glaciers. In this project, we used a semi-coupled ice-flow analysis, that combines output from a continental-scale ice sheet model and a data constrained outlet-glacier model to infer the regional glacial history.</p> <p>Our focus was the Darwin-Hatherton Glacier system (DHGS - <strong><em>Fig: Region of study</em></strong>). Over the course of two field seasons we mapped and dated glacial deposits in detail at four sites: Diamond Hill just above the mouth of Darwin Glacier, and three sites on its tributary Hatherton Glacier upstream (<strong><em>Figs. Diamond Hill &amp; Bibra Valley Lake</em></strong>). Combined, the exposure-age and algae data show that Hatherton and Darwin Glaciers reached a local maximum hundreds of meters thicker than present ~ 9.5 kyr BP and reached their modern thickness ~3 kyr BP (<strong><em>Fig. Deglaciation History</em></strong>). These results contrast with our earlier work at Shackleton and Beardmore Glaciers that indicate the grounding line in the southern Ross Sea reached the mouths of these glaciers by ~7 kyr BP.</p> <p>In order to investigate details of the response of the glaciers since the last glacial maximum (LGM), we conducted a modeling study of the DHGS. Output from a continental-scale ice sheet model (PSUIce; Pollard and DeConto, 2016) was used to provide boundary conditions for a 1.5D flow-band model of ice flow from the head of Hatherton Glacier to the modern grounding line of Darwin Glacier. Multiple experiments were run to investigate the sensitivity effects of the DHGS to changes in (i) Ross Sea ice thickness; (ii) surface mass balance; (iii) varying catchment area. Model results were compared with constraints from the C-14 and exposure dates along the flow band (<strong><em>Fig. Model Results</em></strong>).</p> <p class="p1">Model results show that increasing accumulation over the glacier catchment from LGM to modern values delays deglaciation, but cannot explain the Holocene maximum thickening nor match the glacier profile through deglaciation. However, increasing the flux of ice into the DHGS, coupled with typical mass balance values during the LGM can explain the observed timing and magnitude of thickening along the glacier. A plausible way to increase the flux of ice into the DHGS is to prescribe changes in the catchment area; relatively small changes in catchment area are sufficient to provide a good fit to the data. Another outcome of our model experiments is that thickness changes along the Hatherton-Darwin flowline are closely coupled to the behavior of ice at the glacier mouth, which in turn is buttressed by the much larger flows from Byrd and Mulock Glaciers on either side.</p> <p>The methods developed in this work could be used by others to re-interpret existing data from along glacier profiles, and it also provides a framework for future studies. Another important outcome is that data far from the grounding-line can be used as constraints, but care is needed when using them to infer histories of grounding-line position. The project has provided research experience, training and partial support for graduate students Trevor Hillebrand at the University of Washington, and Courtney King at the University of Maine (Orono); both have now graduated. Research results have been presented at national and international conferences, and will be published in manuscripts (Hillebrand et al., In prep; King et al., In prep; Hall et al., In prep).
