<AbstractNarration>This award supports a novel experiment designed to measure the absolute mass scale of the electron neutrino.  Though the existence of neutrino mass is now firmly established experimentally, the mass scale itself remains unknown. The new technique supported by this award relies on the detection and measurement of coherent radiation created from the cyclotron motion of electrons in strong magnetic fields. Since the frequency of the emitted cyclotron radiation depends inversely on the particle's Lorentz boost, detection and measurement of the coherent radiation is tantamount to measuring the kinetic energy of the electron. One immediate application of this new technique is in the measurement of the endpoint spectrum from tritium beta decay, which is directly sensitive to the absolute mass scale of neutrinos. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Knowledge of neutrino masses has a broad impact to the scientific community, particularly in the fields of nuclear and particle physics, as well as cosmology. The broad appeal and novelty of this technique are expected to engage undergraduate students. The technique explored in this proposal also has potential applications in national security, specifically, in monitoring for nuclear non-proliferation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Neutrinos are among the more mysterious elementary particles in the universe: Billions of them pass through every cell of our bodies each second, and yet these ghostly particles are incredibly difficult to detect, as they donÆt appear to interact with ordinary matter. Scientists have set theoretical limits on neutrino mass, but researchers have yet to precisely detect it.  State-of-the-art attempts at measuring the neutrino mass aim at measuring the energy of electrons created in the process of radioactive beta decay.  When a radioactive atom such as tritium decays, it turns into an isotope of helium and, in the process, also releases an electron and a neutrino. The energy of all particles released adds up to the original energy of the parent tritium. Measuring the energy of the electron, therefore, can access the energy &mdash; and consequently, the mass &mdash; of the neutrino.  Project 8 is a novel method to study the mass of the neutrino by using frequency as a means to precisely measure the electron spectrum from radioactive beta decay. Electrons from a radioactive are briefly "trapped" and their cyclotron emission is measured.  Since the frequency of this emission is related to their kinetic energy, Project 8 turns a frequency measurement into a precise energy measurement for the electron.  In 2014, the collaboration provided a first successful demonstration of the technique.  Future work continues to expand the capabilties of the new technique and apply it to its ultimate goal:  measurement of the mass of the neutrino.  The Project 8 collaboration gratefully acknowledges the NSF for its support in this research program.       Last Modified: 07/15/2015       Submitted by: Joseph A Formaggio]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
