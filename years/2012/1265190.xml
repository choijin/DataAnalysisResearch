<AbstractNarration>This International Collaboration in Chemistry award in the Division of Chemistry supports Professor David A. Vicic at the University of Hawaii to collaborate with Professor Yulia H. Budnikova of the Kazan Scientific Center at the Russian Academy of Sciences in performing electroanalysis on a series of palladium complexes in order to identify new Pd(III) complexes, and to systematically investigate their redox properties under aerobic conditions.  These results will be applied to the discovery of new synthetic transformations using the higher oxidation states of palladium and will be extended to electrocatalytic C-H functionalization methods involving nickel.  The research aims toward an understanding of the details of transformations that could enable new reactions with nickel, which would complement the existing chemistry of palladium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complementing the existing synthetic chemistry of palladium with corresponding reactions using nickel could lower the costs of catalysis and enable greener synthetic methods.  The tabulation of redox potentials for a series of palladium complexes will help guide chemists in choosing an appropriate oxidant for high-valent transformations.  New electrochemistry experiments derived from this research will be incorporated into laboratory courses in Advanced Inorganic Chemistry and Spectroelectrochemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Reactions that use transition-metals in high oxidation states are becoming increasingly important in synthetic chemistry.  However, it is often the case that the oxidants that are used to get to these high oxidation states are either expensive to purchase or difficult to separate from the reaction mixture.  Moreover, every time a new metal complex or substrate or reaction conditions is used, screenings must be performed in order to identify the optimal oxidant.  To overcome these problems, we focused on developing cheaper, greener, and more controllable electrochemical alternatives.  In addition, we focused on replacing the industrially useful yet expensive metal palladium with the cheaper and more earth abundant metal nickel in order to make the new chemistry as universal as possible.  For this project we have been able to design, synthesize, and fully characterize new nickel complexes that could serve as catalysts for reactions that are used to prepare high-value chemicals.  We have analyzed the new palladium- and nickel-containing molecules we have prepared by electrochemical techniques in order to map out the redox potentials needed to access the higher oxidation states.   Gratifyingly we have demonstrated both for palladium and nickel that reactions can be developed that use their electrochemically-generated high valent states without the need for added co-oxidants.  The mechanistic details of these reactions were also evaluated so that more sophisticated chemical transformations can be developed in the future.   In terms of Broader Impacts, a number of undergraduates and under-represented groups were trained on this project.  This project also involved the collaboration of a research team from Kazan, Russia.  Our U.S. student traveled to Russia in order how to gain expertise in a new method (EPR spectroscopy) to characterize our new nickel complexes.  The U.S. student was also taught advanced electrochemical techniques by the Russian team and used that training to operate a new instrument that was purchased with this funding.  The U.S. team helped the Russian exchange student learn sophisticated preparative organometallic chemistry as well as X-ray diffraction techniques.
