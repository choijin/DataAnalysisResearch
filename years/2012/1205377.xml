<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to adapt computer architecture simulation infrastructure to model power and thermal issues for future multicore systems. The main concern addressed by this proposal is simulation speed when power and thermal estimations are also considered. &lt;br/&gt;To accelerate simulation times, engineers employ sampling.  The problem is that adding modern multicores and thermal simulation breaks existing sampling techniques.  The research community needs performance, power, and thermal simulation results at least one order of magnitude faster than currently available. This proposal provides support to build such system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulation infrastructure will have a significant impact on the computer architecture community. We expect an increase in the number of publications by third parties. We also expect a larger, multi-university, class curriculum impact due to make this simulator available to class projects. Combining the two previous impacts, we expect a larger proportion of the graduate and undergraduate students to learn and research about future multicores, mobile systems, and clouds with a focus on power and thermal issues.</AbstractNarration>

The simulation is opensourced at github, and it already has a vibrant community with questions and solutions to challenges. The work developed has also resulted in industry adaptation with two companies (Huawei and Imagination) already starting to incorporate the code in their product lines.     In addition, the NSF grant has provided support for graduate students and the opportunity to further expand the knowledge beyond what was known before it got awarded.
