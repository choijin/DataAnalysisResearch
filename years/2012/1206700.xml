<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crystalline and nanostructured inorganic-organic hybrid compounds assembled on semiconductor nano-modules and organic molecules represent a unique class of functional materials that are of both fundamental and technological importance.  The incorporation of organic and inorganic components in a single crystal lattice not only leads to integrated and improved properties over their parent semiconductors (e.g. broad band gap tunability, enhanced optical absorption/emission power, and reduced thermal conductivity), but also gives rise to intriguing phenomena and new functionality that may not be achievable by either inorganic or organic constituents alone. The primary objective of this project supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program is to (a) modify the II-VI (II: Zn, Cd, Mn; VI: S, Se, Te) based hybrid-nanostructured family in order to further optimize and improve their electronic and optical properties, and (b) expand the series to new hybrid families constructed on other important semiconductor groups, including  binary I-VII (I: Cu, Ag; VII: F, Cl, Br, I) and III-VI (III: Ga, In), and ternary I-III-VI phases. Similar structure designing strategies and synthesis methods built on the previous success will be adapted and applied to develop these compounds. The project attempts to address some fundamental questions concerning the chemistry and physics occurring at the inorganic-organic interfaces, to facilitate an in-depth study employing both experimental and theoretical methods in order to understand the correlations between the crystal structure, composition, chemical bonding, and properties, and ultimately, to offer insight that will contribute to further improvement of material properties crucial for practical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very exciting field of on-going materials research centers on hybrid materials, namely compounds that are made of chemical species from distinctly different categories. Inorganic materials are best known for their framework integrity and thermal stability, superior electronic, magnetic, optical and transport properties, while organic materials are well recognized for their structural diversity, flexibility, processability, low cost, and light weight. This project will develop and optimize properties of crystalline inorganic-organic hybrid materials composed of semiconductor nanomodules and organic molecules that form periodically ordered structures. These functional nanostructured materials have attracted enormous attention due to their integrated and enhanced properties as a result of blending the two components in a single structure.  Research on these materials has shown great promise for their utility in optoelectronic applications, including photovoltaics (solar cells), solid state lighting (LEDs) and sensing.  This highly interdisciplinary, collaborative and integrated project will serve as an excellent platform for student training, and will offer unique opportunities for a large number of participants, including undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral research associates, visiting scientists, and especially women and individuals from underrepresented groups, to work on chemical problems that are both scientifically important and societally relevant. An important component of the project involves numerous educational, training, and outreach activities within and beyond Rutgers University, including new course and course module development, international exchange programs, and partnership with regional colleges and schools. The project seeks to continue and further collaborations with the local industries on areas of common interest.</AbstractNarration>
