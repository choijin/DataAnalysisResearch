<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Lisa Randall at Harvard University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next few years hold the promise of the discovery of new phenomena and particles:  at the Large Hadron Collider, in dark-matter experiments, and in precision tests of flavor and the electroweak sector.  Professor Randall's research will focus on LHC and dark-matter model building. Professor Randall will also continue to address theoretical issues related to predictions from various theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high-energy physics community has also been seeing that the new physics effects or new exotic phenomena might be at the edge of what is kinematically accessible.  This poses challenges to both theorists and experimenters, requiring that both communities stretch ingenuity to the limits in order to uncover as much as possible.  Accordingly, Professor Randall will continue to pursue research whose aim is to find the fullest potential of LHC experiments and to formulate consistent scenarios that will allow the most comprehensive tests of theoretical proposals.  The broader impact of this research is its strong interaction with the experimental community, as well as the training of junior scientists who will be involved in this project.  Professor Randall will also continue her involvement in the public communication of science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit The past few years held the promise of new phenomena and particles being discovered: at the Large Hadron Collider, in dark matter experiments, and in precision tests of flavor and the electroweak sector, and cosmological studies. We got hints that what we find&mdash;or don?t find&mdash;could be perplexing and require moving beyond the reservoir of ideas about the physics of the electroweak scale and beyond.  Randall?s research has focused on LHC model building and phenomenology as well as on dark matter model building and search strategies. Given the hope of understanding the theory underlying the Standard Model, she has done theory that was guided by LHC experiments and that helped analyze data as it came out.  She has found new ways to integrate what we know and want to explain, and new ways to do LHC searches.  Randall has also worked further on several broad new classes of models that accommodate the approximate coincidence of dark matter and baryon energy densities and go beyond the conventional WIMP paradigm.  She has investigated new ways to do searches and interpret data in these new contexts as well as old ones.   Broader Impact We also have seen that the new physics effects or new exotic phenomena might be at the edge of what is kinematically accessible, posing challenges to both theorists and experimenters to stretch ingenuity to the limits and uncover as much as we can. Randall has continued to pursue research whose aim is to find the fullest potential of LHC experiments and formulate consistent scenarios to more comprehensively test proposals.
