<AbstractNarration>This collaborative program will develop and implement a new technique for measuring the growth of dark matter structure from galaxy clustering. While most techniques that use galaxy clustering to constrain cosmological parameters focus on measurements at the largest scales, the investigators aim to use clustering at the smallest scales, making full use of the information available in the data with the goal of developing a new cosmological probe based on the relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos that can be applied to existing data and future surveys.  This approach could develop into a leading probe of dark energy and other cosmological parameters with the next generation of photometric surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students, release of computer code to the community, and outreach via public lectures.</AbstractNarration>

Broader Impacts: This project was the primary dissertation project of two graduate students, including one  female graduate student, who were trained in cutting edge computational  and statistical techniques as well as in modern galaxy formation and  cosmology research.  The project provided additional training for  postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates.  We also  publicly released cosmological simulation data that has broad use for  other scientific studies.       Last Modified: 01/11/2018       Submitted by: Jeremy Tinker]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
