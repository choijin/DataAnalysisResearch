<AbstractNarration>This award suppors the international travel of 10 US scientists to attend the Grid Computing - The Next Decade workshop that will be held in January 4-6, 2012, in Zakopane, Poland. This interdisciplinary, international workshop will discuss the state of the art of Grid computing, its applications and, more importantly, its future. The detailed results of the workshop will be published in the form of a report that will be made available to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 10th anniversary of the EU funded project 'Grid Lab' (which was an early and ambitious attempt on providing a consolidated and science oriented cyberinfrastructure software stack to a specific science community) was taken as an opportunity to invite international leaders and early stage researchers in grid computing and e-Science from Europe, America and Asia, and, together with representatives of the EU and US funding agencies, to discuss the fundamental aspects of CI evolution, and to contemplate the options for a more coherent, more coordinated approach to the global evolution of CI.  The workshop "Grid Computing: The Next Decade" is documented through the report at:  http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.3271v1. We believe that the workshop and this report make a significant contribution toward establishing a common vision among the community leaders who have to do the work to unify the field, and among the government agencies that are asked to fund the activities. There is still a long way to go, especially when it comes to international cooperation between funding agencies and scientific infrastructure providers, but the organizers and participants of the workshop believe that this is an important goal that should be achieved. Many fields have depended on computational science simulations, and many now are beginning to depend on computationally intensive data analysis. Infrastructure providers seek to build computational systems that support these researchers. Developing the common vision that is needed to support these efforts is the eventual goal of this activity. The meeting brought international experts representing such distributed scientific infrastructures as XSEDE, EGI, OSG, NAREGI, PRACE, FutureGrid, and PL-Grid, among others, but even broader participation in future activities is needed.  The workshop had a mix of plenary sessions and breakout groups. Plenary sessions included thought-provoking keynote presentations by Peter Coveney, Ian Foster, Miron Livny, Edward Seidel, and Hai Zhuge and some other invited talks. Tha talks were followed by general discussions, including wrap-ups of breakout sessions and discussions of the overall progress of the meeting. The breakouts were focused on three topics: large science, small science (long-tail), and grand challenge communities. Each breakout group met three times, first to address how to gather requirements, second how to develop a process to move forward, and third to discuss actions that could be started immediately.  Workshop outputs: mission statement and blueprint process.  The following mission statement was writte at the end of the workshop:  E-Science is increasingly based on global collaborations that need access to different resources (e.g., people, instruments, libraries, data, compute, software, algorithms, etc.) across different science communities (e.g., Research Infrastructures, Grand Science Challenges, Societal Challenges), which are at different levels of maturity and, of different sizes and impact (e.g., niche high-end science, campus science, citizen science, etc.). To deliver sustainable æinfrastructureÆ across all of these areas it is necessary to engage with representative stakeholders from across all of these areas to understand their usage scenarios and resulting requirements from which a multi-year plan that identifies and delivers the operation, maintenance and development of the key common components that can be agreed across the communities.  To sustainably exploit the successful prototyping and experimental work that has taken place over the last decade, it is necessary to understand how to effectively identify and deliver the services that need to continue to be operated and identify the new services that need to be provisioned to support the increasingly data driven science.  Therefore, the activity coming out of this workshop will focus on establishing an on-going integrated multi-disciplinary and global view on future infrastructure requi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
