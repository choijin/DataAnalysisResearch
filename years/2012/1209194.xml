<AbstractNarration>This research concerns the development of innovative model comparison and model evaluation methods that focus on the most relevant features of the data and that are robust to deficiencies of model and data.  The advent of modern, automated technology for data collection and of cheap, near-boundless storage capacity provides access to a previously undreamt wealth of data.  The parallel development of sophisticated models which allow one to combine many sources of information and the computational strategies and horsepower which allow one to fit the models would seem to facilitate near-perfect decision-making.  However, the wealth of data aggravates the problems caused by data contamination, and the complexity of model aggravates the difficulty of specifying the prior on the parameters.  Handling data contamination and constructing methods robust to the lack of prior information pose fundamental statistical challenges.  In this project, the investigators illustrate the deficiency of the current leading model evaluation/model comparison methods, and then propose a set of new tools to alleviate the problems.  The proposed research consists of the following two specific aims.  1.  To develop reliable methods for Bayesian model comparison when prior information is lacking.  The common practices of using an improper noninformative prior distribution or a vague proper prior distribution are effective in estimation, however they break down for Bayesian hypothesis testing problems where model choice is sensitive to details of the prior distribution.  To tackle this difficulty, the investigators propose a remedy, the calibrated Bayes factor.  The calibrated Bayes factor does not need extensive subjective evaluation, yields an analysis that better mimics the performance of the Bayes factor under a ''reasonable default'' prior, and is widely applicable in a large variety of model comparison problems.  2.  To develop robust methods for model evaluation and model fitting in the presence of contaminated data.  Contaminated data comes in many forms, including observations potentially from recording mistakes or from irrelevant populations.  The contaminating process might be unstable, which makes standard statistical modeling infeasible.  For model fitting, this project develops and implements restricted-likelihood, which leads to estimation strategies that focus on the most relevant features of the data and that are robust to ''bad data''.  For model evaluation, this project develops an adaptive loss (scoring) paradigm for cross-validation, which produces robust results and yields superior finite-sample performance by stabilizing the evaluation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Model evaluation and model comparison are used on a daily basis in both scientific and corporate decision-making settings.  These techniques help researchers judge which theory best describes the phenomenon, help health professionals identify which risk factors are related to disease incidence, and help corporate managers decide which business strategy results in increased sales or better customer retention.  However, most of the current model evaluation and model comparison methods neglect deficiencies in data or suffer from the lack of parameter information.  The proposed research provides powerful methodological tools for robust model preference, model evaluation, and model fitting in these difficult situations.  It can help people in various fields better extract information from massive data sets, and thus optimize their decision making.  Specific applications in health studies, psychological experiments and machine learning will proceed along with development of the new methodology.  The general methodology is also applicable to many other scientific and technical areas, such as genomics, climatology, and economics, where large data sets are collected and robust model evaluation is desirable.  The investigators are well-positioned to disseminate the project's results.  They have been actively involved in research groups at the intersection of Statistics and the social sciences, engineering/computer science, and marketing.  They are also key members of a joint industry-university center dedicated to provide and disseminate research relevant to the insurance industry.  Results from this project will be spread to other communities through the investigators' interactions with these groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  This project has taken aim at issues driven by the changing nature of data.  Data sets are now massive, but massive is not just "more of the same".  Instead, data is richer, with many more measurements taken on each case, and with greater variety in the types of measurements that are taken.  Data sets are often fragmented, with multiple data sets needed to solve a problem.  The combination of automated data capture and cheap storage has led to exponential growth in the amount of data available to understand the world and to make decisions.  These big data sets comprise the data bases found throughout corporations and government.   The wealth of available data provides a tremendous amount of information, and at first glance might seem to answer all questions.  However, two features downgrade the quality of purely data-based decisions.  First, all large data sets are vulnerable to poor data quality&mdash;much of the data is observational, self-reported, or recorded imperfectly.  Second, the very richness of the data encourages one to ask questions that stretch the limits of the data.  Rather than purely data-driven decisions, data-and-model-driven decisions perform best.   The project addressed data quality by creating a framework, called Bayesian restricted likelihood, under which data of modest quality can be combined with a model.

Broader Impacts  The project has had a substantial impact on the development of human resources.  Eleven students have earned their PhDs in conjunction with this project.
