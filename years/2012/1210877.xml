<AbstractNarration>The goal of this program is to develop a large suite of cosmological ray-tracing simulations to create a library of simulated maps of weak lensing by galaxies, in order to study their cosmological information content by examining and combining several different non-linear statistics.   Special attention will be paid to baryonic effects and to other systematic errors, and tools will be built to best extract the cosmological information.  The simulation library and emulator will be necessary to realize the full potential of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and other future weak lensing datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, release of simulation data, and outreach to the public via work at the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cosmological observations over the last two decades have left no doubtthat the expansion of the universe is accelerating, but the reason forthis acceleration remains unknown.  There are roughly three types ofpossible explanations: (i) there is a hitherto unknown substance("dark energy") with large negative pressure, (ii) thequantum-mechanical proprties of the vacuum provide a similarly largenegative pressure, or (iii) our fundamental theory (Einstein's generalrelativity) is incomplete and/or inaccurate when applied to the entireuniverse.   Our project has sharpened one of the primary techniques available forcosmologists to address this puzzle, and to distinguish between thethree possibilities above.  This technique is called "weak lensing".As light-rays from distant galaxies (or from the big bang itself, inthe form of the so-called cosmic microwave background radiation, orCMB) travel through the universe to our detectors on Earth, theyfollow a curved path, because of the inhomogeneous distribution ofmass in the universe.  As a result, the images of distant galaxies (orof the CMB) are distorted. The effect is very small, but similar toseeing galaxies through a lens, with galaxy images suffering a roughlyone-percent elongation on average.  Crucially, this effect varies indifferent theories about the acceleration of the universe, becauseinhomogeneous structures grow at different rates in different models.   Future surveys, such as the one from the Large Synoptic SurveyTelescope (LSST) planned over the next decade, will measure thisdistortion for approximately a billion distant galaxies.  In ourproject, we have created large suites of computer simulations of theevolution of structures in the universe since the big bang, and wefollowed the light-rays emitted by hyopthetical samples of distantgalaxies. We have analyzed the statistics of the resulting mocklensing data in various different ways, and have developed techniquesto extract the maximum amount of cosmological information from thesedata.  We have applied the statistical methods we have developed to asmall pilot data-set (from the so-called Canada-French-HawaiiTelescope lensing survey, comprising of roughly 1% of the dataexpected from LSST), and have shown that we can indeed greatly improvethe cosmology-sensitivity of previous standard techniques.  We expectthat our statistical methods will be applied to LSST data and willhelp unravel the mystery of the accelerating universe.   Our work will benefit the entire Astronomy community. We have createda library of weak lensing maps in a wide range of cosmological models,and made them publicly available, along with the software package wehave developed, allowing other researchers to analyze these syntheticmaps for their own purposes.
