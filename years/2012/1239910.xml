<AbstractNarration>This Capacity Building project is a partnership between the College of Education, College of Engineering, and College of Science, and is establishing an undergraduate program in engineering to produce teacher-engineers who understand current knowledge of how people learn and who implement effective pedagogical approaches in their classroom using this understanding.  To achieve the desired outcome, the project is working to achieve two immediate goals:  (1) building the infrastructure for producing effective and knowledgeable teacher-engineers who will teach in K-12 settings; (2) strengthening partnerships among the three UTEP colleges and local school districts to support successful development of teacher-engineers.  The project is re-designing targeted engineering course curricula, is coupling those with existing education courses, and is integrating them with field experiences in K-12 classrooms.  These actions are infusing a practice-based approach to learning in the teacher-engineers, and are providing them with deep understanding of the pedagogical and technical content of teaching, learning, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is extending an existing Noyce Scholars Program and is building a unique infrastructure that incorporates inquiry-based learning both in theory and in practice.  The education courses are providing the theoretical underpinnings of inquiry teaching and learning, while the re-designed engineering courses are providing the practice of the theory.  It is this theory-informs-practice model that is providing Noyce Engineering Scholars with the knowledge and experience to teach in an inquiry-based manner that both engages K-12 students in their learning and excites them about engineering as a career option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is informing the broader community of a model for preparing teacher-engineers who have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to teach in mathematics and science including engineering and technology applications.  The engineering courses re-designed around inquiry models of teaching and learning also are benefitting all enrolled students from the deepened conceptual understanding of the content.  As a minority serving institution, the project is positively impacting the diversity of highly qualified, K-12 STEM educators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Texas at El Paso, a minority institution with Hispanic enrollment of ~80%, received funding from the National Science Foundation in 2012 to support institutional and community capacity building for the Noyce Scholarship Program. The long-term goal of the project was to meet 21st century educational demands for quality mathematics, science, and engineering teaching and learning in high need school districts. The team leading the project consisted of an engineering educator, engineering professor, and teacher educator.  Specifically, the goals of the program were to: 1) build the infrastructure for producing effective and knowledgeable teacher-engineers who will teach in K-12 settings; and 2) strengthen partnerships among the UTEP Colleges of Education, Engineering, and Science and local school districts to support successful development of teacher-engineers. To achieve the goals, the following objectives were met: a) institutionalize a plan for Noyce Engineering Scholars that will ensure preparation to successfully teach in K-12 high needs schools; b) create and implement a theory-informs practice model using inquiry-based learning; and c) establish agreements with regional K-12 independent school districts to enable the integration of K-12 classroom field experiences and for placement of certified teacher engineers.   The following are outcomes of the project.  UTEP College of Education re-structured its alternative      certification program to improve how prospective teachers are prepared,      especially those who are engineers and decide to make a career change.   Strong communication among the Capacity Building Leadership Team and local school district administrators created a collaboration, tentatively named STEM Pac, to increase quantity and quality of STEM teachers.   Memoranda of Understanding were signed with four regional school districts. The UTEP College of Engineering established a new degree program &mdash; Bachelor of Science in Engineering Leadership &mdash; which has an option leading to teacher certification and potential to lead more engineering graduates to earning both teacher certification and a masterÆs degree in Education. An early field experience symposium on student teaching was created to allow students seeking the secondary education minor to have insight into the teaching career before the student teaching block. The two one-hour courses include a practicum in a local school with observations, lesson design, lesson implementation, and analysis.  Professional development workshops in problem-based learning are on target for becoming institutionalized at UTEP in the UTEP Center for Effective Teaching &amp; Learning (CETaL) through support from another federal grant.  Five faculty members from the UTEP College of Engineering integrated project-/problem-based learning into undergraduate coursework. Dr. Homer Nazeran, one of these faculty members, received statewide recognition for teaching in 2015.  A prospective 5-year program in the UTEP Engineering Leadership program has potential to lead more engineering graduates to earning teacher certification and a masterÆs degree in Education.
