<AbstractNarration>This dissertation project is a historical study of popular scientific communication, focusing on the dissemination of scientific theories and technological innovations through lectures, mechanical magic shows, and theatrical performances in nineteenth-century Britain. Performances of science and technologies were often put on display within exhibition halls, universities, museums, and theatres, utilizing theatrical techniques of spectacle to attract the wider public. Carried out under the supervision of Dr. Tracy Davis and Dr. Kenneth Alder, Ms. Aileen Robinson will explore how these performances fashioned orientations towards scientific theories and technological innovations for non-specialist audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide historical grounding for contemporary Anglo-American popular science communication. Examining nineteenth-century public performance will assist researchers in uniting science and theatrical practice for public benefit. Understanding the importance of science in the midst of media, such as theatre, can pave the way towards communicating and developing refined methods of non-specialist communication, such as in theatrical presentations of the history of science or university science programming for all majors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is a study in early science communication, tracing the techniques and methods that emerged as essential to the practice of contemporary public science.  The goal of the project is to understand contemporary practices of scientific dissemination and communication in order to deepen our knowledge about the impact of presentational techniques.  Presentational techniques of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries included theatrical and performative methods, from the use of theatres to the absorption of theatrical methodologies. The project contends that theatre and performance were essential to the fashioning of public science, influencing not only the creation of a collective practice, but also advancing the perception of scientific inquiry.  The research conducted examined three key sites of performance in Britain: scientific lectures, mechanical magic performances, and theatrical entertainments.  Science-based technologies such as projection microscopes feature as major case studies within these three categories.  The project explores how the technologies were staged, displayed, and presented as scientific performances in order to communicate ideas, stimulate curiosity, and encourage scientific practice. Scientific performance became an efficacious and dynamic method for communicating and validating the emerging theories and technologies of different scientific practices.  The research for this project focused on data and ephemera from the production and reception of scientific performances.  Data from theatrical archives included descriptions of machinery, manuscripts, prompt books, and other information pertaining to the production of scientific performance.  Research from popular performance archives included sketches and images of performances, accounts of magic shows, and descriptions of technologies. History of science archives offered designs of new technologies, reports in scientific and technological journals, and floor plans of public science galleries.   Overall, the research showed how spectacle, theatrical contracts, and institutional formation helped to fashion a public science.  Defined as a scientific performance, this practice was a space for the explicit celebration and display of scientific theories and technology.  Performative techniques were efficacious because they traded on familiar techniques of display and presentation. Theatre and performance thus formed an important part of the methodology of public science, crafting it into a practice that could be used to communciate to specialist or non-specialist individuals.
