<AbstractNarration>CBET-1264802&lt;br/&gt;Michael Betenbaugh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a significant need to develop new medical treatments against nerve poisoning caused by organophosphorous (OP) toxins present in pesticides and biological warfare agents such as sarin or VX.  A promising treatment option is the protein bioscavenger, human butyrylcholinesterase, (huBChE), which will bind and inhibit these nerve agents.  The enzyme can prevent intoxication of humans exposed to OP compounds by binding to the nerve agents and sequestering them from acting on the nerve agent?s principal target of acetylcholinesterase in humans.  HuBChE derived from human plasma has shown promising results in limiting OP agent poisoning in animal models, exhibiting a long circulatory half-life (mean residence time) extended over days. Unfortunately, since the supply of human plasma is limited, recombinant protein sources of huBChE are urgently needed to meet the need. Unfortunately, recombinant human BChE (rhuBChE) has not been as effective as plasma-derived natural huBChE, predominantly because the circulatory half-life of rhuBChE can be 10 fold lower due to rapid removal of the protein from the patient?s blood stream. A major reason that rhuBChE is not effective is because current recombinant expression systems do not have the biosynthetic capabilities needed for generating a recombinant product with similar physical and chemical properties as native huBChE.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to apply metabolic engineering strategies to modify the production platform of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in order to enhance these cells? post-translational processing capabilities and produce long-lived rhuBChE products.  Previous studies with huBChE have shown that two of the critical factors limiting circulatory half-lives are sialic acid content and multimeric protein assembly.  In order to increase circulatory half-life of rhuBChE and other therapeutics, CHO cells will be modified to synthesize a recombinant protein that contains increased levels of sialic acid and a greater fraction of assembled tetramers.  In order to accomplish these goals, sialyltransferases will be overexpressed, biochemical pathways responsible for generating sialic acid precursors will be enhanced, and the PRAD chaperone facilitating huBChE tetramer assembly will be engineered into CHO cells.   The resulting rhuBChE will be purified and its tetrameric assembly status and sialic acid content compared to plasma derived natural huBChE to determine if the physical and chemical properties are similar.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chinese hamster ovary cells are the most widely used production organism in biotechnology, applied for the production of nearly half of the biotherapeutic proteins available  today. This project will transform this important production platform by enabling CHO to generate products with increased circulatory lifetimes.   Increased circulatory lifetimes will result in lower dosages for patients taking these drugs and make these biopharma products more affordable in the US and around the world.  The enclosed project will demonstrate this capability for the production of the clinically relevant bioscavenger, huBChE, used in treating poisoning by nerve agents present in pesticides and chemical weapons. Furthermore, this new platform will be equally applicable for improving the circulatory lifetimes of many other biopharmaceuticals in the market or clinic.  In addition, the project will serve to educate graduate students in critical biotechnology skill sets needed for industry and excite local Baltimore high school students from diverse backgrounds in biotechnology education and careers through hands-on learning modules.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The current method for treating many diseases is through use of medicines made by biological production methods.  These biological products include protein drugs like butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and erythropoietin (EPO) produced by culturing mammalian cells and purifying the products from cultures.  The final products are then used by patients for treating ailments such as pesticide or chemical toxin poisoning with BChE or kidney failure with EPO.  Unfortunately, these products may not remain in the circulation for extended periods.  If this is the case, patients will have to be treated over and over with these medicines, which can increase therapeutic costs and is inconvenient for patients.  The drugs also may not work well if the medicines do not remain in the patient?s blood circulation for a sufficient length of time.  Therefore, methods that can increase the duration or residence time of protein therapeutics in the human body will be extremely helpful for patients that need them.  The goal of this project is to implement technologies to make drugs that remain in a patient?s circulation longer.  Chinese hamster ovary or CHO cells are the most widely used producer organism in biotechnology, involved in the production of nearly half of all biotherapeutic drugs used today. This project has altered this production platform by enabling CHO to generate biological products with higher quality properties that can increase their circulatory lifetimes and duration in the body.   Increased circulatory lifetimes could result in lower dosages for protein drugs and ultimately make these biopharma products more affordable in the US and around the world.  Importantly, this new platform will be equally applicable for improving the circulatory lifetimes of many different protein biopharmaceuticals on the market.  In addition, the project has educated graduate students and high school students in critical biotechnology skill sets needed for jobs in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.   One of the critical properties that can affect product quality is the level of sialylation on a protein biotherapeutic.  Sialic acid or sialylation is a natural chemical modification made to proteins during the production process.   Studies have shown that increasing the sialylation level on a protein drug can prolong its circulatory lifetime in the patient?s body. As such, the administration interval between drug treatments can be greatly extended.  Thus, the development of strategies to increase the sialic acid content on protein therapeutics is needed.   In order to enhance the sialic acid content and quality of protein drugs. CHO cells were modified to overexpress the human gene a2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal1) which adds sialic acids on protein drugs.  Sialylation levels were increased by more than 26% on both total cellular proteins as well as on the recombinant protein therapeutic, EPO in CHO cells modified to express sialyltransferase.

As a result, the recombinant EPO generated from this modified CHO cell line showed increased levels of complexity and sialylation not possible in the standard CHO-K1 cells.  These modifications will enable biotechnologists to produce the EPO protein drug with potentially longer circulatory lifetimes in patients.  This, to our knowledge is the first time that all three enzymes have been co-expressed in CHO-K1 cells with the goal of increasing the protein product quality.  Most importantly, these modified or engineered CHO-K1 cells may be applied to improve the sialic acid content and protein quality for a broad range of different protein drugs in the future.  As a result, this research could lead to a new production platform for generating valuable protein drugs with increased lifetimes in patients? bodies in order to help patients with chronic and life-threatening diseases in the coming decades.
