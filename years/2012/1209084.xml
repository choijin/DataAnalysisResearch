<AbstractNarration>In contemporary ecology, it is becoming increasingly important to consider the effects of human activities on the environment. However, an equally important, but often overlooked, challenge is to consider how ecological interactions may ameliorate these human impacts. At the University of Pittsburgh, we have developed a unique and innovative research program that addresses these contemporary challenges by investigating the interactive effects of anthropogenic perturbations and ecological interactions. Specifically, we are examining the extent to which aquatic plants can mitigate the environmental consequences of anthropogenic stressors that make their way into freshwater ecosystems. While our prior work has shown that aquatic plants dramatically reduce the lethal effects of stressors to ecologically important aquatic species, we still have a poor understanding of whether this phenomenon translates up to complex communities.  To take this critical next step, we will examine whether, and to what extent, aquatic plants can mitigate the effects of single exposures to high concentrations of stressors versus repeated exposures to lower concentrations in complex aquatic food webs. This research will advance our understanding of the effects that anthropogenic perturbations are having in biological communities, but also of how common components of most freshwater communities can alter, and potentially reduce, those effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to conducting this research and disseminating it within the scientific community, we also engage in a number of activities to promote environmental awareness with the public. For example, we frequently work with K-12 students, where we discuss our research and the importance of the research to conservation. Further, we run annual teacher workshops at the University of Pittsburgh's biological field station, the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology, where middle and high school teachers learn how to conduct and integrate scientific experiments into classroom learning experiences for their students. We hope that our studies and efforts to provide students with scientific experiences early in their careers will lead to the development of innovative new strategies for conserving the environment in the future.</AbstractNarration>
