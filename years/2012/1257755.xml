<AbstractNarration>All life on Earth depends upon the fixation of carbon dioxide to organic carbon by organisms that power this process with light energy or high-energy chemicals. There are four known pathways that catalyze carbon fixation.  Based on phylogenetic distributions and functional attributes, it has been posited that the Calvin Benson Bassham cycle, found in plants, algae, and some bacteria, dominates in aerobic terrestrial and marine aerobic habitats due to its resilience to oxygen, while other 'oxygen sensitive' carbon fixation pathways are relegated to hypoxic or anoxic environs like vents and hot springs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contrary to this supposition, there are symbioses found in hypoxic diffuse flows around hydrothermal vents in which the bacterial partner uses the Calvin Benson Bassham cycle.  Tubeworm-bacterial symbioses, in particular Riftia pachyptila ("Riftia"), are the dominant keystone species at hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean.  These symbiotic systems fix carbon at mass specific rates comparable to the fastest growing plants.  Surprisingly, recent studies suggest that the bacterial symbionts use two carbon fixation pathways, the Calvin Benson Bassham cycle and the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle.  The use of these two pathways by a single organism (the bacterium) to fix carbon is unprecedented, and may be a strategy to cope with the high variability in environmental conditions encountered by hydrothermal vent organisms.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the work proposed here, Riftia will be incubated in high-pressure aquaria under conditions that mimic the environmental variations found in situ.  Biochemical assays on the bacteria and tubeworm host will be used to ascertain the relationship between environmental conditions, metabolic activity and differential use of the two pathways, to understand how they act in concert to sustain carbon fixation in a dynamic environment.  These data will considerably further the understanding of the influence of environment on carbon fixation by bacteria as well as plants, and will also be helpful for determining why different organisms have the different carbon fixing pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are equally committed to the proposed scientific research and our proposed education and outreach.  We plan to support three major programs: (1) graduate student development (2) undergraduate mentoring, and (3) the design of high-impact educational curricula using real research data and experiences. This study will enable the support and training of undergraduate and graduate students who will be intimately involved in designing and engineering the experiments, analyzing the data, and formally presenting and documenting the work.  The proposed research contains significant field and laboratory components, which affords students and teachers the opportunities to participate in this project at a variety of levels.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>80% of our planet&rsquo;s habitable living space is deep underwater. One of the most striking deep-sea habitats are the hydrothermal vents. These underwater geysers are found in abundance along the 65,000 km mid-ocean ridge system, the longest mountain range on Earth. These vents spew out incredibly hot water (over 400&deg;C, hotter than any home oven). This water is rich in hydrogen sulfide (the rotten egg smelling chemical) as well as heavy and precious metals.</p> <p>Despite being one of the most hostile habitats on Earth, vents are home to an extraordinary community of microbes and animals, all of whom depend on the vent chemicals for life. Unlike forests and other terrestrial habitats, in which plants or algae form the base of the food chain, most hydrothermal vents are too deep for sunlight to reach. Without light, plants or algae have no chance of thriving. However, the microbes that live around vents can use chemical energy instead of sunlight to grow and produce sugars. These are called chemosynthetic microbes, and form the base of the food chain in environments where there is little or no sunlight. They grow to high densities within, upon, underneath the vents, and support a lush and vibrant community of animals.</p> <p>The most famous members of these vent communities are the deep sea hydrothermal vent tubeworms <em>Riftia pachyptila</em>. These worms are massive, weighing several pounds and reaching four feet in length. They lack a mouth, gut, digestive tract or anus. Surprisingly, they harbor between a billion and trillion bacteria deep inside their body. These microbes are chemosynthetic, using the chemicals hydrogen sulfide and oxygen to generate energy that, in turn, is used to grow and produce sugars from carbon dioxide. This is a unique kind of symbiosis, in which the worm provides the bacteria with all the chemical it needs, and the bacteria provide the worm with sugars and other nutrition.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The intimate relationship between worm and bacteria begins when the larval worm, which swims through the water with a normal mouth and gut, ingests the right bacterial &ldquo;symbiont&rdquo;. What happens then is an astonishing change in body plan: <em>Riftia</em> goes from being a swimming to settling on the rocks, closing up its mouth and digestive tract, growing a thick white tube, and becoming one of the fastest growing animals known to humankind.</p> <p>The mysteries of the <em>Riftia pachyptila </em>symbiosis, however, goes beyond this developmental shape-shifting. The symbionts appear to have the ability to use two different biochemical pathways to produce sugars from carbon dioxide. With one or two exceptions, every plant or chemosynthetic microbe on Earth uses just one of five different carbon dioxide conversion (or &ldquo;carbon fixation&rdquo;) pathways. <strong>Why <em>Riftia</em> tubeworm symbionts have two different carbon fixation pathways, and what this means for their ability to grow and feed their tubeworm hosts, is the subject of this investigation.</strong> Because this is such an unusual attribute, we hypothesized that having two different pathways might allow the symbionts to fix carbon across a wider range of environmental conditions, which they encounter at the vents.</p> <p>To test our hypotheses, we built a high-pressure aquarium facility into a 20 foot refrigerated shipping container that we take on board research vessels. This mobile high-pressure laboratory allows us to incubate <em>Riftia</em> tubeworms (and any other animals as needed) at the conditions they encounter on the seafloor. Then, while they are alive and well in the pressurized aquaria, we measure their uptake of oxygen, sulfide, carbon dioxide and any other relevant compounds. After the experiments, we collect blood and tissue samples to study the changes in the chemistry and gene expression, with the intention of understanding when and how they use the two different carbon fixation pathways.</p> <p>After two intense research cruises, our team has found that environmental changes lead to striking differences in the rate of carbon fixation (and thus conversion to sugars). Our ongoing analyses are looking deeper into the changes in gene expression and biochemistry that occur as <em>Riftia</em> is exposed to the full range of environmental conditions in encounters. The results of these efforts help us understand how organisms in nature have responded to the natural changes that they encounter over evolutionary time. Moreover, in collaboration with bio-engineers, we have begun to consider the utility of building this capacity into the microbes that are currently used in industrial processes, etc. to confer upon them a greater ability to be productive across a range of conditions. Indeed, nature harbors a great many innovations that we are beginning to understand and, when appropriate, apply to our own activities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/06/2017<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;Girguis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257755/1257755_10248375_1512571450909_riftiapic--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257755/1257755_10248375_1512571450909_riftiapic--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Riftia pachyptila tubeworms"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257755/1257755_10248375_1512571450909_riftiapic--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Riftia pachyptila tubeworms"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is a small aggregation of tubeworms, which are found along the East Pacific Rise off the coast of Mexico.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Peter Girguis, MBARI</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Peter&nbsp;Girguis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Riftia pachyptila tubeworms</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257755/1257755_10248375_1512578287889_BatsonRiftiabody3940--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257755/1257755_10248375_1512578287889_BatsonRiftiabody3940--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Riftia tubeworm, out of its tube"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257755/1257755_10248375_1512578287889_BatsonRiftiabody3940--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Riftia tubeworm, out of its tube"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Riftia tubeworms and their relatives are unusual in that they lack a mouth, gut, or anus.
