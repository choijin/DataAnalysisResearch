<AbstractNarration>The Engineering Research Center for Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt) was funded in 2011 to facilitate the transition of water systems to a new state in which they consume less energy and resources while continuing to meet the needs of urban users and aquatic ecosystems. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will provide an enhanced, cohesive program to a cohort of undergraduates each summer and will target highly qualified science and engineering students from diverse backgrounds with an emphasis on women and minorities. The student-learning outcomes of the project focus on engaging and creating enthusiasm for science and engineering. The test-bed facilities provide ample opportunities for hands-on experience in multidisciplinary research activities at the four geographically and ethnically diverse institutions. ReNUWIt post-docs and graduate students will gain mentoring experiences in working closely with REU participants. Research communication skills of REU participants will improve through report writing, poster preparation, roundtables, and seminar presentations. This REU Site is supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers.</AbstractNarration>
