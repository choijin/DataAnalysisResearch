<AbstractNarration>Effective engineering of complex devices often depends critically on the ability to encapsulate responsibility for tasks into modular agents and ensure those agents communicate with one another in well-defined and easily observable ways.  When such conditions are followed, it becomes possible to detect where problems lie so they can be corrected.  It also becomes possible to optimize the agents and their communications to improve performance.  Cyber-physical systems (like robots, self-piloting aircraft, etc.) modify themselves to improve performance break those conditions in that some agent modules negotiate their own communications and decide their own actions, sometimes taking advantage of the physics of the world in ways we did not anticipate.  This renders difficult application of standard engineering tools to accomplish critical fault diagnosis and design optimization.  This project will produce analysis methods address the specific needs of cyber-physical systems that, by their natures, break the rules of convention.  We will apply these new methods to the design and analysis of self-improving controllers for flapping-wing micro air vehicles.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide advances in both model-checking related formal design methodologies and in module-based self-adaptive control in computationally resource constrained cyber-physical systems.  The formal methods advances will significantly expand our ability to properly design and verify systems that tightly couple computation, sensors, and actuators.  The specific test application addressed is significant to a number of nationally important security and defense efforts and will directly impact identified national priorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project is to develop a "plug and learn" component concept in which components of a flight control system in a Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicle (FWMAV) would modify themselves in flight to improve whole system performance in the face of ongoing damage and/or wear.  To facilitate this project, it was broken into 4 parts:   Produced and tested a multiagent system based controller module that, unlike traditional controllers, adaptively mixes control laws and control/controller allocation strategies in a self adaptive manner. Produced and tested an oscillator component that, unlike previous efforts, is based on adaptation of internal commutation tables for the physical vehicle prototype. This oscillator was tested on multiple physical test rigs. These tests were conducted with the oscillator as an adaptive component inside one or more traditionally designed flight controllers provided by our partners at AFRL. The oscillators were interfaced to a traditional flight path planner as a series of plug and learn modules. Produce and test a FWMAV control system that combines both the adaptive oscillator and agent based controllers and test co-adaptive capabilities. While this appears as simple as an additive combination of the plug and learn components described above, in reality it represents a more complex entanglement of plug and learn module interactions mediated through explicit communication and physical entrainment.  Developed model checking tools that predict, identify, and isolate faults and opportunities in cyberphysical systems containing plug and learn modules. Specifically we identified places in a cyber-physical system?s design where faults are occurring, where they might occur, and where one might add adaptive plug and learn components to increase whole system performance. These automated techniques were verified against the products of the explicit  research goals, of this project.   All tasks anticipated in the original proposal have been completed with minimal exceptions.  Given the work done and the paths we have gone down, there have also been some positive unplanned outcomes giving way to new agent architectures, validation and  verificiation of integrated smart component fault recovery and short and long term verification and validation of safety.
