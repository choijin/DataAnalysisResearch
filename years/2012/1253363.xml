<AbstractNarration>With this CAREER award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Issac Krauss at Brandeis University.  Professor Krauss will develop cyclopropanated allylboronate reagents and catalysts which can be used for diastereo- and enantioselective homoallylation and homocrotylation of aldehydes and related electrophiles.  In the reagent development area, Dr. Krauss will 1) explore homoallylation scope and diastereoselection with variously substituted racemic boronates, 2) investigate enantioselection and matched/mismatched effects with alpha-chiral boronates, 3) develop optimal syntheses of optically active trans boronates for enantioselective syn homocrotylation and optically active cis- and trisubstituted boronates for enantioselective anti homocrotylation and delivery of quaternary stereocenters, and 4) demonstrate the utility of these boronates in a concise formal synthesis of spongidepsin.  In the catalyst development area, Dr. Krauss will explore the potential chiral and achiral homoallylation catalysis by 1) boron carboxylates, 2) boron phenolates, and 3) other Lewis acids, combined with O,O-, N,O-, and N,N-boracycle reagents. Finally, in collaboration with Professor Kendall N. Houk's group at UCLA, computational studies will assist in catalyst and boronate design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the development of more efficient methods for the preparation of complex organic molecules.  Since most medicines and pesticides are made of complex organic molecules, more efficient preparation methods will facilitate the development of new medicines and pesticides.   They could also improve the current preparation of existing medicines and pesticides, thus lowering their costs.  Synthesis of complex organic molecules are also required in many other areas of activities such as advanced material preparations and fundamental biological studies.  In addition, Professor Krauss will develop an educational program to increase scientific literacy in mature citizens.  With the support of BOLLI (Brandeis' Osher Lifelong Learning Institute) a series of lay-appropriate educational presentations and seminars will promote scientific literacy and highlight the impact of basic research in everyday life.  Design and execution of these presentations will include graduate participation.  Presentations and seminars piloted as BOLLI programming will also be repeated at Boston area retirement communities and posted on the web.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this NSF funded project has been to develop the chemistry of homoallylation using cyclopropanated allylboron reagents. This reaction type was unknown prior to our lab's report in 2011 and very underdeveloped at the start of this project.  The major value and impact of this research is to augment the chemist's toolbox for rapidly preparing diverse "chiral" molecules to test in biomedical research. "Chiral" molecules (i.e., those that are not flat or symmetrical) comprise 80 % of drugs currently in development, but methods to produce them are still limited. The homoallylation reaction we have investigated in this project has the potential to create chiral molecules, because it proceeds through a highly organized rearrangement of atoms, known as a "closed transition state."

We used a photochemical (light-driven) reaction to make one of our homoallylation products cyclize, and found that the outcome of the cyclization could be much improved by the use of flow chemistry.  Overall, this project has demonstrated the utility of cyclopropanated allylation reagents to create stereochemically complex structures of medicinal interest.
