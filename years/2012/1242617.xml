<AbstractNarration>Canada/USA Mathcamp is an intensive five-week summer program for mathematically talented high school students.  Every year, Mathcamp brings together 110-120 exceptional teenagers from the United States, Canada, and around the world, and creates an environment where they can "live and breathe mathematics".  Both intellectually and socially, it is a life-changing experience for many of these students, most of whom have never had a true peer group before coming to Mathcamp.  The program takes place on a different college campus each summer; working mathematicians are recruited from across all specialties (and ranging from postdocs to superstar researchers) to visit for a week and participate in the mathematics instruction.  Access to working mathematicians at Mathcamp helps meet an intellectual need for the students, many of whom do not have the mathematical resources at home to pursue their interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award has two components.  The first component of the award is a "Research in Pairs" program, which will support visits to Mathcamp by pairs of mathematical collaborators.  In addition to teaching a class, these visitors will work on their research during their stay, with two main goals: (1) achieving progress on research, and (2) making the production of new mathematics visible to our students.  The second component of the award provides scholarships for U.S. students from target outreach groups (girls, underrepresented minorities, and students from underrepresented communities of origin, economically disadvantaged backgrounds or underperforming schools).  Taken together, the two components of this award will allow talented students from target outreach groups to interact with role models engaged in active research at Mathcamp.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported research activities and student scholarships at Canada/USA Mathcamp, a summer program for high school students who are extremely high-performing in mathematics.    The first component of the award was a Research in Pairs at Mathcamp initiative, which we called RIPm.  Each summer of the award's support, we brought in top-level collaborations of pairs of mathematicians, whose dual mandate was to (a) show students what creative mathematical research looks like, and (b) teach related courses to make some corner of their research accessible.  Here is the list of pairs, and the names of their research-related courses.     Year 1 (summer 2012):      * Ben Schmidt (Michigan State University) and Craig Sutton (Dartmouth):  "Constructible Numbers"    * Joe Rabinoff (Harvard) and Kirsten Wickelgren (Harvard): "Unique Factorization and FermatÆs Last Theorem"    * Rachel Epstein (Harvard) and Karen Lange (Wellesley College): "Randomness".    * Chris Hoffman (Washington) and Matthew Kahle (Ohio State):"The Probabilistic Method"  Year 2 (summer 2013):   * Sam Payne (Yale) and David Jensen (Stony Brook): "Chip Firing and Sandpiles" Year 3 (summer 2014):    * Allison Henrich (Seattle University) and Sam Nelson (Claremont McKenna):  "Knots, Games, Coloring, and Algebra"   * Mohamed Omar (Harvey Mudd) and Matt Stamps (KTH Sweden): "Graph Coloring" Year 4 (summer 2015):     * Mohamed Omar (Harvey Mudd) and Matt Stamps (Yale-NUS College): "Counting the Faces of Cut-Up Spaces"   * Adam Larios (Nebraska-Lincoln) and Jared Whitehead (Brigham Young): "The Hidden Dance of Partial Differential Equations"     The second component of the award was scholarships for students.  We regard Mathcamp as training the next generation of STEM innovators, and for this reason we think it is essential that Mathcamp casts a wide net to be accessible for students from all backgrounds.  Because of the significant costs of running the program, the sticker price of tuition and fees is high.  This award enabled us to ensure that students from target outreach groups could attend Mathcamp without regard to family means.  Scholarship money covered room, board, and travel for students with demonstrated need, targeted at girls, underrepresented minorities, and people from underrepresented geographical areas in the US.    Year 1 (summer 2012): $19,900  Year 2 (summer 2013): $24,505 Year 3 (summer 2014): $17,737 Year 4 (summer 2015): $18,161     The RIPm program was a great success on all counts:  research, teaching, and exposure of students to the culture of mathematics.  The scholarship support was crucial in upholding our mission to make Mathcamp accessible to a wide diversity of mathematically high-achieving Americans.
