<AbstractNarration>Deep packet inspection (DPI) is an established methodology used by ISPs for performance enhancements, security protections, behavioral advertising, and content filtering. However, the limitations of DPI and its applications are becoming more and more evident with the increase in network traffic and the variations in usage patterns. In this exploratory project, the PI will introduce the notion of Deep ``Network" Inspection (DNI) that will go beyond DPI in exploring correlations among multiple networks and other aggregated parameters from multi-genre networks and behaviors. DNI will use broader knowledge including social network relevancies, information network, modalities of accesses, device characteristics, past and present user profiles at various levels of aggregations; thus going far beyond the realm of isolated characterizations of communication networks. Primary goals of DNI include the reduction in the ?search space? for real-time analysis and the complexity of pattern discoveries, and the discovery of relationships which may not be detectable by single-network inspection (such as DPI). The goal of this project is to do an initial study to motivate and explore the capabilities of DNI, the challenges therein, scope of inspections, and potential applications. The outcome of this exploratory study would potentially open up an enriched area for further research in the domains of network science. In terms of broader impact, the proposed project will also instigate researchers in both academics as well as industry to explore this new domain on network inspection, which may have significant potential in a variety of applications, and education of students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The idea of Deep Network Inspection (DNI) is to go beyond traditional communication networks and incorporate correlations between multiple network information, namely, user-to-user relationships (Social Networks), contextual information (Information Networks) and network communication packets. DNI can be really beneficial in two aspects. First, the "search space" for DPI would impose limitations in terms of real-time analysis and the complexity of pattern discoveries. DNI will help in reducing the search space significantly by using knowledge of a much broader scope and the relationship therein. Second, discovery of relationships which may not be detectable by single-network inspection (such as DPI) would be feasible through DNI.      The research accomplishment of this project can be summarized as follows:     Contextual Localization through Network Traffic:  We developed PACL (Privacy-Aware Contextual Localizer) using which an ISP can determine an IP's location signature. Here, location signature means the category (or context) of location (such as cafe, library, shopping mall etc.) which is, at times, more useful to content providers compared to actual latitude and longitude. The context also preserves usersÆ privacy while allowing providers to provide contextual location specific services (like advertisements) by just using the contextual information rather than the actual location. For this problem, we have identified unique attributes of network traffic that vary at different locations. We consider a number of statistical features, like, activity period, percentage on-off time, packet inter-arrival time, count of HTTP/HTTPs/TCP/UDP packets, session lengths, session counts, etc.      Multi-Device Users Network Usage Patterns:   The number of wireless-enabled devices owned by a user have had a huge growth over the last few years. Over one third of adults in the United States currently own three wireless devices - smartphone, laptop and tablet. As a result, the network traffic of just one device is not enough to get the entire picture of the user.  This work provides a study of the network usage behavior of todayÆs multi-device users. Using the aforementioned data collected from a large university campus, we provide a detailed multi-device user (MDU) measurement study of over 30,000 users. We characterized the usage pattern of the different device types in terms to total and intermittent usage, how the usage of different devices overlap over time and uncarried device usage statistics. We also study userÆs preferences of accessing sensitive content and device-specific factors that govern the choice of WiFi encryption type. We also study how contextual information (e.g: location) affects the usage of these devices.      Uncovering privacy leakage in Bluetooth Low Energy Network Packets:  There has been a tremendous increase in popularity and adoption of wearable fitness trackers. These fitness trackers predominantly use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communicating and syncing the data with user's smartphone. In this work we did a measurement-driven study of possible privacy leakage from BLE communication between the fitness tracker and the smartphone. We show that almost all fitness tracker devices utilize unchanged BLE addresses, making the user vulnerable to tracking. Specifically, fitness tracker and smartphone only periodically connect to each other for exchanging data, leaving the fitness tracker in disconnected advertising mode most of the time where it constantly announces its presence by broadcasting advertising packets. This behavior, in combination with their unchanged BLE address, make it possible for an eavesdropper to track the owner of the fitness tracker. Using traces collected in a gymnasium as well as in controlled experiments, we find that the issue prevails in over 90% of observed devices including top five leading fitness tracker manufacturers.
