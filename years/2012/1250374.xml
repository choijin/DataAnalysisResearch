<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) and his team will investigate the use and interpretation of radio imaging spectroscopy observations of solar active regions through advanced theory development and 3D modeling of gyroresonance (GR) and free-free emission. The GR process permits radio emission to provide direct measurements of magnetic field strength and direction in the solar corona, and so supplies the key to understanding the basic mechanisms underlying all of solar activity. This team's recent work in comparing spatially and spectrally resolved radio emission with magnetic field extrapolations of photospheric magnetograms and other data has suggested that an extension of existing theory to non-Maxwellian particle distributions may be needed to account for the observed altitudes of solar radio sources. The PI therefore will develop a comprehensive modeling framework for flaring loops that is capable of reproducing physically realistic solar atmospheric structure, including distributions of non-thermal particles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's existing tools have already successfully calculated both gyrosynchrotron (GS) radio emission and hard X-ray emission for forward-fitting microwave and X-ray observations of solar flares. Here, the team plans to modify this general framework to model GR emission. This requires a separate development effort to deal with specific issues arising from the GR process, including grid resolution problems, the treatment of the process in spherical coordinates to deal with the large fields of view involved in active region emission, and the development of a consistent way to specify ambient solar plasma temperature and density in addition to the magnetic field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this effort, the PI's team will develop user-friendly software tools for the solar and space weather community, and then widely disseminate them online through the SolarSoft software distribution library. Since this work will be performed at the Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), the activity will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning. The PI plans to integrate the analysis tools developed here into graduate courses at NJIT, including curricula in radio astronomy, solar physics, and plasma physics. This research will also broadly be applicable beyond solar physics, given that both magnetic fields and plasma particle distributions are fundamentally important in astrophysics studies.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project outcome includes new knowledge on the fundamental science problem on the magnetic and thermal structure of active regions (ARs) at the sun, a number of three-dimensional (3D) models of active regions as well as computer codes, simulation tools, theory of gyroresonant and free-free radiation from a plasma with a kappa-distribution needed to model, analyze, and deeply understand modern observational data on the solar activity and wisely plan further observations. The project outcome is documented in more than 40 publications including one textbook, 31 journal articles in scientific journals, and more than 10 conference contributions, which have garnered more than 150 citations.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual merit.</strong> We significantly developed and upgraded our unique modeling tool, <strong>GX simulator</strong>, which is capable to quickly compute various kind of electromagnetic emission (radio, ultraviolet, and X-ray) from a 3D modeling volume. The dynamically created 3D modeling volume includes 3D magnetic structure, a corresponding thermal structure and also may include one or more nonthermal flux tube to model solar flares. Coronal magnetic data cubes have been created for many ARs using linear or nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation technique. This was used for study of the magnetic energy and its evolution, modeling the emission from flaring loops, effect on the flare productivity, sunspot rotation, fine structures of solar flares, small-scale magnetic flux cancellation, rapid blue-shifted excursions, and eruptions. We used high-resolution data from NST and EOVSA as well as modeling and forward fitting to study flare precursors at the 22-June-2015 solar flare. Among other findings the paper published in Nature Astronomy reports the first ever derived evolution of the coronal flare magnetic field with 1 second time resolution. A sophisticated 3D magneto-plasma model has been used to develop and comprehensively test the method of the magnetic field measurements at the base of the corona using the EOVSA interferometry data. We succeeded to correctly recover the model magnetic field values with the accuracy typically better than 30%. We developed a theory that analytically computes the GR and free-free emissivities and absorption coefficients for the kappa- distributions. We upgraded the GR/free-free emission code to include more relevant effects and processes: non-LTE hydrogen ionization, all heavier singly-ionized atoms, He ionization states, and the contributions to opacity due to electron collisions with neutral H and He; thus it is fully applicable to weakly ionized chromospheric plasma.</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts</strong>. The project outcomes were disseminated via public lectures and press-releases, the tools developed and data obtained under the project were used for in-class demonstrations, and in research projects performed by graduate, undergraduate, and high school students affiliated with CSTR. We extensively employed the available NSF-funded assets including NST, ALMA, VLA, and EOVSA. The project provided unrestricted access to all its data-driven modeling products, as well as to open source, innovative software and algorithms developed. We organized workshops and tutorials to make the science community familiar with the data, data products, and modeling tools. We disseminated the obtained knowledge by making scientific and public presentations. We enhanced multi-disciplinary impact of our activities by organizing and regularly attending (co-PI Nita) the BIGDATA meetings supported by NSF. PI Fleishman and co-PI Gary served the community by their activities within the NA Solar ALMA development team. &nbsp;PI Fleishman is a Coordinator of Science Team L &lsquo;Active Regions and Sunspots&rsquo; within an international team 'Solar Simulations for the Atacama Large Millimeter Observatory Network,&rsquo; whose aim is to promote solar ALMA science for the community and public as well as supporting a publicly available model database. PI Fleishman organized two-day sessions on 'Quiet Sun and Active Regions' at the IAGA meetings in 2013 and 2015. Our data visualization and modeling tool, GX Simulator, is now routinely used for in-class demonstrations in graduate courses at CSTR. GX Simulator has been included in the SolarSoft IDL repository; a few major upgrades have been issued; its expanding user community includes researchers, educators, and students from North and South America, Europe, and Asia. Recently, Co-PI Nita was an invited lecturer at the 2015 Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers Summer School, organized by University of Glasgow, which gathered a few tens of graduate students and early career researchers. The data, data products, and the modeling tools are used in the research of the female graduate students Natsuha Kuroda and Shaheda Shaik at CSTR.
