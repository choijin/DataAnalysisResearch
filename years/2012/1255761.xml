<AbstractNarration>Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new networking architectural paradigm in which information rather than packets (units of transmission) are given primacy.  This concept is central to several of the NSF's recent Future Internet Architecture projects as well as other US based and international projects.  The paradigm is transformational because the objective is not to move bits from one place to another but rather to provide access to information, without regard to location.  Hence at the core of an information or content centric networking design is identifiers.  This research focuses on identifiers and the system that services them.  In this EAGER proposal, the PI plans on a set of first steps in validation and evaluation of a design for identity management that supports both persistence and pervasiveness of identifiers.  The plan is that this capability can reside on top of any one of the approaches to ICN.  Thus, this identification approach can provide effective persistence and pervasiveness and can be translated into current ICN identifiers, which generally are intended for delivery of bits in a location-independent way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is to validate and evaluate the effectiveness of providing an indirection layer on top of two of the current ICN projects that are significantly different from each other. The demonstration of validity will focus specifically on persistence and minimization of opportunities denial of service attacks, two capabilities not supported in the ICNs themselves. The requirement for persistence of identifiers and identification management is critical to supporting longevity of the information itself. Mitigation of denial-of-service attacks is selected as the second challenge for two reasons. First, denial-of-service attacks are only possible in pervasive systems, in which attacks can be coordinated widely across a system. Second, one of the key questions across the set of ICN projects is the security and integrity of the infrastructure. All these systems support end-to-end integrity, privacy, confidentiality, but none focuses on the security of the infrastructure that is providing that end-to-end service. Hence denial of service attack mitigation has been selected as the second challenge for this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a necessary proof of concept setting the stage for a larger effort to explore a whole Pervasive Persistent Identification System (PPInS). At the core of the design is a set of idspaces that are distinct in several ways: the id syntax they support, the management of ids (such as assignment and resolution of them) and the security they provide.  Each will translate a globally unique, persistent identifier into the identifiers of the underlying ICN.  A global resolution scheme will map each id to the appropriate idspace management facility.  In this preliminary work, the researchers will design one of those idspaces and evaluate it on top of two of the competing ICN approaches, for validity and evaluation.  The contributions of the larger project can be enumerated by intellectual merit and broader impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed clean separation of identification from the supporting ICN layers, if successful, will result in three specific contributions: the persistence and ubiquity of identification, achieved through isolation and layering; the extensibility and evolvability of approaches to identification to meet varying performance, security, and scalability requirements through modularity within the identification layer; and the extension of the end-to-end principle over time by recognizing the separation of identification from the activities of location independent expressions of interesting and delivery including differentiated end-to-end and infrastructure security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: There are three central broader impacts of this work: the role and support of persistent information (Independent of information centric networking, as the Internet continues to expand in its role and influence on economic, civic, and military/intelligence components of contemporary society?the value of information is not only in its short term effect, but in the persistence over extremely long periods of time);  the education and training of women (The PI is a woman and has consistently supported and will continue to support young women in science, through her research. ) and international collaboration (This work is part of a productive research collaboration between MIT and the University of Cambridge, specifically the leadership of the PURSUIT ICN project.)</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Both the NSF and the European Commission have been funding novel projects to examine alternative architectures and designs for the current Internet. The objective in both cases was to propose novel alternatives that would solve problems not well addressed in the current Internet. Several of these efforts began with the premise that at the "core" of the network should be information or content, and that one should not need to know where that content was to retrieve it. Instead, one should be able to simply request it by name or some form of identifier that did not bind it to a particular place. The reasoning is that, if other problems such as security are solved, it should not matter where the targets are, and in fact, they can be anywhere. What matters is that the requestor receives what was requested.     To that end, these systems include schemes for how the targets should be "named". In fact, they assume that the names may be the same forever. The challenge is that the requirements for handling such names (including creating them, "translating" or using them, guaranteeing that they are unique) place complex challenges on the system. They are proposing that these "names" be efficient and effective for many competing capabilities, such as fast and efficient lookup, human friendly naming, uniqueness over all time (persistence), and so forth.     This project proposed and explored a separation of such functions in order to make the engineering solutions simpler and more efficient. The design was to have a "persistent, pervasive" name space and resolution mechanism on top of the efficient discovery mechanisms of the proposed information centric approaches of the existing projects. We explored two aspects of such an approach. The first is how to achieve global, distributed lookup for unconstrained names, starting with an approach called hierarchical DHTs, originally proposed by Garcia-Molina at Stanford. Separately we also considered how to map from our persistent pervasive names into the names proposed by the current projects, in order to take advantage of their opportunities, but relieve them of the higher level requirements.     The novel aspects of the work to date include both approaches to distributed, location dependent management of information in the Garcia-Molina approach. They considered the management of servers arriving and departing, but their proposal for insertion of new data would lead to significant "stretch" of lengthening of the paths to finding a resolution than would be acceptable. We have a new approach that we are continuing to explore. In addition, we began some early work on an improved model of mobility that reflects the fact that apparent mobility in the network increasingly may be the result of a device simply switching networks and apparently moving within the "topology", but not moving physically. New smart devices with multiple radios are the drivers for this different model of mobility. Again, this work is ongoing and we expect it to be brought into another ongoing project.     The intellectual merit of this project falls into three categories:  An architectural approach to decomposing the problems of naming and identity at global scale and under global performance criteria. An understanding of the geographic limitations of the Garcia-Molina approach taken in the Canon project, including a proposal for addressing those problems. The beginnings of an expanded model of topological mobility as it influences global name resolution   The broader impacts of this project fall into four categories  A deeper understanding of the requirements and potential mechanisms for global, efficient name or identifier resolution A deeper understanding of the "architecture" of naming systems, and how to decompose them effectively The beginnings of an expanded model of topological mobility, to be applicable more broadly in the networking community. The current models based on human movements only capture one component ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
