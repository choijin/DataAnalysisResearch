<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Timothy D. Lash of the Department of Chemistry at Illinois State University will explore the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of porphyrin-like macrocycles, including neo-confused porphyrins and other carbaporphyrinoid systems.  Specifically, syntheses of heterobenziporphyrins and heteropyriporphyrins will be developed using a "3 + 1" strategy.  The chemistry of previously prepared monocarbaporphyrins will also be studied.  A strategy for synthesizing carbaporphyrins and carbachlorins from a cyclopentene dialdehyde and a new route to benzocarbaporphyrins from 6-methoxyazulene will be developed.  General approaches to the synthesis of a new class of porphyrin isomers known as neo-confused porphyrins will be investigated.  In addition to dicarbaporphyrinoids, tri- or tetracarbaporphyrinoid systems will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will not only lead to more efficient routes to carbaporphyrinoid systems but will also allow access to new classes of porphyrin analogues.  This project is important to improve our basic understanding of fundamental chemistry concepts such as aromaticity.  It also has practical applications for the synthesis of fine chemicals, since the target compounds can be used to construct catalysts for chemical synthesis.  In addition, the target compounds are important in medicines, as they have potential applications in photodynamic therapy.  These projects not only provide an excellent environment for training undergraduates and master level graduate students in the field of organic synthesis, but they also expose them to the multidisciplinary nature of modern scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

Neo-confused porphyrins were first prepared at Illinois State University and represent a new class of porphyrin isomers. Porphyrin isomers include N-confused porphyrins where one of the pyrrole nitrogens has been &ldquo;misplaced&rdquo; so that it was orientated towards the periphery instead of being placed within the macrocyclic cavity. This system has also been widely studied due to its intriguing chemical reactivity. In neo-confused porphyrins, a pyrrole nitrogen is connected to a bridging carbon thereby dramatically altering the electronic properties of the structure. Surprisingly, neo-confused porphyrins were found to retain aromatic properties and their UV-visible spectra also remained similar to true porphyrins. Nevertheless, the degree of aromatic character was diminished and this has been confirmed by computational studies. Metalated porphyrins have many applications, including uses as catalysts in epoxidations and cyclopropanation reactions. Neo-confused porphyrins have been shown to form stable organometallic complexes with the catalytically important metals nickel and palladium.

Earlier, we had shown that these form stable nickel(II), palladium(II) and platinum(II) complexes under mild conditions. We have now extended these metalation reactions to the formation of iridium(III) and rhodium(III) complexes.

This turned out to have unusual spectroscopic properties that appeared to be intermediary between azuliporphyrins and carbaporphyrins. A synthesis of a carbachlorin and a carbaporphyrin with an unsubstituted carbocyclic ring was also developed. Chlorins, reduced porphyrins that have a moderately strong absorption near 650 nm (absorption of red light leads to their green coloration), are very well studied because they provide the nucleus for the chlorophylls, and because they have superior properties for applications in PDT. Far less is known about carbachlorins and a &ldquo;3 + 1&rdquo; route to this system was developed. Carbachlorins also form silver(III) complexes and have absorptions near 650 nm.
