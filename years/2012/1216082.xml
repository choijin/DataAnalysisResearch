<AbstractNarration>For centuries, the discovery of scientific laws has been driven by empirical investigation of natural phenomena. However, human capabilities of relationship discovery get strained in multi-dimensional spaces, which in particular may explain why we have not seen any fundamental laws postulated for the structure or behavior of such complex constructs as social networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will exploit the methodological toolbox based on symbolic regression with the objective to assist the human mind in simultaneously searching through multiple social network datasets and detecting stable relationship patterns across them, thus allowing for the discovery of natural social network behavior laws. This project will identify objectively measurable, macroscopic metrics pertaining to social network phenomena and explore under what conditions the computer-enabled empirical approach to knowledge discovery can be successful. The scientific inquiry approach based on the computer-enabled empirical learning paradigm will rely on recent advances in stochastic processes, systems theory, symbolic regression, evolutionary algorithms, and data fusion. Using standard social network metrics, computational experiments will be conducted and their results manually traversed in search for robust expressions (explicit formulae and invariants) corresponding to hidden symbolic laws. This project will benefit organizations and institutions that rely on fundamental understanding of social structures. It will further advances in communications, economics, engineering, psychology, sociology, epidemiology, and other domains engaged in studies of social interaction and behavior.  On a broader level, this project will enrich the methodological toolbox of inquiry for other unexplored areas of modern science. Through student involvement activities and outreach, this research effort will enhance the educational environment supported by NSF and fostered at the University at Buffalo.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project explored a new computer-enabled knowledge discovery approach to studying social behavior, and sought to establish whether it was possible to infer any principles of social network formation directly from observations of very large real online networks.  The project revealed that there is a good potential for finding symbolic relationships (i.e., formulae) that would connect global aggregate measures capturing social network structure patterns. However, the experiments with modern symbolic regression software proved that sifting through the multitude of "promising" formulae blindly is an insurmountable task. In other words, in relying on purely data-driven approach to scientific discovery, it is important to know even approximately what one can expect to uncover.  The project then sought to determine what network characteristics could potentially figure in, and thus, should be measured to distill a fundamental social network law. The project members discovered that a simple, intuitive process of information exchange on a local friendship network can be responsible for the emergence of the well-known, but not yet well-explained, global pattern observed in almost all social and many technological networks &ndash; the power law distribution of the number of connections that network actors maintain. Establishing an analytical, quantitative base for this discovery opens an exciting direction for future research.  By connecting the process of local (myopic) information exchange and the resulting emergence of macroscopic (global) patterns in follower-type social networks, this project enriches the knowledge base in the domains of engineering, physics, computer science and sociology - the communities that have recently expanded great effort in understanding social network behavior principles.
