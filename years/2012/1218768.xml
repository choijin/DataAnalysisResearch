<AbstractNarration>Energy and power consumption have become a critical issue ranging from microarchitectures to large-scale data centers and supercomputers. Conservative estimates suggest that the information technology industry world-wide energy consumption is in excess of 400 TWh and growing, generating roughly the same carbon footprint as the airline industry, accounting for 2% of global emissions. At the same time, the power constraints of chips hamper their performance, and the shrinking transistor geometries and low supply voltages increase the severity of processor variations resulting in higher timing error rates. High error rates lead to a significant drop in yield and increased manufacturing costs, calling for designs that are able to withstand them.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to understand and explore the novel paradigm of elastic fidelity computing. Elastic fidelity computing capitalizes on the observation that many applications can naturally tolerate errors, and that not all of them need to run at 100% fidelity all the time. Specifically, the goal of this work is to understand the error models of various hardware components as they relate to data movement, storage, and computation, and simultaneously to understand the error resiliency of applications and re-architect them to leverage elastic fidelity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Elastic fidelity offers potentially transformative effects for science and society, by challenging conventional wisdom and taking a fresh look at the interplay of errors, output quality and energy efficiency for an important class of pervasive streaming and data-intensive applications. More specifically, elastic fidelity promises significant energy savings that can put computing on an environmentally sustainable path, by lowering the operational costs in major economic sectors, and making the manufacturing of future chips cheaper by relaxing the accuracy requirements of hardware components. The results of this research will be disseminated through publications, workshops, advanced curriculum, and releases of the developed infrastructure in the public domain. To accelerate broad societal effects, the project participants will seek to foster technology transfer by promoting collaboration and industry involvement through presentations and site visits.</AbstractNarration>

To investigate this tradeoff, we developed the most accurate and complete hardware error model to date of undervolted integer, logic and floating point arithmetic units. Our model achieves significantly higher accuracy and higher coverage than existing ones, while staying within 1-3% of the ground truth. We proposed processor architectures that increase the accuracy of undervolted arithmetic units to the point that some applications experience fully-correct results in a third of their computations, while a traditional processor under the same conditions leads to all computations being erroneous. We proposed certain ways of restructuring important applications (e.g., large-scale graph processing) to save up to 30% energy without losing much accuracy. While these techniques lead to more energy-efficient systems, which is the primary objective of Elastic Fidelity, they also lead to systems that can tolerate hardware errors. This is especially important, as devices in the deep nanoscale regime are likely to be highly error-prone due to geometry scaling, process variation and device mismatch, which necessitates techniques to absorb these errors at the architectural and software layers.    Simultaneously, our effort to design energy-efficient systems led to the pursuit of novel architectures, some of which utilize emerging devices. Our Galaxy architecture advocates building processors not as single monolithic chips, but as a large collection of smaller chiplets, physically distributed in space and connected through nanophotonic links to form a "virtual macro-chip" that can reach scales impossible to realize with conventional technologies. Galaxy achieves 7x higher performance for the same energy level, far outperforming any other alternative. Our designs on adaptive laser power gating (e.g., EcoLaser, ProLaser, SLAC, which turn off the laser in a nanophotonic interconnect when the network is idle, and predict when communication is imminent to turn the laser back on at just the right time to transmit without dela...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
