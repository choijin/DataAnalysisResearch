<AbstractNarration>The growth of the Internet has led to a dramatic increase in the rate at which information is generated and delivered. This is especially true for the news cycle which has become instantaneous and often resulting in social networks, most notably Twitter, being the medium of choice to deliver late breaking news. This is usually in the form of links to more details which include news articles and multimedia data (news photos and videos). One problem lies in identifying reliable news gatherers which is done by noting if they are the first to report on a topic in contrast to being a re-poster and their frequency. Other issues in providing access to news content involve making the news automatically indexable (instead of by human tagging) both by content (regardless of the language of creation and the nature of the media) and by the location of the content (i.e., geotagging) rather than the location or affiliation of its creator. In the case of location, the challenge lies in devising language-independent geotagging techniques. Machine learning based methods are investigated and are expected to work better than rule-based methods due to a reduced reliance on language-specific rules and a greater reliance on examples. Access to the images is facilitated by indexing them by the words associated with the news articles containing them. This indexing technique is meant to be used as a filter for finding similar or near-duplicate images where the similarity is based on image features. The access by location is facilitated by the use of a map query interface. This is important as it corresponds to enabling the use of spatial synonyms thereby permitting a wider range of queries to be posed. A novel aspect of the research is the incorporation of non-English content which is facilitated by the use of computerized translation services which will be evaluated on their ability to capture the content on the basis of clustering similar articles in different languages rather than on the basis of factors such as proper grammar, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In today's rapidly changing world, the tools that are developed in this project will make this information more accessible as users are enabled to focus on a geographical area of interest as well as have access to content in their own language. This is of utility to a number of organizations and attempts will be made to collaborate with potential users on tailoring the tools for their needs. In addition, the project will provide research experience to undergraduate and graduate students who will be involved in developing some of the components. These tools are also a step in the growth of the nascent field of computational journalism. The project web site (http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hjs/geomultimedia.html ) will provide access to results of this and related research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ GeoMultimedia data is everywhere around us as location has become afirst class data attribute.  This is in large a result of the abilityto geocode data by means of a GPS capability which is present invirtually all of our mobile devices.  These devices are capturing moreand more data about the places that we are visiting whether in ourdaily life or as tourists.  Even more important is what it says aboutour activities and preferences.  This information is captured in theform of images and videos and often transmitted to others under the belief that it is news.  Of course, what constitutes news has changedgreatly over the years in terms of what is of interest to people.  Inparticular, our new communication capabilities like Twitter andFacebook enable people to connect to like-minded people who are members of their social network.  They transmit such information tothem which is rich with references to multimedia data such as imagesand videos as well as news articles and blogs.  Of course, news ofworld events of general interest is transmitted but more importantlythe social connectivity of the recipients with the senders invariablymeans that often the majority of the events that are associated withthem are of local interest.  In the big Twitter stream of tweets, itshard to detect local news events as there are too few tweets aboutthem and thus the clusters do not get large enough to filter outnoise since there are so many tweets.  Also there is the issue oftheir trustworthiness as we prefer the people who are the first totweet about a subject rather than reposting it.  These considerations  effect the veracity and authenticity of these events and we have beenfocusing some of our efforts at building an infrastructure to enableaccessing this information by the spatial locations with which theyare associated.  In particular, this has been done with the aid of amap query interface which enables the data to be accessed by use ofpan and zoom operations and to take advantage of spatial synonyms.    Some of the outcomes of our research were:  1.  A realization that the dominant class of devices with which suchspatio-temporal information is accessed is the smartphone with itslimited and small form factor. This has resulted in the imposition ofinteresting constraints on what can be shown to users in theassociated mapping Apps and APIs.  We have conducted intense studiesabout how they do not satisfy traditional cartographic principles.  2.  We have constructed the PhotoStand system which aggregates news photos into clusters on the basis of the text with which they are associated.The system also extract the dominant locations in the clusters andassociates the photo clusters with these locations.  This is all done without human intervention. 3.  We have developed the BrandStand system for finding mentions ofnames of companies and brands in news articles, clustering thearticles, extracting the principal locations in the article clusters,and associating the clusters with the locations so that they canbe monitored automatically in contrast to the manual process withwhich this task has been executed in the past with the aid ofclipping services.  This capability should find use in brand remediation efforts. 4.  Implemented a Chinese version of TwitterStand to deal with Weibomessages in the same way as done by TwitterStand with tweets.  5.  Raised the issue of a GeoSocial marketplace where people can sellthe social spatio-temporal data that they produce to differentconsumers.  We discussed the challenges involved here such as how todefine supply and demand, pricing data, privacy issues, and measuringthe amount of data being exchanged.  We explain the importance of theapproach and its applicability.  We believe that the proposed visioncould motivate followup research in the area of sharing and exchangingspatio-temporal data as well as determining appropriate pricepoints. 6.  We wrote an article describing the NewsStand system which wasfeatured on the cover of the October 2014 issue of the Communicationsof the ACM which was accompanied by a 4 minute video prepared byACM describing the system and its benefits.
