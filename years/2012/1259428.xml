<AbstractNarration>RPR (An Approach for Recruitment, Persistence, and Retention of CS/ITS Students) provides full four-year scholarships to a cohort of 13 academically-talented and financially-disadvantaged majors in Computer Science and Information Technology &amp; Systems majors. Recruitment initiatives focus on program features that have broad appeal to a diverse population of students, including women.  RPR's intellectual merit is grounded in its coordination of initiatives found to be effective in recruiting and retaining students.   The program features a cohort approach to learning, including a common freshman year experience where students participate in a two-semester active learning CS sequence, a self-management course that aids in student persistence and retention, and a discrete mathematics course.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, students have opportunities to engage in applied research and internships and to be paired with industry mentors.  Program evaluation focuses on the effectiveness of recruitment strategies in attracting a diverse cohort and on core program features in aiding student achievement, persistence and retention.  The broader impact of RPR is to promote growth and diversity in the CS/ITS field and to disseminate evaluation findings through peer-reviewed publications such as the Proceedings of the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) and the Journal of Computer Sciences in Colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to improve upon, and evaluate a successful approach for recruiting, retaining and graduating a cohort of academically-talented and financially-disadvantaged Computer Science and Information Technology and Systems (CS/ITS) students.  The project modified and improved features of an earlier approach that Marist used in 2010 to recruit, retain, and graduate a cohort of 12 academically-talented and financially-disadvantaged scholarship students who majored in CS or ITS.  With NSF funding, this project a) coordinated new recruitment initiatives to attract broader representation of the general population, including females; b) developed and highlighted freshman courses that were of greater interest to a wider population of students;  c) had the students participate in a freshman learning community; and d) evaluated the modified recruitment strategy and retention initiatives.  A key recruitment incentive was the selected cohort students received full tuition, and room and board scholarships.  In order to retain the cohort students, supplemental instruction and tutoring, special advisement, industry mentoring, career placement services, applied research and internship opportunities, and extracurricular activities were offered to the cohort students.  New recruitment initiatives focused on promoting the NSF Technology Scholarships with a larger and more diverse population, especially targeting qualifying students across the country from underrepresented student groups in technology; including females, and financially disadvantaged students.  The NSF Scholarship program proved very effective in attracting students to the CS/ITS majors. Goldman Sachs provided funding each year for 3 additional full scholarships and Marist College provided 1 additional full scholarship modeled after the NSF Technology Scholarships.  Seventeen full scholarships were awarded to CS/ITS majors recruited from across the country and entered Marist as freshmen in September 2014.  The cohort of 13 NSF technology scholars consisted of three females and ten males, three of whom were African-American, two were Hispanic, and one was American Indian/Alaska Native. The PI, the school Dean, and the Self-Management course instructor acted as advisors for all 13 students. The technology scholars formed a freshman learning community (FLC).  As part of the FLC, all NSF scholars were housed on the same floor in the same residence hall, assigned the same advisors, and took three specially designed courses together their freshman year. The PI taught the two computing technology courses. The students participated in applied research projects and paid internships, and worked with industry mentors and tutors.  Several students studied abroad for a semester during their junior or senior year.  Eleven of the original 13 students graduated with degrees in either CS or IT in 2018, ten in May and one in August. One additional student is completing one course to attain his degree.  One of the original cohort students is pursuing a graduate degree at Carnegie Mellon University. Fortune 500 institutions hired four other students.  The 4 year graduation rate for the cohorted students exceeded 84%, with 11 of the original 13 NSF scholars graduating in 2018. The graduation rate for the 17 total scholars was 88%.  This cohort graduation rate exceeded that of the previously NSF funded cohort of 83% in 2014.  Comparisons of the cohorts? four-year graduation rate show that it exceeds at a statistically significant level (p &lt; .05) the four-year graduation rate at the national level (all, public, nonprofit, and for-profit), New York State institutions (public and private), as well as Marist?s prior graduation rates for computer science.  Many of the cohort students participated in fall and spring Open Houses, greeting prospective students and their parents. The cohort students studied and socialized together, continued to schedule classes together, selected to house together and often attended off-campus events together throughout the 4 years.  The cohort model and the special Self-Management course, tutoring sessions, social outings, and resume preparation workshops have proved to be very successful in retaining the cohort students in the technology majors.  This freshman learning community succeeded in building comradery and an informal support system among the students. The freshman course in Self-Management, taught by one of the students? advisors helped students define their career goals, plan their course schedules, and improve their time management skills.   The technology scholarship model has proved to be successful in recruiting, retaining and graduating CS and IT students, and preparing them to be successful in attaining positions in prominent companies. Along with utilizing the cohort model, the self-management course, special advisors, and social activities, students were supported academically, socially, and financially.   Marist College continues to offer a full Technology Scholarship each year.  Marist's Admissions Office promotes the Technology Scholarship during their recruitment visits across the country.  They also promote the scholarship to all students visiting the college and hold Open Houses each fall and spring.  Admissions ensures that they visit schools that have a high percentage of  underrepresented student groups in technology; including females, and financially disadvantaged students.
