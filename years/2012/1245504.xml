<AbstractNarration>This research project develops an electronic assessment model with vocabulary, clicker, and homework assessment questions for a broad range of undergraduate introductory statistics courses. Report generating programs incorporating the current state of data visualization research will be developed to automatically generate reports for students, course instructors, and supervisors, enabling rapid feedback on learning and instruction to all parties. The effectiveness of this new technology on student learning will be evaluated along with the progression of student learning of course outcomes and impact of different styles and methods for delivering questions. The intellectual merit of this project is its contribution to the field of statistics education by extending previous work on course level student learning outcomes (GAISE College Report) to the topic level and by developing assessments to measure these outcomes. These assessments will inform student learning and instruction by finding the relative difficulties students have in learning course outcomes, obtaining the most common patterns exhibited by students in their understanding of course learning outcomes, and identifying the most common problems students have in learning particular outcomes. The broader impact of this project is to affect assessment in undergraduate introductory statistics courses at many institutions by providing instructors at other institutions with an electronic assessment model with report generating software. This project will provide a template for electronic assessments in other introductory courses in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

In this research project, we developed and implemented an electronic assessment model for undergraduate introductory statistics courses. With the use of this model, students, instructors, and course supervisors can obtain more immediate feedback on student learning. This model includes:  A list of 27 common topics covered in a broad range of introductory statistics courses. A list of 218 learning outcomes covered in these 27 topics. A database of over 1200 electronic homework questions and a database of over 400 clicker questions to assess studentsÆ performance on the course learning outcomes. A software package to help instructors and course supervisors quickly evaluate student performance on the course learning outcomes by using state-of-the-art research in statistical computing and graphics. A list of 369 vocabulary words necessary to build statistical literacy and understanding in these 27 topics. A database of 195 electronic questions to assess studentsÆ understanding of these vocabulary words.   This electronic assessment model has been in use at Iowa State University for the past five years, affecting the instruction of over 6,000 students in introductory statistics. Using this model, research has been conducted to identify difficulties in learning selected topics in introductory statistics.  The model and materials listed above will be made available to introductory statistics course instructors at other academic institutions (high schools, two-year colleges, and four-year colleges and universities) in the United States.
