<AbstractNarration>The classical theory of error-correcting codes by Shannon and Hamming has developed into a flourishing subject, and has been hugely influential in the design of communication and storage systems.  However, the more modern aspects of error-correcting codes, including those relevant to complexity theory and pseudorandomness, have lagged behind, and many challenges and problems are not well understood.  This project aims to remedy this situation by systematically exploring what can be achieved in the realm of local-decoding, local-testing, list-decoding and local list-decoding, and by exploring the implications of this in complexity theory and pseudorandomness.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to investigate new constructions of error-correcting codes supporting sublinear-time error-detection, sublinear-time error-correction and efficient list-decoding, as well as their applications in the areas of computational complexity theory and pseudorandomness. The project builds upon several recent advances made by the PI, such as the construction of new high rate error-correcting codes allowing, for the first time, sublinear-time error-correction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this project will involve the mentoring and education of junior researchers who intend to pursue a career in research, as well as the development and dissemination of new course materials and broadly accessible presentations of the results of this research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The primary new discovery of this project was new Locally Correctable Codes which allow representation of data in a robust error-resistant format, which nevertheless allow superfast access to the data despite the occurrence of errors.

Other important discoveries include  new probabilistically checkable proof systems with only a constant factor redundancy, which allow checking proofs in sublinear time constructions of state-of-the-art list-decodable codes robust to large fractions of errors advances in the theory of randomness and pseudorandomness      These discoveries were enabled by the development of new algebraic, combinatorial, probabilistic and analytic tools, strengthening connections between computer science, information theory and mathematics.  This project also enabled the PI to mentor graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The PI has advised 10 PhD students, 6 of whom have graduated and have obtained positions in academia and industry. The research results have been presented at conferences, workshops and have appeared in peer reviewed journals.        Last Modified: 06/05/2019       Submitted by: Swastik Kopparty]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
