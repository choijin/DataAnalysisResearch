<AbstractNarration>This award funds research in the theory of games with incomplete information.  This branch of noncooperative game theory has a wide range of applications in Economics and other social sciences.  Examples include the analysis of optimal taxation, auctions and procurement design, signaling models of the labor market, adverse selection models of trade and insurance markets, reputation and commitment in long-run relationships, credibility of monetary policies, and strategic trading in financial markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous research has established that the predictions made by game theory about behavior in these situations are quite sensitive to the assumptions made about the players' infinite hierarchies of beliefs.  The PIs develop new methods to study this robustness problem. They evaluate the severity of the robustness problem by characterizing necessary and sufficient conditions for the strategic behavior of a given Harsanyi type to be approximated by the strategic behavior of (a sequence of) perturbed types.  This amounts to providing a belief-based characterization of the strategic topology over types.  The investigators also apply their characterization to a variety of questions concerning robustness to perturbations of higher-order beliefs, including genericity of common priors and of critical types, and the connections between robustness of strategic behavior and the notion of common p-belief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have broader impact because this branch of game theory is used to study applied problems in multiple domains, including Computer Science, and Biology.  The PIs will be incorporating their research into graduate courses and will train graduate students in these new methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project concerns theoretical work in the field of game theory. A well-known problem with non-cooperative game theory is its reliance on details. The formal description of a strategic situation as a game requires informational assumptions that are often not verifiable in full detail by the analyst in real life, such as each player?s subjective beliefs about the payoff functions of other players (and their higher-order beliefs). And, unfortunately, game theoretic solutions are known to depend sensitively on those assumptions.  The PI and his collaborators investigate the severity of this robustness problem by quantifying the maximum misspecification error that can be allowed in a model of the players? beliefs and higher-order beliefs while ensuring the model delivers predictions within a specified level of accuracy. More formally, the objects of study are strategic topologies, which are notions of proximity of information structures under which game theoretic solutions display a continuity property: close-by information structures lead to close-by (predictions of) strategic behaviors. The main results of the project are characterizations of strategic topologies provided explicitly in terms of (standard) notions of proximity of probability distributions. These tools are then used to characterize the strategic impact of (seemingly) small violations of common assumptions of economic theory, such as the ubiquotous "common prior assumption" of information economics.
