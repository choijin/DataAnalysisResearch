<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate a novel class of optical tweezers which can trap and manipulate liquid droplets with large force.  The approach, termed optofluidic tweezers (OFT), is based on the photomechanical conversion of light into 3-dimensionally confined thermocapillary microvortices which align a droplet on the axis of a focused laser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. OFT relies on capillary forces, a mechanism fundamentally different from traditional optical tweezers.  It can attain forces in the ÂµN range, which is 100,000X larger than optical tweezers and 1,000X larger than optoelectronic tweezers.  This unique feature makes OFT a potentially transformative approach for liquid manipulation over a wide range of length scales.  This research will build a fundamental understanding of the energy transduction and trapping mechanism through the systematic study of flow fields, temperature profiles, holding forces, geometric scaling, and material properties.  It will also create a prototype system for OFT-based manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Optical manipulation tools are broadly used in biology, physics, and engineering, typically at the micro and nanoscale.  Due to its large force, OFT can extend these capabilities to the millimeter scale, enabling new applications in electronics manufacturing and lab-on-a-chip systems.  This highly interdisciplinary project combines optics, fluid dynamics, and interfacial phenomena, providing a unique platform for training graduate and undergraduate students.  The PI will leverage Wayne State University?s established channels for recruiting underrepresented minorities.  The PI will also develop a ?jello microfluidics? module for Detroit Science Center Nanodays, an NSF-sponsored program for nanoscale science education targeted to K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since the invention of the optical tweezer in the 1980's, the manipulation of objects using light has remained a fascination to scientists.  The optical tweezer found a wide use in physics and biology, manipulate particles, cells, subcellular organells, and molecules.  However, because the optical tweezer is based upon radiation pressure or an electromagnetic gradient force, it can provide forces only in the piconewton range, which limits its use to only micron and submicron-scale objects.     This project investigated the optofluidic tweezer (OFT), a new category of optical twezer which can manipulate droplets of oil in a water phase.  Based on the thermocapillary effect, the OFT can generate forces of 100's of nanonewtons, which is 100,000 times stronger than the conventional optical tweezer.   The large force enables OFT to manipulate larger objects, opening up possibilities to sub-millimeter scale assembly, particle collection, and remote control of objects.  While the thermocapillary migration has been studied by other researchers, to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of a thermocapillary trap.   This project was selected for inclusion in the NSF Year of Light in 2015.  Intellectual Merit  The overall objective of this work was to establish a fundamental understanding of optofluidic tweezers and its practical constraints.  Our efforts centered along the following specific aims:  1) Building a laser scanning system for OFT manipulation.  We built two variants of the system, one in which the laser remains stationary, and another in which the laser is scanned in 2 dimensions using a galvanometric scanner.  This system was controlled through a graphical interface as well as programmed velocities and trajectories.   This system has formed a piece of infrastruture that can be used in our future work in this area.  2) Measurement of the flow fields using high speed microscoping imaging.  Using a microscope and high speed cameras obtained from this grant, we measured the geometry and velocity of the balanced/unbalanced Marangoni flows which drive the trapping effect.  3) Measurement of temperature profiles.  The OFT trapping is due to the Marangoni effect driven by heating from the laser beam.  We measured the temperature profiles directly using a microthermocouple.  4) Measured holding forces.  After experimenting with numerous techniques, we found the most robust method to measure holding forces is by measuring the maximum velocity at which a droplet can be moved.  We developed a model from which the velocity can be translated into a holding force. These measurements confirmed that the OFT can indeed generate forces in the nanonewton range.   5) Investigated the impact of fluid properties such as viscosity and thermal conductivity.  One of the goals of our modeling efforts was to understand how material parematers impact trapping efficiency.  Experimentally, we measured holding forces over a range of materials of various thermal conductivities and velocities, and modeled the effects analytically and in simulation.  The project provided support to 3 Ph.D. students, and 2 MS level international exchange students from Austria and China, respectively.  The work was covered in 1 Ph.D. thesis and 1 MS thesis.  This work has generated 4 conference papers and two comprehensive journal paper (one in process).  Broader Impact  Beyond the technical scope of the project?s specific aims, this work made a broader impact in two areas in the scientific and local communities.    Droplet tracking software.  As a part of this work and another synergistic NSF sponsored project on Tensiophoresis, our group developed a droplet tracking software called droplet morphometry and velocimetry (DMV).  This software was the first tool for tracking and measuring droplet parameters in digital videos.  It is able to track more than 20 parameters of interest.  Although we developed it for use in this project, we made it freely available to the scientific community.  DMV is now used by &gt; 75 groups in 16 countries worldwide for applications ranging from droplet microfluidics, single cell analysis, foams, particle tracking, bacteria, spray drying, and drug encapsulation.  Educational outreach. As part of our educational outreach efforts, we conducted a day-long outreach activity at Wayne State University's STEM day 2018, which involved hundreds of local area high school students. Thirty five of these students participated in our hands-on, 1 hour lab demo which exposed the students to elementary and advanced concepts in surface tension driven actuation and the science behind Marangoni flow.  Experiments included the motion of pepper and a soap boat induced by Marangoni flow, and a demonstration of our laboratory experiments.  Students were asked to fill out a short assessment survey, and the results were compiled and provided to NSF.  The majority of students indicated that the activity increased their understanding of surface tension and science careers in general.
