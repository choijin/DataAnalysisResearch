<AbstractNarration>The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, along with its partner organizations, propose to implement a 10-week summer research experience focused on Security Printing and Anti-Counterfeiting Technology (SPACT), for 10 undergraduate students. Counterfeiting is a growing issue in the U.S., posing serious economic, safety and national security concerns and impacting a wide variety of industries (e.g. pharmaceutics, semiconductors). This REU Site will focus on development of transformative anti-counterfeiting technology, including security printing. Security printing is a field which demands development in four key areas including, advanced materials, advanced manufacturing/patterning technologies, detection and encryption technology, and finally, software and database infrastructure to convert marked products to security end products. The key objectives are to: 1) conduct transformative research in the field of SPACT, and 2) provide STEM research exposure and professional development opportunity to a diverse group of undergraduate students, half will come from Tribal Colleges and other institutions with limited STEM research opportunities. A diverse team of faculty mentors from three partner institutions will build a program in SPACT by applying research methods from various fields of science and engineering. The long term goal is to provide a diverse group of STEM researchers with the needed training and skills to pursue graduate studies and advance the developing field of SPACT.  The faculty will mentor students and also conduct seminars and workshops to supplement student's existing academic training in various SPACT disciplines. Students will also participate in a highly integrated professional development and technical communications program. This REU Site is supported by the National Science Foundation, Division of Engineering Education and Centers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Security Printing and Anti-Counterfeiting Technology Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has been established to expose a diverse group of undergraduate students, half will come from Tribal Colleges and other institutions with limited STEM research opportunities, to the STEM research environment and help them develop as professionals. Counterfeiting is a growing issue in the U.S., posing serious economic, safety and national security concerns and impacting a wide variety of industries (e.g. pharmaceutics, semiconductors). The focus of the student research will be on the development of Security Printing and Anti-Counterfeiting Technology.  Students will also participate in a highly integrated professional development and technical communications program designed to stimulate professional development and the development of research skills necessary to succeed in the 21st century. This Research Experience for Undergraduates Site is supported by the National Science Foundation, Division of Engineering Education and Centers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   During the summers of 2013-2015, 30 undergraduate students (10/year) conducted research focused on Security Printing and Anti-Counterfeiting Technology (SPACT). The key objectives of the collaborative site were to (1) conduct transformative research, and (2) provide STEM research exposure and professional development opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate students, with a minimum of 20% NA students and 50% from universities with limited STEM research opportunities.      Intellectual Merit Dissemination - SPACT REU students have produced four peer-reviewed journal publications (two under review), two peer-reviewed conference preceding papers, four national conference presentations (undergraduate 1st author), and 25 regional conference presentations (undergraduate 1st author). Furthermore, one research project (a collaborative project involving two REU students from separate disciplines) resulted in the filing of a patent application. Site research was also presented at the 2013 Document Security Alliance annual meeting at U.S. Secret Service (SS) HQ. The DSA was formed at the urging of the SS following the 911 terrorist attacks. SPACT was the first academic member of DSA.     The PIs have been active in disseminating lessons learned from this REU program. For example, the PIs twice organized a "SD REU Directors Meeting", first at the 2013 SD EPSCoR All Investigator Meeting and then at the 2014 SD Undergraduate Research Symposium, whereby PIs from various REU programs shared lessons learned regarding the SPACT REU program. Additionally, the PI attended a REU PI workshop at the Council on Undergraduate Research, Conference of REU Student Scholarship, to provide lessons learned from this unique multi-institution REU site.      The PIs and REU participants have communicated Site activities through regional and nationwide news outlets in the form of television, newspaper, and magazines. This has been an effective method to increase the public awareness of the SPACT REU program. The SPACT REU research was also highlighted in an NSF Research Highlight entitled "Tribal Artifacts Revealed" and in a feature article in Hardrock Magazine entitled, "Changing the Narrative." Furthermore, SPACT REU students were encouraged to share their REU success stories with various outreach programs. For instance, this past summer, two REU students presented their research students in the SD Jump Start Program (SD program to help NA and low-income students get a "jump start" on college) and Omniceye Bridge Program (pre-orientation college transition program for NA students).     The SPACT REU program has had a profound impact on undergraduate research within SD. In this regard, in 2014 the PIs requested support from the SD EPSCoR program to organize and lead the first "SD Undergraduate Research Symposium" at the state capital, Pierre, SD. The annual event has now showcased 250 undergraduate research posters in the first two years, making it one of the largest undergraduate research gatherings in the country.      Broader Impacts   Recruiting Results and Participant Information - The SPACT REU site was successful in recruiting a diverse group of talented and engaged undergraduate researchers. Participants came from 17 different institutions, representing 11 states. The program was successful in recruiting and engaging a diverse group of REU participants, evidenced by 33% and 40% underrepresented minority and female student representation, respectively. Furthermore, 87% of REU participants were from universities with limited STEM research opportunities. The Site had a significant focus on engaging a diverse group of students with respect to educational background. In this regard, 53% of REU participants were first or second year college students. To ensure a beneficial research experience for these students, the PIs have worked with faculty mentors to develop research projects and mentoring activities which allow the students to flourish with...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
