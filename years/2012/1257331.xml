<AbstractNarration>Human existence depends on soil, soil organisms and their processes; these are basic to sustaining environmental systems, agriculture and human well-being.  Microscopic nematodes are a key component to soil systems: they are unmatched in species diversity, often with thousands of individuals in a handful of soil.  Surprisingly, most nematode species remain hidden to science i.e. undiscovered and un-named; their species-specific environmental roles are generally not understood at a level useful to define, understand and sustain healthy ecosystems.   This project will develop new DNA/microscopy technology to implement novel, efficient, cost-saving approaches to nematode species discovery and description, including evolutionary and ecological relationships.  A California desert will be the experimental site for developing these tools, but the application and benefits are global.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dramatically improving nematode identification tools will support soil ecologists and other biologists in the broader goals of understanding biological diversity and soil ecosystems for the benefit of humanity. The impact is broadened by developing online identification aids designed for non-specialists as well as for teaching tools. The project will train a graduate student and several undergraduates. Through small college collaboration it will provide research experience for female minority students.  New instructional tools and training approaches involving soils will be developed for grades 5-12.</AbstractNarration>

Nematodes were obtained from replicate samples of soils representing the root zones of three different common plants (Palo Verde, hummingbird bush, and creosote bush). Nematode samples were characterized by three different methods.

This approach provided a direct link between nematode structure and diagnostic DNA sequences. In the second method DNA sequences were obtained from hundreds of individual nematodes representing each soil sample, which provided information on the relative abundance of the different species.

This makes this high-volume approach less useful for certain ecological or agricultural studies where estimates of the absolute numbers of nematode species are needed (e.g., to predict levels of plant damage by plant-parasitic nematodes). The second method provides a good estimate of species diversity and abundance but is more labor intensive and expensive on a per sample basis. The first method is necessary to know what species names should be associated with a particular DNA sequence, or if new species should be described.
