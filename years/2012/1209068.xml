<AbstractNarration>The overall long-term goal of the Long Island University IT-Catalyst proposal is to create a world-class racially, ethnically, and gender diverse STEM faculty to reflect the diversity of their students.   To prepare to meet this goal they will identify barriers to the hiring, retention, and advancement of STEM women, and especially underrepresented minority STEM women.  Specifically they will collect and assess historical and current quantitative data; conduct surveys and focus group interviews of a comprehensive array of STEM stakeholders on campus; review department and institutional policies and practices; and analyze proven ADVANCE-IT strategies used at other institutions. Overall, this project is expected to provide Long Island University with critical information with which to develop an institutionally targeted plan for transformation, and promote institutional buy-in for such a transformation.   The diverse nature of the institution and the quality of the PI team suggest that this institution?s work will serve as a model for institutional transformation at other similar colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overall, the long-term goal of the Long Island University Brooklyn (LIU-B) IT-Catalyst [Institutional Transformation] project was to create a world-class racially, ethnically, and gender diverse STEM faculty to reflect the diversity of LIU students. Barriers to the hiring, retention, and advancement of STEM women, and especially underrepresented minority STEM women were identified through collection and assessment of historical and current quantitative data dating back 23 years; surveys and focus group interviews of an array of STEM stakeholders on campus; review of department and institutional policies and practices; and analysis of proven ADVANCE-IT strategies used at other institutions.     This project provided Long Island University with critical information with which to develop an institutionally targeted plan for transformation, and promote institutional buy-in for such a transformation. The intellectual merit of the project is that it identified barriers to achieving numerical and status equity not only to the LIU-B STEM women, particularly those from underrepresented groups, but to women across disciplines and faculty from underrepresented groups.  It is anticipated that the project?s broader impact will increase the number and status of faculty women at LIU-B, provide role models for the 71% of LIU-B?s STEM students who are from underrepresented groups, improve the STEM climate for all faculty and students, and assist in having LIU-B?s STEM faculty reflect the diversity of their students.     Decreasing enrollments have led to a continuation of a policy of minimal faculty hiring, a policy in place since 2008.  Of the total LIU-B tenured/tenure track faculty members, approximately 49% are female, and of LIU-B Chairs and Deans, 50% and 43%, respectively, are female. In the physical and life sciences however, 24% of the tenured/tenure track faculty are women, and 16% of the full professors are women; no women are chairs or deans. In the social sciences, 37% of tenured/tenure track faculty are women, and 33% of the full professors are women; two women serve as chairs; none are deans. One woman faculty member in the physical sciences and two in the social and behavioral sciences are from underrepresented minorities.     According to this projects quantitative analysis, a majority of new hires are in selected high priority areas of allied health professions such as nursing, with hiring trends showing the exclusion STEM disciplines in the strategic priority.  A plurality of the new hires has been employed on annual, non-tenure track contracts.  As a result of essential hiring freeze, the ranks of assistant professors declined.  However, the ranks of full professors have remained essentially stagnant while the numbers of associate professors has swelled, indicating an inability of faculty to advance their careers post-tenure.      The Long Island University Brooklyn (LIU-B) IT-Catalyst [Institutional Transformation] project identified issues faced by faculty on the LIU B campus as issues not specific to the STEM departments, or of the female faculty in particular, but issues of the campus as a whole.  Issues continue to include heavy teaching and service workloads that do not leave a great deal of time for scholarly pursuits.  While the need for a more formal mentoring program for those new to teaching, or new to LIU remains, feedback suggested a concern for the lack of commitment and full participation from the faculty, especially female STEM faculty.  For this reason, the LIU-Brooklyn ADVANCE program provided all full time female STEM faculty with personal text resources to address professional development in the areas of dual career, interpersonal skills, networking, grant writing, science writing and publication, laboratory leadership and mentoring, and organizational leadership.  Additionally, workshop and text reference information was shared with executives in the Office of Academic Affairs in an effort to bring more opportunities for faculty and staff professional development to LIU-Brooklyn.   Additionally, in an effort to continue to achieve gender equity and ethnic diversity in STEM at LIU Brooklyn, a Committee of Women Faculty was formed under the new administration that includes all full time female STEM faculty.  This group will continue to receive both formal and informal mentoring to assist with grant writing, scientific writing, and other factors of professional development that disproportionately affect women in STEM.
