<AbstractNarration>With this award the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Jin K. Cha of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University to explore the utility of the titanacyclopropane intermediates (Kulinkovich reagent) in organic synthesis.  Particular emphasis is placed at the generation of metal keto homoenolates from cyclopropanols, along with subsequent cross-coupling reactions.  These routes offer attractive alternatives to existing methods, as high convergency is possible to achieve segment coupling.  Additionally, the requisite reagents are inexpensive and environmentally benign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study involves the development of enabling technology in C-C bond formation for the preparation of useful compounds that can be used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, materials science and biology, and hence has potential for broad scientific impact.  The educational broader impact lies in the training of synthetic chemists expected to contribute to the future workforce in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Alkylation and acylation represent the most fundamental C&ndash;C bond forming reactions.   Particular emphasis is placed at high efficiency and convergence in the development of new alkylation and acylation reactions.  High convergence was made possible by segment coupling (union of two large fragments).  A rapid increase in molecular complexity by virtue of segment coupling (coupling of two large segments) offers advantages over known methods.  In turn, this method allows the modular preparation of organic compounds, some of which display desirable biological activities, from pre-fabricated building blocks.  An important class of the key building blocks is cyclopropanols, and our research group developed a new and stereoselective route to functionalized cyclopropanols.     A convergent approach lends itself to environmentally benign syntheses, which would offer enabling tools in pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industry, and materials science.  Additionally, this project will provide excellent training of coworkers, from undergraduate research participants to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in physical science.     These research projects have provided coworkers with excellent training in organic synthesis &ndash; methodology development, natural product synthesis, and transition metal catalysis.  Also emphasized is asymmetric synthesis, which is important in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry.  When our work was shared regularly during undergraduate organic chemistry courses, talks were well received due to their familiarity with Grignard reagents.  As a result of these talks, several undergraduates became interested in carrying out undergraduate research in organic chemistry.  From a recent honors class, six undergraduate students are currently pursuing undergraduate research in the chemistry department.
