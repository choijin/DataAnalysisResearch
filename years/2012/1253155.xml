<AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting Professor Mi Hee Lim at the University of Michigan to design and synthesize chemical libraries to establish a relationship between structures and interactions with metal-associated amyloid-beta species.  In this research program Professor Lim and her students will determine the structural moieties and scaffolds required for interactions with metal ions, amyloid-beta, and metal-amyloid-beta species.  The research group will synthesize multiple chemical series via systematic structural modifications of small molecules previously demonstrated to interact and react with amyloid-beta or metal-amyloid-beta species.  The interactions of newly prepared molecules with metal ions, amyloid-beta, and metal-amyloid-beta species will be characterized to full chemical resolution using appropriate analytic methods, such as UV-Visible and NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), and X-ray crystallography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research effort will provide insight into the development of chemical tools suitable for investigating the involvement of metal-amyloid-beta species in neurotoxicity leading to neurodegeneration.  Since it is not well understood how the interactions of metal ions with amyloid-beta species could be associated with neurotoxicity, it is necessary to have appropriate chemical tools that can simultaneously target metal-amyloid-beta species and modulate their interactions.  In pursuing this research program, the Lim group will provide opportunities for students from high school through graduate student level to conduct interdisciplinary research in bioinorganic chemistry.  Students with diverse backgrounds who traditionally have not studied this field will not only be taught the concepts of bioinorganic chemistry, but also will be introduced to exciting chemistry research in the laboratory.  Professor Lim will also create professional development opportunities for female scientists (undergraduate to postdoctoral), with special attention to outreach to local companies, dialogue among different levels of female chemists, and continuous communication.  Through these efforts, future female scientists will be encouraged to enhance their involvement in the sciences and pursue their career goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With this CAREER Award supported by the Chemistry of Life Processes program, Professor Lim from the University of Michigan have designed and synthesized three different chemical classes to establish a relationship between structures and interactions with metal-associated amyloid-&szlig; (metal-amyloid-&szlig;) species.  From these chemical classes, the Lim group has demonstrated key structural moieties for multifunctionality, such as metal binding and interactions with amyloid-&szlig; and metal-associated amyloid-&szlig; and a balance between these properties for targeting and reacting with metal-associated amyloid-&szlig;.  This foundation has provided insight into the development of chemical tools suitable for investigating the involvement of metal-amyloid-&szlig; species in neurotoxicity leading to neurodegeneration.  Using the newly developed tools, it will be understood how the interactions of metal ions with amyloid-beta species could be associated with neurotoxicity shown in the brain of AlzheimerÃ†s disease.  Herein, a comprehensive program includes the determination of the structural moieties and scaffolds required for interactions with metal ions, amyloid-&szlig;, and metal-amyloid-&szlig; species.  The Lim group has synthesized three different chemical series via systematically structural modifications of small molecules previously demonstrated to interact and react with amyloid-&szlig; or metal-amyloid-&szlig; species.  The interactions of newly prepared molecules with metal ions, amyloid-&szlig;, and metal-amyloid-&szlig; species were characterized to full chemical resolution by appropriate methods such as UV-Visible and NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), and X-ray crystallography.  In terms of Broader Impacts, the Lim group has provided opportunities for students (high school to graduates) to conduct interdisciplinary research in bioinorganic chemistry.  This has allowed the Lim group to teach concepts of bioinorganic chemistry to students with diverse backgrounds who traditionally have not studied this field, while working to introduce young scientists to the exciting chemistry research in laboratory.
