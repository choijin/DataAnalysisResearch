<AbstractNarration>The PI and the co-PIs are planning to establish a Research Training Group in Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Geometry at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The goal of the project is to increase the proportion of US citizens and permanent residents that will be educated in mathematical research and well prepared to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences. The project includes the mentoring of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The PIs will work to develop a research program for undergraduate majors, as part of their degree program in mathematics.  Series of mini-seminars, learning workshops, and conferences are planned to enhance the research experiences of the postdoctoral researchers and graduate students.  The PIs have planned conferences on the applications of model theory, arithmetic geometry and dynamics, and algebraic geometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fields of algebraic and arithmetic geometry are among the most fundamental, diverse and active areas of research mathematics.  Algebraic and arithmetic geometers study the properties of geometric objects defined by algebraic equations, using tools from algebra, analysis and topology.  Beginning with analytic geometry and elementary properties of numbers, techniques in algebraic and arithmetic geometry have developed into important tools for solutions of outstanding problems in number theory and complex geometry, string theory in mathematical physics, cryptography and computer-aided geometric design.  The goals of the Research Training Group of Algebraic and Arithmetic Geometry at the University of Illinois at Chicago are to recruit, to train and to develop young scientists who are US citizens and permanent residents to become researchers in this very interesting and active area of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
