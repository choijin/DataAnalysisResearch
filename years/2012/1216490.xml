<AbstractNarration>In the proposed project, Universidad Metropolitana and the University of Maryland Baltimore County will conduct a pilot workshop that will bring together noted experts from several communities, including the ADVANCE community, the NSF and gender studies researchers to broaden the professional and mentoring networks of Latina postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty. These institutions have a longstanding partnership in increasing the number of underrepresented minority students who earn the doctoral degree that dates back to 2003. However, since 2007, this partnership has been formalized through a memorandum of understanding that includes a focus on collaborations among faculty at both institutions. It is expected that the pilot workshop will provide a foundation upon which more meaningful and deliberate investigation of Hispanic women in the academic STEM disciplines can be examined. The workshop is characterized by relevant plenary and group breakout sessions that will provide attendees with the opportunity to better define the course of study on Latina STEM faculty and determine pathways to broader and future emphases as it relates to this target population.</AbstractNarration>

Building upon a partnership between UMBC and UMET that started with training undergraduate students for graduate school, and utilizing best practices of UMBC's successful (now institutionalized) ADVANCE Institutional Transformation project for women faculty in the STEM fields, the "ADVANCE Hispanic Women in STEM" project based operations in Puerto Rico to develop conferences and meetings for women STEM faculty, deans, and high-level administrators to bring attention to issues of academic advancement and career-life balance for women STEM faculty.</p> <p>This project included several distinct activities: A Networking Workshop in Puerto Rico (2012), A Climate Survey administered to women STEM faculty in Puerto Rico (2012, 2014), An Outcomes Workshop (2014), and a series of meetings with chancellors, deans, and university administrators (2013, 2014).</p> <p>Workshops I (2012) and II (2014) covered the following topics:</p> <ol> <li>Inequality and Exclusion</li> <li>Negotiation and Power</li> <li>Best Practices from ADVANCE programs</li> <li>Assessing Needs</li> <li>Balancing Work and Family and Health</li> <li>The Jessica Alert (discussions of domestic violence)</li> <li>The Superwoman Syndrome</li> <li>Roundtables to share resources</li> <li>Reports from 2012 Participants on Career Advancement and Work/Life Balance</li> <li>Panel: Academia, Industry, Knowledge Transfer, and Grants &ndash; Ideas, Success Stories, and Potential Strategies</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project was introduced to various stakeholders across Puerto Rico. Formal meetings with university administrators of Puerto Rico took place in three phases: 1) An introduction to ADVANCE &ndash; an agenda item for the Asociaci&oacute;n de Colegios y Universidades Privadas de Puerto Rico (ACUP), 2) Presentation during the October 2013 Conference of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), 3) and presentations in March 2014 as part of the ADVANCE Networking Workshop II (Outcomes). These meetings covered 23 ACUP and 7 UPR institutions.
