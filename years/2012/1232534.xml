<AbstractNarration>Living anthropoid primates - monkeys, apes and humans - have proportionally larger brains than lemurs and lorises (Strepsirrhini). The size differences are concentrated in certain brain regions, including the olfactory bulb, neocortex, and cerebellum. These shifts in size and proportions are often highlighted in discussions of differences in adaptive responses to social and environmental pressures between anthropoids and strepsirrhines. Shifts in brain size and shape also are used to explain some differences in cranial shape among living primates. Most of these comparative analyses, however, are based only on studies of the brain of living primates. Fossil evidence for parallel brain size increase between anthropoid clades provides a valuable opportunity to test developmental and spatial constraints on brain size and cranial organization from both a comparative and historical perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many details of brain size and proportions in extinct primates can be estimated from the size and proportions of endocasts, a cast of the internal braincase. Endocasts are virtually rendered using micro-CT scans of crania. This research, conducted by doctoral student Kari Allen, under supervision by Dr. Richard Kay at Duke University, explores the evolution of brain size, shape, and proportion, and its relationship to cranial form, by examining virtual endocasts of both living and extinct anthropoids to identify trends through geologic time in various primate groups. Three-dimensional geometric techniques are used to characterize global and regional differences in endocast shape that may carry a functional or phylogenetic signal. The reconstructed size and shape of selected regions of the endocasts are used to evaluate the timing of cerebellar, cerebral and frontal lobe expansion and their relationship to aspects of cranial form. The paleontological dataset includes early fossil anthropoids from Africa and South America, and European Eocene basal primates. These new data provide useful information to test adaptive explanations about brain evolution that were developed from comparative studies of living primates.  Undergraduate student training will be incorporated into the research activities, and the archived, freely-available micro-CT scans of living primates will serve as teaching materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Accumulating evidence from the fossil record suggests that large brains evolved in parallel among multiple primate groups. For instance, while anthropoids&mdash;the group including monkeys, apes, and humans&mdash;have large brains for their body mass and increased volume in areas reflecting greater capacity for complex thought (cerebrum) and vision (visual cortex) rather than smell (reduced olfactory bulb size), the earliest known fossil representatives of these primates have much smaller brains than the living species. Thus, fossil taxa are crucial to studies of brain evolution, as they allow us to identify evolutionary trends in relative brain size and brain proportions that may not have been expected based on comparative studies of modern species. Unfortunately, brain tissue does not fossilize, but micro-computed tomography (microCT) technology allows us to extract and visualize the internal surface of the cranial cavity in which the brain resides. The volume and shape of this virtual surface model, or "endocast", closely approximates the size and surface features of the brain, thereby providing a window into the history of brain evolution via well-preserved fossil crania.  This study explored the relationships between adult brain size, brain proportions, and the shape of the skull among sixty-two species of living primates and fossil primates representing early primates (Adapis, Leptadapis, Rooneyia), the earliest representatives of anthropoids (Parapithecus), Old World monkeys, apes, humans (Aegyptopithecus), and New World monkeys (Homunculus, Tremacebus).  The goals of the research were: 1) to provide new data on brain size, body size, and brain shape in the living and fossil primates and to evaluate the correlations among these factors; 2) to determine whether changes in brain size corresponded to changes in brain proportions throughout evolutionary time; and 3) to assess whether differences in total and regional brain size and shape co-vary with differences in the shape of the cranium&mdash;in particular, the size of the facial skeleton and the configuration of the skull base.  We found that endocast shape in primates is the culmination of multiple interwoven factors, including evolutionary relatedness among animals and changes in body size, relative brain size, and brain proportions. Despite a great deal of variability in endocast shape among modern primates, there are significant differences between the endocast shape of anthropoids and other primates (tarsiers and strepsirrhines&mdash;lemurs, lorises, and galagos). Some aspects of which&mdash;such as olfactory fossa position and the shape of the midline curvature of the bony braincase&mdash;reflect differences in relative brain size, while others&mdash;such as the size of the olfactory fossa and position of the posterior cranial fossa relative to the occipital poles&mdash;reflect differences in the relative size of the olfactory and visual systems of the brain, and of the cerebrum as a whole.  Across the fossil sample, analyses of endocast shape indicates that key aspects of anthropoid brain proportions were initiated early in the anthropoid fossil record, prior to marked increases in relative brain size, while further changes occurred in parallel between the South American monkeys and Old World primates (Old World monkeys, apes, and human), prior to additional increases in brain size in the evolutionary history of each of these groups.  Finally, we found weak evidence to suggest that the relative size of the brain and that of the face each correlate with variation in the flexion of the cranial base among modern species of primates; however, relative to modern species, the early fossil anthropoids have more flexed cranial bases and shorter facial skeletons at much smaller relative brain size than seen in modern anthropoids. This suggests the possibility that these anthropoid cranial traits evolved in tandem with changes in the relative size of brain components, rat...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
