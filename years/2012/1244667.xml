<AbstractNarration>This project will strengthen the organizational and technical infrastructure of the Center for Historical Information and Analysis (http://chia.pitt.edu), a multi-institutional collaborative of scholars in social, natural, and information sciences structured as a Research Collaborative and a Headquarters. The Research Collaborative links participating institutions that are collecting data on population, climate, and other topics with a crowdsourcing tool to demonstrate the feasibility of building a continuously growing collection of diverse historical data and metadata. The Headquarters assembles and develops knowledge on repository design to develop a repository sufficient to house the incoming data and permit global and interactive analysis. The Center for Historical Information and Analysis?s future plans include expanding its collection and processing of historical data, broadening its community of social and natural science researchers, analyzing historical patterns of global change, and sharing its resources with researchers, policy-makers, teachers and students. CHIA is headquartered at the University of Pittsburgh with participating research groups at Boston University, Harvard University, Michigan State University, and University of California-Merced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand global social patterns as they exist today, it is increasingly clear that we need to understand how they have evolved over recent centuries. The Center for Historical Information and Analysis responds to this need and takes historical analysis into the realm of Big Data. It is expected that the data resources will grow to several terabytes in size. This project will stimulate development of more efficient research collaborations, enabling systematic large-scale consolidation of diverse historical data sources. Once collected and integrated, the data repository and analytical system will allow scholars to address a wider set of questions testing hypotheses about long-term and short-term social change at the global scale and catalyzing an expansion of the evidence base in social sciences. For example, our understanding of important societal issues can advance by linking health to demography and by incorporating climate and health factors into economic studies. Disciplinary theory will advance through interaction among the various scientific fields, so that a global network of social-science researchers will emerge.</AbstractNarration>

Project Objectives:  The Collaborative for Historical Information and Analysis (CHIA) proposed creation of an infrastructure to ingest, house, and analyze historical data on global society. Work was divided between a Headquarters at the University of Pittsburgh and a Research Collaborative of five institutions.  Deliverable 1: an Expanding Repository. CHIAÆs Headquarters planned to deliver a repository sufficient to house incoming historical data and permit global and interactive analysis. This involved designing and constructing a repository to integrate discrete social-science datasets into larger units, populating it with incoming data, demonstrating the repositoryÆs ability to expand as data submissions increase, and conducting the initial set of global historical analyses.  Deliverable 2: Growing Data Collection. The Research Collaborative planned to create a collaborative team and crowdsourcing application for ingesting data and metadata, collecting and submitting data on population, climate, and other topics; and recruiting users to locate, submit, and document growing quantities of relevant historical data for analysis within the repository.     Accomplishments:  Technical Infrastructure (Deliverable 1), the CHIA team has built an infrastructure for large-scale social-science analysis (see Fig. 1).  Datasets enter through the Submission system, facilitating ingest by crowdsourcing, accompanied by triage and cleaning. Ingested files are filed in the appropriate segment of our Distributed Archive, the framework for comprehensive historical analysis of social-science issues. The archive links five archival resources, especially the public archive hosted on the Harvard Dataverse (upgraded in 2015 to version 4.0 by the team at HarvardÆs Institute for Quantitative Social Science) and also including the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Data Documentation, a complex issue for large-scale historical analysis, relies on standards defined at two levels: Level 1 Documentation (19 basic elements) for the public archive and Level 2 Documentation for integration on our Poirot server. Level 2 gives detailed attention to spatial, temporal, topical, and scalar documentation. Our principal technical emphasis, Data Integration (through the Col*Fusion infrastructure), relies on algorithms for integration (see Fig. 2). Elements of the project have been assembled into a Comprehensive website (chia.pitt.edu), which provides a coherent display of overall CHIA functionality and links; portal to major online datasets.     Data Collection and Documentation (Deliverable 2a), The CHIA Distributed Archive holds a growing quantity of historical datasets, increasingly linked to each other. The Dataverse holds some 70 CHIA datasets on a wide range of historical processes. Worldwide datasets address socio-economic inequality, aspects of colonialism, and 20th-century linkages of population, climate, and politics. Regional datasets include U.S. data linking disease, population, and climate; African historical population and migration; and Asian data on the 1918 influenza pandemic. The crowdsourcing mentality appears to be taking hold, in that several established scholars have opened discussions on having CHIA serve as a host for their datasets and projects.     Collaborative Infrastructure (Deliverable 2b):  CHIAÆs Research Collaborative, including all project participants, emphasized close cooperation among work teams. The "scenario" meetings, integrating social-science theory and information-science algorithms, generated a plan for large-scale simulation of missing data on inequality. The Data Hoover group published survey results and clarified techniques for encouraging submission of datasets. The Headquarters operation, governed by the Steer...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
