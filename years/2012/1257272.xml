<AbstractNarration>Many studies have shown that novice performers in demanding tasks (e.g., driving, carpentry, typing) are conscious of each step, attending to the details one by one. On the other hand, skilled performers are only conscious of high-level goals, leaving the details to lower-level processes (hierarchical control). These studies leave an important question unanswered: How does this hierarchical control emerge with practice? How do experts develop lower-level control processes that take care of the details? The proposed research focuses on skilled typewriting, where associative learning causes all the keystrokes in a word to be activated in the motor system at the same time, so the motor system must decide when to make each keystroke. Novice typists activate one keystroke at a time, using higher-level processes to control serial order. As typists acquire skill, words are associated with each of their constituent keystrokes, so the presentation of a word activates all of its keystrokes at once, forcing the motor system to control serial order. This creates a lower-level control process that produces keystrokes, which is distinct from the higher-level control process that produces words to be typed, resulting in hierarchical control. The proposed research will test this proposition in four projects in which the investigators will present typists with novel types of keyboards and tasks, and examine learning over many sessions. They will measure the emergence of hierarchical control in terms of parallel activation and the conscious awareness of the details of the task. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will have an important impact on basic and applied research. Typing has now become a ubiquitous activity in modern life, and understanding the science behind the skill will have a broad impact on education as our workforce ramps up for the 21st century. The proposed research may also provide new criteria for evaluating successful training in other areas requiring expertise, going beyond simple tests of speed and accuracy to more sophisticated tests for the emergence of hierarchical control. More generally, the projects will promote new connections between research on cognitive control and research on motor control, since both are required in typewriting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit in the proposed research stems from its goals to develop a deeper understanding of hierarchical control of thought and action by focusing on the development of skilled typewriting.  Hierarchical control is important in theory and practice because it frees us from thinking through details and allows us to think loftier thoughts. Hierarchical control is a familiar experience in everyday life.  People accomplish tasks entailing several steps by thinking of the overall goal and not thinking about the individual steps.  We tie our shoelaces without thinking of what our fingers are doing.  We drive to work without thinking about how we stop and start and maintain our position in the lane.  Our research has shown similar ignorance of the details in skilled typists.  They have no explicit knowledge of the locations of half of the keys on the keyboard, and they have little explicit knowledge of which hand or finger types which key.     The proposed research addressed questions of hierarchical control in skilled typists.  Some experiments addressed how hierarchical control is acquired by having skilled typists type nonwords like bljdt.  Nonwords push skilled typists back on the learning curve by removing the associations and "muscle memories" that support automatic typing of familiar words.  Typists learn to type these nonwords automatically with sufficient practice.  Our experiments have documented the time course of learning, testing hypotheses about what typists learn by training them on some nonwords and transferring them to others with specific properties.  These experiments show that typists learn to treat an unfamiliar nonword as a single unit, like a word, and that typists learn associations between pairs or groups of letters in the nonword.  Other experiments in this series documented a shift from control from short term memory to long term memory as typists acquired skill with nonwords and discovered the conditions necessary to produce it.  Another line of experiments documented the properties of hierarchical control, investigating the speed-accuracy tradeoff, dual task interference, and error detection and correction.    The proposed research has had broader impact on research topics outside the domain of skilled typing, on community outreach, and on training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in STEM research.  Issues of hierarchical control are important in many serial skills from playing music to flying airplanes.  The principles and results we find with typewriting address central issues and shape theories and experiments in those areas.  Typing is important in applied psychology.  We have addressed issues of learning, comparing typists who use nonstandard methods (fewer fingers inconsistently) with standard typists who follow the classical method.  We found that nonstandard typists typed as efficiently as standard typists and showed the same degree of hierarchical control, which suggests that remedial training on standard methods may not be very beneficial.  We published a paper in Journal of Hand Surgery in which we addressed the recovery of typing skill following carpal tunnel surgery, providing data for evidence-based recommendations about when to return to work.  The PI has given talks on cognitive control to departments of psychiatry at Vanderbilt and at the Hospital for Sick Children in Canada, to Supreme Court judges in Tennessee, and to the Vanderbilt LifeFlight air rescue group.  The PI has given many colloquia in psychology departments in the US and Europe during the grant period.  The proposed research has engaged undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in STEM research, teaching them the skills required for a scientific career in psychology or neuroscience.  The emphasis of the proposed research on computational and mathematical modeling requires students to learn to reason quantitatively and apply sophisticated methods.  These skills will prove as valuable outside the university as inside it.             Last Modified: 11/24/2017       Submitted by: Gordon Logan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
