<AbstractNarration>Urban, suburban and exurban environments are important ecosystems and their extent is increasing in the U.S.  The conversion of wild or managed ecosystems to urban ecosystems is resulting in ecosystem homogenization across cities, where neighborhoods in very different parts of the country have similar patterns of roads, residential lots, commercial areas and aquatic features.  Funds are provided to test the hypothesis that this homogenization alters ecological structure and functions relevant to ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics, with continental scale implications.  The research will provide a framework for understanding the impacts of urban land use change from local to continental scales.  The research encompasses datasets ranging from household surveys to regional-scale remote sensing across six metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) that cover the major climatic regions of the US (Phoenix, AZ, Miami, FL, Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, St. Paul, MN and Los Angeles, CA) to determine how household characteristics correlate with landscaping decisions, land management practices and ecological structure and functions at local, regional and continental scales.  This research will transform scientific understanding of an important and increasingly common ecosystem type (?suburbia?) and the consequences to carbon storage and nitrogen pollution at multiple scales. In addition, it will advance understanding of how humans perceive, value and manage their surroundings. The award will leverage an extensive, multi-scale program of education and outreach associated with ongoing LTER and/or ULTRA-EX projects. Activities include K-12 education and outreach to community groups, city/regional planners, natural history museums, state and local agencies and non-governmental organizations. Graduate students will participate in a Distributed Graduate Seminar in Sustainability Science (DGSS) initiated by NCEAS and the University of Minnesota Institute on Environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Urban, suburban and exurban ecosystems present a unique and difficult challenge to environmental scientists and managers. These highly managed systems have large impacts on air and water quality and human well being. The diversity of natural and human drivers and high heterogeneity at small scales (10 &ndash; 100 m) complicate their analysis and management, and require conceptual and practical tools to understand the complex social and ecological controls on the heterogeneity of increasingly important urban, suburban and exurban ecosystems.    An apparent, but functionally untested result of contemporary U.S. urban land use change is ecological homogenization across cities, meaning that similar infrastructure and land-management practices render urban/suburban systems more similar to each other than to adjacent native ecosystems. This homogenization would result in ecological transformation at the scale of individual parcels, with replacement of natural vegetation assemblages by turfgrass yards, popular plant species, and impervious surfaces, and at broader scales of entire urban landscapes. In this project, we are testing the overarching hypothesis that similar management practices among cities leads to homogenization in ecological structure and functions. Further, we developed the conceptual basis, database and methodologies for evaluating this hypothesis across a wide range of biophysical variables such as soil, vegetation, and microclimate; linked these outcomes to social, psychological, and economic characteristics of residents; and provide a framework for translating the impacts of urban land use change from local to continental scales.  We are addressing our questions and hypotheses across six metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that cover the major climatic regions of the U.S.: Phoenix, AZ, Miami, FL, Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, St. Paul, MN and Los Angeles, CA. At the household/parcel scale, we coupled homeowner surveys with intensive biophysical measurements to determine how land-management practices influence ecological structure and function. We compiled high resolution (&le;1.0m pixels) remotely sensed and socio-demographic data to assess the extent, spatial distribution and quality of lawns and other cover types at the parcel and neighborhood levels. These data were used to link social decisions and preferences with ecological patterns and processes at broader (MSA) geographic scales. The research has the potential to transform both our understanding of an important and increasingly common ecosystem type ("suburbia") and our ability to scale the effects of local (i.e., parcel-level) land use change to regional and continental extents.  The primary finding of this award is documentation of the major shifts in the distribution of surface water that accompany urbanization.  On average, cities have much less surface water than their surroundings, but in the driest cities, the opposite is true.  This pattern strengthens as we consider more intensive urban development within the urban core.  The result is that urban lands have a characteristic amount of surface water, regardless of their geologic and climatic setting.  These changes are also manifest in the characteristics of individual water bodies, which tend to be less variable in size than in undeveloped parts of the landscape.  These findings have implications for conservation of urban aquatic habitat, for urban climate, and for urban water quality.  Our analysis of surface water distributions is consistent with results from other biophysical variables (soil, vegetation, microclimate) at the scale of individual parcels. All of these variables exhibit varying degrees of homogenization across our study cities.    One key contribution of this study is to link these ecological changes to attitudes, behaviors, and satisfaction.  We found that some lawn management behaviors vary primarily among cities, while others vary among socio-economic status and local population density.  This variability in behaviors and attitudes, in turn, responds to broader ecological conditions in a way the produces the observed homogenization of biophysical characteristics of the urban landscapes.
