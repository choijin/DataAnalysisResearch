<AbstractNarration>This project is developing innovative learning materials based on real-life problems that students may encounter in their engineering careers. Incorporating service systems into existing engineering curricula promotes students' critical thinking and scientific understanding of complex systems. In-class and out-of-class interventions such as case-based learning, project-based learning, field trips, student presentations, teamwork, and guest lectures are being developed to show students how engineering is applied to help people. This work is building on the fundamental premise that if students (especially women) could envision themselves applying engineering knowledge to helping people (as their career path), it will build their confidence and they will be more likely to complete their degrees.  The materials are being designed to be gender inclusive and positively impact all students by developing diverse perspectives and emphasizing collaboration. In addition to broadening participation of women in engineering, this project is aiding the service sector of industry by supplying better-trained engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of Project IDEAL -   Increasing Diversity in Engineering education And the Labor force - was to develop innovative pedagogical interventions focused on healthcare applications to engage and motivate students, particularly females, to complete their engineering degree and join the engineering workforce after graduation.  It also aimed to create awareness of the many challenges and opportunities within healthcare engineering.  In-class and out-of-class interventions related to healthcare were designed and implemented.  For in-class interventions, a new course titled Healthcare Systems Engineering was created and offered.  Also, multiple active learning interventions were constructed and integrated into three existing engineering undergraduate courses.  Out-of class interventions consisted of workshops, seminar series, and school visits to showcase the work and experiences of professionals in healthcare systems engineering.  For each of the activities developed, survey questionnaires were administered to participants and statistically analyzed to measure their effectiveness.  The interventions were proven to serve as excellent motivational materials, impacting retention of both female and male students. Most students had a very positive perception of the various activities created and reported to not only be more aware of the role of engineers in the healthcare field but to be better equipped to effectively contribute to their solution. Also, statistics showed a significant increase in the number of students interested in pursuing a job or internship in a healthcare-engineering related field.  Overall, by showing the connection between engineering and healthcare, many students were motivated to complete their engineering degree.  In particular, the seminar series, which showcased successful profession engineers in healthcare environments, proven to be an effective vehicle to encourage students, especially women, to remain in engineering and join the engineering workforce.  Similarly, active learning materials incorporated in both the new course and core courses in industrial engineering, allowed students to better conceptualize realistic challenges within healthcare systems engineering.
