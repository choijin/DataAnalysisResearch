<AbstractNarration>Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation Divisions of Materials Research and Chemistry along with the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities will provide funds to support the participation of US students and US faculty at 2012 Gordon Conference entitled "Scientific Methods in Cultural Heritage Research: Non-Destructive Imaging and Micro-Analysis in Cultural Heritage" that will take place at Mount Snow Resort, VT, from July 29 to August 3, 2012. Thirty-eight leading researchers from museums, art conservation research centers, universities, and national laboratories, from the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico, Israel, China and Japan will be on the program of the conference as discussion leaders and speakers.  The conference will foster dialogue between those pushing the boundaries on methods and instrumentation and researchers in cultural heritage.&lt;br/&gt;Nine session topics will be covered: (1) Complex materials: case studies from the Old and the New World, (2) Structures at the Nanoscale, (3)Hard X-Rays: from Large Scale Facilities to Tabletop Sources, (4) Structures at the Microscale I: The Role of Spectroscopy, (5) Structures at the Macroscale, (6) Structures at the Microscale II: From Bio-Organic Heritage to Modern Art, (7) Lasers: from Molecules to Macrostructure, (8) Imaging and Depth Profiling, and (9) Interdisciplinary Investigations in Archaeology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation Divisions of Materials Research and Chemistry along with the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities will provide funds to support the participation of US students and US faculty at 2012 Gordon Conference entitled "Scientific Methods in Cultural Heritage Research: Non-Destructive Imaging and Micro-Analysis in Cultural Heritage"  The conference will foster dialogue between those pushing the boundaries on methods and instrumentation and researchers in cultural heritage.&lt;br/&gt;Nine session topics will be covered:  (1) Complex materials: case studies from the Old and the New World, (2) Structures at the Nanoscale, (3)Hard X-Rays: from Large Scale Facilities to Tabletop Sources, (4) Structures at the Microscale I: The Role of Spectroscopy, (5) Structures at the Macroscale, (6) Structures at the Microscale II: From Bio-Organic Heritage to Modern Art, (7) Lasers: from Molecules to Macrostructure, (8) Imaging and Depth Profiling, and (9) Interdisciplinary Investigations in Archaeology</AbstractNarration>

In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.          Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
