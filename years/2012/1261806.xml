<AbstractNarration>Interest in entrepreneurship and technology commercialization within U.S. colleges and universities has grown in recent years, especially as related to scientific and technological discoveries. Higher education institutions have developed numerous programs and infrastructure to help faculty explore and realize the potential commercialization of their research. The National Science Foundation (NSF) and other federal programs along with private foundations and nonprofit organizations have supported efforts that strengthen the higher education entrepreneurial ecosystem and increasing commercialization of research. The US government invests $148 billion annually in basic research, more than any other country. While significant successes have resulted from this investment, a much greater opportunity exists to fully capitalize on this investment for the benefit of society. For university research to achieve greater impact, academic researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics need opportunities to learn how to evaluate whether their research discoveries have potential for commercialization.  For this reason, many organizations and universities have developed programs designed to accelerate the commercialization of university research. The proposed summit will bring together university leaders and researchers who seek to strengthen entrepreneurial ecosystems on their respective campuses and in the broader community. The meeting will provide opportunities for these faculty and institutional leaders to learn more about emerging programs and new resources that can help advance their institutional goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summit participants will have the opportunity to learn about relevant services, resources and programs such as I-Corps, SBIR and PFI through discussion of successful program models that have emerged from these programs. NCIIA and the conference presenters will share the results of research on university technology entrepreneurship, and engage participants in discussion about how to develop new programming that supports the commercialization of funded research. Participants will be provided information about funding, training and networking opportunities and have the opportunity to discuss emerging needs and approaches to addressing them. Both the emerging needs and the solutions that emerge from these discussions will be captured and summarized in a white paper and video for dissemination. The summit is designed to increase participation in programs and networks supporting entrepreneurship education and commercialization. This will, in turn, increase the likelihood that commercializable research will emerge from U.S. colleges and universities, ideally leading to commercialization through translation and the creation of new ventures that evolve into viable businesses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In partnership with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, the University of Maryland, College Park, and The George Washington University, NCIIA convened a one-day workshop entitled, University Innovation Summit (UIS). The purpose of the Summit was to engage and inform the U.S. higher education community about technology commercialization and education programs, and how they can connect with other NCIIA and local entrepreneurship programs on their campuses.  The Summit brought together 95 faculty and institutional leaders from 64 colleges and universities in 28 states seeking to strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystems on their respective campuses and the broader community. The agenda provided opportunities for participants to learn more about emerging programs and new resources that can help advance institutional goals. Participants focused on the broad range of instruction, support resources and mentoring which I-Corps, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), and Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) provide to support university innovation and entrepreneurship, and identified successful projects and curriculum models that have emerged from these programs. Collaboration among participants achieved the objective of a highly productive meeting that produced useful ideas to inform NSF, NCIIA, and the participating institutions.  Coming out of the University Innovation Summit, participants from diverse academic institutions across the U.S. committed to:  Establishing an ecosystem for interdisciplinary collaborations that promote innovations to solve pressing global challenges. Developing a mentor network and mentor programs to reach and serve universities located in more remote geographic areas and/or that may not identify as "top-tier" institutions. Identifying and implementing strategies for retaining strong ties between engineering and design faculty who may move away from the university into industry, so that individuals professionally engaged outside academia continue to teach and train students working to commercialize and scale their research. Working with other universities to secure an I-Corps Node grant for senior design projects and start-ups. Identifying strategies for developing an entrepreneurial "mindset" among faculty and a team mentality across disciplines.   In the 24 months since the November 2012 convening of the University Innovation Summit, the national network of mentors and leaders -- from both academia and industry -- that the UIS participants envisioned has come to fruition. Beginning with the formational event made possible under this grant, there now exists a national network of 7 regional Nodes and 13 local Sites that scale and refine the vision and objectives of I-Corps; connect and engage stakeholders with each other; nurture network stewards/leaders; and enable Nodes and Sites to pilot strategies and work together. The network that has grown out of the University Innovation Summit extends the reach of I-Corps and leverages the community it has developed among people and organizations to create, use, and sustain an innovation ecosystem that enhances the development of technologies, products and processes to grow the U.S. economy and benefit society.
