<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the summer of 2012 Washington University in St. Louis convened the Principal Investigator meeting of the NSF/NIH Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) community.  We did so as a service to the community; all awardees are expected to attend a PI meeting, to present recent results and to network with peers.  We hosted the meeting in the spirit of carrying out this mandate, with a special emphasis on bringing together researchers less familiar with each other to bounce ideas and build new, integrative perspectives and challenges.     We invited current and past awardees; dignitaries in neuroscience and related fields to provide novel input; and program officers from NSF and NIH.  We held a plenary session in which scientists shared their most recent work, eliciting feedback from the community.  We held explicit sessions for networking, including a poster session and a discussion of upcoming challenges and opportunities for the field.  The meeting drew 100 scientists, featured 29 platform presentations, 42 poster presentations, and a large discussion, led by senior scientists and officers from NSF and NIH, on the future and challenges in integrative neuroscience, best leveraging computational approaches and collaboration.  Attendees, including program officers, deemed the meeting a success in its forum for sharing results, sharpening ideas, and planning our next frontiers as a computational, collaborative brain science community.
