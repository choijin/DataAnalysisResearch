<AbstractNarration>The continuing underrepresentation of women, Blacks and Hispanics in science and engineering occupations impedes efforts to increase the size of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce, a concern for policy makers who view science and scientists as critical to the future of the U.S. economy. Existing research shows that one factor contributing to this underrepresentation is that gains in women's, Blacks' and Hispanics' representation among STEM college majors do not necessarily translate into equal gains in STEM employment. Additionally, women, Blacks, and Hispanics remain far less likely than White or Asian men to be employed in most STEM occupations, particularly outside the life sciences.  But little existing research studies trends over time in gender and race-ethnic differences in STEM employment or factors underlying these patterns.  The proposed project will use seven waves of the National Science Foundation's (NSF's) Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) to study gender and race-ethnic differences in employment in STEM occupations among college graduates who hold a STEM degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Government spending to educate and train STEM workers is considerable, reaching nearly 900 million by NSF in 2011 (American Institute of Physics, 2010). These investments and the need to increase the numbers of women and underrepresented minority scientists to maintain the future health of the STEM workforce (Burke, 2007; National Science Board, 2010) make retention of STEM workers in related occupations a critical policy issue. This project will enhance the ability of public- and private sector policy makers and program directors to develop and implement practices that encourage the retention of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM occupations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project had three goals: (1) To document the extent to which demographic and educational characteristics explained gender and race differences in STEM earnings and employment; (2) To determine if STEM fields where women are better represented numerically and proportionally reduces the gender wage gap, and if that association varies as women's representation in the field increases; and (3) To explore the factors shaping cohort variation in retention in STEM employment, and how race, ethnicity, and nativity contribute to the gender gap in occupational representation in the two fields that account for the largest share of STEM workers but the smallest representation of women -- computer science, and engineering.  Despite sizable increases in the lieklihood that American women graduate with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, women's representation in the STEM workforce lags behind their educational gains.  Women who major in STEM fields are less likely than their male counterparts to enter STEM occupations or remain in them.  Our project set out to explore why these disparities persist, using data from seven waves of the National Science Foundation's (NSF's) Scientsts and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT).  We focused on understanding whether the gender wage gap persisted among STEM graduates working in STEM occupations, as well as how gender and race/ethnic differences emerged in STEM employment across cohorts.  Because the emphasis on STEM training is largely focused on increasing the presence of women in the pipeline, there is a presumption that as more women complete degrees in STEM fields and obtain jobs in STEM occupations that the gender wage gap in these fields will narrow, as newer cohorts of women engage in employment behaviors that are more like their male counterparts, and as women move into managerial and leadership roles within STEM organizations.  We did find that in most STEM fields the representation of women has increased, and that the gender wage gap has decreased, particularly among recent cohorts.  Furthermore, more recent cohorts of STEM graduates are increasingly diverce, racially and ethnically, though much of this is due to the influx of Asian men and women into STEM fields rather than a sizable growth in black or Hispanic STEM graduates or employees.  In fields with a greater representaion of women (the life and physical sciences), the gender wage gap can largely be explained by differences in observed characteristics between men and women working in those fields (such as work experience, measured by years since college graduation, or the highest degree received, as well as family status).  That was not, however, a uniform finding across all STEM fields.  The growth in female representation in engineering has been slow, and female representation in comptuer science among more recent cohorts is below what it was in the1980s.  In the fields with the lowest concentration of women (computer science and engineering), gender wage gaps persist even after controlling for observed characteristics.  Furthermore, we observe a sliht decline in wages in computer science once women mkae up a significant share of the workforce.  We also explored the factors associated with employment in STEM occupations among those who graduated with degrees in engineering and comptuer science.  The gender gap in employment has narrowed across cohorts for those with engineering degrees; among computer science degree holders, in contrast, the gender gap in STEM employment has increased among more recent cohorts.  In other words, even if they obtain degrees in computer science, such women are less likely among more recent cohorts to work in STEM fields than their male counterparts with computer science degrees, and that gap has widened among more recent graduates.  Observed characteristics largely explain remaining gender gaps among engineering graduates, but not for those who obtained degrees in computer science.  Our findings highlight the need to better understand the factors associated with retention of women in computer science occupations, as well as the factors that serve to deter women fromm entering into or remaining in fields for which they trained.
