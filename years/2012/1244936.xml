<AbstractNarration>The project connects a core curriculum science course taught in the Earth and Environmental Science department entitled, Science for Future Legislators, with the public through the growing of hydroponic food, air quality data collection using data eggs, and the use of touch foil technologies. Partnering with local businesses and libraries, the project team places touch foils on windows to engage the general public in understanding air quality data and the impact of land cover use and changes in air quality.  A touch foil is a thin film that can be placed on any glass surface, for example a storefront window, which transforms that window into a large interactive touch surface (in essence transforming the window in a giant iPad). Using this guerilla science approach affords the general public the opportunity to learn about science in places where they would not expect to see science. The goal is to provide access to scientific data and analyses that are understandable and of interest to the general public in a way that does not require a visit to a museum or similar institution but in a place where the public takes a regular walk, visits, or spends their time. The project also engages non-science majors in growing produce hydroponically and learning how to conduct scientific research to investigate processes that maximize production.  The produce is sold at a local market to help sustain the program and to help the community have access to fresh, healthy, and local food.</AbstractNarration>

Broader ImpactThe number of non-science majors far outnumbers science majors at most universities, yet most research-based courses that have been developed has focused on STEM majors. However, non-science majors tend to have lower levels of science self-efficacy and lack skills regarding the scientific research process, yet often find themselves in need such skills (Laursen, Hunter, Seymour, Thiry, &amp; Mellon, 2010). For example, more and more non-science careers are requiring scientific thinking and problem solving skills and more and more professions require the sorting of large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends (National Research Council, 2007, 2010).

Our proposed work has a natural control group and satisfies the requirements put forth by Ruiz-Primo and colleagues for additional research and development that needs to be done to truly determine if innovations are improving student understanding of science.   Impacts  One of the goals of this project was to examine students ability to engage in scientific inquiry. College majors differed with respect to Scientific self-efficacy [F(2, 89) = 14.928, p &lt; .0005]; business majors scored statistically significantly lower than education majors [4.36 v=5.870, t(74) = 10.440, p &lt; .0005], and also statistically significantly lower than other majors [??= 5.942, t(65) = 8.948, p &lt; .0005].  This fact was particularly interesting given that one of the goals of the course was to support education majors in improving their perceptions toward their ability to do scientific inquiry.The results suggest that the combination of a data-driven and open-ended inquiry projects impact students? perceptions and their interest in ways that depend on their comfort level with science and major. This suggests that a course that is designed around both types of scientific inquiry may maximize the positive outcomes.
