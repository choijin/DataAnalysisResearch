<AbstractNarration>University of Hawaii proposes to support technical services on R/V Kilo Moana (KM), a 185? general purpose research vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The proposal requests support for basic services and specialized services.  For basic services, they will provide two shipboard technicians on each cruise on R/V Kilo Moana to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The Institution also supports some operations on the R/V Ka`imikai O Kanaloa (KOK), which is not a UNOLS vessel, but does support some federally sponsored research, including some for NSF.  As specialized services, they offer two towed seafloor mapping systems (HAWAII MR1 and IMI-30) for shallow- or deep-towed imaging and bathymetry, and they provide services to evaluate the quality of data from acoustic current profilers installed on UNOLS vessels as well as continue to support a flee-wide ADCP standardization and quality control oversight program.  The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A modern research vessel requires an extensive suite of scientific equipment to support investigations at sea.  Aboard the R/V Kilo Moana, typical investigations include seabed mapping with multibeam sonars to understand geologic structures; deploying sensors that measure fundamental properties of sea water, water quality and biological activity as a function of depth from the surface to near the sea bed; acoustically derived ocean currents as a function of depth; collection of biological and geological samples and video and still-camera images using remotely-operated vehicles (ROV) that operate beneath the ship in depths of up to 6,000 m.  The R/V Ka`imikai-O-Kanaloa conducts similar investigations but instead of an ROV, this ship deploys two submersibles to allow a team of three scientists and pilots to descend to depths of up to 2,000 m.  This grant provided funds from 2012 through 2018 to maintain and operate shared-use scientific equipment aboard these two ships, including salary support for University of Hawaii?s (UH) marine technicians that that support NSF-funded research cruises and funds to maintain and repair the equipment.  The University of Hawaii also has expertise in the operation of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) sonars and in the interpretation of the resulting data.  As such, UH was funded to provide software and expertise about shipboard ADCP installations.  This support included evaluation, operation, and data processing aboard UNOLS, Office of Polar Programs and Coast Guard research vessels and to scientists, students, and technicians working with those ships.  During this reporting period, UH provided support aboard the research vessels Atlantic Explorer, Atlantis, Blue Heron, Endeavor, L.M. Gould, Healy, Hugh Sharp, Kilo Moana, Ka`imikai-O-Kanaloa, Marcus Langseth, Neil Armstrong, Oceanus, N.B. Palmer, Pelican, Revelle, Sally Ride, Savannah, Sikuliaq, Sproul, Thompson and Walton Smith.  UH scientists and technicians installed and maintained software aboard those ships to control and monitor their ADCP sonars, logging the resulting data, performing automated data processing and daily monitoring of the resulting data for purposes of quality control.
