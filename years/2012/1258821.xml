<AbstractNarration>The promise of biomass-derived transportation fuels and specialty chemicals is based&lt;br/&gt;on the premise that complex organic molecules in readily available biomass can be converted via a biochemical or thermochemical platform into much simpler molecular building blocks. However, the reality is that biochemical routes are not yet competitive in the commercial markets, while conventional thermochemical routes such as pyrolysis currently produce a low-quality, highly oxygenated bio-oil that is unstable due to the presence of reactive molecules and high acidity. In order to develop advanced biofuels and specialty chemicals, the pyrolysis oil needs to be upgraded and stabilized, usually employing high temperature and pressure reactors containing various catalyst beds. In the upgrading process, the unstable molecules have a great tendency to re-polymerize into higher molecular weight compounds, leading to catalyst instability and operational problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Dorin Boldor of Louisiana State University will test the hypothesis that a microwave heating system of high energy density with a well-controlled electromagnetic field distribution, when coupled with the proper upgrading catalyst choice can significantly increase the reaction rates and increase the catalyst usable lifetime by direct volumetric heating of the catalyst bed and therefore producing a bio-oil of superior quality compared to that obtained in conventional heating systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the development of a sustainable, renewable and reliable source of energy for our society, it is highly desirable to demonstrate a biomass process platform to produce a transportation fuel. The proposed research, if successful, achieves this goal by demonstrating a transformative technology for bio-oil upgrading, which can increase the lifetime of the catalysts and reduce operational costs.This is an EAGER topic in that there is no data to indicate this proposed plan will be successful. The microwave technology may have little impact on rates or on upgrading. It is conceivable that repolymerization is accelerated with greater catalyst instability. The successful completion of this research project will allow Boldor to acquire data in order to prove or disprove the likelihood of success. This data would then form the foundation of a further research program to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms behind the increased process performance at the gas-solid interface in the presence of microwave fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train a current PhD student in the PI?s lab from an underrepresented group. She will gain and master skills critically needed in the competitive labor market of the 21st century. To further increase the impact of the research, the knowledge developed will be incorporated in the ?Biofuels and Bioproducts from Renewable Resources? course taught by the PI, which includes a Service-Learning component in which students demonstrate projects developed in class (one of which is production of bio-oil via pyrolysis) to students enrolled in middle and high school science courses.</AbstractNarration>
