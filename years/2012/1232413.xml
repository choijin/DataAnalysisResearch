<AbstractNarration>Oxygen levels in the ocean are expected to decrease as global warming progresses, with potentially serious implications for marine life. To forecast future changes in ocean oxygen levels, a better understanding is needed of deoxygenation associated with past warming events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, a collaboration between researchers at Syracuse and Yale Universities, will use iodine in benthic foraminiferal tests as a novel proxy for past oxygenation conditions. The research is motivated by the a close relationship between redox conditions and iodate (IO3-) concentrations in seawater, which affect I/Ca values in foraminiferal tests. The project will expand upon preliminary work in order to better calibrate the iodine proxy, then apply it to a study of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a warming event that occurred ~55 million years ago. The researchers will reconstruct temporal, bathymetric, and geographic variations in ocean oxygenation during the PETM, using benthic foraminifera in cores collected by the Ocean Drilling Program from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean basins, as well as land sections from the Mediterranean, eastern U.S., and New Zealand. In addition, they will examine the link between deoxygenation and benthic extinctions, and consider patterns of hypoxia/anoxia to assess which factors (e.g., temperature, productivity, circulation, local methane oxidation) most influenced the development of low oxygen conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will collaborate internationally on proxy refinement with institutions in Germany (GEOMAR) and the UK (Oxford), and will engage policy makers through venues like the Yale Climate and Energy Institute. Funding will support an early-career investigator; additionally, the project will train one PhD, one MS, and two undergraduate students. The project will involve underrepresented high school students through EVOLUTIONS, an NSF-funded after-school program at the Peabody Museum (Yale).  Results will be incorporated into university coursework and exhibits targeted at undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

The use of Iodine in Foraminifera as a proxy for ocean deoxygenation during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum  We expect the world to continue to warm in the near future. Global warming has many, direct and indirect, complex consequences, and one of the expected consequences is a decrease in oxygen levels in the oceans, which may have unpleasant consequences for ocean life, including animals which we fish or cultivate. It is, however, not very easy to predict the geographic and depth extent of low oxygen waters, and the severity of oxygen loss. We proposed to study the geographic and depth extent of low oxygen conditions during periods of global warm climate and climate warming in the geological past (~60-40 millions years ago), a time when there were no or only very small polar ice sheets.  In order to reconstruct oxygen levels in ocean water in the past, we need some property in the sediment record or in fossils that we can measure today, which will provides information on the conditions at the time that the sediment accumulated and the fossil were forming their shells. We used the ratio of the element Iodine to that of Calcium (I/Ca) in the fossil shells (calcite - CaCO3) of microscopic, unicellular organisms that live floating in the water column (plankton), and their relatives that live on the sea floor, on top or in the sediment. If there is much oxygen around, the Iodine is in the form of Iodate (IO3-) which can be incorporated in calcite, and if there is not much oxygen the Iodine is in the form of Iodide, which can not be incorporated. Higher values for I/Ca thus indicate higher oxygen levels in the water where the organisms were forming there shells.  There are, of course, many complexities in the development of such a proxy for past ocean conditions, depending upon the way in which the organism make its shell (vital effects) and possible effects on the shell composition while planktonic organisms fall to the seafloor (partial dissolution), and changes in composition which happened in the millions of years after it formed (diagenesis). In addition, the organisms may be affected by environmental changes, suffer extinction, and not form their shells at all. In order to evaluate our data, we thus need to combine measurements with climate and earth system modeling, and for bottom-dwelling organisms compare our data to these derived from other proxies.  Despite the complexities, we were able to document (in articles in peer-reviewed journals) that Oxygen Minimum Zones in the oceans, which exist in the water column at depths of several hundreds to a bit over 1000m, expanded during periods of past global warming, both vertically and geographically. Due to an important extinction of bottom-dwelling organisms during en episode of past global warming, we were not able to precisely document what happened to bottom waters and pore waters in the sediments during short-term warming, but we were able to document that during warm periods in earth history the deep oceans were generally less oxygenated than they are today. We also found indications that iodine in the oceans had a higher concentration in the past, which must be further investigated to establish the behavior of iodine in the oceans over longer time periods (millions of years). We noted that there are differences in modeled oxygen values in climate models (CCSM3) and earth system models (cGENIE), with some model results being in reasonable agreement with our data, but indicating that more research is needed to validate modeling results and integrate model results and data.  As a side-effect of the research on this project, I serendipitously happened to note the occurrence of an unusual manganese-containing mineral (jianshuiite) in sediments deposited during global warming (resulting in a publication with colleagues who were able to study the mineral in detail), and the occurrence of this mineral could document transient declines in acidity and oxygen levels.   Our education-outreach program in collaboration with personnel at the Yale Peabody Museum reached groups of high school students who succeeded in building a small exhibit explaining our research to the broader public visiting the museum.
