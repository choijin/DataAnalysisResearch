<AbstractNarration>1250524&lt;br/&gt;Kaunas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF CBET Grantee Conference provides the opportunity for building more effective and collaborative relationships amongst the community of CBET grantees and Program Directors. The conference is designed to enable awardees to share their technical achievements with NSF Program Directors and also to learn about current (and/or new) NSF/CBET programs, practices, and supplemental funding mechanisms. CBET Program and Cluster-specific sessions will also facilitate discussions amongst these smaller communities to address topics of specific interest. The conference agenda will provide multiple outlets for networking and interaction with program officers and other grantees in efforts to promotediscussions and potential collaborations. The Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division is amajor element of the Engineering (ENG) Directorate and critical to the Engineering Directorate'smission at the National Science Foundation (NSF). CBET's mission is to promote and supporttransformative research and education in engineering areas CBET's mission is to promote andsupport transformative research and education in engineering areas based on the physical, mathematical and life sciences; advance scientific and engineering knowledge; and develop a diverse, globally engaged workforce enhancing the economy of the United States.</AbstractNarration>
