<AbstractNarration>Assistive technologies can negatively impact social interactions for people with disabilities. As a result, device abandoment can occur.  This problem may be remedied by drawing on social science studies of the social impacts and development of technologies.  Using a multi-method social scientific approach, this research (1) investigates the intersection of people, technology, and context to understand how assistive technologies may make users feel self-conscious; (2) determines what elements of design may be deemed socially acceptable; and (3) develops a new approach, Design for Social Acceptance, for creating assistive technologies that embody social acceptability. To do so, the investigators use interviews, observations, and participatory design with people with disabilities using assistive technologies, focusing on how design affects social interactions. Participatory design workshops may provide opportunities to work closely with people with disabilities to develop design practices that can be used to create socially acceptable assistive technologies. Findings from this study contribute to the field of science, technology, and society by providing a systematic understanding of the relationship between stigma and technology, and how that problem can be overcome. The study also contributes to understandings of the intersection of people with disabilities, the technologies they use, and the social interactions in which they engage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are (1) an increased ability for people with disabilities to participate in technology design, engineering, and testing; (2) a greater awareness of how assistive devices can be designed to meet the social needs of users with disabilities; and (3) establishing a new assistive technology design approach that may be adopted into existing design and engineering processes. Findings are disseminated through a doctoral dissertation. The course component of the study--where design students will work on projects by using the methodology--can shape student design sensibilities and influence their future design work. Finally, the research project broadens the participation of people with disabilities in engineering processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Assistive technology devices have been historically designed primarily to address the functional needs of people with motor, sensory, and cognitive disabilities. But such an exclusive focus on function-centered design results in assistive technologies that appear and operate quite differently than mainstream technologies, e.g., like smartphones. Such traditional designs can create feelings of stigma and self-consciousness, which contribute to the abandonment of assistive technologies. While achieving successful functioning is indeed a goal for assistive technology design, the difference of most assistive technologies in appeal and appearance (form) and features (function) from mainstream technologies often draws unwanted attention to individualsÆ disabilities. The use of typical assistive technology devices can lead to feelings of self-consciousness, rather than self-confidence.  To this end, we have formulated an analog to "design for functional accessibility" we call "design for social accessibility." How can assistive technology designs be improved to enhance, rather than detract, from the social experiences of their users? How can social considerations be incorporated into the design process alongside functional considerations? How can A.T. design promote feelings of self-confidence rather than self-consciousness? These are some of the questions we have explored, and continue to explore, in this project. What was an initial focus on "design for social acceptance" was broadened to "design for social accessibility," of which "acceptance" is one key part.  To-date, we have conducted three research investigations exploring design for social accessibility. Our work has led us to focus on "social accessibility" as having key components for influencing the design of technologies that are conducive to use in social situations by people with disabilities. Some of these key components are acceptance, appeal, self-efficacy, self-confidence, capability, ability, and strength. Our research on the social accessibility of assistive technologies bolsters the literature arguing that the self-consciousness and self-confidence fostered by assistive device use has an impact on the experiences and perceptions of social situations.  We have found that merely increasing designer awareness of users with disabilities is not sufficient in enhancing inclusive design thinking. Instead, our research studies with novice designers as they address design problems for people with and without disabilities suggest that tacit bias is best addressed by design- and reflection-in-action.  With this in mind, our research continues to explore how designers can more inclusively approach design for people with disabilities in ways that result in designs that are also deemed as technically sleek and savvy as popular mainstream devices.   Ms. Shinohara, the Ph.D. student chiefly supported by this grant, has focused her dissertation statement thusly:  Design for Social Accessibility can produce technology designs judged by people with and without disabilities to be both functionally and socially accessible to people with sensory impairments, reducing feelings of self-consciousness and enhancing feelings of self-confidence in assistive technology use.  To address her thesis statement, Ms. Shinohara has:  1. Explored the concept of social acceptance in the design of assistive technologies. Research in this area has reframed her broadening to social accessibility to better define the social situations of use affected by technology design that may influence a user to feel self-conscious or self-confident when using assistive technologies around others.  2. Ms. Shinohara sought to better understand how people approach design for disability. This research work conducted through a design course allowed her to observe how design students work with people with disabilities to establish core design principles and how students defined design requirements and employ common desig...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
