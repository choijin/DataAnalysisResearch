<AbstractNarration>This research will combine the skills of a comparative physiologist, an engineer, and a systematist to unravel the performance, design principals, and evolution of the sucker disk that allows some fishes to cling to rocks.  These fishes, called clingfish, adhere to fouled, irregular substrates in pounding surf and while launching feeding attacks to pry limpets from the rocks.  The work will involve a field component to measure the irregularity of substrates in the field, a pure modeling component that seeks to understand the effects of disk shape and material properties on suction, and a phylogenetic survey component.  In the survey the suction abilities of clingfishes from all over the world will be quantified and the relationships among clingfish species will be determined using phylogenetic methods.  The shape and underlying structure of the disk will also be investigated.  The results of these studies will be deposited in several public databases, including Genbank, Tree of Life, and a custom database for morphological data such as CT scans.  Other broader impacts of the grant include the development of biomimetic suction systems that could be used in surgical or robotic settings, development of tools for modeling soft matter interactions, education and outreach at the K12 and undergraduate level, and support of graduate education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How organisms such as clingfish and geckos cling to surfaces in the presence of large dynamic loads in wet and dry environments such as the intertidal zone or a dirty ceiling serves as a reminder of the remarkable adaptations to extreme environments that life is capable of. Understanding the biological variety of the solutions seen in nature requires a comparative study that  integrates the observations of the adhesive organs with an understanding of the physical mechanisms and the ultimate limits of the adhesion. Our project has brought together biological, physical and mathematical approaches to this problem to see how we might make sense of this question.   Our results take the form of mathematical and physical principles behind the dynamics of the formation of adhesive bonds on wet surfaces and the mechanics of their faiure when loaded. They lead to quantitative predictions for the rate of adhesion and the maximum load bearing capacity of adhesive pads as a function of the geoemtric and mechanical properties of the surfaces in contact, and the properties of the intervening fluid.   As biology moves from a descriptive to a quantitative predictive science, our study serves both to understand how evolution allows living systems to explore and take advantage of the physical, material world,  while suggesting biomimetic solutions that engineers and scientists might take advantage of in their quest to improve technologies - here in the context of adhesion in soft, and often wet environments.
