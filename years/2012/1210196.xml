<AbstractNarration>This action funds Dustin Wayne Adams of University of California, Santa Cruz to conduct a research project, entitled "Blind Friendly Word Processors for Japanese Authors" during the summer of 2012 at IBM Research - Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan.  The host scientist is Dr. Chieko Asakawa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is an investigation into the problems that Japanese authors experience and the successful strategies for layout and formatting work by Japanese sighted authors, the development of an add-on for the Japanese version of Microsoft Word, and the development of an accessible and blind-friendly interface to the Japanese version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The add-on to the Japanese version of Microsoft Word and the blind-friendly interface to the Japanese version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk that will allow Japanese blind authors to check and correct their documents without relying on a small circle of friends and peers can have tremendous impact on their ability to compete in various areas. The understanding of the problems they face can benefit a variety of stakeholders, including developers of assistive technology, the schools that teach blind students about good writing, and scientific communities that try to understand blind persons' mental models, to name a few.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>While photography within the blind community is becoming more popular, there is a lack of accessibility for people who are blind to access photos once the photos have been taken. Since a person who is blind cannot rely on the photo's visual content to identify the photo, they must use other clues about the photo with which to identify it, such as a description, time, date, and location the photo was taken, or audio. Smart phones provide a framework to customize photo capturing capability to cater to needs of users from a wide range. Some current apps try to make accessing a single photo by blind users more accessible, however, they do not try to solve the problem of how a blind user browses a photo library. I, along with IBM Research-Tokyo Accessibility Group, have designed a new interaction technique that will allow blind users to easily browse through a photo library by examining current problems with other apps, as well as the needs by blind users to browse through photos. This app makes photo browsing finally accessible by blind photographers by reducing the number of steps involved to retrieve a photo, providing non-visual contextual information about the photo, as well as organizing the photos in a way that allows blind users to access photos just as fast as sighted users. Thus, blind users will be able to share their experiences with others both online and offline, face-to-face, as well has have a means to remember past events and significant moments. This app has been tested with five people who range from being totally blind to legally blind with very positive results.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2012<br>      Modified by: Dustin&nbsp;W&nbsp;Adams</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
