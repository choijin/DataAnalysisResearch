<AbstractNarration>This project supports 10 students to attend the seventh ACM International Workshops on Underwater Networks (WUWNet)to be held in Los Angeles, California, November 5 - 6, 2012. This will provide students exposure to the challenges and techniques for setting up underwater networks and using them for continuous monitoring of significant events.</AbstractNarration>

These are complex, global-scale issues and the challenges are manyfold, beginning with fundamental scientific questions underpinning environmental processes across multiple scales (in space and time as well as biological diversity).
