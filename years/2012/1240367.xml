<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to understand how on-line learning affects students' self-efficacy and later achievement in an engineering degree program.   The research will investigate how different types of web-based activities impact student learning and their self-efficacy, or belief that they can accomplish a given task.  By looking longitudinally the study will help instructors understand how to effectively integrate web-based learning into mechanics courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project  will be to inform best practices in the rapidly growing area of on-line learning.  The study will be conducted in an introductory mechanics course, common to most engineering programs, and thus can widely inform practice.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research (1) expands understanding of self-efficacy as tied to engineering education in introductory courses, (2) advances knowledge of the impact of online exercises on mechanics self-efficacy and achievement while considering variations in student backgrounds and prior knowledge, and (3) provides a model for embedding assessment into a course for the benefit of students and instructors as well as scholarship on teaching and learning.  Our research results and papers presented at the American Society for Engineering Education Annual meetings in 2014 and 2015 were discussed with experts from across the United States.  Three sets of online exercises to support mechanics learning were created and integrated with both hardware for in-class exercises and written homework assignments.  All of these materials could be made available to other educators. The online exercises support student learning on the topics of equilibrium analysis, creating free-body diagrams, and drawing shear and bending moment diagrams (see Figure 1 for example questions).  Each set of exercises includes 1-2 instructional videos each followed by a set of questions that are graded. If students get an answer wrong (and if they get it right) they have an opportunity to review the correct answer and explanations. Each of the three exercises takes students between 25-40 minutes to complete.  We have seen in increase in understanding through the implementation of these exercises and have identified interesting trends for confidence increases relative to gender and level of education of parents.  Currently these materials are used by two instructors of the Introduction to Solid Mechanics course at Stanford.  Students found the supplemental online exercises useful and wanted to use them again later in the quarter for reviewing concepts. As might be expected, student performance on the online exercises was higher when the concept had been covered in class prior to the online assignment, as compared with online assignments where new material was taught in an online video prior to completing the exercises.

Through this project, three professors with expertise ranging from cognitive psychology and survey design and analysis to mixed-methods research and teaching in engineering education collaborated and mentored a diverse set of students, researchers and educators.  This project was the first engineering education research project for the PI and from this experience research and assessment has been embedded in additional classes that she teaches.
