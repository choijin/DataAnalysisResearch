<AbstractNarration>The relationship between continental collision and deformation along lithosphere-scale (hundreds of km-long) intracontinental strike-slip faults remains intensely debated. Debate persists because despite what we know about this important class of faults at the surface, we know comparatively little about how these structures work in the lower crust. Questions regarding the degree of strain localization, the lateral extent of rheological heterogeneities, and the physical nature of major intracontinental faults at depth will be answered "in situ" in this project by studying a well-exposed deep crustal shear zone and its wall rocks, i.e., the &gt;400 km-long intracontinental Grease River shear zone in the western Canadian Shield (exhumed from ~30 to 40 km-paleodepths). Preliminary data support the hypothesis that at ca. 1.92-1.90 Ga, lower crust NW of the Grease River shear zone was melt-weakened at the same time that lower crust SE of the Grease River shear zone was dehydrated and strong. This ?rheological dichotomy? may be analogous to lower crust beneath the steep topographic gradients and major intracontinental fault systems that mark the margins of the Tibetan Plateau, e.g., the Altyn Tagh and Longmen Shan ranges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide field-based constraints on the role of rheological heterogeneity in facilitating strain localization across a major intracontinental strike-slip fault from the lower crust's perspective. Anticipated results include: (1) resolving the Pressure-Temperature conditions and paths for metamorphic tectonites in the Grease River shear zone and its wall rocks, (2) testing the contemporaneity of deformation, shearing, and partial melting using in situ Th-U-total Pb dates on monazite via EPMA, and (3) constraining a &gt;500 m.y. history of shear zone reactivation via high-precision ID-TIMS U-Pb dates on zircon from a suite of cross-cutting and variably-deformed dikes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include: (1) implementing a program of 6th-8th grade teacher preparation and enhancement, and (2) public outreach via classroom visits and panel discussions that are all focused on faulting and earthquakes in intracontinental systems. These efforts will directly impact teachers and students who live in the immediate vicinity of unexposed intracontinental faults of the New Madrid seismic zone ? the most seismically active region east of the Rocky Mountains. Two professional development summer institutes (workshops + field trips) will be provided to teachers utilizing inquiry-based modules to be developed by the PI. Implementation and assessment of these modules will impact middle school Earth Science frameworks in Arkansas (and nationally via on-line dissemination of the modules). These efforts will be in collaboration with the University of Arkansas' Center for Math and Science Education. Training and education will be provided to at least one Ph.D. student, one M.S. student, and several undergraduate students who will be integrally involved in the research and outreach efforts. This project directly impacts the new geoscience Ph.D. program  at the University of Arkansas. Benefits to the EarthScope community are also anticipated, as this project uses an exposed deep crustal shear zone in the Canadian Shield to inform our understanding of the structure, rheology, and timing of a major intracontinental strike-slip fault as it may have existed in the lower crust near the Moho.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span>. This grant funded an early career Earth scientist at the University of Arkansas to use a deeply exhumed exposure of continental crust in northern Saskatchewan (with rocks at the surface that were once 20-60 km deep) to develop a field-based analog for the southeastern margin of Earth's highest plateau. Tibet is "The Roof of the World", rising to an average elevation of 4,500 m north of the &gt;8,000 m high Himalayan mountains. Earth scientists have long wondered why the Tibetan plateau is so flat despite the 50 million year-long collision between India and Asia that created it. The Clark-Royden hypothesis, proposed in 2000 to explain the growth of the eastern Tibetan plateau, argues that the lower crust of Tibet must be weak in order for the plateau's topography to have such low relief. Gravity acting on the plateau forces this weak lower crust to flow and be injected into the adjacent crust of east Asia. Over 20 years of geophysical campaigns have tried to detect this flow adjacent to the strong lower crust beneath the Sichuan basin.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit</span>. Weak lower crustal flow beneath southeast Tibet has been inferred using a wide variety of data. These data include topography, magnetotelluric profiles, estimates of flexural rigidity, depths of earthquakes, surface wave seismic tomography and seismic anisotropy, 2-D dilitation rates determined from GPS data, and a variety of geodynamic models. Many of these observations and some of the models support the existence of lower crustal flow at 20-60 km depths, but direct observations of this behavior are impossible. Rare exposures of ancient lower crustal flow are present on Earth that have been uplifted along faults with subsequent erosion and additional faulting making their appearance on Earth?' surface possible. One such example occurs in the &gt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> Athabasca granulite terrane in northernmost Saskatchewan, Canada - one of the largest of its kind on Earth. This project used field mapping, geochemistry, petrology, modelling, and geochronology to document a 1.9 billion year old analogy for lower crustal flow that is strikingly similar to the hypothesized occurrence in southeast Tibet where deep partially molten lower crust is inferred to currently flow adjacent to strong cratonic (meaning part of an old and thick tectonic plate) beneath the Sichuan basin. The final results of this project were published in 2020 in Earth and Planetary Science Letters (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X20303198">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X20303198</a>) which validated the Clark-Royden hypothesis and suggest that Tibetan-type lower crustal flow has operated on Earth for at least 1.9 billion years. The field-based results of this project can inform geophysicists and geodynamicists who need exposed examples of these processes to constrain their interpretations of unexposed deep crust in other parts of Earth's highest orogenic plateaus in Tibet and the Andean Altiplano in South America.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts</span>.
