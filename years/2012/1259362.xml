<AbstractNarration>This S-STEM project provides 16 scholarships per year to upper-level STEM majors at the University of Houston, Clear Lake.  UHCL students enter as juniors, and the STEM programs are well designed to serve community college transfer students. The scholarships are being made available to academically talented, low-income undergraduate students pursuing degrees in Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, and Physics. STEM studies at UHCL provide a natural pipeline for low-income and underrepresented students to enter science-related careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This S-STEM project not only complements a prior S-STEM project for computing and mathematics majors but also builds upon lessons learned from the prior project.  Intellectual merit of the project is realized by features that include recruitment activities, faculty involvement in several capacities, peer and career mentoring, a Natural Science Scholar Organization, opportunities for research experiences, an emphasis on developing communication skills, career exposure via partnerships with local high technology laboratories and industries, and a well-defined set of metrics to evaluate and improve project effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts are realized by educating and diversifying a workforce prepared for STEM jobs. Broader impacts will also result from scholars presenting results of their experiences at community colleges, local conferences, and national meetings of professional science organizations. Plans exist to present project outcomes at meetings of professional STEM societies and in journals as well as reports to the public via the project website.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the five years of this grant 73 students majoring in one of the natural science fields (Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, or Physics) participated in the University of Houston - Clear Lake (UHCL)&nbsp;Natural Science Scholars Program. Recruitment of participants (i.e. Scholars) for this program&nbsp;focused on providing support and development of natural science students demonstrating academic talent and financial need in one of the four areas of the natural sciences. UHCL has high numbers of low-income, first generation, and minority students (UHCL is a recognized Hispanic Serving Institution, HSI). At least 30% of UHCL students qualify for low-income status, and approximately 60% receive some sort of financial aid. Of the students selected to participate in the program 66% were women, 27% identified themselves as Hispanic, 5.5% identified themselves as African American, and 2.7% identified themselves as American Indian.&nbsp;Furthermore, Scholars from all four of the natural science areas were selected to participate in the program, and of the 73 Scholars selected 66% were Biology majors, 14% were Environmental Science majors, 9% were Physics majors, and 6% were Chemistry majors. During the 5 years of this grant scholarship support totaling $574,822 (averaging $7874/scholar/year) was provided to the Scholars that participated in the program. In addition, $6440 was provided to support the travel expenses of Scholars that attended and gave research presentations at local, regional, and national scientific meetings. By the last semester of this program 56% of the Scholars that had completed the program were either continuing to pursue further STEM education and/or had obtained employment in&nbsp;a STEM-related company.&nbsp;Therefore, through the activities of this grant a significant pool of qualified, under-represented science students was recruited, financially supported, and guided to graduation and successful employement in STEM-related fields. A significant feature of the UHCL program was that it was designed to especially serve community college transfer students (i.e. transferring after completing 60 or more hours towards a science degree) desiring to obtain a bachelor's degree in a STEM field. This commitment to support and encourage these under-represented science students continued throughout the period of this grant, even with the expansion of UHCL to include freshman and sophomore classes in the fall of 2014. Therefore, this grant has successfully supported a pipeline for low-income and under-represented students desiring to earn a degree in an area of the natural sciences and pursue careers in STEM-related fields.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/09/2018<br>      Modified by: Richard&nbsp;L&nbsp;Puzdrowski</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
