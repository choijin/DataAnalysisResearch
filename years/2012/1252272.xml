<AbstractNarration>This award will help to support student attendance at the 53rd IEEE Annual Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on October 19 through October 23, 2012, as well as to support attendance by some qualified postdoctoral fellows who do not have other sources of travel funding. FOCS and its sister conference, the ACM STOC meeting, are the premier broad-based conferences on the Theory of Computing. FOCS has a record of strongly encouraging participation by students, for whom the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides. In recent years, the annual FOCS conference has been attended by eighty to one hundred students who have comprised more than a third of all attendees. This award will provide partial support to twenty or more students, covering shared hotel rooms and travel. (Student registration will be supported by other means.)</AbstractNarration>

Due to a large number of requests for funds from students and postdoctoral scholars from a large number of universities across US, every effort was made to economize and provide smaller travel grants, yet provide reasonable travel awards, including requesting shared accommodations and requesting shared rides to the conference whenever applicable. Overall, this was a very successful effort. Travel grant funded 41 students and postdoctoral scholars to attend FOCS &nbsp;2012 conference.
