<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1206745            PI:  Winter, Jessica   ORG: Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Micellular Electrospray Synthesis of Magnetic Quantum Dots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  This research will examine new synthesis routes to unite quantum dots and magnetic nanoparticles.  These magnetic quantum dots are fluorescent and respond to a magnetic field and could thus be used in a variety of applications, including multimodal imaging, separations, and studies of the role of force in cell function.  These nanocomposites will be produced by combining a bottom up assembly strategy (micellular self-assembly) with a top down process (electrohydrodynamic spraying).  In the proposed approach, electrospray will generate continuous, uniform, large surface area emulsion droplets that will be transformed to micelles via their interfacial instability with water.  Because the morphology of electrospray particles is tightly controlled, micellular electrospray should enable greater process control and improved particle uniformity, reproducibility, and scale.  Given that electrospray has not previously been used to examine micellular structures, we will first explore the influence of reaction conditions on empty micelle production, and then investigate the influence of nanoparticle loading on micelles.  Particles produced will be characterized through single nanocomposite analysis techniques.  Single particle magnetic characterization at the nanoscale has not previously been demonstrated.  This approach could be applied to virtually any hydrophobic structure smaller than the micelle core, thus producing a wide variety of nanocomposites.  These studies will also increase understanding of micelle-nanoparticle assemblies, which are distinct from empty micelles or micelles encapsulating molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  This research will be executed by diverse teams of graduate, undergraduate, and high school researchers.  Research results will be disseminated through a unique educational strategy that combines teaching and outreach to develop course materials and experimental demonstrations for K-14 students.  Additionally, the proposed work will be incorporated into an educational video game developed by non-profit partner EdHeads to increase K-12 STEM and nanotechnology awareness.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The primary goal of this project was to develop a new method (i.e., micelle electrospray) of creating small polymer nanoparticles, known as micelles, that can encapsulate multiple, smaller inorganic nanoparticles. Because the inorganic nanoparticles are not normally soluble in water, micelle encapsulation provides a way to use them in water-based applications. These materials have important potential applications in medicine, including imaging, diagnostics, and therapy. They can also be used in the biopharmaceutical industry for cell separations.</p> <p>The primary goals of this project were to understand how the manufacturing process itself effects the shape and size of the micelles produced and then to understand how loading of the nanoparticle cargoes effects micelles shape and size. Shape and size are critically important for the use of these nanoparticles. Size generally needs to be uniform, meaning all particles need to display the same size, but different applications have different demands regarding optimum size. Cell labeling may require minimal size, whereas separations may require a larger size. Shape is important because cylindrical shapes can encapsulate more cargo, such as drug, than spheres, and because there is some evidence cells prefer to take up non-spherical structures.</p> <p>In this work, we demonstrated a new manufacturing process known as micellar electrospray. This approach uses a continuous spray to generate small nanocomposite particles known as micelles. We showed that this method could produce ~50-100 fold more micelles than batch methods. We also showed that this method could be used to create micelles with irregular shapes (Figure 1), even though the nanoparticles are generated from originally spherical droplets. We also showed that nanoparticles with irregular shapes could be encapsulated in the micelles, and that this resulted in a higher likelihood of non-spherical micelles. We demonstrated that shape and size alter with process temperature, polymer concentration, and nanoparticle loading (Figure 2). Interesting, we also found that increased nanoparticle loading increased the order of nanoparticles within the micelle, which could enable unique physics. This will be a subject of future work.</p> <p>Next, we evaluated how the manufacturing process affected the encapsulated inorganic nanoparticles. We did not observe any noticeable declines in activity with encapsulation, although we did observe that simply having more particles confined in a micelle provided increased properties associated with collective behavior. For example, because multiple particles could be grouped together, luminescent micelles were brighter than individual inorganic nanoparticles.</p> <p>Finally, we evaluated whether these particles could be used in expected applications. We showed that micelles encapsulating semiconductor nanoparticles known as quantum dots could be used to identify specific molecular signatures in patient cancer cells (Figure 3). This would enable the physician to tailor therapy to each specific patient. We also showed that micelles encapsulating magnetic nanoparticles could be used to separate cells, proteins, and DNA molecules from solution. When combined with quantum dots, these could be used to detect the presence of 1000 molecules from sample volumes as small as a droplet. Thus, these particles could be used in biosensing applications. We also showed that these particles could be used in emerging nanomanufacturing platforms.
