<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on optimizing the design of a&lt;br/&gt;robot for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Research has shown that children&lt;br/&gt;with ASD interact more easily with inanimate devices, such as robots, than with humans.&lt;br/&gt;Despite this promising research, there are currently no consumer robots on the market&lt;br/&gt;specifically designed to interact with ASD children. The goal of this research is to investigate&lt;br/&gt;what set of features are optimal for a robot designed to be an effective and affordable therapy&lt;br/&gt;tool for children with ASD. Initial designs will be generated based on existing research and&lt;br/&gt;previously conducted user tests. These designs will be used to create prototypes which will then&lt;br/&gt;be used to conduct user studies with ASD children to determine which designs elicit the&lt;br/&gt;greatest engagement, measured by proximity to robot, number of interactions (physical &amp; eye&lt;br/&gt;contact), duration of interactions and number of vocalizations. The expected results are a&lt;br/&gt;validated design of an affordable consumer-ready robot that addresses the specific needs of&lt;br/&gt;children with ASD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project involve both the direct impact of&lt;br/&gt;providing a beneficial new therapy tool for children with ASD as well as providing a platform&lt;br/&gt;from which additional research can be launched. The CDC currently estimates that 1 in 88&lt;br/&gt;children in the United States will be diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder and ASDs&lt;br/&gt;are reported to occur in all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Early intervention can&lt;br/&gt;make a significant difference in the lives of these children and their families. Tools that allow&lt;br/&gt;children to practice and reinforce skills learned in formal therapy sessions are strongly desired&lt;br/&gt;by parents. The goal of this project is to develop a validated design for a robot to help children&lt;br/&gt;with ASD practice social referencing skills. By designing both for effectiveness and&lt;br/&gt;affordability, it will be the first autism robot targeted towards the home therapy market.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the results of this project will also be beneficial to researchers studying the use of&lt;br/&gt;robots as autism therapy tools. This robot will serve as an affordable alternative to expensive&lt;br/&gt;research robots, most of which were not designed specifically to interact with special needs&lt;br/&gt;children.</AbstractNarration>
