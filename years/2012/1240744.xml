<AbstractNarration>This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at Kansas State University in the summer of 2013 on the global behavior of solutions to critical nonlinear wave equations.  The principal speaker will be Professor Carlos Kenig from the University of Chicago. The lectures will cover such areas as local and global well-posedness, scattering, finite time blow up, and soliton resolution for classes of nonlinear dispersive equations.  In addition to the 10 main lectures by Dr. Kenig, lectures will be presented by other experts in these fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hallmarks of the NSF/CBMS regional conference series are focus on a single important and timely area of research by a leading practitioner, a published monograph for a wider audience, and continued effect and local stimulation through regional recruitment emphasis.  For this conference, the lectures will also be posted online to provide greater access. This award will support approximately 25 participants in the conference, mostly at early stages of their careers.</AbstractNarration>
