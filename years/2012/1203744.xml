<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2012 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. These fellowships support a research and training plan at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Alexander A. Young is " The Growth of Algebras." The host institution for the fellowship is University of Washington, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. James Zhang.</AbstractNarration>
