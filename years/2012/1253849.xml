<AbstractNarration>Why there are so many flowering plants is an evolutionary conundrum that has puzzled biologists since Darwin's time. Although the group is evolutionarily quite young, there are over 250,000 species of flowering plants. A long-standing hypothesis suggests that reciprocal adaptation between plants and their pollinators (a process known as coevolution) is responsible for the spectacular number of species of flowering plants, but evidence supporting this idea is circumstantial. This project tests this hypothesis by measuring coevolution between yuccas and yucca moths. The yucca / yucca moth interaction is widely referred to as a model system for studying coevolution, but no study has ever conclusively demonstrated coevolution between them. This project will use experimental manipulations of yuccas and yucca moths to determine whether the plants and their pollinators are adapting to one another. Genomic technologies will identify genetic factors associated with plant and pollinator features and determine whether they are coevolving. Finally, genetic tools will be used to determine whether coevolution was involved in the evolution of new species of yuccas and yucca moths. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides one of the first direct tests of the hypothesis that coevolution promotes the evolution of new species, and will significantly advance our understanding of how the diversity of life originated. Integral to the research are three novel educational initiatives: a citizen science program involving the general public in field studies of coevolution, a summer research immersion course for undergraduates, and a program to train a postdoctoral scientist in best practices for integrating teaching and research.</AbstractNarration>

Charles Darwin called flowering plants 'an abominable mystery' because they seemed to appear suddenly in the fossil record. One possible solution to this mystery is that pollinators may have allowed the rapid formation of new species of plants. This project tested this idea by studying the relationship between Joshua trees and their pollinators.</p> <p>Joshua trees are part of a remarkable relationship with their specialized pollinators, the Yucca moths. Unlike almost all other insects, Yucca moths seem to 'intentionally' pollinate the flowers that they visit. The moths use unique, tentacle-like mouthparts to gather pollen and then push it onto the stigma -- the part of the flower that is receptive to pollen. In exchange for pollination, the moths lay their eggs in the yucca flowers, and their larvae eat a portion of the seeds. Finally, each species of Yucca moth typically (though not always) is associated with a single species of yucca, and each species of yucca is associated with a single species of moth.</p> <p>Intellectual Merit:</p> <p>Recent research showed that Joshua trees are pollinated by two different, closely-related species of moths, and that the trees pollinated by each moth are distinctly different from each other in both the overall growth form and in their flowers. With the support of this grant, we conducted a series of studies to determine whether these two moths might be exerting natural selection on the trees -- particularly on the shape of the flowers -- and whether selection by the moths was causing the trees to diverge into two different species.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>First, we used cutting-edge DNA sequencing technology to assay genetic variation in Joshua trees from more than 20 populations across the Mojave Desert, including a site where the two yucca moth pollinators co-occur. We produced genetic data from more than 10,000 'genes' and more than 450 individual trees, which together comprise more than 223 million nucleotides of data.&nbsp;</p> <p>Next, we used an array of statistical tests to draw conclusions from these data. We found evidence that Joshua trees pollinated by the two different moth species are moderately to strongly genetically differentiated, which is consistent with their having become distinct species in the recent past. We also found that although the different tree species interbreed and form hybrids in the population where both pollinators occur, hybrids are relatively rare and seem to have lower fitness than genetically 'pure' trees. In addition, we found evidence that 'genes' associated with flowers seem to be particularly likely to experience natural selection, which might mean that their yucca moth pollinators are indeed exerting natural selection on Joshua trees. Finally, to our surprise, we found indications that other features of the trees, such as leaf shape and trunk height may also be subject to natural selection, which may tell us that pollinators are not the whole story.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a second approach to test the idea that moths may be exerting natural selection on Joshua trees, we completed a large-scale experiment over multiple years. In a region of the desert where both of the yucca moth species and the two Joshua trees that they pollinate co-occur, we experimentally introduced different species of moth onto different species of Joshua tree, and onto trees with variously shaped flowers. The results of this experiment indicate that trees produce fewer fruit (a measure of fitness) when they are pollinated by the 'wrong' moth. In addition, hybrid trees produced fewer fruit than either of 'pure' species, regardless of which moth pollinated them. However, to our surprise, flower shape seemed not to make as big a difference as tree species did.
