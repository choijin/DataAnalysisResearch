<AbstractNarration>The project is aimed at developing a non-asymptotic homogenization&lt;br/&gt;theory of Maxwell's equations in artificial periodic composites&lt;br/&gt;(metamaterials). Currently, there is a consensus that sufficiently&lt;br/&gt;large lattice cell sizes are necessary for some nontrivial physical&lt;br/&gt;effects to occur in such structures. (The most intriguing of these&lt;br/&gt;effects is high-frequency magnetism.) Classical homogenization&lt;br/&gt;theories work well in the zero-cell-size limit but are difficult to&lt;br/&gt;apply to large metamaterial cells. In contrast, the proposed theory is&lt;br/&gt;non-asymptotic and does not involve any series expansions with respect&lt;br/&gt;to the cell size. The electromagnetic field in the material is&lt;br/&gt;approximated by a finite set of functions (modes) usually but not&lt;br/&gt;necessarily Trefftz functions such as Bloch waves. The coarse-grained&lt;br/&gt;fields and flux densities are defined via curl-conforming and&lt;br/&gt;div-conforming interpolations, respectively. A linear map between&lt;br/&gt;these interpolants is established and defines an extended material&lt;br/&gt;tensor. In a certain canonical basis, this extended tensor has a&lt;br/&gt;classical block of 36 local parameters and a novel block quantifying&lt;br/&gt;nonlocal effects. From the differential-geometric perspective, this&lt;br/&gt;constitutive relationship can be viewed as a realization of&lt;br/&gt;Bossavit-Hiptmair's discrete Hodge operators (linear maps between&lt;br/&gt;discretized 1-forms that correspond to vector fields and 2-forms that&lt;br/&gt;correspond to fluxes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last decade, metamaterials have attracted unprecedented&lt;br/&gt;attention due to a variety of potential applications that include&lt;br/&gt;superlensing, electromagnetic cloaking, electromagnetically-induced&lt;br/&gt;transparency, efficient antennas, and more. Experimental&lt;br/&gt;demonstrations of these effects have been limited to proofs of&lt;br/&gt;principle and at optical frequencies have so far been incomplete.&lt;br/&gt;Subwavelength optical imaging has been achieved only in the&lt;br/&gt;quasi-static (near-field) regime, standard for the more conventional&lt;br/&gt;near-field optics; the so-called "carpet cloak" conceals surface bumps&lt;br/&gt;rather than 3D objects, and so on. Moreover, applications that do not&lt;br/&gt;depend critically on the effective medium description of metamaterials&lt;br/&gt;appear to be more easily achievable than the ones that do. The latter&lt;br/&gt;group includes, notably, superlensing and cloaking. This suggests&lt;br/&gt;that, to make further progress, theoretical and mathematical issues at&lt;br/&gt;the heart of metamaterial science must be unambiguously resolved. The&lt;br/&gt;main problem can be stated as follows. Given the composition of a&lt;br/&gt;metamaterial cell and the operating frequency, determine whether this&lt;br/&gt;metamaterial can be reasonably described as a continuous medium with&lt;br/&gt;some effective parameters, just like any natural optical material; if&lt;br/&gt;the answer is positive, develop a rigorous methodology for such a&lt;br/&gt;description. The proposed research is aimed at solving this problem in&lt;br/&gt;the most difficult case when the cell size of the composite is an&lt;br/&gt;appreciable fraction of the wavelength of light. The methodology, once&lt;br/&gt;developed, will allow the scientific community to delineate the&lt;br/&gt;possible from the impossible in the field of metamaterials.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is in the development&lt;br/&gt;of a new paradigm of non-asymptotic homogenization, of new&lt;br/&gt;computational methods related to it, and in the application of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed methodology to electromagnetic metamaterials, allowing one to&lt;br/&gt;gain a much deeper understanding of their properties and limitations.&lt;br/&gt;As a new area of research, non-asymptotic homogenization will also&lt;br/&gt;have a broader technical impact in other areas of applied physics and&lt;br/&gt;engineering, such as acoustics, heat transfer and possibly elasticity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project revisits a century-old problem related to composite materials &ndash; mixtures of two or more ingredients. Given the properties of these ingredients (electric or magnetic or thermal, etc.), what are the respective physical properties of the composite as an "effective medium"? A number of outstanding scientists (Clausius &amp; Mossotti, Lorenz &amp; Lorentz, Maxwell Garnett) developed relatively simple yet accurate effective medium (homogenization) models in the 19th and early 20th century. Later on, in the second half of the 20th century, rigorous mathematical theories followed, and the homogenization problem appeared to be largely solved.  This changed dramatically in the 21st century with the advent of "metamaterials" &ndash; artificial periodic structures judiciously designed to control the propagation of waves and to yield properties and effects not available in natural materials. (Most intriguing of these effects are negative refraction and cloaking.) It became apparent that existing effective medium theories are inadequate for electromagnetic metamaterials. In particular, most of these theories fail to account for magnetic effects. The root cause of this deficiency, according to our analysis, is the asymptotic nature of conventional theories: that is, they are valid when the lattice cell size of a periodic composite is vanishingly small relative to the free-space wavelength.  Thus the main outcome of our project is the development of a non-asymptotic theory valid for any composition and size of the metamaterial lattice cell. We also established principal limitations of any local homogenization of metamaterials and put forward the following uncertainty principle: the stronger the magnetic effects in a metamaterial with intrinsically nonmagnetic constituents, the less accurate its treatment as an effective medium.  Separately, we discovered interesting conceptual links between our non-asymptotic homogenization theory and a class of computational methods known in numerical analysis as "Discontinuous Galerkin &ndash; Trefftz".  In the course of the project, ten journal papers were published in Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Physical Review, Journal of Computational &amp; Applied Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Computation, Optics Express, IEEE Transactions. 27 conference papers, including three keynote/plenary and five invited ones, have been presented.
