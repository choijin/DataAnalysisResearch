<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a highly efficient&lt;br/&gt;supersonic ejector vapor compression technology that converts low-to-medium grade thermal energy&lt;br/&gt;(200-400F) into useful refrigeration (20F-50F) at high condenser temperatures (100-120F). The proposed&lt;br/&gt;multi-fluid jet cooler maximizes heat transfer efficiency by using a propellant with relatively low latent to&lt;br/&gt;continuously entrain and compress an immiscible low temperature refrigerant of relatively high latent&lt;br/&gt;heat. Initial prototypes have 400% higher efficiencies than conventional single-fluid ejectors. Phase I&lt;br/&gt;research will extend these gains while operating at elevated condenser temperatures. Specific research&lt;br/&gt;foci are: 1) Highly efficient jet nozzles to supersonically expand a high molar mass, low specific heat&lt;br/&gt;ratio propellant without the expansion/compression losses observed when using conventional nozzle&lt;br/&gt;designs; 2) Mixing of subsonic refrigerant into the supersonic propellant with minimal kinetic energy loss&lt;br/&gt;by avoiding sonic choking of the refrigerant; and 3) Maximum pressure recovery diffusers utilizing weak,&lt;br/&gt;oblique compression waves instead of strong, normal shock waves to transition the mixed supersonic flow&lt;br/&gt;to subsonic velocity. Potential applications for the two-fluid ejector compression technology include&lt;br/&gt;natural gas powered air conditioning, concentrated solar thermal chiller plants, lower cost combined&lt;br/&gt;heating power and cooling plants, and thermally-driven water desalination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is reduced economic and climate burden&lt;br/&gt;associated with the world?s growing demand for space cooling. Air conditioning is the leading usage for&lt;br/&gt;peak-time electricity in the U.S. and largest energy expense for commercial buildings. Globally, the&lt;br/&gt;$65billion air conditioning equipment market is growing at 5% p.a.; and because it is dominated by the&lt;br/&gt;electrically-driven mechanical vapor compression cycle the strain on electrical grids - and by extension&lt;br/&gt;the environment and economy - is rising likewise. A quiet, clean, reliable and cost effective heat-driven&lt;br/&gt;solution would greatly reduce these risks. Unfortunately, status quo technologies suffer low efficiencies,&lt;br/&gt;large form factors, and require expensive water-cooled condensers. Initial R&amp;D efforts have proven an&lt;br/&gt;ejector vapor compressor using optimized fluid pairs built with low cost components can operate at&lt;br/&gt;efficiencies competitive with electric compressors when operating in moderate ambient conditions. Massmarket&lt;br/&gt;adoption, however, requires efficient operation at extreme outside temperatures. Phase I research&lt;br/&gt;will maximize cooling power and discharge pressure (thus operability at high condenser temperatures) by&lt;br/&gt;minimizing irreversible losses incurred during supersonic expansion and compression of the immiscible&lt;br/&gt;fluid pairs. Project findings will benefit adjacent fields of hypersonic avionics and low atmosphere jet&lt;br/&gt;propulsion</AbstractNarration>
