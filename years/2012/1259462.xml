<AbstractNarration>This project is supporting two cohorts of financially disadvantaged students to address the shortage of labor, women, and underrepresented groups in computer science and related disciplines. Each scholarship is being awarded for four years to remove the financial barrier to degree completion. Sixteen S-STEM scholars in 2013 and 15 in 2014 are being selected based on (1) NSF citizenship/residence requirements, (2) financial need as determined by the FAFSA, (3) academic qualification, (4) personal qualities (e.g., leadership), and (5) contribution to the diversity of the computer science student body. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project objectives include (1) identifying and recruiting students with interest and high potential in computer science, with priority given to women and underrepresented groups, (2) improving retention through cohort class enrollments, S-STEM tutor networks, and enriched interactions between S-STEM scholars and existing academic support units and student groups, (3) providing internship and research opportunities to S-STEM scholars for timely professional development, and (4) gathering feedback to refine the curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is creating interactions with different campus units and examining financial, social, support structure, curriculum, and environmental factors that contribute to the lack of women and underrepresented groups in computer science. S-STEM cohorts are serving as focus groups to examine the computer science education at the university, including curriculum, counseling, mentoring, professional development, and extracurricular activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The scholarships are allowing financially disadvantaged and debt-averse students to focus more on their degrees. Recruitment activities focus on women and underrepresented students to reestablish their critical mass in the program. Project results and findings are being disseminated through a web portal and education publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of our S-STEM Scholarship are to encourage women and other underrepresented groups to major in computer science and to improve retention of these students through a broadened curriculum, academic support, professional development, and cohort activities.  Ultimately, we want to increase overall enrollment in the major.   Between 2013 and 2018, we recruited 63 students, 21 of whom were female, 25 belonged to minorities (including Hispanics and excluding Asians), and two had disabilities.  So far, we have graduated 25 students (including 5 females and 13 minority students).  Ten went to graduate school (FSU), 15 became software developers at Amazon, Comcast, General Electric, General Motors, Harris, InfoSys, Siemens, Solstice, SynTech, and VR Systems, and one became a research programmer at FSU.  For the 2013, 2014, and 2017 entering classes, we have increased the population of female students by 4.4% (from 16% to 20%) and that of minority students by 5.5% (from 27% to 33%).   The persistence rate in the 2013 and 2014 S-STEM cohorts who have completed the degree cycle generally improved as the students progressed through the computer science degree program.  The year-to-year persistence rate from freshman to sophomore year was approximately 85%, whereas the year-to-year persistence rate from junior to senior year was approximately 93%.  The computer science students who entered the program from 2013 and 2014 experienced a year-to-year persistence rate from freshman to sophomore year of approximately 72% and a year-to-year persistence rate from junior to senior year of approximately 88%.  The student?s receipt of the S-STEM scholarship consistently improved the year-to-year persistence rate.     In addition, the women in the 2013-2014 S-STEM cohorts had an 84% average year-to-year persistence rate compared to the 80% average rate for the women who entered the computer science program in 2013 and 2014.  The minority students in the 2013-2014 S-STEM cohorts had a 90% average year-to-year persistence rate, whereas the year-to-year persistence rate of the computer science minority students who entered the program between 2013 and 2014 was 85%.   Our analysis compared our cohorts? characteristics with those of the computer science students entering the program in 2013-2014.  The analysis found that high school GPA, financial need, and ACT math scores have little correlation with college performance in the students? major.  However, the mentoring support system may have been a key contribution to increases in the year-to-year persistence rate of S-STEM scholars, which was confirmed by an external evaluator.  In addition, high schools in financially challenged districts may not have introduced computer science as a possible college major.  Therefore, early exposure to the computer science major may increase the participation of underrepresented groups in majoring in computer science.   We helped students learn more about their potential career paths by invitingthem to events with speakers from MIT Lincoln Lab, Microsoft, Intel, Dell, EMC, GE, Harris, UCSB, Omniangle Technologies, New Sci, Captiveyes, Cuttlesoft, Diverse Computing, i2x, Danfoss Turbocor, Louisiana State University, the University of James Madison, and the University of Kansas.  We also hosted workshops that focused on time management and applying for graduate schools and summer internships, to equip students with the tools and obtain recommendation letters and seek employment opportunities.  Over the years, students who were unable to continue the scholarship program provided the following reasons:  35% switched majors (to IT, MIS, business, and biology); 24% encountered difficulties fulfilling the prerequisites in math (Calculus II and Discrete Mathematics); 18% had low overall GPA; 12% transferred to another university; 6% encountered family hardships (e.g., the loss of a family support system); and 6% lost financial aid eligibility.    We documented our four attempts to obtain this NSF S-STEM scholarship award in a paper, which was published and presented at SIGCSE 2014.  As a result, 11 institutions have asked to use our NSF S-STEM proposal as an example for writing their own proposals.
