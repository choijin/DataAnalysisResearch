<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Mary O'Sullivan from Canisius College and colleagues Mariusz Kozik, Timothy Gregg, Jeremy Steinbacher and Sarah Evans will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) development of particle-based contrast agents for fluorine MRI; (b) investigations of organic mechanisms and methodologies (allene cyclopropanation); (c) development of inhibitors of an enzyme (trypanothione reductase) in parasites; (d) studies of the interactions of polyamines with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor; (e) investigations of DNA-protein cross-links; (f) studies to elucidate the structures of inorganic complexes (transition-metal substituted heteropolytungstates); and (g) uses of inorganic complexes as photo-activated catalysts for reduction reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at Canisius College and neighboring institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project was to acquire a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR) to be used by undergraduate students and faculty in research and laboratory classes at Canisius College.  NMR spectrometers are instruments that can provide an enormous range of information about the structures of materials, including: the connectivity of atoms within molecules; how molecules interact; and the types of movement or motions that molecules can undergo.  Consequently NMR spectroscopy is a vital technique in modern chemistry and biochemistry research and industry. Thus it is important that young scientists and graduates of chemistry and biochemistry programs have had experience operating NMR spectrometers, understand some of the capabilities of NMR and can interpret the results of NMR experiments to investigate materials.  During the three years of this project six faculty members along with 23 students (undergraduates and four high school students) have used the NMR in their research projects at Canisius.  All the students were trained to be able to use the NMR without supervision for routine experiments and several students used the NMR for conducting a range of sophisticated analyses of properties of materials.  Most of these students conducted their research using the NMR for two or more years.  Some examples of the projects that used the NMR extensively, include: studies towards the development of new nano-particles for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to be used in diagnostic medicine; design of novel compounds to inhibit a protein and potentially result in new anti-parasitic drugs; understanding the structures of inorganic materials that can convert carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) into fuels; and the design of new methods to prepare molecules containing rings composed of three carbon atoms.  Results of these projects have been published in journals with students as co-authors and students have presented their research results at national and local scientific meetings.  The NMR has also been used extensively in two laboratory classes in which students were trained to use the NMR without supervision to conduct individual projects investigating the structures of compounds.  The modern electronics of the NMR enabled 42 students in these classes to carry out several types of experiments to investigate compounds.  Essentially all students in the chemistry and biochemistry majors at Canisius will now have hands-on experience with the NMR and enough training that they are able to conduct NMR experiments without supervision.    The NMR has played a pivotal role in both maintaining and also expanding the research activities of the faculty and their student researchers.  Thus, availability of the NMR was a vital component of a successful recent NSF grant application by a faculty member; and the department held its first annual Chemistry and Biochemistry Undergraduate Summer Research Symposium in 2015 with 17 students presenting and over 70 people attending.  Importantly since the NMR spectrometer has so many applications across the sub-disciplines of chemistry and biochemistry, the NMR will continue to have a major impact in the training of students in the classroom and research laboratories at Canisius for many years beyond the three year time-frame of the NSF award.
