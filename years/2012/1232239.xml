<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop reliable protocols for fabricating functional photonic and electronic nanostructures using bioinspired, molecular assembly methods. In one of the proposed tasks, seed nanoparticles will be selectively attached through molecular recognition to the ?DNA origami? template and fused to form the electrodes; a separate nanoparticle island will be separately attached forming a single-electron transistor. In the other major task, plasmonic bow-tie antennae will be assembled from nanoparticles, and the optically active nanoscale object will be attached in the hot spot. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed project stems from the convergence of recent advances in DNA-based self-assembly methods with promising preliminary results on specific surface binding of solution-assembled complexes. These nanostructures may develop into a new class of naturally biocompatible sensors that will have transformative applications in the biomedical field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are the development of alternative, cheaper (most steps are in aqueous solution) and more versatile fabrication methods for making composite bio-nano-devices. The proposal has a strongly emphasized outreach component: the PIs plan to recruit MSc students from the North Carolina Central University ? a historically black university (HBCU). The program will train the students in the unique combination of biochemical and physical methods of modern nanotechnology that are relevant for both industrial and academic careers. Disadvantaged high school students (Project SEED) will participate during the summer months to get a feel for the emerging field of nanoscience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit.  The major theme of the project was developing reliable protocols for fabrication of functional photonic and electronic nanostructures using bioinspired molecular assembly methods. The majority of the steps in the nanostructure fabrication were performed in water solutions using techniques recently established by the principal investigators and their teams.  In one of the main results, metallic nanoparticle were selectively attached to the æDNA origamiÆ template through molecular recognition; optically active molecules were then attracted to the nanoparticles forming a plasmonic (optical) resonator; Raman spectra (a type of optical signals) of these molecules were measured. Based on the enhancement of the optical signatures of the molecules, the group was able to identify the enhancement of electromagnetic (optical) fields at the "hot spots" formed in the nanoparticle resonators.  In another main result, it was shown that nanoparticles made from metal Rhodium resonate in the ultra-violet spectrum range. These nanoparticles were shown to enhance the Raman spectra in the UV range (UV Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, or UV-SERS).  The self-assembling nanoparticle structures resulting from this study may be used to make selective and sensitive biochemical detectors. To that end, the nanostructures may be chemically functionalized, so that they acquire selective affinity to a certain chemical agent. As the chemical attaches to the surface, it will be recorded by measuring the optical spectrum of the nanostructures. Due to the extraordinary charge sensitivity of the Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, chemically functionalized nanoparticle assemblies may be used for environmental sensing on the single-molecule level.        Broader Impacts. The program may lead to development of alternative, cheaper (most steps are in aqueous solution) and more versatile fabrication methods for making composite bio-nano-devices.
