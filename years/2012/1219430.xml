<AbstractNarration>More than a million juvenile suspects are arrested annually and taken into custody. Prior to any confessions or other statements, they must be informed of their Constitutional rights against self-incrimination via Miranda warnings. Juvenile warnings vary in how they are presented (i.e., oral, written, or both) and in their reading levels. Using representative juvenile Miranda warnings, this project is the first to examine how much juveniles understand and apply to their decision-making about whether to exercise their Constitutional rights. The project uses two relevant samples: at-risk youth in juvenile justice alternative education and juvenile detainees in custody. The project also investigates several misconceptions about Miranda warnings that can nullify any rational reasoning about Constitutional protections. For example, many adolescents believe that their silence can be used as incriminating evidence, which might affect their decision whether to talk to police. Two aspects of Miranda misconceptions are studied: (1) their initial beliefs and (2) any improvements as a result of being Mirandized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has far-reaching implications for public policy and appellate court decisions. In 2010, the American Bar Association recognized the national problem of providing juvenile suspects with Miranda warnings they could not understand. This project should assist their initiative for by identifying current problems in the administration of juvenile advisements. The U.S. Supreme Court has recently decided several cases, which established that juveniles be dealt with differently in light of their maturity and intellectual development.  In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court directly addressed juvenile Miranda issues, holding that juvenile suspects are not "miniature adults" and that age is relevant in considering the validity of Miranda waivers. The current research will help to inform the state and federal courts regarding the potential provision of additional Miranda protections for juvenile offenders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  Juvenile arrests in the United States, despite a downward trend in the last decade, still surpass one million per year, including more than 65,000 preteens and more than 400,000 in their early teens (12-15 years). The numbers of juveniles given Miranda warnings is not known, but assumed to be very large.  To protect Constitutional rights against self-incrimination, juveniles must be told their rights in "clear and unequivocal terms" (Miranda v. Arizona, 1966, pp. 467-468). If juveniles decide to cooperate with the police, this should be a knowing and intelligent decision.  Important Findings  1. Are there different juvenile Miranda warnings?  This research has found more than 300 different juvenile Miranda warnings currently being used in the United States. These warnings tend to be very long. When looking at warnings and waivers (i.e., the part asking juveniles to give up their rights), 40% exceeded 225 words with averaged 322 words. When given verbally, 225 words are far beyond juveniles' ability to remember. When warnings are given in written form, another major problems occurs. More than half of these warnings require at least an 8th grade education, which is far beyond many juveniles' reading ability. Even worse, 5% require some college education for adequate understanding.  2. How much can juveniles remember of a typical juvenile Miranda warning?  Miranda warnings have 5 basic components and most are give verbally to juveniles. The good news is that more than 80% can recall their basic rights to silence and to a lawyer. The bad news in that less than half can remember the other 3 components. Only about one-third has any memory about free legal services for those who can't afford them. The percent drops to 20% for any recall that they can assert their Miranda rights at a later time.  3. Do juveniles have serious misconceptions that impair their ability to decide?  Substantial percentages of juveniles fail to reason accurately about their Miranda rights. When it comes to talking to the police, more than half of immature juveniles wrongly believe that the officers are out to help them and not to convict them. In addition, one-third inaccurately thought that they were suppose to talk to police simply because they were persons of authority. Nearly all juveniles cannot afford through their families to retain their own lawyers; instead, they must rely on those appointed by the court. However, more than half of detained juveniles believe they should not trust these attorneys because they can tell the judges everything that the juveniles have said. In summary, there are no reasons to exercise your rights if the police are going to help you and court-appointed attorneys are going to hurt you.  Broader Impacts of this Research  This research has become a primary impetus for reforming juvenile Miranda warnings. In 2010, the American Bar Association changed its policy. It called for a national reform with the goal of simplifying Miranda warnings for juvenile offenders.  This research laid the groundwork for improving how Miranda evaluations are conducted. Using these data, standardized methods were developed and tested. Psychologists and other professionals now have scientifically tested measures to improve both general and juvenile assessments of Miranda-relevant issues.
