<AbstractNarration>The proposed research focuses on applying Floer-theoretic invariants to study objects in low-dimensional topology and contact geometry.  The first project develops combinatorial approaches to symplectic field theory.  The foundation for this study is a combinatorial formulation of Legendrian contact homology for Seifert fibered spaces which will be used to explore Legendrian knot theory in rational homology three-spheres. The second project studies generalizations of the notion of knot genus. We will develop techniques for studying non-orientable surfaces in link complements, adapting existing Heegaard Floer invariants to detect minimal-complexity non-orientable surfaces.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without the sensory apparatus to detect quantum phenomena, our experience of the universe is as a three-dimensional physical space or as a four-dimensional spacetime; this project studies the properties and interactions of three-, and four-dimensional mathematical objects called manifolds. The last decade has seen success in studying these objects using techniques from Floer theory, a powerful yet technically difficult approach. One of the primary goals of the proposed research is developing versions of Floer-theoretic tools which are easier to use.  This will facilitate the study of low-dimensional manifolds  and shed new light on the original constructions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project lead to new results on the theory of knots in three-dimensional spaces, an area of study with close ties to other branches of pure mathematics as well as emerging applications to the physical sciences.  As proposed, the project focused on Legendrian knot theory, a field which studies the behavior of knots subject to rigidity conditions which arise naturally in mathematical models of the physical world.  The local behavior of such models is uniform, whereas the global behavior can vary widely; this project studied Legendrian knot theory in settings characterized by a prescribed global structure known as a "Seifert fibering".     The project developed theory and tools for the further study of Legendrian knots in Seifert fibered spaces. It established the existence of certain geometric behaviors which had previously been conjectured, but not confirmed.  A further outcome of the project is a new approach for computing "classical invariants"; although these are defined in a very general setting, the project introduced combinatorial and diagrammatic tools which facilitate the computation of these numerical invariants for Legendrian knots in Seifert fibered spaces.  This also resolved an open question, posed in 1992, about how to extend an existing diagrammatic technique for presenting knots to the context of Seifert fibered spaces.
