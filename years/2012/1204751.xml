<AbstractNarration>The Florida Advanced Technological Education (FLATE) Center is a statewide ATE Regional Center for Advanced Technological Education that supports manufacturing and its related technology sectors. This project includes three goals as an extension and expansion of FLATE's efforts to: implement a statewide unified education system for manufacturing so that manufacturing education is a convergent curriculum that optimizes technician preparation; provide an effective outreach platform for high school, community college, industry, and legislature access, providing information about the requirement for and impact of manufacturing education in Florida; and present professional development opportunities for STEM educators to develop, refine, and certify their knowledge within manufacturing and its enabling technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: FLATE's focus is on three important areas: (i) Curriculum: The Associate of Science (A.S.) degree in Engineering Technology has integrated the national MSSC-CPT certification and the Manufacturing Skills Standards Council Certified Production Technician credential.  This represents the first statewide articulation for a national industry credential. (ii) Professional Development:  The Engineering Technology Forum is an exemplary model for collaborative professional development. The Forum meets at different Florida State and Community Colleges with a flexible agenda that meets a variety of needs within the College system. (iii) Outreach:  The Made in Florida campaign is FLATE's award-winning dissemination platform that uses as its public information window www.madeinflorida.org . Made in Florida is a comprehensive combination of industry tours, videos, STEM student/teacher summer camps, career pathways, recognition awards, student-focused web site, outreach/dissemination events, FLATE FOCUS (a monthly newsletter), and statewide advertorials that are all partially supported by Florida industry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: FLATE makes a significant impact on the broader aspects of technical education in Florida. It has developed a method for filtering course, certificate, and degree program content that the Florida Department of Education has delegated to FLATE to apply to new Engineering Technology- based program submissions. FLATE has demonstrated an effective way for community colleges to work directly with Workforce Florida - supported Banner Centers in order to optimize technical workforce education and training efforts statewide. It has included the Manufacturers Association of Florida in an awareness campaign that is instrumental in elevating manufacturing careers as necessary for Florida's economic well being. It has also created a pathway to the ET A.S. Degree program that allows high school students to earn 15 credit hours toward the A.S. Degree.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ FLATE's, the Florida Advanced Technology Education Center for Manufacturing, mission is to be the "go-to" organization for manufacturing and advanced technical education, best practices, and resources supporting the high performance skilled workforce for Florida's advanced manufacturing sectors.   Intellectual Merit : FLATE's activities advance knowledge as framed in its mission.  Curriculum Reform/Development:  Grant activities capitalize on the FLATE built statewide-manufacturing education system with a convergent curriculum that optimizes technician preparation in manufacturing and its enabling technologies.  This nationally recognized model includes: a single statewide engineering technology (ET) associate in science (AS) degree program; completely articulated program structured on a set of core technical courses; alignment with stackable industry credentials endorsed by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and offered by the Manufacturing Skill Standards Council (MSSC); and, for current Certified Production Technician (CPT) credential holders, degree completion with 45 credits rather than 60.   The ET AS degree program was implemented in 2007, at three colleges.  Today, 24 of the 28 Florida community and State Colleges offer the ET AS Degree; Florida Department of Education enrollment data, indicates a favorable trend from 9 in 2007-08 to 2,027 in 2018-19.  This strong enrollment growth also indicates the degree?s popularity with statewide employers and its stable, college orchestrated, student recruitment platforms.   Broader Impacts: FLATE's intellectual merit contributions are framed the grant's broader impacts.   Outreach Initiatives: FLATE has effective outreach platforms for Florida's industry, secondary and post-secondary educational facilities. A 2019-2020 activities effort provides these partners access to legislative information related to the requirements impacting manufacturing education.  For broad public awareness, FLATE maintains online dissemination channels that include: fl-ate.org; MadeinFlorida.org; flate.pbworks.com; and a monthly online newsletter, the flate-mif.blogspot.com.

One example, the All-Girls Robotics Camps, includes girl camp scholarships; resources for female recruitment; and FLATE's designed, story-boarded, and produced Women in Manufacturing (WIM) video with its teacher resource guide.   Professional Development: FLATE's Intellectual Merit related activities generated specific Professional Development (PD) that also amplified the grant's Broader Impacts.  Impact activities relate to ET degree long term success and sustainability as it relates specifically to faculty within the ET AS Degree community and the STEM community at large.   The Engineering Technology (ET) Forum, coordinated by FLATE, is the premiere Florida State College system faculty two-day bi-annual PD event. The FLATE model for curricula topic forum provides a viable means for industry and educators across the state to meet to discuss common interests and issues surrounding the education of tomorrow's advanced manufacturing workforce.
