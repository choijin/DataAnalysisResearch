<AbstractNarration>This project aims to achieve key technology, infrastructure, and&lt;br/&gt;regulatory science advances for next generation medical systems based&lt;br/&gt;on the concept of medical application platforms (MAPs). A MAP is a&lt;br/&gt;safety/security-critical real-time computing platform for: (a)&lt;br/&gt;integrating heterogeneous devices and medical IT systems, (b) hosting&lt;br/&gt;application programs ("apps") that provide medical utility through the&lt;br/&gt;ability to both acquire information and update/control integrated&lt;br/&gt;devices, IT systems, and displays. The project will develop formal&lt;br/&gt;architectural and behavioral specification languages for defining&lt;br/&gt;MAPs, with a focus on techniques that enable compositional reasoning&lt;br/&gt;about MAP component interoperability and safety. These formal&lt;br/&gt;languages will include an extensible property language to enable the&lt;br/&gt;specification of real-time, quality-of-service, and attributes&lt;br/&gt;specific to medical contexts that can be leveraged by code generation,&lt;br/&gt;testing, and verification tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will work closely with a synergistic team of clinicians,&lt;br/&gt;device industry partners, regulators, and medical device&lt;br/&gt;interoperability and safety standard organizations to develop an open&lt;br/&gt;source MAP innovation platform to enable key stakeholders within the&lt;br/&gt;nation's health care ecosphere to identify, prototype, and evaluate&lt;br/&gt;solutions to key technology and regulatory challenges that must be&lt;br/&gt;overcome to develop a commodity market of regulated MAP components.&lt;br/&gt;Because MAPs provide pre-built certified infrastructure and building&lt;br/&gt;blocks for rapidly developing multi-device medical applications, this&lt;br/&gt;research has the potential to usher in a new paradigm of medical&lt;br/&gt;system that significantly increases the pace of innovation, lowers&lt;br/&gt;development costs, enables new functionality by aggregating multiple&lt;br/&gt;devices into a system of systems, and achieves greater system safety.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In medicine, clinicians currently deliver therapy by manually coordinating collections of independently developed devices. With many devices marketed today already including some form of network connectivity, it becomes increasingly possible to automate device coordination via external control applications. Ideally, future medical devices would support plug &amp; play protocols which would allow clinicians to construct networks of medical devices that automatically interoperate to automate routine clinical workflows.  This vision can be realized through the concept of a "clinical app," which would describe information flows between devices and the logic of coordination.  While such plug-and-play automation may reduce the burden on clinicians and reduce medical errors, it also brings new hazards that need to be overcome: if interoperation silently fails, the patient can be harmed.  Therefore, such on-demand systems need to be designed using safety-assured techniques and go through the regulatory approval process, which should apply to devices used in an on-demand system, as well as clinical apps themselves.  The challenge of the regulatory approval for these on-demand systems lies in their open nature: it is unrealistic to certify each new interoperable device that comes on the market with every app that may be able to use this device, and to certify each new app with respect to every available device of a required type.  We believe that a certified medical application platform (MAP) would allow us to avoid this conundrum.  Our research results from this project suggest that a MAP, supported by an ecosystem of clinical apps, certified for safety based on their models, and of medical devices, certified for compliance with the MAP, would be sufficient to guarantee safety of any system instance deployed on the MAP.  We have developed a pattern for a safety assurance argument for MAP-deployed clincial apps.  The two key technological innovations developed in this project are a language for precisely specifying the architecture and resource requirements of a clinical app, and a MAP prototype that can be automatically configured to execute the clinical app based on this specification.  The salient aspect of this work is that the MAP accepts deployment of only those apps that can be correctly executed, which is the key claim in the safety assurance argument for a deployed app.  The project also developed a set of requirements for an alarm system in a MAP.  Alarms are needed to alert users of the on-demand system of abnormal situations that, if left unattended, can harm the patient.  Alarms are app-specific, which means that the alarm system needs to be configured using the app specification.  We performed fault tree analysis for a MAP used to deploy on-demand systems, and showed how such a generic fault tree is instantiated for specific apps.  The outcomes of the project thus lay the foundation for the development and deployment of safe clinical apps.  App design environment and the MAP prototype, developed in this project, may serve as the basis for technology transfer in building an ecosystem for on-demand clinical systems.  Furthermore, findings of this project are not limited to the medical domain.  The same platform-based and ecosystem-supported design paradigm can be applied to other domains where dynamically deployable on-demand systems may be needed.
