<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to advance a coupled atomistic-continuum simulation method to explore slip transfer at grain boundaries. Lack of such a method is a current obstacle to progress towards developing constitutive relations that reflect the structure and behavior of grain boundaries, for example in polycrystal plasticity. The problem is complicated by the need to account for long range interactions of dislocation fields while also considering the atomic-level structural detail of the interface.  This research will explore processes of sequential dislocation reactions with bicrystal interfaces by maintaining full atomistic resolution of the interface reactions and successively coarse graining the field description away from the interfaces at distances that are normally inaccessible to fully resolved molecular dynamics. Such a capability will enable parametric studies of dislocation-grain boundary slip transfer reactions over the full range of grain boundary degrees of freedom, including tilt and twist boundaries, as well as asymmetric boundaries that often have faceted structure and can give rise to profuse dislocation nucleation. Nanotwinned structures with a wide range of twin spacing will also be considered. This work will use state-of-the-art embedded atom method potentials which have proven quite accurate for fcc metals such as Cu in modeling various aspects of dislocation nucleation, formation of stacking faults, and dislocation interactions &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will advance a computational method that couples fully atomistic descriptions of nanoscale metallic behavior to mesoscale and macroscale constitutive behavior. It will permit study of the complex interactions that occur between dislocations and grain boundaries in polycrystalline metals which will lead to physics-based predictive constitutive models for metals. This research will advance the multiscale modeling of metals and lead to improved simulation and ultimately design of materials. Results of the research will be incorporated into graduate courses at both institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ By combining strengths in the McDowell group at Georgia Tech in atomistic modeling of interfaces and dislocations with the pioneering work in the Chen group at the University of Florida on coarse-grained atomistic field theory, this research has pushed the frontiers of modeling defects in crystals under both quasistatic and dynamic loading conditions. The resulting body of work serves to bridge from discrete atomistic modeling to continuum modeling of discrete mixed dislocations interacting with interfaces such as grain boundaries, addressing both long range (continuum) and short range (atomistic) effects. This bridging research is unique and fundamental; although molecular dynamics (MD) is the most common class of models employed to simulation crystalline defects such as dislocations at small scales, MD simulations are limited to very small nanoscale sizes.   Coarse-grained atomistic modeling methods such as Concurrent Atomistic-Continuum (CAC) can address larger sizes and can provide more complete understanding of specimen size effects and response of laboratory scale specimens. The program has focused on advances of both dynamic and quasistatic forms and implementations of CAC.  Transformational capabilities developed and documented in this research program include quasistatic simulations of the influence of grain boundaries on slip transfer between grains at length scales that are compatible with length scales of laboratory thin film specimens employed in transmission electron microscopy.  Such studies can enable advances in modeling slip transfer between grains in continuum polycrystal plasticity. We have also applied the CAC method to model dynamic inelastic deformation of anisotropic crystalline materials from the atomic scale to mesoscales of hundreds of nanometers; these shock phenomena are not directly accessible discrete dislocation models or MD.  One graduate student, Shuozhi Xu, has been supported by this project at Georgia Tech.  Mr. Xu has actively collaborated with the Chen group at the University of Florida.  In addition to the direct impact of the technical work outlined in the project summary, results of this study have been incorporated in two graduate courses taught regularly by McDowell at Georgia Tech, one on Mechanics and of Nanostructured Materials and Devices, and one titled Advanced Constitutive Relations for Solids.
