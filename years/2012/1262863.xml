<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of Cincinnati that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014- 2016. The program focuses on sensory ecology -- the study of how animals acquire and respond to information about their environment-- which integrates the experimental and mechanistic study of sensory processes with the conceptual approaches of ecology, evolution and behavior. The Department of Biological Sciences has 11 faculty in a new research focus area - Sensory Biology, Behavior and Evolution (SBBE) - who serve as mentors in a tiered multi- level mentoring program along with graduate students and post-docs in a team environment. There is a wide range of very interesting and exciting projects for the students, ranging from neurobiology to behavioral ecology. Students are expected to do full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and various workshops, such as the responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. REU students have access to a rich array of individual mentor's research facilities as well as many interdepartmental labs and centers such as the UC Chemistry department, and collaborating institutions such as Cincinnati Zoo Center for Research on Endangered Wildlife, UC / Cincinnati Children's Hospital Biomedical Research Center and the UC Center for Field Studies field station. The program's multi-phase recruitment effort consists of both traditional "hard copy" formats as well as digital-based advertising, and visits to regional college campuses. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool available to BIO-funded REU PIs. More information is available by visiting http://www.artsci.uc.edu/departments/biology/undergrad/REU.html, or by contacting the PI (Dr. George Uetz at george.uetz@uc.edu).</AbstractNarration>

We created a structured program of multi-level mentoring in research and an educational program in professional development to develop students conceptual and professional skills and prepare them for graduate school or careers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our REU program at the University of Cincinnati provided a 10-week summer program to introduce 36 undergraduates to multidisciplinary research, built around the theme of Sensory Ecology.</p> <p><strong><em>Highlights include</em></strong><em>:</em></p> <ul> <li>36% REU students were from underrepresented groups</li> <li>69% REU students were female</li> <li>67% REU students from primarily undergraduate or HBCU institutions</li> <li>13 REU students are now in graduate school in biology</li> <li>7 REU students are in science related careers (e.g., professional technical positions)</li> <li>4 REU students&nbsp;co-authored peer-reviewed publications and at least 3 more are imminent (one under revision, one submitted, one to be submitted in 2018).</li> <li>5 co-authorships on presentations at scientific conferences</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Key outcomes:</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Obj. 1. Establish a tiered, multilevel mentoring system </em></strong>that allowed undergraduates to have direct contact with research faculty early in their career, acquaint them with graduate students and postdocs in the labs, and experience the excitement of a team environment in an active research lab. This approach was successful and is a model for future programs. There was a great deal of interaction between REU undergraduates and UC graduate students and faculty mentors. The level of enthusiasm by the students toward their experience in the lab and in the final poster symposium, as well as by the faculty indicates this objective was achieved.</p> <p><strong><em>Obj. 2. Engage students in professional development. </em></strong>Educational activities were conducted as a group, through weekly discussions and lab related demonstrations of cutting-edge research techniques. These activities were designed to be interactive and to covered a wide variety of topics each year; e.g., Lab Safety Training; Introduction to Sensory Ecology and faculty research projects; Ethics in Science: Responsible Conduct of Research, Animal Care; Hypothesis testing, experimental design and data analysis; Effective oral/poster presentation; Career options, resumes, recommendation letters; Graduate school applications, graduate student panel discussion. Other activities included midsummer research update talks open to the whole department, and a joint poster symposium with other UC REU Site programs (Chemistry, Psychology).</p> <p><strong><em>Obj. 3. To improve recruitment and retention of undergraduates from underrepresented groups in&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>STEM disciplines. </em></strong>We targeted sophomore/junior level students at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUI) within 500 miles of Cincinnati, with a special focus on minority students. Consequently, our recruitment efforts resulted in an applicant pool that was diverse in terms of race/ethnicity, geographical background, level in school, and institution size (PUI, Research 1).&nbsp; We selected and successfully recruited 36 students from diverse geographic and ethnic backgrounds, most from predominantly PUIs. With approximately 70-100 applicants each year, we recruited outstanding students from all over the U.S., with an average GPA of 3.68. The applicant pool (324) was 34% male and 66% female, with 52% white, 9% African-American, 7.4% Asian, 4.3% Hispanic, 1.2% biracial and 26% not reporting. Our participants (11 males and 25 females) had the following ethnic breakdown: 60% white, 22% African-American, 8% Asian, 11% Hispanic, and 3% biracial. In addition, we had a mix of students from small and large institutions - 21 small liberal arts colleges, 3 HBCU schools, and 12 Research universities.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual merit. </strong>Evidenced by the research projects conducted by each of the students, in conjunction with the participating faculty members and their research groups, and by the research results coming from these projects. Each student contributes to scientific knowledge through a presentations and/or publication.</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts.&nbsp;</strong>Success was achieved in all three main objectives of the program: (1) scientific mentoring; (2) professional development; (3) recruitment of underrepresented minorities. Impacts arise from both research participation and&nbsp; development of&nbsp; REU students as young professional scientists through a range of educational activities. The focus on minority recruiting has strengthened the pool of underrepresented groups in the graduate training pipeline for biological sciences.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the end of the program each year, we administered the URSSA survey to&nbsp; students. Results show a sizeable majority (70-90%) reported they gained a "good deal" or "great deal" in application of scientific knowledge to their research work. Likewise, a similar majority of respondents (70-90%) reported that they gained either a good deal or a great deal in terms of personal growth. Respondents were highly positive with respect to the overall research experience (20% good, 80% excellent), and in response to specific areas such as mentoring, participation in meaningful research, interactions with others, and advice about careers/graduate school. A majority of respondents (&gt;80%) were satisfied or highly satisfied with their REU experience.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/24/2018<br>      Modified by: George&nbsp;W&nbsp;Uetz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262863/1262863_10253736_1540406888481_IMG_2286--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262863/1262863_10253736_1540406888481_IMG_2286--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Chrissy Horton w/poster"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262863/1262863_10253736_1540406888481_IMG_2286--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Chrissy Horton w/poster"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Undergrad Chrissy Horton explains the effect of leaf moisture on chemically-mediated courtship behavior of wolf spiders.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephanie Rollmann</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">George&nbsp;W&nbsp;Uetz</div> <div class="imageTitle">Chrissy Horton w/poster</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262863/1262863_10253736_1540407024797_IMG_2289--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262863/1262863_10253736_1540407024797_IMG_2289--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Juan Capeles-Cordero w/poster"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262863/1262863_10253736_1540407024797_IMG_2289--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Juan Capeles-Cordero w/poster"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Juan Capeles-Cordero discusses the potential role of gravisensation in the butterfly righting response</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephanie Rollmann</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">George&nbsp;W&nbsp;Uetz</div> <div class="imageTitle">Juan Capeles-Cordero w/poster</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262863/1262863_10253736_1540407167286_IMG_2295--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262863/1262863_10253736_1540407167286_IMG_2295--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ken Hale w/poster"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262863/1262863_10253736_1540407167286_IMG_2295--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ken Hale w/poster"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ken Hale presents his poster on color dependence of visual motion detection in fiddler crabs at the REU Symposium.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephanie Rollmann</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">George&nbsp;W&nbsp;Uetz</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ken Hale w/poster</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262863/1262863_10253736_1540407346273_IMG_2285--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262863/1262863_10253736_1540407346273_IMG_2285--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Isabella Geeding at poster session"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262863/1262863_10253736_1540407346273_IMG_2285--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Isabella Geeding at poster session"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Isabella Geeding presneting her poster on crypsis and conspicuousness in jumping spider coloration to faculty at the REU Poster Symposium.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephanie Rollmann</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">George&nbsp;W&nbsp;Uetz</div> <div class="imageTitle">Isabella Geeding at poster session</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
