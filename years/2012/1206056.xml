<AbstractNarration>The main thrust of the research program of the Louisiana Tech (LaTech) Particle Physics Group (PPG) involves parity violating electron scattering, a program of which will challenge our understanding of nucleon structure, probe the dynamics of QCD symmetry breaking, and provide precision tests of the Standard Model. Four parity violating electron scattering programs at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF), the G0, Qweak, PVDIS and a future Moller measurement after the 12 GeV TJNAF upgrade, represent parity violation measurements covering a broad range of momentum transfers from 0.03 - 2.0 (GeV/c) squared.  These measurements will investigate ground state nucleon properties and properties of the nucleon during its transition to excited states, provide precision tests of the Standard Model, and constrain weak quark couplings to unprecedented levels.  Each of these experiments is sensitive to unique and interesting physics, and together constitute a program of parity violation experiments in which the Louisiana Tech PPG group plays a critical role.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will allow the LaTech PPG group to continue to make major contributions to physics research, transfer technology from basic science to engineering applications, and enhance the educational opportunities for undergraduate students, local high school students and teachers, providing an excellent avenue for recruiting students into scientific disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We believe today that there are two types of matter, Quarks and Leptons.  There exist as far as we know now 6 quarks and 6 leptons.  To make normal matter such as protons and neutrons we need to cluster together 3 quarks mediated by the strong force which is one of the four fundamental forces.   It is now a well-established fact that normal nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks.  This grant has supported present and future experiments at Jefferson Lab to investigate the quark structure of protons and neutrons. In particular, these experiments will explore how electrons scatter from the proton and from other electrons in a way which will test the fundamental theoretical model of physics, called the Standard Model. These experiments will help to advance the field of nuclear and particle physics, as well as provide a world class education to the graduate and undergraduate students working on those projects.   In the electron scattering experiments at Jefferson Laboratory in which the Louisiana Tech group is involved, many new physical observables will be mesured.  The physics available from these measurments include measurements of inherent properties of the weak interaction, allowing us to test predictions of the Standard Model of Particles and Interactions, and in particular the weak interaction parameter. Addition measurements allow us to probe the internal structure of protons and neutrons, providing tests of predictions from existing theoretical models.
