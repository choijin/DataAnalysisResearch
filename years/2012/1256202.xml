<AbstractNarration>1256202&lt;br/&gt;Khan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program grant support acquistion of a portable hyperspectral camera system (near infrared) to support research and education at UH.   The instruments will augment other digital geologic mapping tools (TLS) at the University of Houston.  The instrument will support research and research training that would benefit from the capability to spectroscopically characterize geologic outcrops in support of neotectonic studies with the goals of mapping the distribution of melt channels beneath ancient mid-ocean rides (from ophiolite studies),  developing 3D fluid flow models, understanding rock alterations and sulphide mineralization.  The requested systems will complement an extant Terrestrial Laser Scanner for studies of fundamental geological processes, natural hazard mitigation and energy resource exploration and processes for TLS and hyperspectral data fusion will be developed. The instrument will serve graduate students and post-doctoral researchers working with the PIs and other faculty at UH and support undergraduate eduction through incorporation into a geology field camps offered by the University of Houston at Yellowstone Bighorn Research Alliance (YBRA) site in Red Lodge, Montana.  UH is is a minority serving institution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
