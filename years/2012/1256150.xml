<AbstractNarration>The arthropod class Diplopoda (the millipedes) comprises ~12,000 described species that are distributed worldwide in nearly every biome.  The group has a deep evolutionary history that includes some of the very first terrestrial animals, dating from the mid-Silurian over 400 million years ago. Despite their ecological importance as decomposers in forests, wealth of diversity (estimated 20,000-80,000 species), and prominence as chemical warriors owing to their vast array of defense secretions, the group is woefully understudied.  The research team will revise the current ordinal and family-level classification systems using a modern phylogenomic framework based on next generation sequence data and then employ these data to explore the evolution of chemical defense secretions and their precursors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to greatly enhance the accessibility of millipede diversity through the development of a morphological atlas for the group, production of the first illustrated key to millipede families, and publication of the first complete millipede species catalog.  The project team will develop a strong collaborative research and training network and will partner with collaborators worldwide.  Training in millipede systematics, morphology, and genomics will include a broad range of individuals from high school students and teachers, undergraduate researchers, a postdoctoral trainee, to students participating in organized training workshops, to be held in the Southeastern US and in Bangkok, Thailand.</AbstractNarration>

To investigate the 400 Mill years long evolutionary history of the ancient millipedes, extensive field expeditions were conducted, yielding many species from all the 16 millipede orders. Specimens were preserved with the most recent techniques allowing us to generate a wide range of molecular characters. Prior to this project, molecular studies of millipede taxa were limited to sequencing approaches that recovered only a handful of genes. Through the use of next generation sequencing technologies, more than 2,000 genes can be sequenced. This project significantly enhanced the molecular toolkit available for millipede research.&nbsp; The newly generated molecular data were analyzed and yielded a robust phylogeny, informing us who is more closely related to each other among the millipedes. Using the phylogeny we investigated the nature and evolution of the defense secretions that most millipedes produce. A large group of millipedes produces even cyanide. These defense secretions may contain bioactive compounds that may prove to be important for humans; South American monkeys rub some millipedes over their fur, most likely to repel insects. Research into the chemistry of these defense secretions can now advance further; this secretions may be useful for some human applications. Identifying millipedes to species requires a careful analysis of their mating devices, that are the copulatory organs used during mating. In many millipedes, these organs ?glow? in the dark, they fluoresce. Imaging these organs before digital photography was laborious and time consuming, slowing down the research. Using digital photography, imaging specimens under UV light and modern image stacking software (composing one sharp image out of numerous partially sharp images), was greatly advanced in this project. Imaging and identification, description of new species will be sped up. The project generated over 7,500 images illustrating millipede morphology from the antennae, the mouthparts, the copulatory organs to the legs and the features of the hind end of the intestinal track. Several millipede groups produce silk and have spinnerets at the hind body end. Despite their ecological importance as detritivores, millipedes never attracted a large number of researchers. This project attracted the collaboration and interest of over 50 young undergraduate and graduate students from the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Uruguay, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Indonesia. Undergraduates spend a summer internship in our laboratories to get a real research experience. Three intensive training workshops in millipede systematics were conducted at Biostations in North Carolina, Vietnam and Mexico.
