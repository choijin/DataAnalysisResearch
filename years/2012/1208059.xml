<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This project focuses on understanding theoretically the interaction of intense coherent laser radiation with electrons, atoms, and molecules and on investigating the use of ultrashort (attosecond scale) laser or electron pulses to image the time-dependent motion of electrons in atoms and molecules.  The interactions of electrons with both intense laser fields and with atomic and molecular potentials are difficult to describe accurately; also, their interactions with ultrashort laser or electron pulses must be described time-dependently. We have developed a number of theoretical approaches to overcome these difficulties. In particular, we have solved essentially exactly the problem of a weakly bound electron in a short-range potential interacting with an intense laser field and the results obtained for this particular system can be accurately generalized to the case of other, more complex atomic and molecular systems. Our investigations include: (1) using short (attosecond scale) electron pulses as both temporal and spatial probes of electron motion in both atoms and molecules; (2) investigating the utility of using intense lasers to assist or induce electron scattering from atoms, electron recombination with atoms, and electron bremsstrahlung (radiative) processes in the vicinity of atoms; (3) developing analytic formulas for laser-induced high-order harmonic generation for the heretofore analytically unexplored cases of elliptically-polarized laser fields, crossed two-color laser fields, and chirped, few-cycle laser fields, both for atoms and for asymmetric diatomic molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers involved with this project are given a broad education in theoretical atomic physics, first hand experience in all aspects of scientific communication, and in teaching undergraduates at a large Big 10 Land Grant university.  Project results are not only published in leading physics journals and presented at national and international meetings, but are also periodically distilled and integrated with related work by others in review articles written by the PI and collaborators.  All graduate students and postdoctoral researchers involved with this project in the past have been sought after by a variety of other employers, including technology companies, medical researchers, and other leading AMO theory groups. The basic research supported by this project contributes broadly to our understanding of means to control matter on an atomic scale.  Our work on increasing the intensities of high order harmonics may one day lead to sources of coherent x-rays, thus providing a new means for visualizing living biological structures as well as nanoscale material structures. Our investigations involving ultrashort (attosecond) pulses of electrons may lead to ways of resolving electron motion both temporally and spatially. The P.I.'s membership on the American Physical Society's Publications Oversight Committee (2010-2013) and on the Science Advisory Board of the Max Planck Institute on the Physics of Complex Systems (2007-2013), a major theoretical atomic physics center in Dresden, Germany, is evidence of his continuing service to the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has focused on understanding theoretically the interaction of intense coherent laser radiation with electrons, atoms, and molecules and on investigating the use of ultrafast laser or electron pulses to image time-dependent electronic processes in atoms and molecules.  Over one dozen investigations were carried out involving intense laser ionization of electrons from both atoms and molecules, laser-driven harmonic generation from atoms, laser field control of electron-atom scattering, and use of electron impact ionization involving short incident pulses of electrons to image electron motion in both atoms and molecules.   Among the specific accomplishments of the research carried out are: (1) the development of a detailed understanding of Coulomb field effects on intense laser ionization of atoms; (2) the development of new kinds of harmonic generation spectroscopy involving elliptically polarized laser fields that allow a more complete identification of the properties of target atoms and molecules; (3) a proposal to use ultrafast electron impact ionization to image the time-dependent motion of electrons in both atomic and molecular target systems; (4)  the development of a simple, analytic model of intense laser ionization of molecules intended to clarify the dependence on molecular and laser parameters; (5) the prediction of ways to increase the intensity of (Bremsstrahlung) radiation emitted in electron-atom scattering processes; (6) the development of an analytic model of intense laser ionization of atoms; and (7) the development of an analytic determination of the dependence of the yield of high-order harmonic generation on the wavelength of the incident laser field.     Broader impacts of this project include significant training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in state-of-the-art theoretical atomic, molecular, and optical physics.  Specifically, one graduate student supported by this project has become an expert on ultrafast electron diffraction, and another one has become expert on the analysis of high-order harmonic generation produced by short pulses of laser light of different wavelengths.  The two postdocs supported by this grant have greatly advanced knowledge of low-energy electron scattering in the presence of intense laser fields.  The P.I. of this grant has disseminated results of the research accomplished in invited talks at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2013 and at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara in 2014.  Moreover, the students and postdocs supported by this project have given numerous contributed talks both at national meetings and at various physics department seminars.
