<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This project documents two endangered and little-studied languages of Gran Chaco, South America: Pilagá (Guaycuruan) and Nivacle (Mataco-Mataguayan). It undertakes grammatical and lexical analyses of Nivacle, and comparative analyses of Pilagá and Nivacle grammatical structures and lexicon, also with an eye to what is known about other Chaco languages. Joint work on these languages is motivated by the fact that the traditional Nivacle territory extended from the mid-Pilcomayo River to the Bermejo River, partially overlapping Pilagá and Wichí (Mataco-Mataguayan) territories in northern Argentina. In this region there is evidence of potentially non-genetic diffusion of features. Pilagá is spoken by about 5,000 people; Nivacleì is spoken by fewer than 1,000 people in Argentina. There are more Nivacleì speakers in Paraguay, but language shift to Spanish is rapid, especially among the younger generations and especially among women married to criollo men. Field research is mostly in Argentina, with visits to Nivacleì communities in Paraguay to develop a better understanding of linguistic history and dialect variation. Analyses are undertaken in the field, and at universities in Argentina and Oregon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Documentation under this project includes recording and videotaping of verbal performances to create a representative sample of genres. Some documentary materials were previously collected for Pilagaì, but some were suboptimal for archiving, have not been fully analyzed or prepared for archiving, and extant materials are incomplete as far as genres; the current project addresses these issues. There has been little prior modern linguistic work on, or documentation of Nivacle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes will include an archived corpus of 20 hours of video and audio recordings, databases with from five to ten hours per language of translated and analyzed elicited and text materials, and tri- or quadri-lingual lexical databases (Pilagaì, Nivacleì, Spanish, English). It will enable open access to materials for speakers and the linguistic community, ethical considerations permitting. Focused analyses investigate the grammatical constructions of Nivacle and compare Pilagaì-Nivacleì grammatical and lexical issues. The results increase understanding of diffusion of structural features and lexica, as opposed to inheritance of features from proto-languages in the Chaco region. The project investígates internal divisions and influences among Chaco languages. It amplifies knowledge of world-wide patterns in expressing possession, ways of classifying in-view/out-of-view objects, the development of tense/aspect from determiners, grammatical relations and stative/active systems, and other linguistic features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The documentary cultural and linguistic materials are of interest and use to the language communities for their education and language revitalization goals, and will be explained and promoted in community workshops. They are useful to other linguists, educators, anthropologists, and historians. The project provides training for at least three students (two graduate), and for native speakers. Indeed, the project is a joint effort between researchers and the language communities. It further strengthens research partnerships and between the University of Oregon and the Instituto de Investigaciones Lingüísticas of the National University of Formosa, with the potential to create new research opportunities for students of both countries.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project was aimed at the documentation and linguistic analysis of two endangered South American languages spoken in the Chaco, namely, Pilaga&#769; from the Guaykuruan language family and Nivac&#770;le from the Mataguayan family. Project goals included the collection of documentary material which would not only provide a rich empirical basis for scientific linguistic analysis, but which would also be relevant for eventual development of reading and other pedagogical materials with indigenous content for Pilaga&#769; and Nivac&#770;le communities.</p> <p>The project collected four hours of video, 12 hours of separate audio, produced 168 archive-standard pdfs of transcribed texts with translations, eminating from the recordings. The Niva&#265;le recordings come from the most endangered communities in Paraguay (San Jose&#769; de Esteros y San Leonardo) and Formosa, Argentina, whose linguistic varieties have very little previous study and where the language is undergoing rapid attrition. The texts have word-by-word glosses in Spanish (and some texts are further analyzed to the morpheme, or sub-word meaning-unit, level). The texts contain approximately 4400 distinct lexical and grammatical items. In addition approximately 26 scientific journal articles, book chapters, and scholarly presentations, concerned with various linguistics findings, have been produced.</p> <p>The collected documentary materials include Niva&#265;le and Pilaga&#769; personal and autobiographical narratives (anonymized where so-requested), historical narratives, folk stories, descriptions of cultural practices, conversations, interviews, and some verb paradigms and elicited sentences. The texts tell about past and current inter-ethnic contact between the Pilaga&#769;, Niva&#265;le and Wichi&#769; groups; histories of their settlements and the constitution of different (sub-)groups; and also describe present-day preoccupations such as land ownership and group survival; among other topics. Information in the oral texts supports sometimes very fragmentary information found in historical documents left by earlier European travelers and ethnographers about encounters among indigenous Chaco populations. The research findings suggest that a prior period of bilingualism between Pilaga&#769; and Niva&#265;le peoples likely accounts for the structural convergences between the languages (even though now the greatest bilingualism is between speakers of each of these languages and Spanish).</p> <p>In the field of endangered language documentation, the project has reflected in print on the value of co-collaborative research between native speakers and non-native researchers, the benefits of employing a discourse-oriented approach to language documentation, the societal impacts of such documentary activities, and the value of returning documentary information to native speaker communities to strengthen and preserve indigenous knowledge and identity.</p> <p>The data has been archived for long-term preservation in the Archive of Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA) (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/ailla-pilaga">https://tinyurl.com/ailla-pilaga</a>; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ailla-nivacle">https://tinyurl.com/ailla-nivacle</a>), and will be soon be available at the Laboratorio Digital en Lingu&#776;i&#769;stica y Antropolologi&#769;a (DILA) under the auspices of the the National Council of Scientific and technological Research (CONICET) of Argentina (<a href="http://www.caicyt-conicet.gov.ar/dila/">http://www.caicyt-conicet.gov.ar/dila/</a>). Prior to archiving, older legacy Pilaga&#769; materials incorporated into the project were converted to a Unicode-compliant font system. The Pilaga&#769; and Nivac&#770;le text transcriptions have free translations in Spanish and English. Lexical materials and elicited setences all have Spanish translations and most also have English translations. All items have metadata according to archiving standards, are tagged for quality, making them searchable and useful to a variety of researchers and communities.</p> <p>Information from the project relative to the indigenous knowledge, folklore, oral histories and other aspects of the Niva&#265;le and Pilaga&#769; peoples has been disseminated in the Argentinian press (e.g. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/socompa2017-guardianes-lg">https://tinyurl.com/socompa2017-guardianes-lg</a>; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/infobae2020-ataque-pilaga">https://tinyurl.com/infobae2020-ataque-pilaga</a>; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/panorama2019-lg-peligro">https://tinyurl.com/panorama2019-lg-peligro</a>). This knowledge has the potential to impact societal attitudes and the availability and quality of governmental and non-governmental services for the indigenous peoples in the Chaco region. These indigenous peoples have long been marginalized, to the extent that they have sometimes not been accorded the rights of citizens.
