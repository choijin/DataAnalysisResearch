<AbstractNarration>Many problems in enumerative geometry can be reduced to a computation in the cohomology ring of a flag manifold X = G/P.  The structure constants of this ring are ruled by deep and beautiful combinatorics, and their study falls in the intersection of several mathematical disciplines.  For example, when X is a Grassmann variety, these structure constants are the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients that also describe tensor products of representations of GL(n), products of symmetric polynomials, and play a role in numerous other areas ranging from linear algebra to statistics and complexity theory in computer science.  The celebrated Littlewood-Richardson rule expresses any Littlewood-Richardson coefficient as the number of certain combinatorial objects called tableaux.  A more general combinatorial formula, conjectured by Allen Knutson, states that the structure constants of a two-step flag variety are equal to the number triangular puzzles with specified integer labels on the sides.  The investigator hopes to prove this conjecture.  Earlier work of the investigator has established that the structure constants of two-step flag varieties specialize to the Gromov-Witten invariants of Grassmannians, and therefore count the number of rational curves of a fixed degree that meet three Schubert varieties in general position. The Gromov-Witten invariants also determine the structure of the(small) quantum cohomology ring, whose definition is inspired by physics and has relations to mirror symmetry.  A proof of Knutson's conjecture will therefore establish the most precise description of this ring as a fact.  The investigator will also study other questions concerning the K-theory and quantum K-theory of flag manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A typical question in classical algebraic geometry is to identify the complete list of geometric figures of some type that satisfy a list of conditions.  While it can be difficult or impossible to identify the individual figures, it is in many cases possible to say how many there are.  Enumerative geometry is the study of such counting problems as well as methods to solve them.  Powerful techniques have been developed that can translate an enumerative geometric problem into an algebraic problem, so that the number of solution figures is the result of a computation.  However, the combinatorial aspects of an enumerative problem are in most cases best understood in the presence of a formula that makes it clear that the number of solutions is non-negative.  For example, such positive formulas are much more useful for proving general statements about which enumerative problems have any solutions at all.  Surprisingly, positive formulas are significantly more difficult to discover and prove than non-positive formulas.  In return the positive formulas tend to surround themselves with deep combinatorial structures and methods that provide even more insight into the geometric problem than the formulas themselves.  The investigator will attempt to prove a number of positive formulas of this type.  He also plans to write a computer program capable of computing the solutions of a large family of enumerative problems. Examples of this type are important for making progress in the field, and are at the same time very useful for students or others who would like to learn the subject.  Finally, the investigator will continue to engage graduate and undergraduate students in his research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI has studied the enumerative geometry and Schubert calculus of flag manifolds, a field motivated by the ability to determine the number of geometric figures of a specified type that satisfy a list of conditions.  He has written 6 research articles in this area, and has given invited talks about his work at numerous major conferences in USA, Japan, China, Germany, and Poland.  The PI has also created computer software to facilitate research in Schubert calculus, organized conferences, and advised both graduate and undergraduate students on research projects.  Much of the PI's research has concerned longstanding conjectures asserting that the number of curves of a given degree that meet three fixed geometric figures called Schubert varieties is equal to the number of triangular puzzles that can be created using a list of puzzle pieces.  His proof of the most general version of this conjecture is based on a new mutation algorithm that organizes puzzles in a graph structure.  The mutation algorithm is analogous to the classical jeu-de-taquin algorithm for Young tableaux, and it unifies and generalizes all earlier known methods for modifying puzzles, which have been used by several authors to prove significant results about geometry, representation theory, linear algebra, and combinatorics.  The PI has also studied the quantum K-theory ring of flag manifolds, which contains information about enumerative problems where an infinite family of curves meet a collection of Schubert varieties. Many important questions about this ring are still unanswered, such as if products can be expressed using finitely many terms.  The PI's work has answered some of these open questions, and it has significantly reduced the level of sophistication required to approach many other questions, so that they can be attacked by talented graduate students using a combination of basic algebraic geometry and combinatorics.  At the same time his work has revealed that other questions about quantum K-theory are related to difficult problems in algebraic geometry, such as understanding the singularities of the infinite family of curves and proving that it can be explicitly parametrized.  This has opened new channels for communication between Schubert calculus, singularity theory, and birational geometry.  Much of the PI's research involves writing computer programs to compute examples or test conjectures.  A separate goal in this project has been to single out programs that are likely to be useful for other researchers.  Towards this goal the PI has released the Equivariant Schubert Calculator, a Maple package created by rewriting and combining several programs he has written during the last 10 years. This program is able to perform many computations that are commonly needed in research projects in Schubert calculus, and which are not available in other software.  The PI has also continued to maintain earlier programs that he developed, including the Littlewood-Richardson Calculator, which has been widely used and is now incorporated in several mathematics systems, including SAGE and MuPAD-Combinat, as well as the Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora Linux distributions.  The PI has advised both graduate and undergraduate students as part of his research during the grant period.  Two graduate students have completed their PhD degrees with the PI as thesis advisor.  One of these students has done successful research after graduating and now holds a tenure-track faculty position at Chennai Mathematical Institute in India.  The PI is currently the advisor of one graduate student who is on track to submit a PhD thesis about quantum K-theory in the Spring of 2017.  The PI has also supervised four undergraduate students in REU projects at Rutgers University, which examined questions about enumerative geometry and Schubert calculus that can be approached without too much background.  One REU student managed to prove some interesting and surprising results about plethysm of ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
