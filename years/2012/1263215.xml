<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the Division of Medical Sciences at Harvard University that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013-2015. The scientific focus is in the area of cellular and molecular biology.  The main fields in which students conduct research include cell and developmental biology, microbiology, neurobiology, biochemistry, genetics, and virology.  Objectives of this REU are to: (a) increase knowledge of basic biological research; (b) develop students' interest in pursuing research careers; (c) enhance related skills necessary for success; and (d) provide post-program advising and networking. In addition to their research projects, program objectives are attained as students participate in weekly student-faculty research discussions at which they teach each other about their projects, and in a weekly career development series, which covers topics including choosing graduate programs, completing applications, networking, and interviewing.  Special skills sessions on critical reading of the literature and strategies for preparing for GRE exams are also included.  Ethics and responsible conduct of research topics cover experimental documentation, research fraud and misconduct, image manipulation, and ethical issues related to lab life.  Students participate in a peer advising/mentoring program with current graduate students and are provided additional opportunities to meet other research faculty and graduate students in both academic and social settings.  Participants are recruited from a nation-wide pool, with emphasis on recruiting students interested in research careers and on recruiting members of under-represented minority groups and those who have few research opportunities on their home campuses.  Selection is based on statements of interest, recent academic achievement and preparation in science courses, recommendations, and previous research experience. Several mechanisms of formative and summative evaluation are employed and will include an assessment tool common to REU programs.  Program alumni receive twice-yearly newsletters, contact information about each other, and open access to continued advising and counseling by the REU program director, their individual research advisors, and their peer mentors. Follow-up activities facilitate effective tracking.  Information about the program can be found at: www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/diversity/Summer.html.   Contacts: Sheila M.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF grant funded students participating in the broader Summer Honors Undergraduate Research Program at Harvard Medical School.  The goal of the grant was to provide research opportunities to students from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences and who have limited access to research.  As such, the program provided 10 week research experiences on the Harvard Medical School campus for undergraduates who were interested in pursuing advanced graduate degrees in the biosciences.  Information about the program was distributed through a variety of mechanisms including online, in person, and through email.  The applicant pool included students from schools across the U.S. including Puerto Rico.  Over the period of funding the average number of applications each year was close to 400.    Participants spent the majority of their time doing research.  Students participated in a wide range of fields in biology.  Areas of research in which they participated included cell biology, neuroscience, microbiology, bioinformatics, molecular biology, genetics, developmental biology, bioengineering, biochemistry, and systems biology.  In addition to research, they also participated in two weekly discussions.  One of these was a weekly research discussion.  This session was designed to build their oral presentation skills, their scientific discussion skills, provide opportunities for students to meet other faculty, and to hear about the work of their peers.  Students gave informal presentations about their projects, answered questions from faculty and peers and also received feedback on their presentations.  The weekly academic and professional development discussions covered a wide variety of topics.  Participants heard from current graduate students who spoke about the process of deciding where to apply, their decision making process, and life as a graduate student at Harvard.  They also heard from faculty who sit on admissions committees about how to put together a competitive application and about the programs at Harvard.    To enhance their understanding of the broad range of careers available to individuals with a PhD in the biosciences, career panel discussions were also held.  They heard from faculty and their path to becoming a professor.  They also heard from various alumni and others who used their Ph.D. to pursue careers in science policy, biotech/pharma, consulting, patent law, science writing/editing, and regulatory affairs.    Finally, the weekly academic and professional development sessions also provided information about the responsible conduct of research, strategies for reading and managing the scientific literature, and discussion on how to give an effective presentation.  They further expanded their professional network by participating in a conference that included other summer students along with faculty and administrators from 33+ schools who are members of the Leadership Alliance Consortium.    For the participants who have graduated from college, 14 are currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Harvard, MIT, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, Berkeley, and UCSF.  Four are enrolled in  MD or MD-PhD programs, 9 are participating in post-baccalaureate research programs prior to applying for PhD or MD-PhD programs and three alumni of the program are working in science-related careers.
