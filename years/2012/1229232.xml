<AbstractNarration>This MRI grant will help support the development of a particle detector being built by an international collaboration of scientists.  The primary objective for the experiment using this detector is the search for new and exotic forms of matter.  Regular matter is made from protons, neutrons and electrons.  Many other types  of particles are known, but some short-lived particles are predicted to exist from theoretical models of the theory of the strong force, called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). When high-energy photons strike a proton target, many particles are produced, and some of these may be the predicted exotic particles such as glueballs or hybrid mesons.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the process of developing this instrumentation, physicists train students in the use of high-technology equipment and electronics.  Some of these students go on to develop new uses of the technology, such as the diagnostic equipment used in many hospitals, including MRI, CAT and PET scanners.  The economic impact of a highly-trained workforce is well-documented. The development of this equipment will train students with high technology skills that are needed in today's marketplace, while adding to our understanding of QCD.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to built a detector (Forward Tagger) for the detectiion of forward going electrons at CLAS12 in Hall B at Jefferson Lab.  The Forward Tagger system consist of a calorimeter (PbWO crystals), (plastic scintillators) hodoscopes and tracking(Micromegas) devices that will be added to the standard CLAS12 equipment. This system will detect the scattered electrons in the angular range &theta;e&prime; = 2.5? &minus; 4.5? and energy range Ee&prime; = 0.5 &minus; 4.5 GeV and fully determine the energy (&nu; = 6.5&minus;10.0 GeV) and the polarization (P = 70&minus;10%) of the associated quasi-real photon. The system is crucial for the baryon and meson spectroscopy experiments planned for CLAS12. The calorimeter was constructed in Italy by the INFN, Genoa group.  Ohio University was in charge of procuring the tracking (microomegas) from Saclay, France. The hodoscopes (two walls) were designed and built by the University of Glasgow, UK, James Madison University, VA, and Norfolk State University. During the last four year, NSU procured the electronics and performed tests. The fast electronics (of the Daq system) used on the hodoscopes was designed at Jefferson Lab and it was, mostly, built by outside vendors (ACDI).   The system is now assembled at JLab and is ready to be installed in HallB-CLAS12 detector by early 2017.         Last Modified: 10/30/2016       Submitted by: Carlos W Salgado]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
