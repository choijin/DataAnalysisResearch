<AbstractNarration>The project director will lead eight undergraduates each year in a series of open ended research projects that will lead to a research publication in at least half the cases. REU students will form a cohort that will work on related but distinct problems in Combinatorics, Probability, and Probabilistic Combinatorics.  A special focus will be on problems in Universal Cycles and Permutation Patterns.  The problems selected for the students will be contemporary; difficult but tractable; of interest to the wider mathematical community; and lead to more questions with every new result. Students will present their research at the Joint Mathematics Meetings (or another specially targeted meeting).  Every effort will be made to publish the students' work in refereed journals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to use low-threshold high-ceiling research projects in discrete mathematics to engage talented undergraduates in research that they can be proud of later in their careers.  Participants will be able to make a more informed choice about graduate school and the profession as a result of participation.  The organizers will actively involve the students with other NSF initiatives on campus, both funded and as-yet-unfunded. Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;(i) As in the past, REU students will serve as role models to undergraduates in ETSU's proposed NSF-STEP project.&lt;br/&gt;(ii) REU students will inspire, and receive computational assistance from, students in ETSU's Noyce Program.&lt;br/&gt;(iii) The organizers will recruit a cadre of REU students from a diverse set of schools, and facilitate research partnerships across this spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;Students will be selected after a nationwide search, with at least half chosen from schools with limited research opportunities.  The principal investigator will endeavor to further improve the project's record of recruitment of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Three groups of students, from a diverse group of US colleges and universities, were supported through this grant. Eight students participated with full support in each of the summers of 2013, 2014, and 2015.  In addition, 3 self-supported students attended the program, and one came with support from another federal agency, the NIH.   Intellectual Merits:  Publication of papers in refereed journals, and presentation of work at key national and conferences is often used as a measure of the intellectual worth of a mathematical research project.  Students from this reporting period have had seven papers published in refereed journals; have had two more accepted; and two papers are under review.  More papers are under preparation.  Each group of students presented their work at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, the largest meeting of mathematical scientists in the world.  Presentations of their work, either by the students themselves or by the Project PI, were made at 11 other meetings, including three International Permutation Patterns Conferences, the International Random Structures and Algorithms Conference, and two American Mathematical Society Regional Meetings.  Students have gained acceptance into top graduate schools such as Brown University, Carnegie Mellon University, Dartmouth College, North Carolina State University, Rutgers University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, University of Florida,University of Minnesota,  University of New Hampshire, University of Waterloo, and University of Wisconsin.  Broader Impacts:   Three of the students were from underpresented minority groups, and students came from a wide variety of schools.
