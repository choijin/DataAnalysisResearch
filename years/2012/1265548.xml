<AbstractNarration>Diffusion processes are regulated by their diffusivity, which is a "gauge" of how fast the diffusion takes place. These phenomena include heat transfer, expansion of gases, flow of fluids, Newtonian or not, in either homogeneous or composite media, Brownian motions, movement of molecules in cells, etc. In all of them the diffusivity changes as function of the diffusing quantity itself (temperature, gas or fluid density, etc.) and/or its  spacial gradient. If the diffusion coefficient becomes zero at some point, the diffusion stops and the phenomenon is degenerate at that point. If it becomes unbounded, the diffusion is infinitely fast, and the phenomenon is singular at that point. The evolution Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) modeling these phenomena, seldom can be solved explicitly, and exhibit a mathematical behavior, which is not well understood. The project aims at exploring the local and global behavior of solutions of these classes of PDEs.  Issues of continuity, differentiability, sudden vanishing and generation of singularities are investigated by means of measure theoretical techniques, and Harnack-type inequalities. The central idea is that these diffusion processes, evolve with their own intrinsic parabolic geometry, that incorporates the evolving "gauge" of its diffusion. Homogenization in PDEs is an essential tool in understanding the local behavior of composite materials with periodic structures, such as alloys. Several diffusion phenomena in biology occur in periodically structured domains exhibiting multiple scales. An example is the diffusion of the second messengers Calcium and cyclic Guanosine Mono Phosphate (cGMP), in rods and cones in the retina of vertebrates. Both rods and cones exhibit a thickly layered structure, where the layers are folded membranes.  Homogenized limits will be computed for the diffusion of the second messengers in cones. The analytical difficulty is that the domain becomes disconnected as the thickness of the layers/folds goes to zero. The homogenized limit permits one to compute pointwise, the concentration of the second messengers Calcium and cGMP. These in turn control, locally, at the boundary of the folds, the current generated by photons of light entering a cone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this investigation is theoretical in nature, the Partial Differential Equationss considered, originate from physical models such as immiscible fluids (water-oil), non Newtonian flows (thick fluids), phase transition (water-ice-gas), heat transfer (burning of thermal shields), and some issue in mathematical biology (motion of molecules on the surface of living cells). As such they are interdisciplinary, involving mathematicians, physicists engineers, and biologists. These investigations will contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying physical and/or biological phenomena.  The project aims also at introducing new theoretical/mathematical tools because of the non standard nature of these degenerate/singular diffusion phenomena.  Particles move, by diffusion, on the surface of living cells to effect specific functions. For example a receptor, captures a signal from outside a cell and transmit it to its interior to begin a biochemical process. The space-time location and the speed of diffusion of a receptor affect the intensity of the signal and its transduction inside the cell. In the homogenization of cones, the second messengers Calcium and cGMP are the transducers of the outside signal (photons of light) to regulate the current generated by ionic channels on the surface of the folds.  Alteration of these diffusion processes, causes improper functioning of the visual signaling cascade, leading to pathologies (for example age-related macula degeneration). Cones are very fragile and hard to experiment with, calling for mathematical modeling of their behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes of the Project Degenerate and Singular Parabolic Equations These equations arise as model in fluid flows, biomathematics and stochastic  processes. Degeneracy and singularity separate  normal and anomalous  diffusion. Understanding such a transition, impacts on understanding how  non-newtonian fluids (gas, oils, etc) transition from various regimes driven  by different viscosities. The parabolic 1-Laplacian equation is one such equation, and it is of interest  on several accounts. First it is the limit as p goes to 1, in some topology, of  the p-laplacian equation  arising in non-newtonian fluids.  Second,  it describes  the motion by mean curvature of  the level sets of  its solutions.  Thirdly,  it arises the Euler equation of parabolic functionals with linear growth  with respect to of their gradient. These, termed "total variation flows",   are naturally set in the space of functions of Bounded Variation (BV).   Functions in BV are inherently discontinuous.  For these singular  evolution equations we have found a necessary and  sufficient condition for asolution to be continuous at one point.  Properties of DeGiorgi Classes The DeGiorgi classes [DG]+(-), consist of functions whose  gradient  of  their upper(lower) truncations, is controlled, locally in Lp, by  the  truncations  themselves. The DeGiorgi classes  link  variational functionals  to partial differential equations. Their interest stems from the large class  of seemingly unrelated functions they encompass, and from properties,  such as Holder continuity, and Harnack inequality,  typically regarded as  properties of solutions of elliptic equations.  Thus it appears natural to  ask to what extent they differ from  elliptic equations.   We have expanded the information on these classes by showing that  (i) convex(concave) non-decreasing(increasing) functions of elements in  the [DG]+(-)classes, remain in these classes; (ii) if u is in [DG]- is  non-negative then the logarithm of u is in BMO, and (iii) if u is in[DG]-,  then it satisfies the local higher integrability property.   Wiener-Type Conditions for Q-Minima of Variational Integrals The Wiener criterion gives necessary and sufficient conditions on the structure  of the boundary of a domain for an harmonic function to be continuous up  to the boundary. It is formulated in terms, roughly speaking, of the "electrical" capacity the boundary is capable to hold. The criterion is known also for  solutions of a large class of quasilinear elliptic equations.  It is then natural  to ask whether Wiener-type conditions holds for minima of functionals.  Such a result would say that the boundary behavior is driven by an energy   minimization process rather than a partial differential equation.  We have established that Q-minima of functionals are continuous up to  the boundary if a proper Wiener Integral, compiling the local capacity of the boundary, diverges.  The result is relevant as  it applies to "almost minimisers" of  functionals which need not admit a Euler equation. The significance  is that the structure of the boundary for a minimum to be continuous,  hinges on minimizing a functional, rather than solving an elliptic p.d.e.   Cone Phototransduction Photransduction in cones in the retina of vertebrates, is the process by which  photons of light are transformed into electrical pulses for the brain to "see".  Wet bench experiments are difficult because cones are small and fragile.  As a consequence, experimental data are few and sparse. Mathematical  modeling of phototransduction for cones helps filling these gaps and limits  animal experimentation. It also has a potential impact on eye diseases such  as macula degeneration.  We have generated a mathematical model for phototransduction in cones and  have written a corresponding Finite Element code.  The code is modular, so that  processes can be selectively included and/or excluded. This is the "virtual"  version of knock-out (or transgenic) experiments.  By virtual experiments  we can refine the set of parameters to populate our model.  We  can also  identify that part of the cones where cGMP-gated channels are located.  Their location is important since their closing generates cone vision.  Diffusion of Molecules on Curved Surfaces We have investigated the diffusion of molecules on non-flat cell surfaces.   Manifestation of curvature in membranes are ubiquitous and have observable  biological functionality. Many processes such as recruitment of proteins,  changes in composition of lipids and changes in membrane physical properties  are curvature specific.  The consequence of such a non planar geometry on diffusion is poorly  understood but is highly relevant for cell membranes, which often adopt  complex geometries. To analyze these effects we have created a Finite Element  code starting from the Laplace-Beltrami diffusion on surfaces.  For tubular  geometries of length h and radius r we have established that (i) the equilibration  time grows with h and tends to zero as h tends to 0; (ii) The density increases  as the bottom of the tube grows linearly with the radius r, and  (iii) Compared with a virtual flat geometry, loss of material from the bottom  hemisphere of the tubule, was slower, suggesting a mechanical  constraint exerted on moving particles by a curved geometry.
