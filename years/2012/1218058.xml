<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research project is to transform the way that data visualizations are designed and created to enable more effective, creative, and accessible ways of communicating scientific information using computer graphics. The project enables artists, scientists, engineers, and others to rapidly design, generate, and iteratively refine visualizations of today's most complex datasets. The approach combines novel computational tools that enhance sketching, analogical reasoning, and other creative human design tasks with underlying scientific data and 3D displays. The results include new tools, algorithms, and guidelines, which are evaluated experimentally through challenging applications to biomedical engineering, such as visualizing multidimensional imaging and modeling data to understand interactions between proposed new medical devices and human tissues. These results are significant because they lead to new understandings of how computation and human creativity can be most effectively combined in general, and specifically, how they can be combined to help scientists visualize and understand complex multidimensional data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the work lie in educational efforts integrated with the experimental research and broad applications of the new methods developed. Students from local art and design colleges are educated in scientific methods, opening up new career paths in the sciences for these visual experts. Hands-on educational research demonstrations are conducted in the local community. Through specific applications, the work yields insights that can improve and accelerate science, engineering, and healthcare. Project results, including new curriculum developed, open source software, videos, publications, and demos, will be disseminated on the project web site (http://ivlab.cs.umn.edu/visualization-by-sketching).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project team has completed a research project with the goal of dramatically improving the ways that data visualizations are designed and created to enable more effective, creative, and accessible ways of analyzing scientific information using computer graphics.  The research has been applied to some of today?s most complex scientific datasets, including data from medicine and climate modeling.  The results fit into a bigger picture of research that aims to understand how humans can work most effectively and creatively with computers.  This has important implications for society as a whole given the critical role that computing plays in the human existence today. The project results have already been well received by several communities.   Intellectual Merit:  Within the computer science research community, project results have been awarded a best paper prize and twice been featured in invited "best of" sessions at the community?s largest academic and industry conference. Expert computer programming skills are often required to analyze many of today?s important scientific datasets.  The project makes it dramatically easier to visualize these data, improving understanding by taking advantage of the human visual system?s information processing power.  It also makes it possible to rapidly redesign and explore these visualizations in an interactive process that does not require programming, opening up new opportunities for scientists, engineers, artists, and other creative thinkers to work with complex data.  All this is enabled by new human-computer interfaces that draw upon creative tasks that humans already do well, such as sketching, reacting to examples, and thinking creatively.  One example software tool developed during the project is called Visualization-by-Sketching.  It is possible for artists or scientists with no programming experience to use this tool to develop new animated visualizations of multidimensional datasets as large as 1 terabyte.  Some of the results created by artists are stunning &ndash; with a tool like this, artists can rapidly explore many different data-to-visual mappings, and this is important because innovation in data visualization requires additional input from visual thinkers (visual artists and perceptual scientists, not necessarily programmers) who have not traditionally had the tools or background necessary to create cutting-edge data visualizations.  However, it?s not just artists that use these new computational techniques.  Scientists and engineers can now also create and rapidly explore alternatives for sophisticated new data visualizations rather than just viewing the visualizations that others create for them.  A second example software tool developed during the project is called Lift-Off.  This is a virtual reality (VR) tool for 3D modeling, and it uses a similar metaphor of creating by sketching, again translating a creative human process into a new data-driven context.  Within the medical community, the collaborative research has resulted in new data visualizations of brain imaging data and several new techniques that have broad potential application.  A new approach for designing medical devices in VR has been developed &ndash; engineers can sketch ideas on paper, import these hand-drawn images into VR, scale them to life size, and then "lift" curves out of the drawings to create a 3D napkin sketch "in the air".  The result is something like a 3D whiteboard that enables new creative design processes in the context of immersive 3D data visualization.  Likewise, a new VR technique has been developed to better explain complex medical procedures to patients using annotations drawn by physicians in 3D on top of patient specific imaging data.   Broader Impacts:  The work has already impacted the medical domain, which was a driving application area for the project.  Collaborators are using the new software tools, and follow-on studies are being planned.  The techniques generalize to work with many other datasets and exploratory visualization tasks; thus, broad impact is anticipated as others build upon the research and apply the results to new areas of science and engineering.  Six computer science Ph.D. students, two art students, and four undergraduate students have been trained in science and engineering methods through participation in the research.  Two Ph.D. dissertations have resulted directly from the core project research, and these two students are now both employed as tenure-track Assistant Professors.  Each year of the project, the research team hosted about 50 K-12 students for special research presentations and hands-on demonstrations in collaboration with programs, such as TRIO Upward Bound, Eureka!, and Discover STEM, that are designed to reach groups underserved and/or underrepresented in science.  Results have also been integrated with teaching at the University of Minnesota and beyond.  Open source software, videos, publications, and other results are archived on the project website.
