<AbstractNarration>This award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms - A Program of the Division of Chemistry, enables Prof. Timothy C. Steimle of the Department of Chemistry, Arizona State University at Tempe to experimentally determine the most fundamental chemical behavior and properties of small metal containing molecules using new laser-based technologies. Two interrelated classes of molecules will be investigated: a) diatomic molecules containing heavy metal atoms of thorium, hafnium and ytterbium, and b) the triatomic molecules, Si3 and SiH2.  Both classes of molecules exhibit vibrational and electronic motions that defy conventional theoretical description. Molecular magnetic and electric dipole moments, which are used in the proposed schemes to produce ultracold samples and are routinely predicted by theorists, will be experimentally measured from the analysis of Zeeman and Stark laser spectroscopy, respectively.  The data is critical for proposed experiments that use heavy metal containing molecules (e.g. ThO, ThS and YbF) to test various extensions of  the Standard Model through the detection of the electric dipole moment of the electron (eEDM) and the anapole moment of nuclei.  The laser-based studies of Si3 and SiH2 will investigate the mechanism of spin-orbit and other relativistic induced coupling between electronic and vibrational motions.  In collaboration with theorists, new methodologies for addressing relativistic effects will be developed and assessed.  All studies will be performed in the gas-phase, which is most compatible with new theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecules containing elements near the end of the periodic table (e.g. Th, Hf, and Yb) are poorly understood and modeled compared to those at the beginning (C, O and H), yet are of great technological importance in, for example, catalysis, batteries or solar cells.  Much of the unique properties of these molecules can be traced to the fact that the electrons forming the chemical bonds are accelerated to speeds approaching the speed of light. At these unusual speeds, relativistic effects become important which, in general, strengthen and shorten chemical bonds. Furthermore, it is predicted that under these relativistic conditions, here-to-fore unobserved phenomena become greatly enhanced. One such phenomenon is the interaction of the electron with the very large electric fields predicted to exist in the region of the nuclei. The data generated in this study are critical for sophisticated experiments designed to precisely measure these effects. A comparison of predicted and measured charge distribution of the electron is critical to the field of physics for validation of modern models for fundamental particles. Hence, the tiny metal containing molecules studied here are the laboratory for understanding new properties of matter, generating information typically obtained at large research facilities that possess particle accelerators, but at a small fraction of the cost.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spectroscopy in support of Fundamental Physics (YbF, ThO, TaN, CaF, SiO+):  Since the 1970?s the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has provided our best understanding of how particles and forces are related.

To develop theories Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scientist have relied upon experiments performed using exceedingly expensive particle accelerator facilities such as CERN(2016 budget $1.1 bn).  A fundamental question for testing various BSM theories is whether the electron is better described as having a distribution of charge (electron electric dipole moment, eEDM) instead of being a point charge.  It has become evident that relatively inexpensive experiments using certain molecules in very particular energy levels can be used as venues for determining the eEDM, and other BSM predications.  In our studies the particular energy levels of YbF, ThO,  and TaN where investigated and used to design new BSM tests.  There is great interest in cooling and trapping molecules to very low temperatures, motivated in part by quantum computing. While laser cooling and trapping of (magneto-optical trapping, MOT) has been used to cool paramagnetic atoms to ultracold temperatures for decades, it has only recently been applied to molecules (e.g. SrF).

The results are being used to develop a broadband laser cooling method with implications to quantum information and metrology.  Isotopic dependence of photodissociation dynamics  (SiHD)   Fabrication of polysilicon, which is used for solar cell manufacturing, is via the thermal or photodissociation of silane, SiH4.   Developing a quantum level understanding of the simple SiH4&reg;Si + 2H2 reaction is relevant to this chemical vapor deposition (CVD) generation of polysilicon.  One of the more prevalent intermediate in the dissociation of SiH4 is silylene, SiH2.  Here we garner insight into the dissociation process by mapping the energy levels of the singly deuterated silylene, SiHD, using visible laser spectroscopy. It is shown that the substitution of H for D has a profound effect on the SiH2&reg;Si + H2 reaction. The data provides insight into reaction dynamics and a benchmark for theoretical modelling. Sensitive laser-based detection schemes for monitoring  the SiH2 intermediate has been developed.  Optical Stark and Zeeman studies of PGMcontaining molecules:   Iridium, platinum, and gold (referred to as Platinum Group Metal( PGM)) are key elements in catalysis.

Spectroscopy in support of Astronomy (MgH)  Optical astronomy is on the verge of a new era ushered in by the soon to be commissioned Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) and, in the more distant future, the Giant Magellan Telescope.  The huge mirrors and adaptive optics of these telescopes will vastly enhance light collecting area (TMT ~10&acute;Keck) and spatial resolution (TMT ~10&acute;HST), which when combined with the spectrometers will provide an unprecedented spectroscopic view of the universe. Laboratory measurement of electrostatic and magnetostatic properties of key refractory molecules such as of magnesium monohydride, MgH, are essential for full utilization of observations obtained using these multi-billion dollar telescopes.  The visible spectrum of magnesium monohydride, MgH, can be used to characterize solar activity and stellar magnetism.  Our studies represent the first precise determination of the magnetic tuning parameters for numerous lines in visible spectrum which has implications for stellar magnetic field detection.
