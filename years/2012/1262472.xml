<AbstractNarration>Across the biological sciences, high-quality, high frame-rate images and video are widely used in analysis of sub-cellular organelles to individual organisms. The use of video has become so pervasive, that many research teams accumulate much more data than can be reasonably analyzed by current methods. This project will develop algorithms to allow the rapid and affordable mining of very large video sets for motion behaviors of interest in the study of the collective behavior and emergent properties of complex systems of organisms. This work is motivated by the needs of domain experts in various areas of biological motion analysis and incorporates research in computer vision, image processing, user interfaces, and visualization. A key part of the project is a fast, semi-automated biological object tracker that leverages the computational power of off-the-shelf hardware and incorporates simple user interactions to dramatically improve tracking accuracy in the types challenging cases that frequently arise in biological image analysis. Domain experts will be able to search motion databases through visual query by selecting an example motion of interest. The system will be evaluated on three biological research applications: honeybee behavior, ant colony networks, and cell motion analysis.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Groups of organisms can display a rich and sophisticated behavioral repertoire and are able to make complex collective decisions. Studying these interactions provides insight into collective decision-making, adaptive networks, and division-of-labor. Understanding these complex interactions over large time scales requires new methods of data analysis that this project will address with an interdisciplinary collaboration between biologists and computer scientists. The outreach components of this work include demonstrations and explanations of the complex behavior of groups of organisms and how these behaviors can be studied using computing.   The system is intended to be widely-applicable and will be disseminated to other researchers by making the software available for download online.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Advances in computing power over the last decade have made it feasible in principle to automatically analyze large volumes of video data.  However, for biological research to capitalize on these advances, a tool with the end user in mind had to be developed. The result of this project is an intuitive software package that can be used by biologists to study the behavior of honeybee, ants, and cells.  This software applies artificial intelligence to automate the tracking of biological objects such as ants.  New algorithms for handling challenging cases of motion analysis have been developed by a team of students and researchers from biology and computer science.  The accuracy of the algorithm has been tested using a large dataset to ensure that accuracy in future usage.  Using this tool, researchers are now able to analyze much more quickly, at lower cost, and at much larger scale.  This tool has already been used to generate a large, rich dataset on social insect behavior.  The tool is freely available for download at our website http://www.abctracker.org/ for anyone to use.  Through the project, many students have experienced research and joined a graduate school in a STEM.  The tool has also been demoed to more than 300 people including K-12 students, college students, and professors.
