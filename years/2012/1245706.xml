<AbstractNarration>This project is establishing an innovative introductory biology course open to both biology majors and those majoring in other fields.  Both lecture and laboratory are integrated as regards teaching approaches used and subject matter covered. Both use an inquiry-based approach to teaching.  The particular teaching approach used has been piloted at the institution and found to be superior to other approaches in retaining majors and gaining an interest in and knowledge of the discipline by those students not biology majors.  Class time is devoted to group discussions of student-generated questions and peer review of each other's work under the guidance of faculty and experienced upper division students.  This experience provides an opportunity for upper division students to enrich their research skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Web-based background materials are used to prepare students for investigations, while scenarios and discussion questions are of high quality and connect basic concepts in the life sciences (such as the nature of respiration) to real world problems in subjects ranging from molecular biology to animal behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The entire department is engaged in faculty development activities to prepare both the upper division students and the faculty for this student discussion-centered mode of teaching and research-centered approach to a student laboratory so the impact will go beyond this institution.  In addition the web-based background material prepared for students is being made freely available to facilitate easy adaptation by other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   We created the Integrating Biology and Inquiry Skills (IBIS) program in response to national calls for transforming undergraduate education in science. Traditional instructor-centered lecture environments do not provide adequate student opportunities for critical thinking and exploration.  The major goal of the IBIS project was to implement a new introductory biology course in which student-centered inquiry and critical thinking were facilitated by open-ended laboratory investigations aligned with lecture curriculum. Class time was devoted to group discussions of student-generated questions followed by peer review of student artifacts under the guidance of faculty and experienced upper division students. To support the implementation of this new curriculum, we created a Peer Mentor system to train upperclassmen in teaching and research skills. This experience provided an opportunity for upper division students to enrich their research skills as they mentored underclassmen in laboratory investigations. Web-based background materials were used to prepare students for investigations, while scenarios and discussion questions required high-level critical thinking and connected basic concepts in the life sciences (such as the nature of respiration) to real world problems in subjects ranging from molecular biology to animal behavior. The Peer Mentors play an integral role in the instruction of this new introductory program. Additionally, we created training opportunities for faculty members new to the curriculum. Over a four year period (2013-2017), we implemented and modified the lecture and laboratory curricula, and assessed the effectiveness of the program by measuring gains in students? knowledge and critical thinking skills. We also assessed program impact on undergraduate Peer Mentor and Faculty attitudes towards modern, evidence-based teaching practices.  We found that the students enrolled in the IBIS course significantly improved their biology content knowledge and their critical thinking skills (see Figs. 1 and 2).
