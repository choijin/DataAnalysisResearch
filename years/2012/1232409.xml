<AbstractNarration>Hangelbroek&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1047694&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The goal of this project is to develop new tools and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for effective kernel approximation on Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;domains and certain compact manifolds.  This work includes two&lt;br/&gt;important aspects.  The first is to develop schemes to treat&lt;br/&gt;highly nonuniform arrangements of data (with approximation rates&lt;br/&gt;controlled by a parameter reflecting the local density of the&lt;br/&gt;data).  The second is to devise nonlinear schemes that&lt;br/&gt;approximate using linear combinations of very few kernels. &lt;br/&gt;Schemes developed abide by two features of mainstream&lt;br/&gt;approximation theory (features that have generally been elusive&lt;br/&gt;for kernel-based approximation schemes):  they provide&lt;br/&gt;approximation that is precise, by providing convergence rates&lt;br/&gt;dictated by the smoothness of the approximand, and they are&lt;br/&gt;universal, by treating approximands at all levels of smoothness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The use of kernels to treat scattered, high-dimensional data&lt;br/&gt;is, by now, an established methodology in approximation theory. &lt;br/&gt;Kernels are especially prized for their ability to approximate in&lt;br/&gt;the absence of underlying geometrical structures, like meshes or&lt;br/&gt;triangulations.  At this point there exist several algorithms&lt;br/&gt;employing kernels to treat large datasets that have been sampled&lt;br/&gt;almost uniformly.  However, the approximation power of such&lt;br/&gt;algorithms -- judged in terms of the fidelity of the approximant&lt;br/&gt;to the approximand -- is rarely completely understood. &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the question of how to treat highly nonuniform data&lt;br/&gt;(data with large gaps, or with points that coalesce) using&lt;br/&gt;kernels is only beginning to be addressed.  An important goal of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to develop kernel-based approximation methods&lt;br/&gt;that approximate from highly unstructured datasets and that&lt;br/&gt;approximate high-dimensional datasets with little computational&lt;br/&gt;overhead.  Another goal is to acquire a precise understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the approximation power of such methods.  Of particular interest&lt;br/&gt;are problems where there is some underlying geometric or&lt;br/&gt;algebraic structure to be exploited, as, for example, is the case&lt;br/&gt;in problems in geodesy, crystallography, and molecular biology.</AbstractNarration>

The PI has studied the boundary value problems (Dirichlet problems) associated with the class of polyharmonic kernels -- this has yielded insights into the boundary effects phenomenon, where degradation of approximation power occurs when boundaries are present.  Over the course of the project, the PI helped to organize two workshops (one in Tennessee and one in Hawaii) and co-organized one international conference in Hawaii involving participants from the US and abroad. The PI successfully mentored a graduate student who has gone on to teach mathematics in the state of Hawaii. In addition to this, he has given numerous research talks at international conferences and has completed about ten research papers, many co-authored with US and international collaborators.  All have been published in, or are currently submitted for publication in, high quality, peer reviewed, international journals.
