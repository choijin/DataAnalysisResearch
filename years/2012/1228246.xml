<AbstractNarration>As a result of rapid advances in information technology, massive datasets are being generated in all fields of science, engineering, social science, business, and government. Useful information is often extracted from these data through statistical model fitting, e.g., through regression models. These models are useful for describing relationships between predictor variables and a response variable. Given a set of n data elements and p predictors, p and/or n can be large in much modern massive data set applications. In these cases, conventional algorithms often face severe computational challenges. Subsampling of rows and/or columns of a data matrix have traditionally been employed as a heuristic to reduce the size of large data sets, thus enabling computations to run more quickly. Recently, however, an innovative sampling methodology that uses the empirical statistical leverage scores of the data matrix as a nonuniform importance sampling distribution has been proposed. This has been applied to the ordinary least squares (OLS) problem and other related problems, and this leverage-based nonuniform sampling procedure gives a very good approximation to the OLS based on full data (when p is small and n is large) more rapidly than traditional methods, both in worst-case theory and in high-quality numerical implementations. As of yet, however, the statistical properties of these algorithms are unexplored. Understanding these properties is of interest for both fundamental and very practical reasons; and the investigators' work addresses these problems. The investigators consider both statistical theory as well as the evaluation of that theory with high-quality numerical implementations on large real-world data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal consists of two related research thrusts, both of which center around the common goal of an integrated treatment of statistical and computational issues. The first research thrust focuses on studying the statistical properties of the subsampling estimation using the statistical leverage scores in linear regression. The second research thrust generalizes the theory and methods to nonlinear regression and dimension reduction models. The proposed theory and methods serve as an inspiration for new ideas to push statistical methodology development forward. The research provides new insight into the existing algorithms, produces innovative methodologies for analyzing large-scale data, inspires new lines of quantitative investigations in interdisciplinary research and offers a unique educational experience.</AbstractNarration>

(1)  We provide the first interpretation of algorithmic leveraging paradigm from a statistical analysis point of view. For theoretical results, we provide a simple yet effective framework to evaluate the statistical properties of algorithmic leveraging in the context of estimating parameters in a linear regression model with a fixed number of predictors.

(4) We proposed a reference-free and distribution-free binning method, MetaGen, which makes use of the relative abundance information from multiple samples to cluster contigs into different species bins and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to determine the number of species in the samples.  (5) We proposed the sequential leveraging method and stated the main theorem, present some simulation results to support the theorem presented and do a real data analysis using sequential leveraging method.  (6) For the first time in the case of p&gt;&gt;n, valid confidence intervals for post-Lasso estimators via parametric bootstrap when p&gt;&gt;n and first statistical analysis of leverage sampling and LS estimation with two new improved procedures based on leverage sampling for the fixed p case. Both problems are important for big data since both LS and Lasso are canonical methods for discovering relationships between variables.

Broader Impacts         Our broad research spectrum from basic statistical theory research to applied fields such as Biology and Chemistry.      As a popular sampling based framework for solving scalable least squares regression and other matrix problems via the empirical statistical leverage scores of the data, algorithmic leveraging has been demonstrating many desirable algorithmic properties. Our proposed algorithms demonstrated its benefits on several real dataset. Especially, the proposed SSANOVAs show the promising potential for discovering interesting functional relationships among large noisy data sets in the physical and social sciences.  In Biology, the proposed leveraging algorithms have been applied to analyze high throughput RNAseq data. We observe that LEV, LEVUNW, SLEV, and UNIF all have comparable sample variances. When the subsample size is very small, all four methods have comparable sample bias; but when the subsample size is larger, then LEVUNW has a slightly larger bias than the other three estimates. In the other direction of genetic data analysis, our purposed statNMF method has been very successful in analyzing noisy gene expression data.   In Chemistry, the tensor sufficient dimension reduction model is proposed to analyze the optical electronic nose data (also known as the colorimetric sensor array data). The data set contained large amount of tensor observations, which are multiway arrays.             Last Modified: 12/15/2016       Submitted by: Bin Yu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
