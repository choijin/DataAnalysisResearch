<AbstractNarration>Developing students' understanding of fundamental concepts is a primary goal of undergraduate engineering education. Innovations such as concept questions, model-eliciting activities, and inquiry-based instruction have consistently been found to be more effective for promoting conceptual change. However, these innovative approaches were designed with educational effectiveness as the foremost (or only) concern. Considerably less research has been devoted to understanding how to design these activities to increase their adoption by engineering faculty. The primary challenge facing engineering reform today is not primarily to develop more effective instructional strategies but to find ways to get faculty to adopt instructional techniques that we already know to be more effective than the traditional methods still found in the majority of undergraduate engineering classrooms. This project addresses that challenge by identifying methods of developing instructional modules that are simultaneously effective for student learning gains and faculty adoptability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing instructional materials for heat transfer, an important foundational course for chemical, mechanical and other engineering majors. It is combining the research on student learning of fundamental concepts with research on adoption and change to develop materials that professors are more likely to actually use in their classes. The materials are being evaluated for "usability" by a panel of professors at different types of institutions who work with a diverse range of engineering student populations. Ongoing evaluation of the project is monitoring the most frequently downloaded activities and relating this information to factors that promote faculty adoption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The literature on diffusion of innovation into the college classroom identifies several factors that inhibit adoption of new approaches. These include faculty concerns about (1) preparation time, (2) class time, (3) effectiveness, (4) student resistance, (5) inflexible teaching environments and (6) inability to adapt innovations to suit their needs. There is therefore a need to develop approaches that minimize these identified barriers so that effective practices are more widely adopted and consequently provide broad impact. The findings of this project will inform future efforts to promote faculty adoption of new instructional practices in other STEM areas.</AbstractNarration>

While it is true that the chipped ice will be faster, both drinks will ultimately reach the same temperature - the rate of cooling is related to the amount of surface area (higher for chipped ice) but the amount of cooling is related to the mass of ice (same for both).  Students presented a similar situation as a mathematical (rather than "real life") situation will often answer correctly.  This happens because students' original beliefs are not engaged when they are taught the equations only. This means they go unrepaired by traditional instruction.  Because engineering practice is as much "real life" as it is calculation, it is critically important that repair of these misconceptions become part of undergraduate engineering education.    Previously, the Bucknell team demonstrated inquiry-based activities in which students move through a cycle of prediction, observation, and reflection, are highly effective at repairing students? misconceptions about concepts in heat transfer.  However, not every instructor has the resources to offer laboratory experiments for small groups of students.  In this project, we tested parallel delivery modes for the same educational activities ? instead of just experiments, we tested the same activity when presented as demonstration, simulation, demonstration-of-simulation, and thought experiment.    All students engaged in pre- and post- tests, and also started each activity with a prediction and ended it with a reflection.   We found that while experiments done by students are most effective at misconception repair, all of the other approaches are significantly more effective than traditional courses for repairing misconceptions.  For example, students without an intervention improve from a score of 37% to 43% on a test of the ?rate vs. amount? concept described above.  Students in a class where they conduct the experiment improved from 35% to 74%, and those watching a demo rom 28% to 58%, and those with a thought experiment from 39% to 50%.   All of the handouts needed to use these activities in class, instructions, and simulations are available for free to instructors online through the AIChE Concept Warehouse (see images).  The Concept Warehouse also shares information about the effort needed to use each activity and the effectiveness of that activity so that instructors can make informed choices about which activity mode they wish to use.  While the student experiments were the most educationally effective, simulations were the most popular approach with instructors.  We believe this is because simulations are reasonably effective while requiring far fewer classroom resources (space, equipment, time) than experiments.
