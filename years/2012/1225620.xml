<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to examine how inhibition in early childhood, as reflected in anxious, wary, and vigilant behaviors in challenging situations, contributes to social and psychological adjustment in early adulthood and how social relationships affect those contributions in different cultures.  Moreover, the role of emotional and instrumental aspects of parent-child and peer relationships will be examined in the formation of the relations between early inhibition and adulthood outcomes.  The children in two samples in China and Canada participated in previous studies related to this project from early childhood and will be included in a follow-up study in early adulthood.  Data on young adults' social and psychological adjustment will be collected from the youth, their parents, and their best friends through interviews and questionnaires.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will make significant contributions to knowledge about context for human development through investigating the long-term outcomes of inhibition in Chinese and North American societies.  The project will also provide valuable information about the mechanisms in which early child characteristics and social relationships jointly shape development in different circumstances.  Findings from the project will help professionals develop culturally sensitive and relevant policies and practical programs in the United States to promote adaptive development of children, particularly immigrant children and children from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It has been commonly believed that sociopolitical, economic, cultural, and ecological circumstances may affect human development.  However, there is little systematic research on children?s and adolescents? social behaviors, relationships, and psychological functioning in non-Western societies.  As a result, our understanding of human development is still largely based on Euro-American cultures.  Over the past years, our research team has conducted studies of socioemotional functioning in Chinese and North American children, which have demonstrated that social and cultural contexts play a significant role in defining the functional meaning of individual behavior and in determining its developmental patterns.  One of the main foci of our research program has been on the development of behavioral inhibition.  In a longitudinal project initiated in the middle 1990s, for example, we found that, compared with their Canadian counterparts, Chinese children displayed more inhibited and anxious behavior in novel social situations.  Moreover, inhibition was associated with different parental and peer attitudes in Canada and China, which indicate distinct social environments for child development.    In the current study, we expanded our longitudinal project into late adolescence and early adulthood.  Our primary goal was to understand, from a contextual-developmental perspective, relations between inhibition in early childhood and social and psychological adjustment in early adulthood and the role of social relationships in shaping these relations in China and Canada.  The participants included the children in the two countries who participated in the previous studies of the project.  Follow-up data were collected from the samples on social and psychological adjustment in early adulthood (mostly 19 years).   The results first showed significant differences between Chinese and Canadian groups in early adulthood social and psychological adjustment.  For example, whereas Canadian youth were more active and more emotionally engaged in social activities and community services, Chinese youth were more involved in family activities and displayed higher levels of family responsibility.  Chinese youth also appeared to display less deviant social behaviors than Canadian youth.  The results of longitudinal analyses indicated that childhood inhibited behavior was associated with adjustment outcomes in both samples.  In the Canadian sample, inhibition predicted low quality of social relationships, such as conflict, and internalizing psychological problems, including health problems, in early adulthood.  In the Chinese sample, early inhibition predicted mixed adjustment outcomes.  For example, whereas it was associated with lower involvement in community, it predicted academic achievement and work performance.  Thus, Chinese children who were inhibited in childhood were less active in social participation in early adulthood.  However, these children obtained higher academic achievement and more positive work experiences in the later years.    We found that social relationships played a significant role in affecting the relations between early inhibition and later adjustment.  In Canada, for example, inhibited behavior interacted with parenting in predicting academic achievement; inhibited children whose parents were warm and supportive in parenting were less likely to develop problems in academic achievement, whereas inhibited children who experienced negative, power-assertive, or unsupportive parenting in the family tended to develop more problems in achievement.  In China, inhibited children who experienced supportive parenting were more likely to display greater attention, care, responsibility, and commitment to the family and displayed less deviant behaviors in adulthood than their counterparts who experienced unsupportive parenting.  The results suggest that supportive parent-child and peer relationships are an important protective factor that buffers against the maladaptive development of inhibited children in Canada and serve as a facilitating factor that enhances the adaptive development of inhibited children in China.   The project provided extensive opportunities for researchers and students in the US and China who participated in the project to learn valuable skills and gain experiences in conducting cross-cultural developmental research.  The training and experiences helped the researchers and students develop important abilities to understand complicated issues in human development in contexts, to explore interesting ideas and solve specific problems in research, and to engage in academic activities such as presenting and communicating research results at conferences.     In short, the project has provided important information about the role of social and cultural contexts in human development through investigating long-term outcomes of early behavioral characteristics in Chinese and North American societies.  The findings will help professionals develop culturally sensitive and relevant policies and educational and other practical programs in the United States to promote adaptive development of children, particularly immigrant children and children from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds.
