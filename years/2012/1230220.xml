<AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of the regulations controlling the circulation of sensitive but unclassified knowledge between the United States and other countries is of growing concern. This is especially so for researchers in academia and in industry. The ever-closer linkage between basic research and application in civilian/military dual-use technologies and the determination of foreign countries to exploit American scientific pre-eminence have brought International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) into the core of collaborative research with foreign nationals. Communities that prize scientific openness and regard it as the bedrock of American scientific and technological leadership and economic competitiveness are increasingly frustrated by ambiguities surrounding the interpretation of the regulations and the severe penalties for violating them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will trace the history of the debate between scientific openness and national security that began in the 1980s, primarily using reports produced by the National Academies, Congressional Reports (such as the Cox Report), studies by the Congressional Research Service, and supporting materials. This historical study will be supplemented by an empirical study of the day-to-day implementation of ITAR using in-depth interviews with senior researchers, and administrative and legal personnel, at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Policy conclusions will be drawn from the experience of those who conduct their research in this regulatory framework. The project will throw new light on the mechanisms that regulate the circulation of knowledge in a global, interconnected world. It will identify the changing circumstances that define cutting-edge science and technology that is both unclassified and subject to regulation. It demands that we expand the meaning of "technology transfer" to accommodate the exchange of knowledge in face-to-face encounters between American researchers and foreign nationals in a laboratory setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will be of interest to historians of science and technology, and to stakeholders involved in implementing ITAR. They should stimulate public debate on how best to balance the freedom of inquiry with the needs of national security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We are all aware that governments and industries need to protect sensitive knowledge, i.e. knowledge that is important to national economic or military security.  Especially since World War II, the US has developed many instruments to do this, including classification, export controls of military and dual-use items (i.e information, products and services that have both civilian and military uses), and visas, that restrict the entry of foreign nationals into the country.   University research has generally been exempt from export controls on the grounds that it is basic or fundamental research rather than applied research.  It is argued that the nation can only benefit from the broadest possible dissemination of knowledge that is far from commercial or military use.   Although there are risks in sharing what we have learned about a new material, say, we can also save time and money by learning what others have done in the same area, and can capitalize rapidly on any promising application of the material.   This situation is changing as the US becomes just one of many major knowledge producers in the global knowledge economy.  Research systems in emerging powers like China and South Korea are both dynamic and predatory. The growing threat of  terrorism, beginning with the attacks on US soil in 2001, is also a cause of concern, especially as regards bio-weapons.  The exemptions accorded universities from government regulations have come under strain. There are two main reasons for this.  First, with universities being able to commercialize the results of their research, that research is increasingly close to application for the market and the military.  It is still basic or fundamental but the 'gap' between basic and applied is small.  Secondly, US universities are hosts to thousands of foreign national students from China, South Korea and India. This has always been the case. But numbers have exploded over the last ten years.  US universities now grant about 4000 PhDs annually to students from China in science and engineering.  In the past many of these graduates stayed here: now many are returning to their home countries. America is producing its own competitors in science and engineering.    The advantages of sharing knowledge with others are being overtaken by the danger that they will use knowledge gained while being educated here to the detriment of US economic and military security.  The government is increasingly invoking export controls to limit the circulation of sensitive knowledge to foreign nationals being educated on US campuses.   This project studied the history of export controls as they have affected university research and applied the findings in a case study of their implementation today at one major research campus, the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.  The PI has been extensively trained in export control regulations.  He used select interviews with about 30 faculty, students and export control administrators to assess the impact of these regulations on academic research.  His  major findings are five  1. Georgia Tech has established a highly effective system of training and monitoring for students and faculty in the basic policies and practices of export control of sensitive unclassified knowledge.  2. While the research faculty do not like the added bureaucratic burden and the controls on their research, they understand why it is there and accept that it is needed.   3. Self-censorship of what they say in front of foreign nationals (when they don't have an export license) is common among faculty.  4. Some foreign national students resent the restrictions imposed on what they can do as a research topic without an export license.   5. The basic principle of academic freedom is increasingly challenged by government regulations that control the flow of sensitive knowledge to foreign nationals.   The major findings of the project have been published online in the academic journal, Engaging STS, Vol,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
