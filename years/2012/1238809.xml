<AbstractNarration>The Targeted Infusion Project entitled - Innovative Learning Experiences in Astronomy for Undergraduate Students at NC A&amp;T - proposes a partnership with the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). The goals of the partnership are two-fold: (1) to incorporate UNC-CH's successful introductory astronomy curriculum into North Carolina A&amp;T University's (NC A&amp;T) existing space science curriculum, and to provide NC A&amp;T's space science faculty with the training and the tools to deliver the lecture and laboratory courses; and (2) to recruit talented NC A&amp;T undergraduate students as research fellows, who will work with telescopes at professional observatories, engage in astronomical research at both NC A&amp;T and UNC-CH, present their work at conferences, publish their findings in observing reports, conference proceedings, and journal articles, and in doing these things be inspired to pursue graduate studies and/or careers in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNC-CH has recently developed a new introductory astronomy curriculum that leverages access to the robotic telescopes in Chile and Australia. Through this collaboration NC A&amp;T will adopt this curriculum,  NC A&amp;T faculty will receive training on how to deliver the curriculum and on how to make effective classroom use of the tools that were developed such that even first-year, non-majors can use remote telescopes and analyze the resulting images. Furthermore, NC A&amp;T will gain permanent, guaranteed access to observing time on the new PROMPT telescopes in Chile and Australia, and on the 20-meter diameter radio telescope in West Virginia.</AbstractNarration>

During summer 2015 we get a supplement that allowed us to hire four new students for research.  These students were mostly engaged in training on how to assemble a robotic observatory and continued to develop the radio jove kit and the SID monitor.  In relation to Goal 3, NCATÆs REMO observatory is almost functional.  Since the summer of 2014, Dr. Abebe Kebede and his students, with the support of the Physics Laboratory manager, mitigated most of the technical problems with REMO.  A new dome controller was purchased and installed.  A new autofocusser was purchased.  At this time the autofocusser, the filter wheel and the CCD camera are installed.
