<AbstractNarration>The proposed research uses a game theoretical framework to test the hypothesis that fishers generate simple institutional norms that modify the incentive structure of pirating relative to FAD (fish aggregating device) fishing. The research tests hypotheses about sociality in the ethnographic context of a small-scale (artisanal) FAD fishery in the Commonwealth of Dominica, a Caribbean island nation. FADs  are simple, human-made structures designed to float on or near the surface of the ocean, attract fish, and facilitate their capture. Difficult to defend from free-riders (pirates in the local vernacular) because they are placed in the open ocean, the recently (1999) introduced FAD technology produces a classic common pool resource dilemma (CPR). In spite of the CPR dilemma, FAD technology has now spread to most of the major fish landing sites on Dominica. The goal of the project is to learn how fishers achieve the level of cooperation that they do in spite of a context that structurally favors free riding. Predictions will be tested with data collected from interviews, direct observation, and GPS tracking of fishing trips. The large yellowfin tuna and blue marlin now targeted with the aid of FADs are species that were difficult for fishermen to regularly find in the past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small scale fisheries have a significant impact on food security and poverty reduction in the Caribbean region. The project will have broad positive impact by contributing to the Dominica Fisheries Division's goal to develop sound FAD policy and practice and create a national FAD Fishery Management Plan whose objective is the efficient and sustainable use of FADs and associated pelagic resources. The proposed research has intellectual merit by linking aspects of evolutionary theory, common pool resource theory and game theory to address core theoretical issues concerning the exceptional nature of human sociality.</AbstractNarration>

FADs produce common pool resource problems where fishers suffer disincentives to produce FADs because of vulnerability to free-riders. FADs consist of a simple technology that floats on or near the surface of the sea, attracts fish, and facilitates their capture (Figure 1-2). Since they are placed in the open ocean, however, it is difficult to exclude other fishers, referred to locally in Dominica as pirates, who have not contributed to a FAD's production from free riding on the effort of those who have.</p> <p>I used innovative data collection methods and analysis to create a data set of 2,362 fishing trips. Nearly 1,500 of those trips were described with spatial data collected with GPS technology (Figure 3-4). Forty-five FADs were identified. Fishers visited twenty-three local, private FADs, and 3 local, state sponsored FADs; &nbsp;the fishers also visited 19 non-local FADs, four of which were state sponsored.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The fishers and the state produced a number of solutions to the free rider problem. Cases of punishment were relatively rare but possibly important to the long-term stability of the system. While reports of piracy were common in the decade previous, especially with respect to foreign fishers, such piracy declined after an international incidence in 2010 that involved Dominican coast guard and French Fishers at a Dominican FAD. Afterwards, relatively low levels of piracy and punishment were observed. Other conflict resulted from the ambiguity associated with FADs deployed by the State. Most of the day-to-day FAD use involved direct and indirect reciprocity between a handful of fishers, some of them contributing more and some less. Network analysis points to a small number of key fishers whose activity contributed disproportionally to the maintenance of the system (Figure 5). This seems to be leading to nascent social inequality.&nbsp; FAD placement at greater distance from shore by high-investing fishers kept low investing fishers from free riding so easily. In addition, FADs were occasionally placed by high investors near shore to placate potential pirates and keep them near shore.&nbsp; The importance of state sponsored FADs came as a surprise. While state sponsored FADs were a relatively small number, they were generally close to shore and well used by a variety of fishers.</p> <p>Both graduate and undergraduate students obtained field experience during the project.
