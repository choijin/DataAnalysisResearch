<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to continue funding for the deep-sea core and sample repository at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO). The repository has distributed over 15,000 samples over the past three years. Additional funds are sought for the replacement of corroding sample trays and for some inexpensive analyses to aid sample selection. LDEO provides significant support to the facility, especially personnel and IT. The facility also offers opportunities for student training and research.</AbstractNarration>

In addition to physical samples, a database of the Lamont core collection has been maintained for nearly 50 years and contains information on the geographic location of each collection site, core length, mineralogy and paleontology, lithology, and structure, and more recently, the full text of megascopic descriptions.  Over the nearly seven decades of its existence, this unique and unparalleled facility has evolved from the scientific collection of a small number of extraordinary Lamont scientists to the present-day repository which serves the national and international Earth Science community.  Maurice Ewing?s (our founder) foresight in collecting "A core-a-day" created a scientific legacy that now constitutes one of Earth Science?s foremost oceanographic and geologic resources. It is because of this function, service to the community, that the LDCR receives significant operational funding from the National Science Foundation.
