<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to understand and explain the mechanisms and processes involved in the social production of risk perceptions and in the ebb and flow of environmental protest. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in three marginalized and contaminated communities, the project will scrutinize changes over time in shared understandings about toxic risk and in environmental collective action. The research will: a) examine the life-threatening effects of environmental contamination in three highly polluted marginalized communities in the Americas, b) explain the (sometimes puzzling and contradictory) meanings their poor residents ascribe to it, and c) examine the links between shared understandings about contamination and the cycles of mobilization and de-mobilization around environmental matters that these communities have witnessed during the past two decades. The main questions this project will address are the following: How do poor people make sense of (and cope with) toxic danger? When and why do they understand what is objectively a clear and present danger? When and how do shared understandings about threatening pollution trigger collective action? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bring together the often dispersed insights that have developed over the past three decades in the study of risk perception, environmental collective action, and urban poverty. In analyzing the relationship between marginality, risk, and contention this research will seek to create intellectual bridges among several areas of study. This work will seek to enrich the discourse in these areas by offering a more comprehensive understanding of environmental suffering and contention, extend the boundaries of these fields to include relevant dynamics borrowed from the others, and advance the intellectual integration of these fields. Doctoral dissertations, academic articles, and a book will be the outcome of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Making Environmental Suffering Visible  Javier Auyero        "I raised three kids here. I myself have been inside many of the chemical plants, and I don?t have any health problems," a 70-year-old resident of Flammable &ndash; a highly contaminated shantytown in the outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina&ndash; told me.  The shantytown sits adjacent to one of the largest petrochemical compounds in the country and it is surrounded by a hazardous waste incinerator and by an unmonitored landfill. Other residents expressed their doubts about pollution in the following ways: "I don?t really know if I am contaminated or not. . . . I don?t even know what the symptoms are," or "we don?t really know if we have something." Flammable residents are routinely exposed to chromium and benzene (both known carcinogens) and to toluene. But lead, "the mother of all industrial poisons . . . the paradigmatic toxin [linking] industrial and environmental disease" (Markowitz and Rosner 2002:137), is the main toxin affecting primarily shantytown children. Despite ample evidence of pollution, residents, both young and old, express serious doubts about its sources, extent, and effects. In a detailed ethnographic study, conducted alongside Debora Swistun (an anthropologist who was born and raised in the shantytown and was living there while we carried out the research) we found enigmatic patterns of pervasive toxic uncertainty and paradoxical absence of community protest (Auyero and Swistun 2009).  That study called for more systematic attention to what we dubbed "environmental suffering" &ndash; a form of affliction produced by a toxic environment filled with oftentimes invisible but highly consequential hazards. Despite an increasing focus on diverse sources and experiences of social suffering among social scientists, the hardships created by the physical place where people live have not deserved the same needed consideration. We embarked in this study to extend the interest on the lived experiences of environmental suffering to other contaminated communities in Latin America &ndash; having the case of Flammable as an implicit case with which to compare and contrast these other instances.  Funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, Maricarmen Hernandez, Pamela Neumann, and Emily Spangenberg &ndash; at the time of this study, graduate students in the Sociology Department at UT-Austin and fellows of the Urban Ethnography Lab &ndash; lived for varied periods of time (between four months and a year) in Esmeraldas (Ecuador), La Oroya (Per&uacute;), and Palpal&aacute; (Argentina) respectively. There they were joined by Donna DeCesare, indefatigable documentary photographer and Associate Professor of journalism at UT-Austin. Together, they sought to portray daily life in these highly contaminated places and to dissect the ways in which local residents understand, and give meaning, to their toxic surroundings.  Although images of "abandoned" places, "sacrificed zones," "disposable peoples," have certain appeal for their dramatic character and almost apocalyptic resonance, the images and stories our book will tell show a much more complex reality.  To each case, they ask a seemingly simple and straightforward question: How do residents of these highly polluted places think, feel, and cope with their grounds, water, and/or air?  Reconstructing points of view and ways of acting requires hard, rigorous, and (in these three particular cases) physically and emotionally challenging, fieldwork. Maricarmen, Pamela, and Emily spent hours with local residents, trying to understand their daily life and their perceptions of the risks that surround them. Journalistic and scholarly accounts (with a few notable exceptions) tend to offer monochromatic pictures of areas likes the ones under consideration here &ndash; focusing either on residents who do not see or do not care about contamination or on those who have very strong oppositional views (and who act, usually collectively, in consequence). Our book will present a different scenario. There is no single monolithic point of view and way of acting &ndash; neither between these communities nor within them.  But there is a common thread running through the images and texts in our book. Environmental suffering is not only produced by whatever the source of pollution is &ndash; an oil refinery, a smelter, etc. &ndash; but also, and as importantly, but by the meanings people assign to them &ndash; and this attribution of meaning is not a cooperative construction, something residents simply come up with, but part and parcel of a process of symbolic domination.  This book &ndash; the images and the texts &ndash; is our joint attempt to visibilize and represent (in as faithful manner as we possibly can) the environmental suffering that, as lived experience, is produced both by toxins generated by industrial and extractive development and by toxic words produced by powerful &ndash; both local and external &ndash; actors.
