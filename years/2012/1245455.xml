<AbstractNarration>The objective of this TUES Type 1 project is to develop an instructional framework that promotes self-directed learning and enhances problem-solving skills in undergraduate engineering students.  The instructional framework uses an Inverted Classroom (IC) to facilitate Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and is implemented in a Heat Transfer course at Seattle University.  Material traditionally covered in a lecture format is moved outside of class time and made available in an online repository of learning resources.  During class time, students solve authentic engineering problems presented in a PBL format.  These real engineering problems are co-developed by the project team, academic partners from Montana State University and the University of Washington, and industrial partners.  The instructional framework is being created through collaboration between faculty in mechanical engineering and psychology at Seattle University and evaluated by academic partners.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The development of the IC-PBL pairing has the potential to be a transformative pedagogy that capitalizes on the growing interest in inverted (flipped) classrooms.  A model for academic and industrial partnerships in learning is created that allows faculty to teach students using real world engineering problems while providing an avenue for industrial partners to help prepare better engineers for the workplace.  To evaluate the effects of this IC-PBL framework on student learning, control-treatment experiments are conducted on (1) student problem-solving performance, (2) self-directed learning performance, (3) retention and understanding of fundamental engineering principles, and (4) student motivation and attitude towards engineering studies and degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed instructional framework could fundamentally change how undergraduate engineering students are taught, creating engineering graduates who are better self- directed learners and problem-solvers. The engineering education community have access to an adaptable educational framework, including curriculum materials, online resources, and authentic engineering problems, facilitating future wide-scale adoption.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  Engineering educators and practicing engineers noticed a gap between engineering schools and industrial practice; students leave programs without the skills necessary to be professional engineers.  Part of the problem is that traditional classroom formats leave little room for active problem-solving, and even when such problem-solving is incorporated, it does not use the nonlinear, unscaffolded, unstructured, open-ended problems representative of what graduates encounter in industry.  To address these shortcomings, a new approach was developed that relies on a flipped classroom to make room for Authentic Engineering Problems (AEPs).  AEPs are real-world problems developed by industrial partners and taken from the partner?s engineering experience. AEPs are chosen to reflect what graduates might encounter in industry and so are open-ended, unstructured and often require students to research topics outside of what they are learning in the course. During class time students worked in teams to solve AEPs while the instructor provided guidance.  Traditional course material was delivered through online resources. This new format (Inverted Classroom Problem Centered Learning or ICPCL) was applied in a junior level heat transfer course. This course and the same course offered in a traditional format were offered, assessed, and compared.      Results  ICPCL students demonstrated increasingly better problem solving as the term progressed. Talk-alouds (each student?s plan for solving the problem) and solution evaluations  (each student?s evaluation of their solution) showed statistically significant improvement on all four categories of problem solving -- understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out, and looking back. Students were more comfortable and confident solving problems, and students? solutions, as evaluated by industrial partners, showed significant improvement as the term progressed.  Both ICPCL and traditional students completed two design problems - one early and one later in the quarter.  These were in addition to the AEPs. Students? solutions were evaluated on the same rubric by a panel of three engineering faculty in both courses. On the first design project, before ICPCL students had much problem-solving experience, results were mixed; on some aspects ICPCL students did better, on some traditional did, and on some there was no difference.  However, by the second design problem, ICPCL students performed better on all aspects of problem-solving.   Although improving problem solving was a primary goal of the project, such improvement should not come at the expense of engineering fundamentals. Indeed, ICPCL students performed as well as students in the traditional course on the HECI (a standardized test), surpassing the traditional students on a few problems suggesting deeper understanding. Similarly, ICPCL students performed as well or better than traditional students on all exams, showing that they learned at least as much basic knowledge as students in the traditional heat transfer course.  Structured interviews and anecdotal evidence further support these data. ICPCL students realized they had improved in problem-solving and presentation skills and the instructor noted that students became more efficient at problem-solving, asked better questions, and were more open to solution approaches as the term progressed.  In addition, students valued the practical skills relevant to the work environment gained such as working and collaborating in groups with people of different levels of skill and expertise, giving presentations, communicating clearly, and doing on-the-spot problem solving.     Impact  Results of the project and material to help implement the ICPCL approach were disseminated to educators at other colleges, universities, and high schools through journal publications, national and international conferences, and workshops.  The project produced videos of industrial partners presenting their AEPs and a website with course lecture material.   Together the project findings and course material support a transformative approach to engineering education that bridges the gap between programs and jobs.  ICPCL is a better way to prepare students to be practicing engineers. ICPCL students improve at solving authentic, real-world engineering problems; and this improvement comes without a loss of content coverage and with as much or more learning of traditional material.
