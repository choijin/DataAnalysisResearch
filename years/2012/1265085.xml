<AbstractNarration>1265085 - DeWeese&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to develop a nanometer-scale electrophysiological probe capable of recording the electrical activity both in and around individual neurons in the intact brain. The probe will consist of a single carbon nanotube (CNT) or a small bundle of multiple CNTs, grown from a sharpened tungsten electrode. The device will be coated with Parylene, which will provide electrical insulation as well as structural support for the contact between the tungsten wire and the CNT. This probe will be the smallest passive neural recording electrode ever built, by far, opening doors to many previously impossible experiments and medical&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Public abstract&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will use nanotechnology to develop more sensitive electrodes for monitoring activity of nerve cells in the brain.  This new technology will provide better information about neurological diseases and may lead to better treatment of such diseases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to develop a method for fabricating nanometer-scale recording electrodes that could eventually be used to record from neurons in the brain.  Current approaches do not allow for simultaneous recording from many closely spaced neurons at sufficiently short time scales to allow for the detection of the electrical activity of the neurons as they communicate with one another.  Moreover, present technologies cannot provide access to the electrical activity inside more than one neuron at a time within the intact brain.  Improving on current neural recording capabilities could lead to improved methods for research on and treatments for epilepsy and other neuralogical disorders.  We have developed a fabrication process for attaching nanometer-scale carbon nanotubes to an electrical microcircuit, and then electrically insulating the carbon nanotube with a uniform coating of parylene.  The parylene film?s flexibility allows it to flex without any evidence of cracking and is both biocompatible and chemically inert.  Unlike other methods of parylene addition and removal, this new approach makes it possible to use for large-scale high throughput production of insulated nanotube probes, opening the door to the production of arrays of many well-insulated carbon nanotubes that could be used for simultaneous recording from many neurons at once.  The small scale of these nanotubes allows for them to be placed very close to one another, and it lowers the damage they would cause to brain tissue compared with current, larger electrodes used in neural recording.  This method of tube insulation could be extended to other nanotubes beyond the carbon nanotubes we used, and in addition to its potential for producing neural probes, it could find application in nanoelectrochemistry and conductive atomic force microscopy.  This research formed a major portion of the doctoral thesis of the Physics graduate student who was the lead researcher on this project.  In addition, seven undergraduates actively participated in this research project.  We published a peer-reviewed article on our results, coauthored by six undergraduates, two graduate students, and three faculty members.
