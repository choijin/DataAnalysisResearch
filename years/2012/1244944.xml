<AbstractNarration>This award is an Early-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER). The project will provide the first data closely exploring the changing meanings that people attach to being overweight ("fat stigma") in the developing world.  The PIs are building a conceptual model of the relationship between obesity stigma and upward mobility as mediated by symbolic body capital that can be applied cross-culturally. They hypothesize a tipping point of economic prosperity where the idea of fatness as an undesirable personal and social characteristic begins to proliferate.  In this phase of the project they will evaluate ethnographically the key concepts that that they will test with more extensive survey-based research in a later phase.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The growing global prevalence of obesity is associated with increased engagement in the global economy, affecting diet and work patterns.  At the same time there appears an increase in stigma against overweight even in societies that traditionally valued larger bodies.  Little is known about the predictors and processes of the rise of fat stigma.  Even less is understood about changing understandings of shifts in body size, body size ideals, and fat stigma.  The researchers will collect ethnographic data in a typically upwardly mobile segment of these populations -- university students -- as well as among their non-student age-matched peers.  They will conduct participant-observation on university campuses and in community sites in Belize, Jamaica, and Nepal, three countries that vary in obesity rates, wealth, and culture. Interviews will be conducted with infomants matched by age (18-25) and gender in each of the six sites (for a total of 120 interviews).  They will also conduct a survey of a larger sample.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this research will contribute to theory on embodiment, moral personhood, and social transition.  They will also inform health-promotion programs and provide timely opportunities for two-way international educational collaborations in cultural anthropology.  Three graduate students and two undergraduate students will be engaged in data collection, and two graduate students and two undergraduate students will assist in data coding and analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The World Health Organization describes obesity as a global epidemic, one whose numbers have doubled since 1980. Not only does obesity contribute to diseases such as diabetes and cancer, but today it (with overweight) also is linked to more deaths around the world than underweight.  The alarm created by such statistics has prompted widespread, well-intentioned initiatives to reverse the trend, but they have not been without drawbacks. Among the most prominent is obesity stigma, which actually hampers those efforts. How, then, can societies intervene effectively against this epidemic and at the same time stem obesity stigma and its deeply deleterious effects?  Part of the answer to this question involves a better understanding of obesity stigma as it exists across various countries and cultures. This project examined stigma and symbolic body capital in Belize, Jamaica, Nepal and South Korea, and found significant differences in how cultural beliefs and norms influence the ways communities defined and responded to those concepts.      For example, gendered body ideals carried important meaning that included symbolic capital as a drive toward upward mobility in both dating and economic markets.  Body shapes that did not conform to culturally desirable ones--and especially those involving obesity-&ndash;evidenced a stigma component at both societal and individual levels in most cases (with the exception of dating preferences in Nepal).  More, "fat" was not found to be a monolithic object; rather, in the cases of Belize, Jamaica and Nepal, there could be "good" fat and "bad" fat depending on local practices, ideals and moral loading.   This work contributed novel theory in cultural anthropology regarding both drive toward ideals and drive away from alternatives evidenced through multi-faceted stigmatization of the wrong kind of obesity.  It also advanced understanding of how multi-level societal and individual beliefs and practices mutually inform one another in complex human phenomena such as body image and obesity.  The 2017 University of New Mexico/School for Advanced Research book, Fat Planet: Obesity, Culture and Symbolic Body Capital, describes some of the most important related findings.   This project piloted a multi-method protocol for assessing body image ideals and obesity stigma that captured local variation while still allowing for cross-cultural comparison in a multi-sited study that included both objective and subjective measures.  In addition, this project included expansion of multi-sited research capacity for the PI, training of 15 graduate and undergraduate students (the majority of whom are scholars from underrepresented groups), and international collaborations which include training of faculty and students and the establishment of enduring institutional relationships in the host countries.  Beyond scholarly publications emerging from this project, its results also are being communicated in public spaces such as a natural history museum and community and K-12 workshops and presentations.   Finally, this project provides a foundation for larger-scale studies of obesity stigma across varied settings, as well as differentiated approaches to future attempts to address rapidly climbing obesity rates.
