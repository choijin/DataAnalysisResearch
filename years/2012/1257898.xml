<AbstractNarration>This project investigates how the biodiversity of one of the world's most important groups of freshwater fishes evolved. Containing tetras, piranhas and many other popular aquarium fishes, order Characiformes represents one of the most diverse groups of fishes on the planet, but some of its families include species of many varying shapes, sizes and diets, while others include numerous species with similar habitats, food sources and anatomies. Why are some groups more diverse than others? How do its many species fit together on their family tree? How do a dozen or more ecologically similar species coexist in a single river? This project will tackle such questions by assembling a comprehensive tree-of-life for the very diverse characiform superfamily Anostomoidea (headstanders and relatives) using traditional DNA analysis, study of skeletal anatomy, and a new genomic approach. Then, that tree-of-life will serve as a framework with which to investigate the evolution of anatomical and ecological biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, this project synthesizes the expertise and genetic resources of two countries to forge an enduring international collaboration and reconstruct the evolutionary history of some of the most intriguing South American fishes with precision and detail that would be impossible if the labs were to work alone. It draws on diverse human capital in the US and in Brazil, including the author of previous evolutionary studies on these fishes, one of Brazil?s leading fish geneticists, an expert on taxonomy, a leader in genomics and macroevolution, and students in both countries.  Other broader impacts include the involvement of undergraduate students in research and outreach, development of a DNA-barcode library and interactive online identification key, sponsorship of graduate students at a training workshop and active participation in the Smithsonian's "The Scientist is In" program, which brings the public into direct contact with museum-affiliated researchers and specimens.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> This project collaborated internationally to produce a comprehensive tree-of-life for Anostomoidea, which is one of the dominant and most ecologically important groups of fishes in South America. The team completed one of the largest and most detailed genealogical reconstructions for a group of fishes to date, particularly with respect to the ambitious scope of datasets on internal anatomy and genomics. The project also pioneered a method for capturing the shape diversity of an anatomical system (the lower gill arches) that has been almost entirely unexplored by ichthyologists who focus on the study of biological shape. By harnessing recently developed analytical methods, the project revealed that differences in the speed of evolutionary change coupled with constraints on the kinds of changes that are easy to evolve can explain why some groups of fishes are more diverse than others in their jaws, gills and other parts of anatomy. It also demonstrated that fishes that are remarkably similar to one another in one portion of anatomy may differ considerably in other aspects. The genealogy generated herein will help revise the taxonomy of one of the largest groups of South American fishes and will provide a scaffolding for years of analyses to come. The analytical approach that this project developed provides a model for future studies comparing patterns of internal and external anatomical evolution in other groups of organisms distributed widely across the tree-of-life. &nbsp;Many species new to science were discovered during this project, five of which have been described to date.&nbsp;The project has produced fifteen publications and two completed graduate theses at the time of this writing, with another thesis and several other publications to appear over the next two years.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> This project enjoyed substantial success in training young scientists and helping them transition to positions that fit their skills and career goals. &nbsp;In total, one postdoc, four graduate students, one technician and two undergraduates played critical roles in the development and completion of the work. &nbsp;The postdoc has moved to a prestigious curatorship, the technician now manages a large human genomics lab, and the two graduate students who have finished their degrees have moved to a postdoctoral fellowship in Brazil and a biological collections management position in the United States.
