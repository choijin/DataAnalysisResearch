<AbstractNarration>Predator/prey interactions represent life and death struggles, especially for the prey.  Moths have developed a wide variety of behaviors to avoid being captured as they fly at night by bats.  The researchers study a system in which species of tiger moths have developed the ability to "jam" the sonar, or echolocation, of bats. The moths produce high-frequency sounds that interfere with the bat's ability to hear echoes returning from the moth, making them very difficult to catch. During the first-ever field study of sonar-jamming, the experimenters discovered a sound that Mexican free-tailed bats make while competing for insects against other Mexican free-tailed bats. The bat's call has many similarities with the moth's jamming signal. Using high speed video and high frequency microphone arrays in the field and lab, the experimenters will determine whether bats jam one another deliberately while competing for food. If this is so (and preliminary evidence suggests that it is), then this would be the first discovery that any echolocating animal actively jams individuals of the same species for their benefit. This work will allow us to compare how jamming works in moths and bats, and how this compares to jamming in modern human warfare. This research may have implications for developing acoustic bat deterrents and in understanding the biology of animals that provide billions of dollars in insect pest control each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will educate graduate students, undergraduates, and grade-school children. The most exciting educational aspect of this proposal is a partnership with SciWorks in Forsyth Co., NC. SciWorks is a Science Center and Environmental Park visited by over 40,000 K through 12 students per year (many of whom are minorities and/or economically disadvantaged). The Conner laboratory will provide a variety of presentations and assist in the development of interactive exhibits for SciWorks based on the research described in this proposal.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>If you watch a bat zipping after insects around a streetlight, it appears to be quiet, but it is anything but that. Bats make some of the loudest sounds in nature&mdash;so loud that it would hurt your ears if you could hear such high frequencies. By listening to faint echoes that return within milliseconds, the bat can &ldquo;see&rdquo; the world around it. These sounds are one of the bat&rsquo;s greatest assets, but they are also a liability. Unlike us, other animals, including many insects and other bats, can hear bat calls from some distance. When a moth hears a bat, it flees desperately. If that early strategy fails, it tries to out-maneuver the bat. We&rsquo;ve also discovered that some moths make specialized high-frequency clicks that jam the bat&rsquo;s echolocation. When studying these jamming signals in the field, we discovered a highly-unusual sound that the bats were making. This bat sound, which we later termed the sinFM, rises and falls in pitch some 150 times per second and it matches the frequencies used by other bats. What stood out to us about this sound was that we only recorded it when another bat was making its specialized &ldquo;feeding buzz&rdquo; calls used for capturing prey. Could the bats be jamming one another, just like the moths that we studied? To answer this question, we used specialized infrared cameras and microphones that would allow us to see and hear what the bats were doing.

We confirmed this finding by playing back the sinFM calls and other sounds to wild bats that we lured in to attacking a moth that we had suspended in the air with a fine fishing line. Just as we expected, the bats had no problem catching the moths in silence, or when we played sounds outside the frequency range of their echolocation.
