<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Catalysis Program, Prof. Umit S. Ozkan from the Ohio State Uinversity and co-PI Anne Co will investigate, in an interdisciplinary setting, the factors that control olefin selectivity from the electrocatalytically-assisted dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. The primary challenge in alkane dehydrogenation is selectivity control. The proposed research will combine two different strategies to tackle this problem. (1) Using an electrocatalytic reactor scheme will prevent hydrocarbons and oxygen coming in contact in the gas phase, hence limiting further oxidation of olefin molecules. At the same time, voltage control will provide a steady-flux of oxide ions to the anode, lifting the thermodynamic limitation, which governs non-oxidative dehydration reactions. Also, controlling the transfer of oxide ions to the anode surface could limit any carbonaceous species depositing on the surface in the form of coke. (2) By focusing on the surface properties of the anode electrocatalysts, it will be possible to tailor its activity to promote alkane activation, but inhibit C-C bond cleavage and complete oxidation of olefins. Understanding the structure/function relationship will guide this tailoring. To achieve this goal, the co-PIs will combine their expertise from two different fields, namely heterogeneous catalysis and electrochemistry. The interface of these areas will provide a unique approach to tackle the problems inherent in alkane dehydrogenation. The work plan will combine materials synthesis, detailed characterization and electrocatalytic activity measurements in an iterative process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alkane activation and dehydrogenation are reactions of great importance to the chemical industry. Selective conversion of alkanes to olefins may have significant economic impact. The fundamental understanding which will be acquired in this study can be extended to other catalytic oxidation reactions such as production of aldehydes, ketones and alcohols from lower alkanes. Many of the results from this project will be used to enhance the contents of a new course on electrochemistry, developed by the co-PI.  The PI has well-established partnerships with two local high schools to provide research internship experience to senior high school students. One of the schools, Columbus School for Girls, is a college preparatory school dedicated to girls' intellectual and social growth from infancy to the twelfth grade. Other programs that focus on human resource development will include College of Engineering Summer Orientation for Female Engineering Freshmen and "Energy and Environment Day" for ninth grade girls as part of a "CheME &amp; YOU @OSU" summer camp at Ohio. Both PI and co-PI have an existing track record of involving undergraduate students in hands on research, leading to co-authorship in research publications.</AbstractNarration>

The large availability of lower alkanes from refineries as well as their abundance in natural gas reserves and oil shale makes these reactions economically very relevant.
