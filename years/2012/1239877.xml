<AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the Advanced Research Workshop on Future Trends in Microelectronics, which is to be held in Corsica, France during June 25-29, 2012, is to discuss the future of the rapidly evolving microelectronics technology, in a small group, with leaders in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will provide a forum for an exchange of views among leading research professionals in industry, academia, and government. The intent is to arrive at a far-reaching overview of the evolution of microelectronics in the coming decade or more, as perceived by leading practitioners in the field. The major goal of the workshop is to assess the current status, define future research directions in microelectronics and to establish collaborations between researchers. This will be achieved through presentations and open discussions of the key technical issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: &lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this Workshop will be instrumental in defining the research required by the growing demands of microelectronics in the coming decade. This workshop will also contribute to the training of participating students and the topics will be disseminated through the Conference Technical Digest.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "Future Trends in Microelectronics: Into the Cross Currents" international workshop was held on the island of Corsica, France in Pianottoli-Caldarello, a village not far from Bonifacio. We met for five working days, June 25 &ndash; 29, 2012.  Among the 60 attendees were visionary academics as well as a number of captains of high-tech industry worldwide (Samsung, Applied Materials, Canadian Solar, Texas Instruments, ASML, etc.).     The program included both prepared invited presentations and ad hoc contributions with uninhibited exchange of views and rebuttals. Some of the key luminaries of our profession came to share their opinions and to lead the discussions on where we are going and/or should be going.  Balanced representations of advocacy and opposition where intentionally sought. The entire program complete with one-page abstracts of all papers, including both oral and poster contributions can be viewed at  http://www.ee.sunysb.edu/~serge/ARW-7/program.html     Each day of the conference started with presentations given by key speakers on subjects in one or two chosen themes.  It was then followed by debates and invited talks by other participants.  All oral presentations (in morning sessions) focused on the presenter's views and projections of future directions, assessments or critiques of important new ideas/approaches and NOT on their own achievements.  The presenters where asked to be provocative and/or inspiring.  Latest advances made and results obtained by the participants where presented in the afternoon sessions in the form of posters and group/individual discussions.   The day was concluded by an evening panels session that aimed at furthering the debates on selected controversial issues connected to the theme of the day.  Each session was chaired by one forceful character who invited 2-3 attendees of his/her choice to lead with a position statement, all other attendees being the panelists. The debate was forcefully moderated and irrelevant digressions where cut off.  We have taken a format that is less rigid than normal workshops to allow and encourage uninhibited exchanges and sometimes confrontation of different views.
