<AbstractNarration>This award will provide continued support of Skynet, a web-based software suite for controlling many remote telescopes simultaneously.  As part of this effort, the group at the University of North Carolina will continue to expand their network beyond the original PROMPT telescopes, an array of six fully automated telescopes located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, into a larger system with telescopes on several continents.  This network will be used to support observations of gamma-ray bursts and other transient and time-variable phenomena.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to have a significant impact on time domain astronomy.  The leaders of this project also envision outreach to tens of thousands of citizen scientists and members of the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Supported primarily by NSF, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) began building "PROMPT" and "Skynet" in 2004.  PROMPT originally consisted of six 16-inch diameter fully automated, or robotic, optical telescopes at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.  Skynet is PROMPTÆs control software, as well as sophisticated web-based, dynamic queue-scheduling software.  Skynet has opened PROMPT to tens of thousands of users, and is capable of controlling scores of telescopes simultaneously, including most commercially available small-telescope hardware.  In partnership with other institutions, Skynet has enabled us to grow PROMPT into a network of small, robotic telescopes.  The Skynet Robotic Telescope Network now numbers 19 optical telescopes between 14 and 40 inches in diameter and spans Chile, Australia, the United States, Italy, and soon Canada.  Skynet has now taken over 8.4 million exposures, currently at a rate of about 170,000 per month and this rate is increasing by about 4,600 per month.      Originally built to observe gamma-ray bursts, PROMPT and its mission have both expanded significantly.  PROMPT, and increasingly all of SkynetÆs telescopes, now serve a rapidly growing, state, national, and international user community as a broad-based facility for small-telescope science.  Over the past nine years, but mostly over the past 4 &ndash; 5 years, Skynet observations have resulted in 56 journal articles (with another approximately dozen submitted or in preparation across the network), over 350 observing reports, two doctoral dissertations, at least six masters theses, and at least five undergraduate honors theses.  SkynetÆs user community consists of UNC-CH; 13 regional undergraduate institutions, including three minority-serving institutions; UNC-CHÆs Morehead Planetarium and Science Center; many other institutions, nationally and internationally, that we have partnered with to produce additional high-impact, small-telescope science; the growing number of institutions that are putting non-PROMPT telescopes on Skynet, now including the National Radio Astronomy Observatory; and their partners.      OVERVIEW:  With this project, we funded Senior Personnel Joshua Haislip, SkynetÆs senior systems engineer:  (1) to continue to integrate new instruments and new telescopes into Skynet; (2) to continue to develop SkynetÆs telescope control and web-based, dynamic queue-scheduling software; and (3) to continue to develop Afterglow, which is easy-to-learn and easy-to-use, but publication quality, web-based data reduction and analysis software integrated into SkynetÆs database.  These efforts havel significantly impacted UNC-CHÆs ability to study GRBs, but more importantly, they have significantly impacted research and research training that is being carried out across SkynetÆs larger, and rapidly growing, user community, on transient and time-variable phenomena in general.      BROADER IMPACTS:  Aside from UNC-CH, most of SkynetÆs research and research training users are from smaller institutions without comparable facilities &ndash; some do not even have a campus telescope.  However, leveraged by PROMPT, our users have forged partnerships with users of other optical and radio telescopes around the world, and also of space telescopes.     PROMPT is also used by students of all ages &ndash; graduate through elementary &ndash; as well as by public audiences.  For example, in 2009 we revamped UNC-CHÆs introductory astronomy courses, including our lab course, which is now almost completely Skynet-based.  Lab enrollments have since increased 154%, all introductory astronomy enrollments increased 116% (now one in four UNC-CH students take at least one of our courses), and astronomy-track majors and minors increased &asymp;400%.  Our curriculum is now being adopted by over a dozen colleges and universities, and is offered both online and in MOOC format.     Given the impact that this labora...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
