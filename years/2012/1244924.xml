<AbstractNarration>Many aspects of atmospheric-ocean interactions at high southern latitudes are still poorly understood. For instance the interaction of large cyclonic and mesoscale storm systems with the atmospheric moisture balance in a changing climate and with a warming ocean are curiously different from the corresponding Arctic case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to better quantify the contribution of water vapor transport, and especially  the mesoscale drivers of synoptic variability, on the surface mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheets, and also to the annual progression of Southern Ocean  sea-ice. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To investigate the role of these mesoscale cyclonic storm systems, a variety of satellite data products, best available reanalysis products and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model predictions will be used to developed scenarios for changes in cyclone frequencies and strength in an intensifying hydrological cycle, and the impacts these may have on Antarctic sea-ice and continental surface mass balances.</AbstractNarration>

The paths of some storm systems have been found to go from the Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica, to directly over the Antarctic continent itself (See Figure 2 and sequence Figures 3-6).&nbsp; This in turn brings moisture, clouds, and poor weather conditions to these sections of the continent.&nbsp; The impact is both a local and global issue.&nbsp; It locally affects the weather of the select regions, and these are also places in which scientists, researchers, and logistic support crews are operating, putting them at risk.&nbsp; It globally impacts the cryosphere of the Earth, being the method for the distribution of moisture onto the Antarctic continent from lower latitudes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project utilized satellite observations to attempt to verify the clouds associated with these storms and their movement from over the Southern Ocean toward Antarctica.&nbsp; Several sectors around Antarctica are preferential as compared to other sectors for clouds to move onto the Antarctic continent. This observational finding confirms numerical model analyses and prior theoretical research. Although these occurrences have been well characterized, determining well-defined reasoning why they take place is less clear. Larger forces in the atmosphere and climate system have been examined but do not exhibit a definitive cause-and-effect relationship. &nbsp;The behaviors documented in this project are found not to have strong associations with individual broad phenomena like El Nino, which might have been expected. Instead, it is likely that either a combination of global interactions and local factors are more important, and this is beyond the scope of this research project.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This work has also inspired collaborative studies with an objective to also identify smaller storm systems, known as mesocyclones.&nbsp; These objectives aim to track mesocyclones, developing methods to do so in an automated way, as well as developing databases of these smaller storm systems, which are often overlooked by numerical modeling reanalysis systems and climate models.&nbsp; The impact of these mesocyclones is large on both the wind speeds and surface heat fluxes over the ocean.&nbsp; This is important for diagnosing energy transport and for improving &nbsp;modeling systems &ndash; both those with a weather focus and those with a climate focus &ndash; to better capture the behavior in this region of the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project has also seen a spin-off of activities.
