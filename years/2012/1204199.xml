<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2012 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. These fellowships support a research and training plan at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Anatoly Preygel is "Higher-categorical tools in singularity theory and algebraic-symplectic geometry." The host institution for the fellowship is University of California, Berkeley, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Constantin Teleman.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funded work advanced the start of the art in applying highly technical tools from homotopy theory to topics in other fields of pure mathematics: algebraic geometry, mathematical physics, and geometric representation theory.  One recurring theme in many of these works was the application of the notion of "Ind-Coherent sheaves," the development of some of their technical properties, and the analogies between these objects and microlocal analysis.  This notion played a central role in the PI's PhD thesis, which contained one of the early written expositions of some of this machinery.  Ind-Coherent sheaves and their microlocal interpretation occur in the Geometric Langlands program, and this project led to several papers exploring similar connections.  More broadly, this project funded the PI's undergraduate teaching, collaboration, and mathematical writing.  The author taught course both for math-majors (abstract algebra) and a broader scientific audience (mathematical methods for the physical sciences), and wrote several recommendation letters to strong students in these courses.  The collaborations involved co-authors at UC Berkeley, UT Austin, and Columbia and resulting in several finished works products.  The project also led to the completion of several manuscripts and several publications in journals of interest to a broad mathematical audience (e.g., Composition, JEMS).
