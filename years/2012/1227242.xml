<AbstractNarration>San Jose State University proposes to support technical services on R/V Point Sur, a 135? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated by the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  They request support for basic services and maintenance of a towed, undulating vehicle as specialized services. They will provide one technician on each seagoing research project of R/V Point Sur to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  This project supported Oceanographic Technical Services on the NSF owned UNOLS research vessel POINT SUR while it was being operated by Moss Landing Marine Laboratories.  This support ensured that the oceanographic instrumentation on board Point Sur was properly calibrated and operated with the assistance and guidance of experienced marine technicians.  This support before, during and after cruises ensured successful data and sample collection for research and educational projects using the vessel. From March of 1986 until December of 2014 the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories operated the Point Sur as a UNOLS vessel supporting a wide range of research and educational programs in all major disciplines of the ocean sciences.  Point Sur is a 135 foot Regional Class research vessel capable of supporting up to 12 scientists at sea for as long as three weeks at a time.  During the period of this grant, in addition to working along the California and Oregon coasts the Point Sur has traveled to Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula and to Attu Island in the western Aleutian Islands primarily supporting NSF funded researchers.  Point Sur supported researchers looking at the effects of ocean acidification on kelp forests in the Aleutians, the recovery of Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) as part of a post seismic event study off the coast of Chile, Physical Oceanographic observations around the Baja Peninsula and in the Gulf of Alaska, Whale population studies in the Antarctic, studies of Mercury transported in coastal fog, the recovery of optical telemetry instruments from a seafloor borehole observatory and a study of waves and currents at the mouth of the Columbia river, just to name some of the many research projects made possible.  These and other peer reviewed and funded research projects made possible with support by the Research Vessel Point Sur form the basis for the Intellectual Merit of this project.   Broader Impacts:  As part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet the R/V Point Sur was a shared use asset available to any qualifying researcher or educator with a funded project.  Access to state of the art research facilities is fundamental to a successful U.S. ocean sciences research enterprise. Through the support of the National Science Foundation and other Federal Agencies and the coordination provided by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) the operation of vessels such as the Point Sur is made possible.  The National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research provide the capital investment with the construction and ownership of the majority of the vessels in the fleet.  UNOLS Operators such as Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) provide the expertise and management to effectively support research and education funded by the Federal Agencies and by the institutions themselves.  In the case of the Point Sur educational programs were a very high priority supporting the development of oceanographers and marine scientists of the future.  Class cruises for graduate students at MLML and at the Naval Postgraduate School made up about 10% of the annual operations.  In the final year, a program for early career scientists that provided training in how to serve as a research cruise Chief Scientist was supported with funding by NSF, ONR and MLML with three short cruises and classroom activities.  With the retirement of the Point Sur a valuable asset for research and education on the Central California Coast has been lost. However, with the sale of the vessel to the University of Southern Mississippi the vessel continues to support research and educational programs in the Gulf of Mexico.  Valuable oceanographic instrumentation was also transferred with the vessel and to other UNOLS institutions with support under this grant.
