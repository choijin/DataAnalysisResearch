<AbstractNarration>With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Lisa J. Lucero will bring together a multidisciplinary team that include archaeologists, underwater archaeologists, exploration divers, an ethnobotanist, a tropical tree specialist, and a paleontologist from the U.S., Mexico, and Belize to examine how ancient Maya settlement articulates with sacred landscape features in addition to examining rainfall patterns and landscape transformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Openings in the earth, such as caves and pools, were sacred to the Maya as portals to the underworld or Xibalba.  The Maya left countless offerings in these portals to petition gods and ancestors to bring forth rain and bountiful crops.  At Cara Blanca in central Belize, there are 25 openings in the earth in the form of pools (Pools 1-25).  Its distance from centers and relatively sparse but unique settlement (e.g., water temple and sweatbaths) suggest it may have served as a pilgrimage center.  Growing evidence in the form of a Terminal Classic (c. 800-900 C.E.) water temple at Pool 1 with a copious amount of water jars indicates that the Maya increased their visits to Cara Blanca at the end of the Late Classic, perhaps in response to a series of multiyear droughts that struck the Maya area between c. 800 and 900 C.E.  Further, previous dives at Pool 1 have yielded megafauna fossils, submerged trees and freshwater shells that can be used to assess ancient climate and landscape change through oxygen isotope analysis, radiocarbon dating, and species identification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goals in 2014 (April 30-June 30) are to conduct underwater excavations at two pools, continue excavating the water temple at Pool 1, collect submerged fossils, fossil matrix (gastropods, wood, soil) and tree limbs, map and explore a total of five unexplored pools, and collect botanical specimens near pools to compare with submerged trees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project will be to collect information about cultural landscapes, ceremonial life on the surface and in the water, and ritual intensification.  This project is unique in both its multidisciplinary approach and focus on both the cultural and material aspects of climate change and how the Maya responded to it.  This project also will address a topic that has been missing in southern lowland Maya studies - the focus on water bodies as portals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the study is that results will be relevant today since the challenges the Maya faced between 800 and 900 C.E. are similar to the ones at present with accelerating global climate change.  The international and multidisciplinary team will include graduate students from the University of Illinois.  The investigations at Cara Blanca also set the stage for future fieldwork, including additional diving expeditions to explore more of the 25 pools, continuing to survey the transect along the pools, and excavating the sweatbaths, water shrines, and other interesting settlement configurations.  Results will be disseminated through major peer review outlets (e.g., Latin American Antiquity, Ancient Mesoamerica, Antiquity) and in Belize at the annual Belize Archaeology Symposium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How have people in the past dealt with major climate change?  What lessons can we take away and apply to the present in the face of current, global climate change?  These are some of the broader questions this project has been attempting to address with NSF funds in the 2014-2016 summer archaeology field seasons at the Cara Blanca pools in central Belize, Central America.  Most of our efforts focused on what we hypothesize to be ceremonial structures that the Maya built along the edge of Pool 1, a 60 m deep cenote (steep-sided sinkhole fed by groundwater) during a relatively brief period of time (800-900 CE) when there appears to have been several prolonged droughts.  The Classic Maya (c. 550-900 CE), as many traditional Maya group do at present, made pilgrimages to sacred openings in the earth (water bodies, caves, etc.) to supplicate gods and ancestors to end droughts.  The diverse ceramic styles of the thousands of water jar sherds recovered from excavating buildings suggest that people from all over the Maya area visited Cara Blanca to participate in water and other rites.  They were to no avail, however, and the Maya abandoned Cara Blanca along with southern lowland centers in search of water and new lands and economic opportunities.  These were hard choices&mdash;leaving one?s home and community for good.  They had no choice, however; tough times meant tough choices.  I think we will soon be in a similar situation&mdash;facing very difficult decisions to address climate change, ones that will require us to completely rethink how we live on a daily basis.  Continued analysis on collections will fine-tune what the Maya did and how their story impacts our current, ongoing story.  In addition to excavating ceremonial buildings, we also were able to explore the pools themselves; experienced cave divers were able to collect diverse kinds of datasets from Pool 1 (and others) to address landscape, climate change, and human action; these include Pleistocene megafauna fossils, ancient and modern trees, ancient Maya artifacts, and sediment cores (for pollen and soil analysis). Intellectual merit: Datasets provide the foundation for the current proposal based on the positive preliminary results that are starting to reveal long-term climate and landscape transformation and how people respond to climate change and adapt with broader applications. Broader impacts: not only does this project contribute to how humans address changing climate that has implications for present concerns, but also has allowed students to gain field and research experience as expressed in report chapters (http://www.anthro.illinois.edu/faculty/lucero/index.html), peer reviewed publications and presentations in Belize, the U.S. and elsewhere, dissertation research, senior honors theses, a MA thesis, independent study projects, and blogs written by Lucero and students featured on the UIUC homepage and other media (e.g., National Geographic).
