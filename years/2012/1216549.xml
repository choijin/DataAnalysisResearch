<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funding to help defray the expenses of participants, especially graduate students and postdocs, attending the biannual meetings of the "Midwest Partial Differential Equations Seminar" for the years 2012, 2013, and 2014. The first of these conferences will be held from April 27-29, 2012, on the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Midwest Partial Differential Seminar began to hold twice-yearly meetings in Spring 1977. Over the intervening years the seminar has proved to be extremely influential in the development of aspiring young specialists in the field by providing a venue in which they could present their work, by facilitating important professional contacts, and by serving as an incubator for research collaborations. The next three years of the event will continue and enhance that tradition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Partial differential equations comprise one of the major topics in the fabric of mathematics.  The roots of the subject go back to Newton in the 17th century.  Newtonian mechanics, which replaced the earlier ideas of Descartes, is written in the language of differential equations.  By the end of the 19th century, most of physics was expressed in terms of partial differential equations, and this continues today, but broadened to include chemistry, biology, economic theory and finance.  It is an area of mathematics that has a very clear connection with engineering practice as well as the pure sciences.        In North America, the subject began to find its feet in the 1950s.  By the middle of the 1960s, it was on its way to becoming a major subdiscipline in the mathematics firmament.  In the middle 70s, some 40 years ago, Felix Browder (University of Chicago), Avner Friedman (Northwestern University), Mike Crandall and Paul Rabinowitz (University of Wisconsin, Madison)  and Salah Baouendi (Purdue) conceived of a bi-yearly, informal meeting of mathematicians, joined occasionally by physicists, engineers, and later biologists, to discuss some of the latest developments in partial differential equations.  This was partly due to their own predilections, but it was also in response to the burgeoning of the subject and its applications, and to the large preponderance of experts working at midwestern universities.  Thus came into being the Midwest Partial Differential Equations Seminars.         This seminar has been running twice a year for almost forty years now.  Its impact has been, and continues to be, enormous.  It is especially helpful for students and young researchers who benefit both from being exposed to what is current in the subject and to being able to present their own work to a group of experts for commentary and suggestions.       A typical meeting features six to eight invited speakers and anywhere from four to eight presentations by younger researchers.  The attendance runs around 40 or 50, but some have been larger.  They usually run on the weekend, though some have started on Friday and others have run over to early in the next week.  The seminars do not have a registration fee and are run informally and on a relatively low budget, so making the outlay from public funds minimal, especially considering the scientific benefit.       Originally, the seminars cycled between Purdue, Northwestern, Madison, and the University of Chicago.  However, that has broadened considerably by now.  Sixteen universities and one national laboratory have run meetings, including as far South as the University of Kentucky and University of Memphis, as far West as the University of Missouri, East to Ohio State and North to the University of Minnesota and the University of Michigan.  This has allowed a very large group of researchers to participate in these very successful seminars.       The present grant continued this tradition, and included meetings at Michigan State, the University of Minnesota, the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Northwestern, Purdue and the University of Michigan.
