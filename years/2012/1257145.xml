<AbstractNarration>This study examines the relationship between capacity building in computer science and economic innovation. Data will consist of 1) a quantitative survey of computer science researchers; 2) in-depth qualitative interviews with researchers, students, policymakers, funders, entrepreneurs and staff of nongovernmental organizations; and 3) video ethnographic observation of researchers in their everyday interactions with students, funders, community organizations and other nodes of the innovation system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to presenting results at scholarly meetings and in scholarly publications, the PIs plan an outreach event in Washington, DC for congressional staff, international policy makers and managers of technology companies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This three year research project examined the development of computer science research capacity in East Africa. We found that Uganda and Kenya have developed both a robust research initiative and academic programs that are producing multiple PhD computer scientists each year. Unlike much scientific research in the developing world, these computer science programs are not being driven by outside influences. Rather, they have developed an impressive internal capacity that is allowing them to pursue research projects that solve local problems. These include apps that help diagnose crop diseases for local farmers, a weather information management system to enable better forecasting, and techniques to inexpensively identify cases of sickle-cell anemia.  The major barriers to these efforts are typically not access to computing equipment or even basic funding. Rather we found that there is so much demand for computer scientists to teach or work in basic IT management jobs that it is easy for some to be pulled away from research.  This research demonstrates that it is possible for local populations to develop and carry out important scientific research in the developing world.  Research need not be defined by outsiders to ensure productive results. In fact there is evidence that when outsiders define the problems to be researched in developing countries, the benefits are more likely to accrue to the outsiders, rather than to the people it was meant to benefit.  The researchers in our study did benefit from some outside support &ndash; including scholarships to spend part of their PhD training in Europe and grants to cover the construction of facilities &ndash; but they were ultimately free to train their own students and define their own research programs.  Thus our research shows that finding simple ways to empower rather than direct researchers in developing countries can lead to numerous benefits for local populations.  Over the course of this three year research project, the team conducted an online survey of computer scientists in Kenya and Uganda, and over 120 interviews on site in Kampala, Nairobi and Europe. The project concluded with two dissemination workshops in East Africa with dozens of local presenters and 120 local researchers in attendance. Researchers on this project have produced 2 published articles (with 4 more in preparation), 19 research presentations in 7 countries and an ethnographic film entitled "Computing Cultures: Portraits of Knowledge Production in East Africa that has been screened at three film festivals.
