<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to provide travel support for PIs and students on current NSF cubesat projects to participate in a meeting hosted at NSF on May 24, 2012.  The purpose of the meeting is to showcase how the current projects promote innovative and creative STEM education and workforce development as well as front-line, interdisciplinary scientific research and technology advances.   Presentations will also explore the potential for future cubesat projects to provide crucial measurements from space that are needed to solve critical societal problems including:  climate change, land use and resource management, pollution and disaster monitoring, communication and space weather; and enable further scientific discoveries and engineering innovation, including: Manufacturing in space, materials research for 3D printing of satellites and components, sensor miniaturization, micro-electro-mechanical (MEM) systems, systems engineering, radio science, communication algorithms and networks, cloud physics, atmospheric chemistry, space physics, Earth radiation budget, ocean observations, and biology. The goal of the meeting is to identify ways and best practices for CubeSats to benefit interdisciplinary science goals along with STEM education and diversity objectives broadly within all relevant research areas of NSF.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CubeSats are satellites that are approximately 4 inches by 4 inches by 12 inches and are launched as secondary payloads on rockets that are taking a much larger satellite into orbit.  These CubeSats are a relatively inexpensive way to allow scientists and students to launch small instruments into space to conduct science.  The scientists gain knowledge of the environment, while the students learn how to design, build, test and deploy complex systems to accomplish an extremely specific goal in very harsh conditions.  The National Science Foundation has funded almost 10 CubeSat projects that have focused on education and space science.  This project brought those groups together at NSF headquarters to have oral and poster presentations on the accomplishments of the CubeSat missions that have been flown and those that are being built presently.  Approximately 10 scientists and 15 students presented their accomplishments at this meeting to a general audience that included people off the street and NSF employees.  As an example, the Radio Auroral Explorer (RAX), the first NSF sponsored CubeSat, was represented by Professor James Cutler from the University of Michigan and two students.  He presented a talk on his experiences with CubeSats, while his students presented a poster on the accomplishments of the RAX CubeSat.
