<AbstractNarration>Duke University proposes to support technical services on R/V Cape Hatteras, a 135? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated by the Duke/UNC Consortium as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  They request support for basic services only. They will provide one technician on each seagoing research project of R/V Cape Hatteras to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The R/V Cape Hatteras was sold on March 3, 2013.  There are no current activities or outcomes related to the R/V Cape Hatteras technical services to report.  After the sale of the R/V Cape Hatteras the marine technician assigned to the vessel became a member of the Marine Technician Relief Pool Pilot Program and employee of Duke University from August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013.  University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) managed the scheduling of technician time (vessels and dates), Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute managed the travel and Duke University managed the payroll.  With approval from the National Science Foundation the former R/V Cape Hatteras technician attended technician training sponsored by UNOLS and served 85 days onboard various UNOLS vessels.  On December 31, 2013, Duke University ended its involvement in the Marine Technician Relief Pool Pilot Program.  It is my understanding that the Marine Technician Relief Pool Pilot Program transitioned from a Pilot Program to a Program (NSF solicitation 15-525) with Texas A&amp;M winning the solicitation.  The Program is currently under the management of Texas A&amp;M and UNOLS with support from the National Science Foundation.  The relief technicians are independent contractors and serve on both UNOLS and non-UNOLS research vessels.       Last Modified: 09/12/2017       Submitted by: Richard T Barber]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
