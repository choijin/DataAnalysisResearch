<AbstractNarration>Understanding bat biosonar performance using the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound and adaptive beamforming&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will test the series of hypotheses that bats use adaptive beamforming for echolocation and that this adaptive beam provides more tracking information than a stationary transmit beam. The project will use a combination of biological, behavioral, acoustic, engineering, signal processing and statistical techniques as well as new acoustic technology and a creative mathematical approach to investigate adaptive beamforming in the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus). A high-resolution, multi-element microphone array will measure the echolocation beam from both stationary and flying bats and the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound will be used to determine the tracking accuracy for static and adaptive transmit beams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the project, the postdoctoral fellow will create a bioacoustic curriculum on the biological, physiological, and ecological characteristics of bats that includes acoustic files and spectrograms and students will be encouraged via inquiry-based approaches to create bioacoustic experiments and mathematically interpret their results. The curriculum, alone with outreach components, will be implemented at high schools across Rhode Island to foster an understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of science and encourage student excitement and engagement about biology, mathematics, and the physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

The biosonar performance of these bats far surpasses that of man-made systems, particularly for real-time operation.  Understanding how bats use echolocation with fine precision can improve devices to navigate in different environments using sound, such as sonar and acoustic imaging devices for the blind.   The beam of batsÆ echolocation signals is wide, which provides the advantage of a large area for acquiring acoustic returns. This wide beam area, however, comes with a trade-off, resulting in echoes from background objects or sonar signals from other bats arriving from many different directions.  Such unwanted signals&mdash;called clutter&mdash;can interfere with a batÆs ability to successfully localize a target.  Despite these challenges, echolocating bats operate remarkably effectively even in cluttered environments, and it is thought that bats use the structure of their emitted beam to better perceive targets in clutter.
