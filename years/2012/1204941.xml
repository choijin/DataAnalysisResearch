<AbstractNarration>The Problem Based Learning (PBL) in Advanced Manufacturing: Transforming 21st Century Technician Education project builds on several successful projects and is developing a curriculum and providing professional development to bring problem based learning to advanced manufacturing training. The work primarily supports Community Colleges. The industry partnerships in this project will sustain the work beyond the funding period. Problem based learning is a well recognized, highly engaging teaching pedagogy and is improving student achievement in several areas of advanced manufacturing. The project is developing and disseminating PBL lessons for several interdisciplinary real-world advanced manufacturing challenges. To facilitate expansion of the program, the project investigators are also creating PBL design templates that make it easier for others to create effective PBL lessons. As the project progresses, investigators continue to study the efficacy of PBL in engineering technician and STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional development and ongoing support is provided to community college engineering technician faculty across New England enabling them to implement PBL in the classroom. Outreach to high schools is increasing the number of students prepared to enter STEM majors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of the AM PBL project were to:  Expand the reach of the successful PHOTON PBL and STEM PBL Challenge model to the field of advanced manufacturing in New England and beyond by creating a new series of multimedia PBL Challenges, instructional resources, and user-friendly tools that will enable educators to develop their own PBL materials to enhance 21st century engineering technician skills. Increase the number of engineering technician faculty and in-service high school STEM educators in New England capable of developing and delivering PBL instruction in advanced manufacturing technician education. Increase the pipeline of high school students prepared and motivated to pursue engineering technician education and other STEM careers by increasing the number of STEM teacher education faculty and subsequently pre-service teachers capable of developing and delivering PBL instruction. Conduct scholarly research on the efficacy of PBL in engineering technician and STEM education.    Building on the interdisciplinary multi-media Challenges in the field of optics and photonics and sustainable technologies, this project expanded the number of resources and training in PBL methodology to include advanced and sustainable manufacturing in fields such as aerospace, optics, precision measurement, medical devices, and nanotechnology. The strategy employed and resources developed have produced more graduates prepared to fill the demand for skilled workers in New England?s advanced manufacturing companies. The instructional materials, including six new Challenges and a user-friendly template to enable educators to create their own Challenges, are now accessible on the Internet to provide full access across the nation and beyond.
