<AbstractNarration>Future scientific and technological efforts to achieve better understanding of oceans and water-related applications will rely heavily on our ability to jointly consider communications, actuation and sensing in a unified system that includes instruments, vehicles, human operators and sensors of all types. The goals of this project are to design networking tools for mobile underwater networks, develop novel navigation mechanisms for communication-constrained autonomous underwater vehicles and to ultimately integrate sensing and classification to provide solutions for the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to development of underwater communication methods with applications to science, security, and industry in the areas of environmental monitoring, aquatic eco-system analysis, ocean accident remediation, surveillance for defense applications, homeland security, oil and gas, aquaculture, geological and oceanographic science, and marine biology. It will also contribute to the training of new information technology professionals and scientists with expertise in interdisciplinary research spanning underwater networks, oceanography and computer science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Multiple agents operating autonomously under the ocean surface with the ability to sense the environment, move, communicate with each other and transmit information to the shore, have the&nbsp; potential to enable&nbsp;an array of &nbsp;emerging applications,&nbsp; ranging from smart aquaculture to protection of&nbsp; coastal waters and exploration of both the deep-ocean and polar regions. They thus have an impact on diverse disciplines, such as &nbsp;basic &nbsp;sciences (oceanography, marine biology, geology),&nbsp; industry (off-shore oil, aquaculture), environment monitoring (climate recording, pollution control, prediction of natural disturbances)&nbsp;&nbsp;and security (surveillance for defense applications, homeland/port security, ocean accident remediation). &nbsp;</p> <p>Ocean is a harsh environment in which to operate, and the technology that goes into autonomous &nbsp;underwater systems is a sophisticated one. It&nbsp; often requires the designers to go back to fundamental principles of signal processing, communication and control, before the final field demonstrations can be successful.</p> <p>The &nbsp;focus of the <em>Exploration and Exploitation in Actuated Communication Networks </em>project was on &nbsp;autonomous underwater systems, where the various system functions,&nbsp; ranging from sensing and navigation to communication and fusion &nbsp;of information obtained from distributed sensors, must be integrated in an intelligent manner so as to overcome the limitations imposed by the underwater environment.</p> <p>The major challenge in accomplishing these tasks comes from the fact that communication is established by transmission of sound under the ocean surface, which, in contrast to the traditional radio transmission on land, is plagued by an extremely limited bandwidth, as well as distortions imposed by signal reflections from the bottom and surface. In other words, any exchange of information, be it between fixed sensors and a fusion center, or between autonomous underwater vehicles, is possible only at low bit rates, and the guarantees of receiving the information correctly can be slim.</p> <p>In light of these challenges, our research focused on several layers of the system architecture. From bottom to top, we addressed&nbsp; (1) signal processing for establishing improved-quality acoustic communication links, (2) packaging of information and adjustment of transmission power to increase the chances of successful packet reception in a network, and (3) top-level system architecture where multiple sensors access the fusion center in a random fashion to send data packets that are then used to reconstruct field events. A specific field event that was of interest to our work was one where multiple moving objects traverse the area populated by sensors while emitting signature signals. The signals are picked by the sensors, encoded into digital data packets, &nbsp;and transmitted to the fusion center. Reconstruction of the objects&rsquo; trajectories is then attempted using a custom-designed method that is capable of operating with limited information (the information is limited because only so many data packets can be transmitted over the limited acoustic bandwidth, and not all of them will be received successfully because of the channel distortions).</p> <p>Key outcomes of our work included a number of new design approaches within each of the three areas mentioned. On the signal processing level (1), we developed a new propagation model which helps in understanding the apparently random channel distortions, and informs the development of specific signal processing algorithms.&nbsp; Specific algorithms included a new method for estimating the randomly-varying communication channel, and for processing acoustic communication signals of the &ldquo;multi-carrier&rdquo; type.&nbsp; The advantages of our method, which was also demonstrated experimentally using&nbsp; real data, include efficient use of the limited acoustic bandwidth, resistance to motion-induced Doppler distortion, and computational complexity that is in line with &nbsp;current hardware capabilities.</p> <p>Going above the signal processing to the second level (2), we have developed a new method for&nbsp; improving the reliability of packet transmission. This method incorporates &nbsp;packet coding and adaptive adjustment of transmission power, which is made&nbsp; in response to the information fed back from the receiver. Packet coding is a simple, stand-alone technique that&nbsp; does not replace conventional bit coding, but instead operates together with it to improve the link reliability.&nbsp; Packet coding &nbsp;can also be applied together with any type of signal processing, i.e. it is readily applicable to any existing acoustic modem. Its major advantage is in increasing the chances of successful data packet delivery, which it does&nbsp; by coding ahead. This is an important asset in networks where full reliability is required through acknowledged receipts &ndash; there, increasing the chances of success results in fewer re-transmissions, which in turn yields a shorter delivery time on acoustic links where round-trip delays are long (sound travels a hundred thousand times slower than radio signals).</p> <p>Finally, on the third level (3) we have assessed the intricate interplay between the number of sensors, transmission rate and the available bandwidth needed to achieve a certain quality of reconstruction. Using computer simulation, we have demonstrated &nbsp;successful operation of our method. Our future work will continue along similar lines, as each new result offers inspiration for the next.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/11/2017<br>      Modified by: Milica&nbsp;Stojanovic</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1212999/1212999_10195432_1502477323499_outcomesfig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1212999/1212999_10195432_1502477323499_outcomesfig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig.1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1212999/1212999_10195432_1502477323499_outcomesfig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig.1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Multiple sensors (triangles) pick up the signals emitted by moving objects (circles), encode the signals into digital data packets and transmit the packets to the fusion center (rectangle labeled ?FC?) where the objects' trajectories are reconstructed.</div> <div class="imageCredit">M.Stojanovic</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Milica&nbsp;Stojanovic</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig.1.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1212999/1212999_10195432_1502477420475_outcomesfig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1212999/1212999_10195432_1502477420475_outcomesfig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig.2."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1212999/1212999_10195432_1502477420475_outcomesfig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig.2."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Colored stripes moving upwards represents signal echoes (dorect, sirface-reflected, etc.) in time.
