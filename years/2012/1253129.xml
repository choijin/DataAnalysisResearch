<AbstractNarration>This project tests whether streams and lakes in the Big Thicket National Preserve (BTNP) in East Texas harbor a higher diversity of animal species than streams and lakes in surrounding, unprotected areas. This will be accomplished via a comprehensive survey of the parasites of fishes in the BTNP and the surrounding area that encompasses the historical range of the Big Thicket. Parasites will be utilized as indicator species for overall biodiversity and community interactions, and is expected to include at least 220 parasite species from 8 animal groups and at least 95 species of fishes.&lt;br/&gt;The project will greatly accelerate discovery of new species in an area under intense human pressure, provide critical, informative tests of the utility of conservation preserves in protecting natural ecosystems, and will help inform future decisions regarding conservation design and protection of natural resources. In addition, the project will enhance the nation's public museum holdings of parasite and fish specimens (at least 1,600 new lots of specimens), enhance infrastructure for research and education of students in STEM disciplines at a small, rural college, provide opportunities and effective avenues for student advancement towards careers in the sciences, and contribute to ongoing research and conservation endeavors, including the Big Thicket All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory coordinated by the National Park Service.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual merit: The scientific goals of this project were to: 1) test whether a conservation unit in Texas (Big Thicket National Preserve) effectively maintains healthier and more interactive communities of animals in its streams and rivers than do areas unprotected by the Preserve; and 2) to discover, document, describe, and preserve for posterity the diversity of parasites found in fishes in the waters the Big Thicket National Preserve and of southeastern Texas, generally.<br />We collected data on two species of catfishes from 12 sites from both inside and outside the Big Thicket National Preserve to test the hypothesis that the Preserve protects its aquatic habitats. Our analyses demonstrated that there were more kinds of parasites in catfish <em>inside</em> the Preserve than outside, and that the parasites were more common and abundant <em>inside</em> the Preserve. This demonstrates that the complex life cycles of parasites (which involve many other vertebrate and invertebrate animals besides the fishes) are more successful inside the Big Thicket than outside. Because these life cycles involve feeding relationships (e.g., fish feeding on many kinds of prey) and spatio-temporal relationships (fishes coexisting with other animals in diverse communities), this indicates that the waters of the Big Thicket National Preserve are biologically healthier than their nearby counterparts outside the Preserve. This study is one of the first to demonstrate that: 1) parasites can be used to make inferences about ecosystem health; and 2) parasite diversity reveals that a conservation unit is effectively protecting ecosystems from degradation and decline.<br />In addition, 16 expeditions were made to the Big Thicket National Preserve to collect samples of fish species and recover their parasites for analysis. In all, 533 person-days of work resulted in the collection of 1,405 fish representing 76 species from 38 sites. 2,888 parasite specimens were deposited in the Harold W. Manter Laboratory of Parasitology at the Nebraska State Museum, including 858 specimens of approximately 75 species suitable for genetic testing in the future. These databases are duplicated in the National Park Service database and online at the award&rsquo;s website (science.peru.edu/acanths). Included in these collections are specimens representing 13 species previously unknown to science, all of which have been, or are in the process of being, published in the scientific literature. In all, we published 17 manuscripts on the diversity and ecology of the parasites of fishes in southeastern Texas.<br />The summation of all of this work is the documentation of a significant amount of unknown parasite biodiversity in the southern regions of the U.S.A. Collectively, we often think that most of the discovery of species has been accomplished in places like the U.S.A., but this is only true for the large and charismatic groups of animals and plants. Parasites remain poorly understood everywhere on this planet, with the few exceptions of those that plague humans, their livestock, pets, and agricultural plants. This work will hopefully help to invigorate a renewed interest in biological survey of parasites, wherever that work might occur.<br />Broader impacts: The project supported a number of efforts to broaden and intensify the participation of young students in the biological sciences. Ten undergraduate students participated in all aspects of the project&rsquo;s work, including 342 person-days in the field during 15 field expeditions. These students published 9 articles describing species new to science, as well as significant contributions to the classification, ecology, and biodiversity analyses of parasites of fishes. They also presented 7 platform and poster presentations at regional and national/international scientific meetings. Eight of the 10 students now have professional goals in the sciences, and 7 have graduated and progressed in the sciences, ranging from medical research to veterinary medicine to agricultural science to fisheries biology and conservation.<br />Other broader impacts include: 1) outreach to high school teachers through a cooperative educational curriculum in parasite and fish diversity taught at Sam Houston State University; 2) development and population of the website and databases that distribute freely the materials and information collected as part of this project, including all original datasheets and summaries of all our data; 3) documentation of the diversity of parasites through comprehensive museum collections (Harold W. Manter Laboratory of Parasitology) and multiple avenues to access the data produced by the award (HWML, NPS, award website); and, 4) collaborations with other scientists offering their expertise to the work, resulting in 5 publications so far, including a species new to science and the discovery of an invertebrate previously undocumented in this hemisphere.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/25/2017<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;A&nbsp;Barger</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236037630_Students_Trinity--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236037630_Students_Trinity--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Researchers"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236037630_Students_Trinity--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Researchers"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">From left, Drew, James, and Haley, in the Trinity River during an early collecting trip.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael Barger</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Michael&nbsp;A&nbsp;Barger</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Researchers</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236112150_Students_Trinity_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236112150_Students_Trinity_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Researchers, part two."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236112150_Students_Trinity_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Researchers, part two."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">From left, Kyle, Hayden, and Haley (again), again in the Trinity River on a later collecting trip.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael Barger</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Michael&nbsp;A&nbsp;Barger</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Researchers, part two.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236193492_Students_Turkey--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236193492_Students_Turkey--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Researchers, part three."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236193492_Students_Turkey--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Researchers, part three."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">From left, Gunnar, Kyle, and Taylor, in the woods surrounding Turkey Creek in the Big Thicket National Preserve.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael Barger</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Michael&nbsp;A&nbsp;Barger</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Researchers, part three.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236276843_Students_lab--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236276843_Students_lab--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Students in the lab"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236276843_Students_lab--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Students in the lab"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Taylor (left) and Gunnar (right) working on collecting worms from fish intestines in our field laboratory.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael Barger</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Michael&nbsp;A&nbsp;Barger</div> <div class="imageTitle">Students in the lab</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236381758_Crappie--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236381758_Crappie--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Crappie"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1253129/1253129_10242648_1498236381758_Crappie--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Crappie"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">One of our hosts, a crappie collected from Steinhagen Lake by one of our gill nets.
