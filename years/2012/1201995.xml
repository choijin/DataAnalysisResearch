<AbstractNarration>Turbulence and turbulent transport of heat, momentum, and particles in the presence of spatially varying (sheared) flows are ubiquitous in fusion, space, and laboratory plasmas. It has been observed that when the shear in the flow -- either "equilibrium" ExB flows, or turbulent Reynolds stress self-driven (zonal) flows -- is sufficiently large, turbulence and/or turbulent transport can be reduced or suppressed. The high confinement mode (H-mode) widely observed in toroidal fusion devices is one example of such flow shear suppression.  There has been a significant amount of work, including experimental, computational, and theoretical, on understanding the interactions between fully developed turbulence (and its associated transport) and flow shear. However, since the observed transitions to suppressed or reduced turbulence states typically occur on very fast time scales, little has been done experimentally to elucidate the detailed nonlinear dynamics of this transition. Because of the difficulty in observing the dynamics, a theoretical understanding of the transition is also lacking, since few detailed tests of models have been possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to improve the understanding of the detailed dynamics of transitions between states of unstable drift fluctuations (including broadband turbulence) and fluctuation-suppressed states in a controlled laboratory environment.  Experiments, which are being conducted in the dual-source HelCat (Helicon-Cathode) device at the University of New Mexico (UNM), are investigating the effects of controlled magnetic shear and magnetic X-points on these dynamics, as well as the detailed effects of electrode biasing.  These experiments are being complemented by direct comparisons with a fully nonlinear global Braginskii code, as well as other computational tools.  The primary numerical code, a fully 3D global (full plasma equilibrium and fluctuations), is being used to model and understand both large-scale equilibrium flows and fluctuations. This code is complemented by a linear stability code, which will be used to interpret the nature of the fluctuations, and a 1D, 3V particle in cell (PIC) code to understand the details of the plasma potential profile as electrodes are biased to arbitrary voltages to affect flows.  Additionally, measurements and simulations from the linear HelCat device are being compared with those from the toroidal TORPEX basic plasma device at the Centre de Recherche en Physique des Plasmas, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (CRPP-EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international research team includes researchers from UNM, the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and CRPP-EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland (who are participating at no cost to NSF).  The team is composed of full-time faculty, graduate and undergraduate student researchers, including female and minority students, and thus has a strong STEM educational component.  This work will increase the fundamental knowledge of plasma turbulence/flow shear dynamics, and is expected to have an impact on astrophysical, space, laboratory, and fusion plasmas, as well as on neutral fluid systems.</AbstractNarration>

This voltage creates a radial electric field, E<sub>r</sub>(r), between the electrode and wall.&nbsp; The plasma experiences an E<sub>r</sub>(r) x B<sub>z</sub> force, which causes the plasma to have a radially- varying (sheared) azimuthal flow.&nbsp; A high enough electrode bias can generate sufficient flow shear to result in a reduction in the fluctuation level, and the associate fluctuation-driven particle transport.&nbsp; Depending on plasma conditions, this flow shear can also be associated with an <em>increase</em> in fluctuation level and transport.&nbsp;

Thus, neutrals diffuse radially inward.&nbsp; Collisions with ions then exert a new inward force, F<sub>r</sub> on the plasma.&nbsp; This inward force together with the axial magnetic field, B<sub>z</sub>, then exerts an F<sub>r</sub> x B<sub>z</sub> torque on the plasma in the azimuthal direction.&nbsp; Work is currently underway to determine if this neutral-driven torque is sufficient to significantly affect the overall azimuthal plasma flow profile.&nbsp; A detailed understanding of the flows, in conjunction with such an understanding the associated edge fluctuations, would complete the detailed understanding of nonlinear flow-fluctuation dynamics that is the topic of this research.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/21/2017<br>      Modified by: Mark&nbsp;Gilmore</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1201995/1201995_10200994_1492751146091_nsf_outcomes_phy_1201995--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1201995/1201995_10200994_1492751146091_nsf_outcomes_phy_1201995--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1201995/1201995_10200994_1492751146091_nsf_outcomes_phy_1201995--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Spectogram (relative spectral power) of plasma density fluctuations inferred from ion saturation current measurements versus background magnetic field.</div> <div class="imageCredit">T.R.

Plasma fluctuations, including turbulence, occur naturally in the edge of laboratory plasmas, and change their dynamical character as parameters, such as magnetic field, vary.  An example is shown in Fig. 1, which plots a spectrogram of plasma density fluctuations as a function of magnetic field (B-field).  As the B-field varies, the frequency and harmonic content of the fluctuations change, eventually becoming mostly broadband turbulent at the highest magnetic fields.  At a few transition regions (e.g. 65 mTesla), the fluctuations are chaotic.  Flow profiles have been affected by inserting electrodes into the plasma which are biased to a fixed voltage, Vbias.  This voltage creates a radial electric field, Er(r), between the electrode and wall.  The plasma experiences an Er(r) x Bz force, which causes the plasma to have a radially- varying (sheared) azimuthal flow.  A high enough electrode bias can generate sufficient flow shear to result in a reduction in the fluctuation level, and the associate fluctuation-driven particle transport.  Depending on plasma conditions, this flow shear can also be associated with an increase in fluctuation level and transport.  An example of fluctuation reduction with is shown in Fig. 2.  Fig. 2a shows a trace of ion saturation current, which is proportional to plasma ion density, versus time (blue).  The red trace shows the voltage on a gridded electrode inserted into the plasma with respect to the grounded vacuum chamber wall.  At t &asymp; 110 ms the grid is pulsed positive for 100 ms to approximately 3Te, where Te &asymp; 3 eV is the electron temperature.

Although plasma flows, and flow shear, are clearly affected by electrode biasing through modification of the Er x Bz profile, understanding the details of what drives the flows across the plasma radius remains work in progress.  One possible effect is due to an azimuthal torque experience by the plasma column due to the force on plasma ions from collisions with neutral atoms.  Recent laser induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements of neutral density have shown that the radial neutral density profile, nn(r) is hollow, i.e. there is a lower density of neutrals in the plasma center than at the edge.  Thus, neutrals diffuse radially inward.  Collisions with ions then exert a new inward force, Fr on the plasma.  This inward force together with the axial magnetic field, Bz, then exerts an Fr x Bz torque on the plasma in the azimuthal direction.  Work is currently underway to determine if this neutral-driven torque is sufficient to significantly affect the overall azimuthal plasma flow profile.  A detailed understanding of the flows, in conjunction with such an understanding the associated edge fluctuations, would complete the detailed understanding of nonlinear flow-fluctuation dynamics that is the topic of this research.
