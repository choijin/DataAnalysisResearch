<AbstractNarration>SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Office of Cyberinfrastructure, Division of Materials Research, and Chemistry Division contribute funds to this award.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a conceptualization effort to design a Sustainable Software Innovation Institute to elevate the level of scientific computing in X-ray and neutron scattering science. This conceptualization project will define the priorities of users and facilities to serve a significant fraction of the community of 14,000 annual users of X-ray and neutron scattering facilities in the U.S. The Institute aims to adapt modern methods of computational materials science to predict scattering from materials. It would incorporate these software tools into workflows for scattering scientists, giving them new pathways to scientific discovery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 1980, the performance per dollar of computer hardware has increased by a factor of 100 every decade. Over the same time period, this million-fold improvement has been closely matched by the increased brilliance of X-ray sources, and in the past decade the performance of neutron sources has increased by a factor of ten. These improvements should be multiplied by comparable factors to account for improvements in software and methods of computational science, and for major improvements in optics and detectors for X-rays and neutrons. These enormous advances in computing and in scattering have occurred independently. Today there are exciting opportunities for combining them to do new science, and there is a growing body of work in computational scattering science that does so. Today this is only a small fraction of the work done by users of the synchrotron and neutron sources in the U.S., but it accounts for a disproportionately large fraction of high impact publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conceptualization process will shape and assess envisioned activities of the Institute in the areas of workflow, uncertainty quantification, new avenues for discovery, and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important activity of the Institute will involve developing new computational workflows that open channels for discovery in scattering science. This can be as direct as offering a common environment for comparing results from experiment to results from computational materials science. Computing also facilitates the combined analysis of information from different types of experiments, linked by an underlying model of the structure and dynamics of a material. Such a combined approach requires the assessment of uncertainties in the model using mathematical methods that are not yet standard practice in scattering science. This conceptualization project will develop a path to obtaining appropriate uncertainty analysis tools for a computationally enabled scattering science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workflows that include calculations of the structure and dynamics of materials can allow experimental results to be interpreted on a more fundamental level, letting scientists explore properties that are not measured directly by experiment opening new avenues to discovery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports aspects of the Materials Genome Initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Institute will bring materials simulation to train the next generation of scattering scientist. The Institute aims to broaden participation, particularly of  women in computational science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computational infrastructure now impacts many aspects of modern life, from the ubiquitous cellphone Apps to sophisticated weather forecasting models.  Our Sustainable Software Innovation Institute (SIXNS) project exemplifies what can be done with an integrated approach that combines software and computational power seamlessly to simplify complex tasks. The potential impacts of these developments are huge, yet are largely unexploited in the physical sciences. Indeed they will likely have a transformative impact.  Our collaborative S2I2 project was a conceptualization effort for a sustainable SIXNS Institute. Currently the lack of readily accessible theory and analysis software is a major bottleneck to progress in X-ray and neutron scattering science.  SIXNS would address this limitation by adapting modern computational materials science codes and software into efficient workflows that foster the synergy between theory and experiment. SIXNS would thereby complement experimental facilities and provide new pathways to scientific discovery.     In an effort to assess needs and build the case for a SIXNS Institute, three international Workshops were carried out bringing experts from the US and abroad to elicit community input. These included: I. "Scientific Workflows for Scattering Science;" II "Advanced Analysis of Xray and Neutron Scattering Data;" and III., "Theory Codes and Analysis Software for Scattering Science". The Outcomes of  are documented in the Workshop Reports available at the SIXNS Websites. The first of these demonstrated the utility of SIXNS for prototypical Use Cases. As an example of the impact of SIXNS on advanced x-ray spectroscopy, we developed a Virtual Beamline, i.e., a suite of theoretical and computational tools that model all of the steps in an experimental beamline.    A key outcome of the 2nd Workshop was an analysis of the Prospects for a Virtual X-ray and Neutron Scattering Spectroscopy Facility for SIXNS.   We found that the prospects for automated workflows are clearly feasible and there is a huge opportunity to advance science with such virtual facilities,    A key outcome of the third workshop was a detailed assessment of  theoretical and computational needs. Finally, as proof of principle, we developed some prototype workflow tools that link modern materials science codes and spectroscopy codes.   As a result, sophisticated, state of the art workflows can be made dramatically more user-friendly,  especially to novice users, thereby catalyzing their ability to generate innovative science.  As a consequence of this Conceptualization Project, we have shown that SIXNS would have an enormous impact on the scientific productivity and research of about 14,000 annual users of X-ray and neutron scattering facilities in the U.S.   A SIXNS Institute will increase the efficiency of these facilities and advance science by exploiting the natural synergy between theory and experiment. The computational infrastructure in the SIXNS is also critically important to deal with the enormous amount of data currently being generated by the scattering facilities.   As an example of broader impacts,  the workflow tools being developed will likely be useful in many other disciplines where complex workflows are common.
