<AbstractNarration>The South Central Conference on Advanced Numerical Methods and Applications will be held in April 5-7,  2013 at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR).   The conference will bring together researchers of all career stages, working on various aspects of numerical analysis and scientific computing, from the south central region and other surrounding states. It will cover a wide range of topics on Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing, including but not limited to the following list: finite element methods, finite volume methods, spectral methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods, numerical linear algebra, preconditioning techniques, multiscale methods, parallel computing, numerical methods for solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, image processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will serve as a forum for researchers to distribute newest ideas, foster interaction and collaboration between different groups, advocate the numerical analysis community in the south central region, and help envision future research and education agendas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to promoting group interaction and collaboration, this conference will influence and invigorate the educational developments among colleges, universities and research institutes.  Graduate students, postdocs, and junior researchers will benefit greatly from attending the conference and communicating with peers. Special effort will be made to encourage the attendance of woman, minorities, and other under-represented groups.
