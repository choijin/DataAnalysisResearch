<AbstractNarration>David Chandler of the University of California, Berkeley is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Chemistry division to carry out research in the area of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, specifically to elucidate the underlying driving forces and implications of glass transitions.  These are transitions of complex systems driven far from equilibrium, transitions manifested in the structure trajectory space. Theoretical techniques have only recently allowed for their systematic analysis, and results from these techniques are now being used in this research to further explore the molecular origins of glass transitions in systems ranging from simple to complex mixtures. In particular, this research aims at predictive theory for the energies and structures of elementary excitations in glass. It should answer how these properties relate to the preparation of the glass, to responses of glass to stress, and to changes in components. The theory should have a degree of generality to reveal implications for other classes of materials, making predictions that can be tested by experiment, and with practical approximations and insights guided by unambiguous results derived from molecular simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is at the frontier of contemporary statistical physics.  Scientists have long understood the principles of equilibrium theory and exploited these principles to design useful ordered and regular condensed phases. Examples include regular solution theory as it is used in the oil-refining industry, and the Ostwald step rule for nucleation used in the steel industry. But no similarly fundamental understanding is yet available for kinetically trapped disordered solids and nanoclusters -- materials, like glass, that emerge by driving liquid matter out of equilibrium. This research is devoted to ameliorating this gap in knowledge. Concerning glasses, in particular, these materials are welcoming and long-term stable hosts for impurities. Glasses are thus materials of choice when contemplating the safe stable storage of radioactive waste materials. Of similar or possibly greater importance, secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) are most often in glassy states.  Their transformations play a dominant role in the chemistry of the atmosphere, affecting Earth's climate and human health. This research, therefore, addresses issues pertaining to significant problems in society.  Its profound importance together with its fundamental nature makes it superbly appropriate for motivating and training students to become scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The glass transition presents a fundamental puzzle.  The transition is a non-equilibrium phase transition between a liquid and a solid.  But unlike a crystal, such as ice, glass is an amorphous solid. It has the structure, but not dynamics, of a liquid. In a liquid, inhomogeneity relaxes over time, while in a solid, inhomogeneity is frozen.  Thus, in a glass transition, symmetry of time changes while symmetry of space does not change.  Moreover, unlike equilibrium transitions between liquid and crystal, like the freezing of water and the melting of ice, glass transitions are irreversible processes, which is to say that the glass produced depends upon the path or protocol by which it is produced.  These features &ndash;  irreversibility, and the change in time dependence without concomitant change in structure &ndash; cannot be accounted for in the standard theories of phase transitions.  Various theories for the transition have been proposed, in some cases leading to significant extensions or generalization of the discipline of theoretical physics called "statistical mechanics."  The PI?s approach is one such extension.  It is an approach where the glass transition manifests in the statistics of trajectories, not in states.  Further, in the PI?s approach, the underlying mechanism for the transition is dynamic facilitation, not thermodynamics.  Over the past decade, the PI and his co-workers have pioneered this approach arriving at novel numerical methods and analytic theory detailing the nature of the transition.  This NSF grant has enabled research that has tested central predictions of this approach, it has shown that dynamic facilitation is present in proteins, not just in traditional glass forming materials, and it sets the stage to apply dynamic facilitation theory as a practical tool for various disciplines.   Better understanding of glass may enable improved production and quality of glass. Such materials are important to advanced technologies, ranging from portable computer screens to ceramic ball bearings. It is also relevant to atmospheric science and human health as it is recently understood that aerosols can exist in glassy states. That particular implication is the focus of a new NSF grant on which the PI is a collaborator.              Last Modified: 11/09/2016       Submitted by: David Chandler]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
