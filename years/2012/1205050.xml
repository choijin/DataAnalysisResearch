<AbstractNarration>In response to regional workforce needs, Hagerstown Community College is creating a biotechnology microscopy training center for education on the use of bright field, phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopy with digital imaging capabilities, in collaboration with local biotechnology industries, government laboratories and higher education partners. Two biotechnology courses are being created to strengthen the college's biotechnology program and existing biology courses are being updated with new protocols, developing options for entry into biotechnology employment, including internships. Broader impacts include educational outreach through mobile microscopy training for elementary, middle, and high school students, as well as professional development opportunities for area K-12 teachers, including summer workshops and in-service day activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hagerstown Community CollegeÆs Microscopy Training Hub  HCCÆs Microscopy Training Hub was funded by a National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education grant (#1205050).

It included an onsite microscopy training suite, summer workshops for K-12 teachers, a summer institute for advanced high school students, summer programs for elementary and middle school students, and an extensive K-12 outreach program. Our program also serves as a model for anyone interested in creating a partnership between higher education and their local K-12 communities. For more information, see www.hagerstowncc.edu/microscopy.  On Campus Microscopy Center:  The Microscopy Training Hub center is located in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics building and Advanced Technology Center at HCC and is used by HCCÆs faculty and students as well as available to host field trips for local high school and undergraduate students.  We are equipped with:  Fluorescence microscopes with digital imaging Research-grade stereo dissecting microscopes Compound light microscopes with phase contrast Portable digital imaging systems to be used with the CenterÆs equipment or with other microscopes   We provide:  Microscopy training and support to help faculty incorporate microscopy into their classes On-site and in-classroom microscopy skills tutoring for students Staff-led microscopy lessons for students and for non-HCC students visiting the facility Microscopy video series to support microscope use in the classroom   Mobile Microscopy Training Hub:  Over 20 different hands-on, inquiry-based science lessons designed to help pK-12 students learn how to use magnifying tools to explore the microscopic world around them. Students ask questions, form hypotheses, gather and record data, and come to evidence-based conclusions. Lessons were developed with the help of over 5,000 local students and their teachers, and are aligned with Maryland State Science Standards. Many lessons, along with teacher guides and supplies lists are available for download for free from our website.  Teacher Summer Institutes:   One-week summer workshops for K-12 Teachers in which teachers enhanced their content knowledge and learned how to use microscopy to explore the content with their students. Each teacher created a lesson plan to bring back to the classroom.  Participants had the option to earn 3 graduate credits from Frostburg State University with concurrent registration.  Teachers also received a stipend for each week.  In addition to workshops focused on integrating basic microscopy skills into the K-12 classroom, the following were offered over the course of the grant:  Microscopy for Microbiology: Microscale and Nanoscale Science and the Environment.   Microscopy for Microbiology: Emerging and Re-emerging Infections Diseases and Human Health Issues. Microscopy &amp; Microlife: Studying Microscopy Organisms in the Elementary Classroom Microscopy &amp; Microlife: Exploring Impacts of Climate Change on Microscopic Organisms   College for Kids:  Two, one-week summer camps for elementary and middle school students focused on microscopy.  In Fossils and the Sands of Time, elementary school students make egg geodes, examine fossils &amp; sands from around the world under the microscope, create insects in resin fossils, hunt for shark teeth in sand slurry from Calvert Cliffs, MD &amp; collect brachiopod fossils near Hancock, MD.  In CSI: Hagerstown, middle school students examine hair, fiber, fingerprint, handwriting, ink and blood type evidence with microscopes, learn to prepare slides of evidence, conduct a DNA analysis, and collect clues from a crime scene to solve the mystery "Who Cat Napped Fluffy?"    Variations of these summer programs have also been offered as single day classes during school holidays and teache...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
