<AbstractNarration>As part of the larger CONTRAST measurement campaign (Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics) which has a main objective of measuring the transport of reactive chemical species into the topical Tropopause Transition Layer (TTL) over the western Pacific warm pool, Georgia Tech researchers will measure a number of short lived reactive bromine compounds (BrO, BrCl, the sum of Br2 and HOBr), and also pernitric acid (HO2NO2). These molecules will be detected and quantitated using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) flown on the NSF G-V research aircraft during CONTRAST.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During northern winter, surface tropospheric air masses containing these reactive species may be transported by intense tropical convection high into the TTL lower stratosphere over the Pacific warm pool. Here they may substantially impact the chemistry of the lower stratosphere, including its ozone chemistry. Accordingly, knowing the sources, chemical environment and abundance of reactive halogen and short lived halogen containing species such as bromocarbons in the TTL will help inform our understanding of the bromine chemistry of this understudied region of the earth's atmosphere.  The observation of pernitric acid, which provides constraint on HOx-NOx radical reactivity, will be modeled photochemically providing an additional test for our understanding of how TTL photochemistry may be impacted by tropical deep convection. The unique low-ozone environments in the upper troposphere are expected to result in very small levels of OH radicals, which can be expected to increase the lifetime of reactive gases whose main loss is through OH radical oxidation. The simultaneous occurrence of deep convection and prolonged lifetime of organic compounds in the TTL can have significant impact on the stratospheric halogen budget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With field work based out of Guam, the project will support one Ph.D. student and provide the bulk of her thesis research work. In addition, one undergraduate student will be provided with an extensive research experience. The timing of the CONTRAST experiment has been designed to take advantage of collaborations with two international airborne studies planned for the same time and geographic location. These are the NASA EV1 project ATTREX (Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment) and the European CAST (Coordinated Airborne Studies in the Tropics). With complementary instrument payloads, coordinated flights of the NSF GV, the NASA Global Hawk and the UK BAE146 will provide an unprecedented examination of the full atmospheric column, from surface to &gt;19 km, in the Tropical Western Pacific.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The major goal of the CONTRAST field experiment was to determine the impact of convection in the western tropical Pacific Ocean on the chemistry of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS). For example, compounds (such as bromine containing gases) emitted from the ocean can be rapidly transported to high altitude by convection where they can impact photochemistry or potentially be transported to the stratosphere. The primary goal our our work during the CONTRAST mission was to deploy a mass spectrometer to measure inorganic bromine species such as BrO and HOBr from the NCAR G-V research aircraft as a function of altitude. Bromine species are of particular interest as they can have a strong impact on tropospheric photochemistry as well as lead to ozone loss in the stratosphere. We found that in general only low levels of BrO and HOBr (less than 1 pptv) were observed at lower altitudes. The highest levels of BrO were observed at higher altitudes in the presence of significant ozone levels in stratospheric air. Our results indicate minimal bromine chemical activity below the stratosphere but suggest that some bromine at higher altitudes is transported to the stratosphere in the form of BrO and HOBr. Our work on this project also laid the groundwork for measuring other important species such as HBr in the atmosphere. This project supported and trained one Ph.D student who developed skills in mass spectrometry, modeling, and data analysis. This student has since graduated and move on to a postdoctoral position. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/03/2018<br>      Modified by: L.&nbsp;G&nbsp;Huey</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
