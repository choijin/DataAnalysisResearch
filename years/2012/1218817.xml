<AbstractNarration>Cloud computing provides many benefits including convenience, consolidation, compatibility, and cost-reduction.  However, security is a major concern, since cloud resources are shared with other users who may be adversarial.  The goal of this research is to define a framework for security-on-demand: cloud customers can request the security they need and cloud providers can map these security requests to the appropriate secure servers.  Since customers have different security needs, a range of threat models is explored together with servers with different security capabilities.  Research contributions include (1) new strategies for measuring cloud server security capabilities, and (2) new hardware-software mechanisms for collecting runtime trust evidence that a server is enforcing a customer's requested security policy. (3) Secure protocols are designed for collecting and reporting server security capabilities to cloud management software, as well as (4) a hardware-software security verification methodology to verify these protocols, using model checking and other tools.  (5) Novel actionable models of cloud servers? security properties that can be matched to customers' requests are implemented by new trust monitoring and policy enforcement modules. Also, (6) hardware mechanisms and migration protocols for secure Virtual Machine migration to improve cloud security are designed.  The broader impact of this work includes providing greater security in cloud computing for customers, allowing cloud providers to differentiate their offerings with security provisioning using different secure server architectures, enabling the specification and provisioning of customized and verifiable security, and providing a research platform for investigating secure hardware and software architecture in a cloud environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aims to improve the security of Cloud Computing.  Intellectual contributions:  We defined a Security-on-Demand (SoD) architectural framework for Cloud Computing. This allows security-conscious cloud customers to request security services, in addition to computing resources, for their Virtual Machines.  It also allows cloud providers to add different types of secure computer servers to their data centers, and charge for additional security features provided.  Our SoD prototype is built on the open-source OpenStack cloud computing software, enabling easy deployment.  We defined the CloudMonatt architecture to enable cloud customers to request monitoring and attestation of the security health (e.g., the security properties they requested) of the Virtual Machines that they have leased from the cloud provider.  This uses our SoD framework, and includes the definition of an unforgeable attestation protocol, distributed key management and a scalable property-based attestation methodology.  While property-based attestation has been defined conceptually, no concrete examples have been implemented.  We show several concrete examples of security properties that may be requested by cloud customers, and monitored by cloud providers, using our CloudMonatt architecture. Our work includes detecting attacks, mitigating the impact of these attacks and providing defenses.  For example, we show:  Hardware memory DoS attacks that severely degrade the performance and availability of a Virtual Machine, and a generalized detection and defense solution.  We also show general DoS attacks on shared resources (e.g., network, disks and memory) in cloud computing, their detection and defense.  We show a new Last Level Cache side-channel attack across Virtual Machines in the cloud that can leak secret and private keys, nullifying any protections provided by strong cryptography.
