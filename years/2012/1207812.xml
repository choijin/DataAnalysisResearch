<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator (PI) will pursue a collection of concrete problems in low-dimensional topology, using a combination of traditional topological techniques, Heegaard Floer homology, combinatorics, and whatever else might come in handy.  As a sample list, the PI hopes to address the questions of which alternating knots have unknotting number one; which alternating knots bound smoothly slice disks in the four-ball (joint work with Brendan Owens); and which 3-manifolds admit a strong Heegaard diagram (joint work with Adam Levine and John Luecke).  In each of these projects, Heegaard Floer homology provides important information and sets up a challenging combinatorial problem, which in turn requires modern methods to solve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-dimensional topology is concerned with the properties of curves, surfaces, and 3- and 4-dimensional spaces -- objects that we can visualize, though sometimes with a bit of effort.  On one hand, this field has a rich tradition in the sciences: it owes a lot of its development to physics, both classical and modern; it impacts biology, where the knotting of DNA plays a significant role; and it interacts with fields all across mathematics.  On the other hand, it has a distinctly visual nature that is reflected in the arts: for example, through Celtic knots, motifs in ancient architecture, and Escher's prints.  The goal of the PI's proposal is to study some attractive and simply-stated problems in low-dimensional topology.  In fact, many of these problems focus on the mathematical properties of Celtic (a.k.a. alternating) knots.  While some of these problems have been around for many decades, they have only recently become accessible through the advent of sophisticated techniques from nearby fields (Floer homology and combinatorics).  The interplay between these different fields fascinates the PI.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Low-dimensional topology refers to the study of shapes in dimensions one through four.  These dimensions are special from an anthropic perspective, since they model our everyday perception of the physical world, and from a mathematical perspective, since the phenomena they exhibit and the collection of techniques used to study them are rather different than in higher dimensions.  While supported on this NSF grant, the PI undertook projects focused on properties of knots and links in 3-manifolds.  One concrete outcome is a new characterization of when knots admit alternating projections of the kind depicted in Celtic art.  The characterization leads to new proofs of fundamental facts about this class of knots and to a new effective algorithm for recognizing them.  Another outcome is progress concerning how the simplest 3-manifolds are related by the process of surgery, a basic operation on knots.  The answer is surprisingly complex and continues to be the subject of work in progress.  The PI published seven papers while supported on the grant and worked on several more that are variously under review and in preparation.  The PI continued his involvement with summer mathematics enrichment programs for talented high school students.  He visited the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics during the summers and taught a mini-course during Summer 2014.  He also served on the board of directors for Mathematical Staircase, Inc., which governs the running of MathIly and MathIlyEr.
