<AbstractNarration>CBET-1239114 Burken&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are requested to create an Environmental Engineering Chairs and Directors Conference. This conference and continuing effort will focus at establishing a continuing communications platform to address the needs of educating and training those entering the environmental engineering profession. Coordinating efforts through AEESP and AAEE, we strive to pull together the current environmental engineering department chairs and program directors from across the country for a two-day conference that will serve as the seminal event in coordinating a concerted national effort to improve and aid these programs is identifying areas of continued need and assist in the challenges of growing new programs in times of difficult university funding. This conference is organized jointly by Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors and the American Academy of Environmental Engineers. The proposed conference will have broad and profound impacts on the field of environmental engineering, and specifically the educational process that trains the fastest growing and most diverse field of engineering. The environmental challenges that face our nation and planet are of a grand scale, and the training of engineers to handle a field with such extensive impact on human health and prosperity is of great need. This training and education will also translate into a better understanding in the field of environmental engineering of the linkages to public health and societal well being.</AbstractNarration>
