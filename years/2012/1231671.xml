<AbstractNarration>This project develops a ubiquitous human health monitoring system that collects not only vital signs, but also daily activities and environmental context of a human subject in an everyday life setting. From these collected data, higher level knowledge, such as behavioral and vital sign anomalies, is extracted to assist health evaluation, medical diagnosis/prognosis or healthcare delivery.  The research team first develops a low-cost and power-aware wearable Smart Health Monitoring (SmartMon) system, which is integrated into human clothing with minimized obtrusiveness to the wearer. The research team then employs a minimalist approach to understand human?s daily activities and environmental context using the data collected by the SmartMon system. The research team further develops adaptive and intelligent signal processing algorithms to detect anomalies in human daily activities and vital signs for health assessment applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research can significantly improve the ubiquitousness, accuracy, and reliability of wearable human health monitoring. The technologies developed in this project have many different applications, from improving quality of life for elderly people to enhancing capability of first responders during emergency responses. Through the involvement of female, minority (Native American) students, this project prepares a more diversified workforce in the area of biomedical engineering for the State of Oklahoma and the nation.</AbstractNarration>

When used by physicians to monitor their patients, or elderly, this monitoring system can greatly improve the accuracy of human health assessment and medical diagnosis in an everyday life setting. Through prevention and early detection of disease or optimal maintenance of chronic conditions, this monitoring system will augment existing healthcare systems. As the baby boomers step into their retirement age, such a smart health monitoring system will enable physicians to have a better understanding of the living behavior of elderly and help improve their quality of life.
