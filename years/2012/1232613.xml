<AbstractNarration>The NSF Divisions of Chemistry (CHE) and Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) fund this award to the National Academy of Sciences to support the core activities of the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology (BCST). The BCST has broad representation from academe and industry and uses its collective expertise to identify the needs of the community and to provide peer-reviewed consensus reports, workshops, and symposia, as broad outreach into the chemical community and beyond.  The BCST enhances the impacts of the chemistry and chemical engineering communities by engaging in questions of importance to federal decision-makers.  It addresses timely research problems such as sustainability and energy, and safety and security.  The Board also proactively examines topics of importance to the larger chemical enterprise, such as education and training issues, employment concerns, and changes in the research and funding models.  By identifying and recruiting top experts to its ad hoc studies, BCST ensures that the present state of technical knowledge is applied to the policy issues facing decision-makers.  By raising issues impacting the conduct of chemistry and chemical engineering research with federal officials, it helps assure that the community of practitioners can remain at the forefront of knowledge.</AbstractNarration>

The board explores the science, policies, and infrastructure needed to support the health of the chemical and chemical engineering disciplines and their impacts on society. The board exercises leadership within the chemical sciences/engineering communities by helping to identify and communicate the needs for the field, responds to specific requests for advice and information from government agencies and Congress, and oversees a variety of study projects related to the chemical sciences/engineering. Because chemistry is vital to a broad range of issues, the board provides guidance to many different agencies, including a longstanding engagement with the NSFÃ†s Division of Chemistry and Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems.  BCST has three primary mechanisms to accomplish its mission.  The first is the board itself; biannual board meetings provide an important venue for high level, strategic dialogues among leading members of the science and engineering communities and also with the federal agencies engaged in the chemical sciences and engineering. The second mechanism is the ad hoc committee process, in which specially appointed groups conduct in-depth analysis of focused topics.  Ad hoc studies are separately funded, but cannot take place without board involvement in design, member selection, and oversight.  In the last 3 years, BCST completed 8 ad hoc studies on topics ranging from chemical safety in academic laboratories to a research roadmap for glycoscience to the role of the chemical sciences in finding alternatives to critical resources. The third mechanism is the Chemical Sciences Roundtable, which is a complementary venue for the science community (the subject of a separate Outcomes Report).

Board members are responsible for identifying emerging and important issues, strategic planning for new initiatives, information gathering, interactions with agencies and other scientists, program oversight, information dissemination, and outreach. Over the period from 2012-2015, the board explored a broad range of topics at its meetings, examples include:  Challenges in chemical separations; The role of chemistry in the Food/Energy/Water Nexus; Chemical sensing for chemical and biological defense; Key challenges in organic synthetic research; Energy usage in the chemical industry; Additive manufacturing; Chemistry and the BRAIN initiative; Graduate student training for a rapidly changing industry; Chemical challenges in the use of shale gas; Big data in the chemical sciences; Polymers and sustainability.    Below is a listing of the studies conducted by the BCST from 2012-2015 (these reports are available for free download at http://dels.nas.edu/bcst/Reports-Academies-Findings):  Industrialization of Biology: A Roadmap to Accelerate Advanced Manufacturing of Chemicals (2015) Framework to Guide Selection of Chemical Alternatives (2014) Safe Science: Promoting a Culture of Safety in Academic Chemical Research (2014) Effects of Diluted Bitumen on Crude Oil Transmission Pipelines (2013) Determining Core Capabilities in Chemical and Biological Defense Science and Technology (2012) Transforming Glycoscience: A Roadmap for the Future (2012) Assuring a Future US-Based Nuclear and Radiochemistry Expertise (2012) The Use and Storage of Methyl Isocyanate (MIC) at Bayer CropScience (2012)   The consensus studies that BCST oversees provide answers and recommendations to federal decision-makers on topics of national importance related to chemistry and chemical engineering. BCST studies have had wide ranging impacts within the science community: they have provided scientific direction for federal research programs, have communicated information to researchers abo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
