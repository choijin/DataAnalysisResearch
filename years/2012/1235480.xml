<AbstractNarration>The central goal of this project is to establish a paradigm shift in material design by combining theory, modeling, and experimentation in a multiscale and synergistic manner to maximize the strength and toughness of nanocomposite materials that emulate the performance of natural nacre using graphene oxide. It is expected that graphene oxide sheets with optimal overlap geometry, bonded together by tunable chemistry, will mimic nacre. Specifically, this research will lead to characterization of the deformation mechanisms of multilayer nanocomposite systems through studies of the strength and stiffness of both the individual atomically thin sheets as well as their crosslinking elements. This project aims to develop a fundamental understanding of the roles that van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and chemical crosslinking, conformation, and geometrical assembly play in modulating the mechanical behavior of nanocomposite materials based on graphene oxide. The mechanical performance of functionalized graphene sheets and macroscopic oxidized-graphene materials will be optimized through a series of iterative synthesis-assembly-modeling cycles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel nanoscale mechanical testing methods based on MEMS technologies and AFM will be applied to measure the mechanical behavior of few-layer graphene oxide materials with "brick-and-mortar" like hierarchical structures. New crosslinking chemistries, such as thiol-amines, will be explored to impart significant improvements in controlling shear interactions through covalent bond breaking and reformation. Varying geometrical overlap between layers and conformations of the sheets will be explored. In-situ electron microscopy mechanical testing, to yield atomic and micro-scale characteristics on multiple length scales, coupled with computational modeling using ab initio and semi-empirical methods, will quantify the interface strength and deformation governing load-transfer mechanisms. The developed insight will then be used to guide the synthesis of a macroscopic nanocomposite material that takes advantage of the strength of graphene and the hierarchically assembled structures inspired by Nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the development of criteria for predicting and tailoring the mechanical properties of graphene oxide-based nanocomposite materials will be transferable to a wide range of nanocomposites and will optimize the design process of materials with hierarchical structure that incorporate stiff building blocks and ductile crosslinking elements. These next-generation synthetic materials are essential for advances in the aerospace, satellite, automotive, military, and healthcare industries. The research also will serve as an excellent training platform for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the critical frontier of structure-based material design and in the art of interdisciplinary scientific research in the areas of synthesis, modeling, and hierarchical measurements.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the lifetime of this DMREF award the Espinosa, Nguyen, Huang, and Keten groups at Northwestern University have combined their expertise in nanomechanical testing, materials synthesis and fabrication, and computational tools development to address the use of <em>chemically functionalized</em> nanocarbon building blocks (such as carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene and, graphene oxide) in engineering materials. &nbsp;In addition to CNT and graphene, which can be chemically functionalized, graphene oxide (GO) was selected as a natively functionalized material for our study given its facile synthesis and a broad, tunable range of oxygen-containing functionalities.&nbsp; While the presence of these functional groups can lead to an increase in load transfer between GO sheets when integrated into a macroscopic composite in comparison to graphene, high levels of functionalization can also result in some degradation of properties as shown by our studies. &nbsp;However, at moderate functionalization levels, large improvements in ductility can be observed in epoxide-rich GO through nanoscale membrane-deflection experiments (Figure 1); in stark contrast to existing reports, where the material was shown to be brittle. &nbsp;Based on these observations, advanced computational tools and models were established to evaluate the relationship between the functional space and mechanical properties of graphene/GO nanosheets. &nbsp;Through detailed computational studies at the atomic level, we demonstrated that the types and levels of functionalization in GO have a direct effect on its mode of failure and mechanical properties (Figure 2). &nbsp;With this &ldquo;constituent-level&rdquo;

structure. &nbsp;Subsequent molecular dynamics (MD) studies revealed the underlying mechanism for this behavior to be water-mediated formation of hydrogen bonds between functional groups in neighboring GO sheets. &nbsp;Such intercomponent hydrogen bonds are very similar to those that occur in many other natural materials like cellulose, proteins, spider silk fibers, and others; a strategy that nature has evolved over millions of years to generate biomaterials with outstanding combination of mechanical properties.</p> <p>In parallel, several modeling tools&ndash;ranging from statistical shear-lag model and finite-element approaches to sophisticated density functional theory and MD calculations&ndash;were developed through this DMREF award to accelerate the study of engineering materials based on nanocarbon composites and to improve the predictive capability available to researchers. &nbsp;As an example, a large limitation for atomistic studies is the long computational time and small length scales available. &nbsp;To overcome this, coarse-grained MD tools&ndash;where the behavior of multiple atoms is collected onto an entity called a &ldquo;super atom&rdquo; (Figure 4)&ndash;were developed using nanoscale experiments and atomistic simulations as guide. &nbsp;These new tools increased the accessibility of time and length scales by at least an order of magnitude during the design process. &nbsp;Additionally, finite-element tools were developed to study graphene-based nanomaterials at length scales of relevance to fabrication processes and use of engineering materials (Figure 5). &nbsp;Thus, by combining simulations and experiments, we are now well on our way toward the development of a comprehensive framework for enabling the smart design of the next generation of engineering materials based on physical and chemical considerations of the nanoscale components.</p> <p>From a workforce development perspective, this DMREF award has supported the research of four PIs as well as the education and training of six graduate students and three postdoctoral fellows.&nbsp;
