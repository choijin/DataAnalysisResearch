<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  On-chip radio-frequency (RF) wireless communication will be investigated to propose a unified design framework for its applicability on contemporary Multi-Processor System-On-Chips (MPSoCs) in 2D and 3D semiconductor technologies.  RF wireless communication will be established with multiple antennas on the same die for a 2D integrated circuit (IC), or multiple antennas and/or couplers on the same 3D IC package.  In order to enhance these on-chip wireless communication channels, novel approaches in reconfigurability of wireless interconnects will be utilized, as well as exploring the applicability of various wireless communication schemes of the proposed research is in leveraging the diverse knowledge in wireless communications to improve the MPSoC performance in computing and power efficiency.  Performance profiling of proposed communication circuits and channel quality will be examined on a network-on-chip system to observe the direct impact of proposed novelties in MPSoC efficiency, highlighting trade-offs in physical, wireless, channel and communication quality and the MPSoC computing efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Proposed research will enable the next generation of low-power, increased functionality ICs, as well as providing a high performance interconnect for current and future&lt;br/&gt;(i.e. 3D IC, MPSoC) microelectronic devices.  Wireless interconnects are a vehicle to alleviate the power wall and communication challenge in contemporary MPSoCs and enabling the further scaling of complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor technology by replacing the power-hungry wire-based interconnects. Impacts on education include those generated by new course modules developed to integrate in undergraduate-level wireless communications and very large scale integration (VLSI) design courses, a new graduate course, student projects (independent and research experience for undergraduates projects) and outreach to high-school students to promote science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines.  Investigators are proactively participating in outreach activities to create synergy in VLSI and wireless communities, including a recent newsletter article on wireless interconnects to 3000+ recipients in the VLSI community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The investigators collaborated on the NSF EECS-1232164 "Hybrid Wireless Network-on-Chips" project, 09/2012-08/2016.  The intellectual merit of the project was in improving the performance of 2D and 3D network-on-chips of Multi-processor Systems-on-Chips (MPSoCs) by integrating wireless interconnects (hybrid with wired interconnects). MPSoCs are electronics such as those in cell phones, automobiles, medical electronics and robotics. The broader impacts of the project were to enable the next generation of low-power, increased functionality ICs, as well as providing a high-performance interconnect for current and future (i.e. 3D IC, MPSoC) microelectronic devices.  These broader goals are for the future term application of the research goals investigated in this project.   The intellectual merit goals were reached by 1) developing novel antenna designs that improved the performance of existing antennas on chip and 2) their integration on a chip for communication.  The antennas designed in this project could communicate longer distances on chip and with less power.  These lightweight and improved antennas were integrated into the communication backbone on a chip (i.e. of a MPSoC), enabling electronics that are superior to existing standards.  Due to prohibitive time and financial cost of physical device implementations, these research outcomes were achieved using cost-effective computer simulation tools.  The computer simulations of hundreds of potential chip implementations prove that the targeted innovation of "wireless interconnects on a chip" can boost the performance significantly.  When implemented, these chips could lead to electronic devices that have batteries last 30% more, performs 20% more work and is smaller in footprint by 22%.  The possibility of such an implementation by the industry is an indication of the broader impacts of the project being reached.   The project provided products in goals towards research, education and service to the community.  Products from EECS-1232164 include a scientific panel at the 2014 IEEE/ACM System Level Interconnect Prediction conference on Wireless NoCs [with all 4 panelists being the prestigious NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program award recipients on wireless interconnects], a new graduate course on Network-on-Chips at the host institution, one PhD. thesis by a student now employed at Intel, OR and two other Ph.D. theses in progress, 4 research experience for undergraduates (REU) projects with supplements.  2 of these 4 REU students are NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) winners in 2015, covering full costs for graduate school and providing a competitive stipend).  One of these two NSF GRFP winners is from the underrepresented minorities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM).  A senior design project was offered in 2013-2014, where all four students are now in graduate school and the senior design team producing a poster presentation entry at American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) Mid-Atlantic Conference.  Scholarly publications include a best paper candidate at IEEE International Conference on VLSI Design 2015, two conference papers first-authored by an REU student (with an REU supplement at Drexel - minority student from University of Pennsylvania volunteering research time at Drexel VLSI Lab during two consecutive academic years and an NSF GRFP winner in 2015).   Overall, the project met its goals in delivering the intellectual merits of scientific progress and have had a broader impact in enabling a technology transfer to the industry, providing research and educational resources for the students (including those from underrepresented populations) and engaging a community around the theme of wireless interconnects.  The investigators of this project remain equally engaged in pursuing the next generation of research goals in this domain and enjoy the proliferation of new, related research emerging from a number of groups in the nation and around the world.  The students who were trained in this project have successfully been placed in jobs and graduate education programs, providing continuation of US competitiveness in the global technology market.
