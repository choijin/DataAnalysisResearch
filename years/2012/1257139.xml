<AbstractNarration>Ecologists have long been puzzled about why there are so many species of trees in tropical forests; the answer is not obvious. Recent evidence suggests that disease microbes hidden in the soil may play an important role in determining how many species can grow in a given area. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis are lacking, though. This project employs a combination of experiments, plant pathology, and cutting-edge genetic approaches to test whether interactions between trees and disease agents in the soil determine tree species composition in tropical forests of Panama.  The study is unusual in the amount of detailed data collected on distributions, identities, and host specificity of many types of largely unknown pathogens.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changes in species composition of soil pathogens as a result of human-caused disturbances and agricultural practices are well documented. However, the impact of such changes on land restoration is poorly understood. This study will provide critical insights to scientists as they search for more effective conservation and reforestation techniques.  Because this project is highly collaborative, it will also provide broad training to U.S. and Latin American students in the ecology of plants and microbes.  Finally, the lead scientists will work with the Missouri Botanical Garden to publically demonstrate the importance of soil microbes to the health and sustainability of both natural and agricultural plant communities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The main goal of this project was to identify the soil-borne fungi that possess sufficient species-specificity required for the maintenance of tropical forest diversity, as well as to test whether these same fungi play a role in regulating tree species relative abundance. To accomplish this goal, the collaborative research team conducted a series of field experiments, greenhouse experiments, soil sampling, mesocosm inoculations with fungi and sterile seedling, fungal isolations into culture, and fungal identification using gene sequencing. We identified &gt;350 unique fungi from these tropical forest seedlings and have archived the specimens in the UA Mycological Herbarium with specimens also housed in the host country of Panama. Fungal culture collections such as the one developed from this project are increasingly valuable for their potential in bioprospecting and agricultural developments. Our findings indicate that certain soil fungi have preferences for specific tree species and they generally have a negative effect on their tree hosts. As the strength of the negative effect increases, trees become less common. Thus, tree suppression mediated by fungal pathogens appears to be a contributor to maintaining the high plant diversity found in tropical forests and soil fungal pathogens prevent any one tree species from dominating the community. Results from this grant have been included in peer reviewed publications, conference proceeding, and book chapters. This study has led to research opportunities and training of 11 early career scientists, including 5 graduate students, 4 undergraduates, 1 high school students, and 1 technician, 8 of which are underrepresented in science.
