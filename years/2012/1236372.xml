<AbstractNarration>PI: Collison, Christopher&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1236372&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rochester Institute of Tech&lt;br/&gt;Title: Novel Squaraines for Enhanced Near Infra-red-active Organic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells are inexpensive to produce but suffer from low efficiencies, which ultimately prevent their widespread use. Some success has been achieved using polymer based active layers, which absorb strongly in the blue-green region of the solar spectrum. However, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10% must be achieved for commercial viability and incorporation of a near infra-red (NIR) low-band-gap-absorbing dye is necessary to accomplish this goal. Many groups have therefore explored NIR sensitizer addition to their OPVs but many promising low band-gap materials have shown poor PCE or difficulties in processing. A substantial need remains for new materials and new developments in fabrication of NIR-active OPVs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates novel, solution processable squaraine dyes, targeted specifically for optimal application in NIR bulk heterojunction active layers for tandem OPVs. The work is designed based on a systematic variation of the functional groups on synthesized squaraines and a measure of the associated impact on isolated variables such as solubility, solid state morphology and aggregation, molecular orbital energy levels, interaction strength with fullerene electron acceptors, and excited state lifetime. Functional group substitution will be exploited because of the large number of potential synthetic precursors. Thus, an appropriate solubility and film morphology will be dialed in, beneficial since conductive properties are associated with the order and packing of the molecules in the solid state. Resulting optical absorbance red-shifts and energy level changes will also be explored. The long term goal is to describe how squaraine dyes must be chemically modified to achieve high PCEs for commercial viability. In application-driven research, an empirical approach is commonly used to meet goals for better device performance. However, a strong complementary approach is involved in this work on the prescription for how devices can be improved by fully understanding all contributing variables and mechanisms for efficient operation. To achieve the highest PCEs an interdisciplinary approach will be utilized making use of the team?s ability to i) make, measure and optimize devices, ii) test a complete range of individual properties contributing to device efficiency and iii) synthesize new compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from this project will help enable more efficient, affordable and sustainable solar cells. Participating students will develop a fundamental confidence and understanding in chemistry, materials science and device engineering that can be universally applied. Research experiences and publication opportunities for graduates and, importantly, a large number of undergraduates will be provided.</AbstractNarration>

Our long term expectation was to describe   how squaraine dyes should be modified to achieve high efficiencies in   these devices by systematically varying the molecular side groups and   measuring the impact on isolated variables.  Intellectual Merit  In application-driven research, an empirical approach is commonly used to meet goals for better device performance. However, we have taken a strong complementary approach to ultimately prescribe how representative small molecule (squaraine) solar cell devices can be improved through fully understanding contributing variables that lead to more efficient operation.  We exceeded our proposed milestone of 4.8% efficiency with a batch of devices of 5.1% average device efficiency. More importantly, with a series of squaraines, we demonstrated how this could be done when organic photovoltaic efficiency was linked to i) stacking motif within a crystal structure, ii) chemical compatibility within an active layer blend, iii) extent of phase separation and domain size, iv) charge mobility and v) excited state properties.  We also demonstrated an improved fingerprinting of excited states in aggregated molecules in the solid state with gained knowledge of H-aggregation and intermolecular charge transfer.  We continue to use such results and understanding for our squaraines, representative of all so-called "push-pull" molecular OPV target materials, as a foundation for our current and future OPV research. We thus maintain a far-reaching contribution in this larger context.  Broader Impact  Success in this research enables more efficient, affordable and sustainable OPV systems, crucial for the nation to become more energy independent.  Participating students have developed a fundamental confidence and understanding in chemistry, materials science and device engineering that can be universally applied.
