<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Stabilized Organic Carbon and Paleoenvironmental Interpretations of Late Quaternary Paleosols&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael Thompson, Iowa State University, EAR-1226949&lt;br/&gt;Elmer Bettis III, University of Iowa, EAR-1226412&lt;br/&gt;Rolfe Mandel, Kansas University, EAR-1226757&lt;br/&gt;Jingdong Mao, Old Dominion University, EAR-1226323&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Paleosols are widespread archives of paleoenvironmental information. Many Quaternary paleosols are laterally extensive, readily correlated, and suggestive of periods of regional climatic or geomorphic stability. This grant focuses on organic matter (OM) in paleosols.  The objectives of this grant are (1) to identify and rank the importance of mechanisms of OM stabilization at the millennial scale, and (2) to significantly refine paleovegetation reconstructions of midcontinent, Late-Quaternary environments. At five sites in Kansas and Nebraska, OM will be studied in buried paleosols as old as 44.6 ka. These paleosols were chosen (1) to characterize paleosol organic matter in the two most widespread surficial materials in the Midcontinent (alluvium and loess), (2) to compare OM that has witnessed primarily aerated conditions (loess soils) with OM that has been subjected to alternating aerated and saturated condition (alluvial soils); (3) to systematically lengthen the periods in which OM has been buried, giving opportunity for early diagenetic changes to occur; and (4) to capitalize on information available from previous studies.&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve understanding of which components of soil organic matter are preserved over millennial time scales and why they are preserved. Such understanding will inform reconstructions of Quaternary paleoenvironments and landscapes that are based on OM-hosted proxies. Of particular interest is the hypothesis that a significant component of stable carbon in paleosols consists of charcoal.&lt;br/&gt;By evaluating the significance of charcoal in paleosol OM, the roles that fire can play in carbon storage, landscape evolution, and interpretations of paleoclimate can be elucidated. Because some forms of OM bind together mineral particles, paleosol OM components may regulate the ability of sediments to resist erosion, thus impacting landscape evolution. The research will also help to refine geochemical models that predict the amount of carbon that can be effectively sequestered in soils and provide new insights concerning the long-term stability of terrestrial OM and its impact on global carbon cycles.&lt;br/&gt;This project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in earth sciences  through collaboration with colleagues and students at Alabama A&amp;M Univ. AAMU students be invited to join the research team during summer sessions as part of ISU's George Washington Carver Summer Internship program and they will be recruited for graduate studies at Iowa State Univ. and Univ. of Iowa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  This project was aimed at identifying mechanisms of organic matter stabilization in buried paleosols and to use that information to refine paleovegetation reconstructions of midcontinent USA, Late-Quaternary environments. The study focused on six localities in Nebraska and Kansas that spanned the period ~800 BP -55,000 BP to provide a robust sample set for analyses aimed at addressing organic matter stabilization in the shallow burial environment. We found that similar, biologically-driven mechanisms act to preserve paleosol organic matter in both well-drained and poorly-drained settings, and that soil organic matter transformations occur rapidly after burial. The project also identified and dated a new series of stream deposits that provide a record of valley landscape development during the last major period of loess accumulation on uplands in the region.  Plant macrofossil records in these stream deposits can be used to independently assess paleovegetation reconstructions that have previously relied on pollen and carbon isotope records.  Two key outcomes of this study are a better understanding of the response of the Eastern Great Plains stream system during a glacial/interglacial cycle and evaluation of the effects of loess deposition on fluvial system behavior.  Broader Impacts  The record of valley landscape development documented by this project will provide researchers with new insights into the response of stream systems during major periods of loess accumulation.  The record provides important chronological and sediment information that will foster new perspectives on linkages among upland and valley landscapes in semi-arid regions. Paleoecological records preserved in these stream sediments will allow paleoecologists to better refine vegetation composition during this period of significant environmental change and will provide potential avenues of new research linking vertebrate and plant fossil records.
