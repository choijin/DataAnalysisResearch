<AbstractNarration>Reproduction is an energetically expensive process and therefore can lead to impairments in health and survival.  In mammals the costs and tradeoffs, including reduced growth, impaired immune function, and lower life expectancy, have been mainly studies and associated with females and maternal care.  In some mammals, including humans, males/fathers also provide extensive care for their offspring; however, the consequences for fathers of  providing paternal care has not been well studied.  Therefore, this research will investigate the effects of fatherhood on blood hormone levels, body composition (fat and lean mass), energy utilization, exercise performance, and immune function in the California mouse, a monogamous rodent in which both parents engage in extensive parental behavior.  Behavioral, morphological, and physiological measures will be compared between males housed with a breeding female and males housed with a female that has been surgically neutered.  Because the consequences of fatherhood might be exacerbated by stress, half of the animals will be housed under standard laboratory conditions and the other half under cold conditions.  The results will identify the effects of parenthood on behavior, morphology and physiology in fathers, and will further indicate whether such effects differ with the animals' age, reproductive experience, or stress.  These results will provide novel insights into the biology of paternal care and may have important implications for understanding parenting in humans.  In addition, this research will contribute to the training of numerous graduate and undergraduate students, a substantial number of whom will be underrepresented minorities and/or socioeconomically disadvantaged.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In most mammalian species, fathers provide virtually no care to their offspring.  However, in approximately 5-10% of mammals, including humans, fathers invest extensively in rearing their offspring and can have important effects on offspring survival, development, behavior, and physiology.  Relatively little is known about the mechanisms that motivate these fathers to engage in paternal behavior, and even less is known about the consequences of fatherhood for fathers themselves.  This research aimed to identify effects of fatherhood on fathers? physiology, morphology, behavior, and exercise performance in the California mouse, a monogamous rodent in which both parents provide extensive care for their offspring.  The experiments mainly focused on effects of fatherhood under both standard, benign laboratory conditions and more environmentally challenging conditions, such as cold temperatures or reduced availability of food.  Overall, our findings suggest that fatherhood has few effects on males under standard housing conditions but might limit their ability to adjust to more stressful environmental conditions.  We also examined the effects of motherhood on mothers, especially on mothers rearing their offspring without assistance from a mate.  Results indicate that motherhood alters females? morphology, physiology, and behavior, consistent with studies of other species, and that single mothers show more extensive effects of motherhood than paired mothers, including differences in stress hormone levels, morphology, and maternal care.  In sum, this work may have implications for understanding the evolution of biparental care, for clinical management of health problems in human parents, and for maintenance of captive populations of biparental animals.  This research also contributed to the training of numerous graduate and graduate students, including many women and students from underrepresented ethnic or racial minorities and socioeconomically and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds.
