<AbstractNarration>The dominant process in mountain building is shortening and thickening of the Earth?s crust across relatively narrow orogenic belts where tectonic plates converge. During the past two decades there has been growing appreciation of the importance of crustal extension occurring within mountain belts at the same time as shortening. Examples of such syn-convergent extension have been identified in active mountain belts including the Himalaya and Andes and many researchers have also found evidence for similar processes in rocks that formed in ancient mountain belts. The goal of this project is to document the mechanisms of ongoing syn-convergent extension within an active fault system that bounds the southwestern margin of the Cordillera Blanca in the Peruvian Andes. Data collected on this modern structure will help researchers interpret evidence for syn-convergent extension from ancient orogenic events as well as modern mountain belts. The Cordillera Blanca is the ideal structure to study these processes because extension is very recent (&lt; 6 million years), the regional tectonic regime has remained fairly constant during the evolution of the fault and the rocks in the footwall are similar along the entire 200 km length of the detachment. These factors will facilitate comparison of data from different parts of the detachment and allow us extrapolate processes and rates of deformation into the past.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Syn-convergent extension can be broadly divided into two general types according to the direction of extension relative to the mountain belt: orogen parallel extension involves stretching of the crust parallel to the trend of the mountain belt (perpendicular to the direction of shortening); transverse extension involves stretching across the trend of the mountain belt (parallel to the direction of shortening). Orogen parallel extension generally occurs on faults oriented perpendicular to the mountains while transverse extension occurs on structures parallel to the mountain belt. Transverse extension poses something of a conundrum: How can the crust shorten and extend at the same time and in the same direction? The answer seems to involve a partitioning of shortening and extension at different levels in the crust. By studying the evolution of the Cordillera Blanca through time as it is exhumed we will attempt to elucidate the conditions that allow extension while overall shortening continues across the Andes. This project will focus on shear-zone-scale processes including: (1) How have the thickness, strain rate, differential flow stress and temperature evolved during exhumation to shallower crustal levels, and (2) How is deformation on the master detachment related to slip on seismically active structures? By carefully integrating field mapping of structural geometry, kinematic studies, analysis of deformation mechanisms, temperature estimates and paleopiezometry, we hope to reconstruct a profile showing how the strength and mechanical behavior of the shear zone varied at different depths during deformation and exhumation of the Cordillera Blanca. Our research will provide results that will help researchers to better understand how extensional faults evolve during crustal extension in modern and ancient mountain belts.  The research represents a collaborative effort between researchers at the University of Kentucky Knoxville and Montana State University. In addition to the scientific goals of the project, the project is supporting the training of graduate and undergraduate students in an STEM discipline and contributing to public outreach efforts based on the research outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The collaborative project <em>&ldquo;</em><em>Shear Zone and Detachment Formation during Syn-convergent extension in the Andes: Cordillera Blanca, Peru&rdquo;</em> revisited a classic location in the high Peruvian Andes (figure 1) where previous research had identified a large extensional fault known as the Cordillera Blanca Detachment (CBD). Although evidence for syn-orogenic extension is common in ancient mountain belts, the CBD is a rare example of an active extensional fault in a convergent orogenic setting. East-west extension on the CBD acts in opposition to the east-west compression driven by subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American continent. Dalmayrac and Molnar (1981) recognized that extension during convergent mountain building indicated that tectonic compressional forces were locally balanced by the gravitational forces arising from high topography. This balance allows us to use the CBD to constrain the strength of the crust supporting the high Peruvian Andes. Information on the strength of the crust and how it may change over time is critical for understanding the processes of mountain building and earthquake generation at tectonically active convergent plate boundaries.&nbsp;</p> <p>The CBD bounds the southwestern edge of the Cordillera Blanca, the highest range in Peru. The fault trends northwest and dips ~0-50&deg; SW with shear sense indicators showing consistent top-to-the-southwest (normal) sense of shear. The footwall is composed of relatively uniform leucogranodiorite of the Cordillera Blanca batholith (8 Ma) intruding Mesozoic metasedimentary rocks. High-strain rocks within the shear zone include mylonite, ultramylonite, psuedotachylyte, cataclasite, breccia, and fine-grained gouge. Lower structural levels preserve ductile deformation fabrics representing deformation at deeper crustal levels with progressive overprinting by brittle deformation mechanisms as the footwall was exhumed by motion on the detachment (e.g. Giovanni et al. 2010).</p> <p>Research at Montana State University (MSU) focused on Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) analysis to determine the temperature and stress conditions prevailing during dynamic recrystallization of quartz at different structural levels in the shear zone. Using the empirical relationship between the grain size of dynamically recrystallized quartz and the stress that caused the deformation &ndash; a technique called paleopiezometry (e.g. Stipp and Tullis, 2003) &ndash; to rocks collected from six transects across the detachment we calculated stresses for different structural levels.&nbsp; Working with colleagues at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, we also estimated deformation temperatures from microstructural observations and metamorphic equilibria. Samples from two transects across the CBD indicated that deformation stresses ranged between 30 and 90 MPa (figure 2) and deformation temperatures ranged from about 350-475 MPa consistent with deformation below the seismogenic layer of the crust (greater than 10 km below the surface). These results suggest that the crust had a strength profile typical of continental crust. Thus, extensional faulting in the Peruvian High Andes probably did not require a substantial weakening of the crust to promote extension driven by high gravitational energy gradients arising from elevated topography.</p> <p><em>Intellectual Merit.</em> This project offers new insights into the strength of the crust in active mountain belts. These results will help to improve geodynamic models of mountain building processes.
