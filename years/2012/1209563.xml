<AbstractNarration>This action funds Christopher Hakkenberg of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to conduct a research project, entitled "Filling in the Gaps: Restoring Forest Ecosystems in SW China" during the summer of 2012 at Kunming Institute of Botany in Yunnan, China.  The host scientist is Dr. Xu Jianchu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a combination of afforestation and reforestation programs China has increased its forest coverage; two of the efforts are the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) and the Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP). While the new forests emerging in China's heavily human-impacted landscapes may not match the original old-growth forests in structure and community diversity, plantation reforestation holds the potential to restore some vital ecosystem functions to degraded lands where persistent ecological barriers to succession might otherwise preclude native species' seedling recruitment. Because of their sacred status among local populations and their general inaccessibility to timber operations, remnant "near-natural" forest patches persist in montane northwestern Yunnan that are well suited to ecological restoration via natural regeneration. Reforestation campaigns like the SLCP and NFPP hold the potential to connect these disparate forest patches, thus enhancing landscape connectivity and biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is testing if these reforestation projects lead to different outcomes in the rate of tree species accumulation as well as the nature of forest composition. It compares processes of forest community assembly on degraded sites and analyzes how plots' spatial relationship from source "forest islands" compare with plot reforestation methods as a determinant of community composition, species abundance and diversity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In completion of the 2012 EAPSI Fellowship "Restoring Forest Ecosystems in SW China" I performed a series of vegetation surveys to provide data on patterns of reforestation in NW Yunnan Province, China. Specifically, I looked for evidence of woody plant dispersal on lands occupied by two reforestation programs: the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) and the Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP). One particular criticism of both programs is that they have suffered due to a prioritization of the quantity rather than the quality of restored forests by focusing on large-scale plantations and planting non-native species, sometimes in monoculture.   My research focused on one particular aspect of this emerging large-scale ecological restoration project, where species in isolated patches of old-growth forests (characteristic of native pre-deforestation forest ecosystems) disperse into proximate, newly reforested lands. To properly test for significant results that could be easily replicated, I chose village sacred forests abutting NFPP forests because the discrete boundaries between the two allowed for logistically feasible and scientifically meaningful comparisons.  The 2012 EAPSI Fellowship enabled me to collect a large dataset for analysis in the future and provided me valuable academic, cultural and social insights that will help guide my work in China and the USA in the future.     Intellectual Merit  1.  I collected a database of woody plant abundance in sixty plots, representing incremental dispersal steps from æuntouchedÆ sacred forests outward into the surrounding NFPP landscapes that will be used to investigate the role of scared forests as a source of plant species in reforestation processes.  2.  I collected over 300 distinct rapid assessment canopy cover measurements around NW Yunnan to be used in vegetation classification, allowing for extrapolation of site-specific ecological changes at far larger scales.  3. I established a network of contacts in ecology and conservation circles around NW Yunnan that will be integral to pursuing dissertation research on the topic in the future.  4.  Broadly speaking, I have familiarized myself with the facts on the ground as regards reforestation projects in NW Yunnan causing me to rethink assumptions made in the proposal process and identify critical knowledge gaps in this area of study worthy of urgent academic attention.     Broader Impacts  Through this program I had the opportunity to communicate scientific culture with my Chinese colleagues at the Kunming Institute of Botany, the Lijiang Alpine Botanical Institute and the Shangri-la Alpine Botanical Institute and mutually benefit from the different perspectives our different backgrounds brought to the dialogue of scientific advancement.  Furthermore, having spent near every minute of the two months with my research assistant Wu Junwen, a graduate student at the Southwest Forestry University, I was provided countless opportunities to discuss and compare education and research systems in the two countries.  My summer fieldwork brought me to a number of rural mountain villages in SW China, consisting of people of Naxi, Zangzu, Lisu and Yi ethnicities. Travelling from villages of one ethnicity to another offered an excellent opportunity to better familiarize myself with the diversity of cultures in SW China and work to build a bridge of mutual cultural understanding. While my encounter with Western ChinaÆs "minority cultures" was not my first, it certainly helped deepen my understanding of the cultural context of ecological consciousness. I presented research results as well as the experience of doing research in China and in North Carolina, and plan to do so in San Francisco later this year. In addition, I wrote an online article on the UNC CEE website highlighting my work as well as the role of EAPSI in developing ties between young scientists in the US and China through scientific dialogue.
