<AbstractNarration>This research aims to overcome the extreme challenges that need to be solved to realize a 1000-core (kilocore) processor. Processors with tens of cores are already in commercial products today. A kilocore processor could take us into the era of Server-on-Chip and Supercomputer-on-Chip. On-chip network is the medium through which two nodes in a processor can communicate, and therefore constitutes the backbone of a kilocore processor. Unfortunately, current on-chip network solutions are inadequate as they do not scale in terms of both power and performance beyond a few tens of cores. To reach the ambitious design goal of 1000+ cores with realistic power budgets, the interconnect technology needs to be at least 15 times more power efficient while providing at least the same level of throughput-per-core as today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates three interrelated solutions to meet the above challenge in an evolutionary manner: (1) Developing a low-power and energy-proportional interconnect architecture that employs a larger number of narrower networks, (2) Using high-radix Swizzle-Switches as the building blocks for interconnecting the multiple networks, and (3) Re-designing network architecture with multiple networks and Swizzle-Switches using 3D integration with Through-Silicon-Vias to achieve scalability beyond 1000 cores. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of kilocore processors. If such processors can be built, they could have a tremendous impact on future exascale systems such as cloud computing servers and HPC systems that have many applications including drug discovery, defense, information analysis, and social networking.</AbstractNarration>

The lack of a good interconnect fabric can be envisioned to result in problems similar to traffic chaos in a large city without a proper roadway infrastructure. The trend towards integrating 100Æs of cores onto the same chip is further accentuating the importance of on-chip interconnect design.   In this project we focus on scaling networks for on-chip communication in manycore systems with up to 1000 cores, that will be the critical enabler for exascale supercomputers and cloud computing platforms of the future.  To accomplish our ambitious goal, we must overcome several challenges. The largest of these barriers is related to energy and power.

While meeting the power constraint is important, it is equally necessary to meet the performance goals in terms of network bandwidth and latency. We adopt a power-driven approach towards scaling on-chip interconnects to meet the bandwidth and latency targets necessary in high-performance processors.  Our research investigated two interrelated thrusts to scale the interconnect: (1) high-radix swizzle switches and (2) fine grained power-gating to achieve energy proportionality.   Existing on-chip network topologies require large number of on-chip routers. The performance and power cost of these routers becomes prohibitive as we scale up to a manycore system with 100Æs of cores. Consolidating these routers into a few large but efficient high-radix switches is a potential solution to this problem. Each high-radix switch should be able to provide connectivity for 32 to 64 cores and connectivity to other high-radix switches. Typically, such a design is generally considered impractical due to power and area complexity of these large switches. Along with our colleagues at Michigan, we developed a novel high-radix switch design called Swizzle-Switch which challenges this conventional notion and can readily scale up to a radix of 64. Using Swizzle-Switches as building blocks we architected asymmetric high-radix topologies that can scale on-chip networks to 1000 cores. As a natural next step we designed Hi-Rise 3D high-radix switch which extends scalability to radix 96 from that of the 64 radix supported by 2D switches at the same operating frequency. 3D integration is a promising technology to enable performance scaling for future systems and Hi-Rise can serve as an efficient communicati...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
