<AbstractNarration>In order to increase the scientific literacy skills of undergraduate students enrolled in introductory cell or general biology courses, Colorado State University (a research-intensive university), Minnesota State University Moorhead (a 4-year teaching university), and White Earth Tribal &amp; Community College (a 2-year college) are integrating writing-to-learn (WTL) activities into these courses at their respective institutions. In the writing-to-learn model students are assigned the task of writing three related essays in response to reading assignments on socially relevant topics. Two different electronic platforms (Writing@CSU and Electronic Blackboard) are being used to support the writing activities.  The WTL model was originally developed through CCLI project 0930978, tested in small (10-30 students) college courses  and found to be successful, as measured by analysis of student writing, in increasing students' scientific literacy and tendency to draw on scientific data when faced with STEM related challenges.  The goals of the current project are to determine if and how: 1) WTL activities in cell biology courses help students achieve greater science literacy, as well as, increased science content knowledge and 2) the greater flexibility and leveraging potential offered by the use of two accessible Online learning platforms makes it easier for faculty to introduce STEM-related writing activities such as WTL into their courses by helping overcome the management and assessment challenges that arise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: By documenting the effect of WTL activities in large (150+ students) cell  and general biology courses this study will add to the knowledge base concerning the development of higher order thinking skills, such as problem-solving and decision-making, as well as on student learning outcomes and decision-making skills in large foundational biology courses.  The study is also exploring how faculty members can efficiently implement WTL activities and assess their efficacy using existing online educational platforms.  Concept inventories, developed and tested at Colorado State University are being used to determine the impact of the instructional intervention on overall knowledge gains in such subjects as molecular chemistry, cellular metabolism, and protein synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project involves a total of over 700 undergraduates, about thirty of them Native American students at the tribal college involved, from three very diverse institutions. Both of the universities involved have initiatives to increase the number of courses with writing components. Colorado State University houses Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC), which is visited over a million times a year by users from around the U.S. The Editor of this website heads the Advisory Board and helps disseminate project findings and products (writing prompts, rubrics, and modified concept inventory assessment tools) through this Online resource. Findings are being disseminated through university Professional Development institutes, journal articles, conference presentations, and an instructional wiki linked to the WAC Clearinghouse Website.</AbstractNarration>

We collected several types of data: pre-posttest (multiple choice content survey), graphic organizers, essays, peer feedback, self-evaluation comments, content analysis (evaluation of what was written in essays), rhetorical analysis (evaluation of the types of arguments constructed in essays), and retention (if participants graduated in STEM majors or not).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All students in control and intervention sections at both universities improved on their posttests compared to pretests, and none of the gains in the intervention sections were significantly different than in the control sections.

However, we found that, at both sites, students in the WTL sections outperformed their peers on final essay scores (using the same grading rubric) and final exam scores in control classes. This finding was particularly significant for minority students, first-generation college students, international students, and women, even though the numbers of these groups were usually lower in the intervention sections compared to control sections.

Preliminary data indicates that student essays in WTL sections are more likely to be classified as dialectical arguments that require the use of persuasive rhetorical devices, compared to essays written in control sections that are more demonstrative (or explanatory).
