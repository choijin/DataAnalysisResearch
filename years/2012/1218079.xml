<AbstractNarration>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely used in applications such as environmental monitoring, surveillance and health monitoring of large structures. A major challenge when using WSNs is their limited life expectancy. However, in practice the phenomena of interest in a sensed field are quite localized and affect a small number of sensors. This property of locality induces sparsity in sensor data statistical descriptors such as the covariance matrix. This project involves the development and analysis of efficient algorithms that uncover sparse structures in the sensor data covariance, and determine in a distributed fashion which sensors acquire informative measurements and have to remain active. Identifying the `informative' sensors can lead to significant energy savings. The research focuses on the novel utilization of covariance sparsity in developing distributed informative sensor selection algorithms that have the ability to adaptively learn the statistical behavior of the sensed field, without relying on a priori known data models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators consider the design and performance analysis of a generalized sparsity-aware framework that is capable to analyze the sensor data covariance matrix into sparse factors. Norm-one regularization mechanisms are employed to estimate and identify the support (nonzero entries) of the unknown sparse covariance factors. The factors' support is used to identify the informative sensors. A novel blending of the sparsity-based factorization techniques with distributed optimization tools is also studied to obtain distributed algorithms that enable sensors to collaboratively learn the underlying sparse covariance structure, even with noisy inter-sensor communications and overlapping sources.  The research also involves adaptive implementations that track online the set of informative sensors in non-stationary settings formed by mobile sources, using stochastic approximation toolboxes properly tuned to exploit sparsity.</AbstractNarration>
