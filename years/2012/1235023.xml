<AbstractNarration>The project will develop a general framework for defining risk measures for systems consisting of&lt;br/&gt;a set of interacting agents with uncertain joint outcomes.  This framework will define convex&lt;br/&gt;programming-based axioms that characterize a very general class of systemic measures. This class&lt;br/&gt;of risk measures includes all the ad hoc risk measures that have been recently proposed in the&lt;br/&gt;literature. The optimization-based approach leads to a primal-dual representation for the systemic&lt;br/&gt;risk that allows attribution of the overall risk to individual agents in a fair manner, as well as&lt;br/&gt;the development of decentralized algorithms for systemic risk sensitive social welfare&lt;br/&gt;maximization. The project will seek to extend this representation to include a larger class of&lt;br/&gt;risk functions. New structural models will aid the study of the role of contagion in complex&lt;br/&gt;systems. A statistical methodology will be developed for identifying systemically important&lt;br/&gt;factors and the exposure of the system to these factors. These systemic factors would lead to&lt;br/&gt;methods for robust and efficient estimation of systemic risk.  Systemic risk measure based&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for the design and control of the network structure underlying complex systems will&lt;br/&gt;also be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent events across many disparate settings (e.g., the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in&lt;br/&gt;2010, the financial crisis in 2008, the Northeastern blackout in 2003) have all highlighted the&lt;br/&gt;critical importance of risk management in general, and systemic risk management in&lt;br/&gt;particular. Progress on tools for systemic risk management will help prevent, or at least better&lt;br/&gt;manage, future systemic failures in financial, public health, environmental, national security,&lt;br/&gt;and governmental domains.  The proposed research is synergistic with ongoing relationships and&lt;br/&gt;collaborations the PIs maintain with industry and policy-making groups concerned with systemic&lt;br/&gt;risk in electricity grids and in capital markets. In addition, the project will provide funding&lt;br/&gt;for research and educational opportunities for students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project explored the development of methodology and frameworks for assessing risk in systems of interacting agents, primarily focused on financial networks. We explored systemic risk along several different dimensions:  One driver of the financial crisis in 2008 was the fact that many important firms had significant exposure the real estate assets. ``Fire sales'' which occur when one firm is in distress can then impact the solvency or liquidity of many firms.  We developed models for asset-based contagion, that results in financial networks where agents hold similar portfolios and distress may propagate through fire sales of these common assets. The risk in an economy is influenced by macroeconomic factors (e.g., interest rates, unemployment), fundamental corporate factors (e.g., revenues or earning), and commodity factors (e.g. oil or energy prices, etc.), among others. Factor models play an important role in modeling future uncertainty in economic systems as well as more broadly. We have developed a statistical framework to analyze systemic risk based on factor models. Regulatory changes are transforming the multi-trillion dollar swaps market from a network of bilateral contracts to one in which swaps are cleared through central counterparties (CCPs).  We developed models for exploring the impact of central clearing and, in particular, the presence of many competing CCPs systemic risk.  The recent financial crisis and the ensuing sovereign debt crisis once again highlighted that understanding the potential instabilities in the financial system is of great societal value. Financial instability typically results from positive feedback loops intrinsic to the operation of the financial system. We developed a process engineering framework for modeling systemic risk and analyzing the causes and effects of such loops. One of the important limitations of many existing measures of systemic risk is their reliance on stock market data without much validation against the institutions? fundamentals based on its financial statements.  We propose a financial statement based approach to estimating the vulnerability of an institution to a systemic event.  Our approach works for insurers, commercial banks and investment banks. Estimating liquidity accurately is an important ingredient of portfolio management, and, indeed, liquidity risk is an important element of overall systemic risk. We developed a model to estimate liquidity costs at the level of a portfolio, capturing interactions between assets created by the trading of ETFs or indices. Our model provides insight into the structural drivers of liquidity costs.         Last Modified: 06/27/2018       Submitted by: Ciamac C Moallemi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
