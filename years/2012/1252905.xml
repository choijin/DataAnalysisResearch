<AbstractNarration>The mustard family (Brassicaceae) includes over 3660 species, of which many are important vegetables (cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, turnip, radish, watercress, arugula) and  sources of industrial and vegetable oils (canola) and condiments (table mustard, horseradish, wasabi). One species, thale cress, is the model organism in experimental plant biology. The family is quite complex, and there are very few young scientists with expertise in this important family. This two-year grant will support the synthesis of the extensive taxonomic/evolutionary literature and vastly unpublished, though nearly complete, work the PI assembled during his 45-year research on the family. All findings, regardless to their stage of completion, will be downloadable from the project website at the Missouri Botanical Garden (MBG). The website will also include plant digital images, comprehensive literature, and simplified electronic keys to assist professionals and students with the easy identification of mustards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will train 28 undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral botanists through four workshops at MBG to enable them to understand the taxonomic complexity of the family. The Project website will be a major resource and will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by covering all aspects of mustards on a worldwide basis. The information will be used by researchers and students in taxonomy, conservation, education, horticulture, and crop sciences.</AbstractNarration>
