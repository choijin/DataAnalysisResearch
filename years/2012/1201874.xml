<AbstractNarration>This award is made in response to a proposal submitted to and reviewed under the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering joint solicitation NSF 09-596. The award provides funds to support undergraduate participation in the overall research effort, which is being funded separately by the DOE under contract to Columbia University (TBD).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plasmas constitute over 99% of the visible universe and turbulent mixing of plasmas is a fundamental process that is important both in natural and artificial situations. Turbulent mixing of ionized gas, called plasma, is especially fascinating when the plasma is embedded inside a strong magnetic force field. Mixing of magnetized plasma has special geometric relationships, couples energy from small and large sized vortex-like structures know as "eddies," and creates self-organization through a remarkable turbulent "pinch." A collaboration between two universities will operate two unique facilities, called laboratory magnetospheres, that contain high-temperature ionized gas using a magnetic force field that resembles the field that surround our Earth and other planets. New measurements will be combined with new theories and simulations that will answer unresolved questions including: How do plasma eddies couple energy at different sizes? How do plasmas evolve during turbulent mixing? What mechanisms cause turbulent self-organization? New science will advance including: (1) global imaging and control of turbulent interchange mixing in a variety of plasma conditions, (2) study of electrostatic self-organization through the understanding of the turbulent pinch, and (3) validating our models for lowfrequency turbulence by carrying out self-consistent nonlinear simulations of turbulent mixing in laboratory magnetospheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has broad impact because turbulent mixing of magnetized plasma is ubiquitous and fundamental. Understanding turbulent mixing in laboratory magnetospheres will improve our understanding of (1) processes occurring in the ionosphere, which is important to satellite communication, (2) turbulence inside the central regions of planetary magnetospheres, which is important to space weather models, and (3) the anisotropic mixing of low-dimensional fluid systems, which is important to industrial processes. Additionally, this collaborative research uses state-of-the-art facilities at highly-regarded research universities to motivate students and scientists to explore plasma dynamics in a magnetic configuration that resembles a magnetosphere and to encourage the next generation of scientists able to understand and control high-temperature, ionized matter.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Goals:  Visualize and control strong interchange turbulent mixing under a variety of plasma conditions and through the application of asymmetrical plasma bias and probe&shy; induced vorticity.  Understand how and why low&shy; frequency interchange turbulence causes "self&shy;organization" as observed both by profile consistency maintained by the turbulent pinch and by nonlinear "symmetry breaking" in the form of non&shy;axisymmetric quasi&shy;coherent modes.  Validate our models for low&shy; frequency turbulence in strongly magnetized (and shear&shy; free) plasma by carrying out self&shy;-consistent, nonlinear, whole&shy;-plasma simulations of turbulent interchange mixing in laboratory magnetospheres.  Key Results and Accomplishments:        (1) First identification of the presense of entropy modes in the electrostatic turbulence found in laboratory magnetospheres. Observation of the change in the toroidal rotation of interchange-entropy modes due to changes in the plasma temperatutre and density profiles as predicted by theory and simulation. (2) Demonstration of robust "self-organization" of plasma with centrally-peaked profiles as first predicted with scientfiic computation and simulation. (3) First demonstration of an "artificial ionosphere" used to both suppress and amplify interchange-entropy modes in a laboratory magnetsphere. (4) First demonstration of multiple free-falling micro-probes for simultaneous measurment of plasma density fluctuations. (5) First computation of global interchange and entripy modes as a function of plasma profiles including the presense of energetic trapped "radiation belt" particles. (6) Completion of several doctoral dissertations and the education of undergraduate students in applied plasma physics.
