<AbstractNarration>The investigators will conduct a comprehensive study of the chemistry and dynamics in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) using existing and new data.  The tasks include the development of a new radar capability to measure nighttime Fe+ concentrations, and enhanced lidar capabilities for temperature and wind measurements. The objectives are to characterize relationships among atomic metals and electron concentration, compare chemistries of meteoric species in MLT through simultaneous observations, and investigate the response of metal layers to gravity waves and tides.  In the last two decades, there have been a number of simultaneous and common volume observations of meteoric species, including, Ca, Fe, K, Na, and Ca+, as well as electron concentration (Ne) and temperature in the mesopause region at Arecibo. The simultaneous observation of multiple species offers the advantage that the atmospheric conditions are identical. With the anticipated radar measurement of Fe+, the observations will allow for comparative studies on ion-molecular and neural-molecular chemistries.  Also, the influence of dynamical versus chemical transport and its variation with the altitude will be investigated. The study will help in the development of atmospheric models and improve knowledge of mesospheric chemistry and dynamics.  It will involve graduate and undergraduate students from Miami University, as well as students from universities in Puerto Rico, and will strengthen international collaborations with scientists from at least two other countries. The results are expected to help to improve atmospheric models used by the broader atmospheric community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of the grant is to study the metal atoms and ion concentrations using the lidar and radar measurements at Arecibo. There have been 13 journal papers published with the support of this grant. The main findings are summarized below:  We have discussed the impacts of wave-induced dynamical transport, chemical cycling associated with temperature fluctuations, and temperature-dependent chemistry on the Na and K layers (Yue et al. 2016). The correlations among temperature, Na layer and K layer can be explained qualitatively by the theoretical model for the density responses of an atmospheric layer to wave-induced dynamics. Such results provide strong support to the assumption that the wave-induced dynamical effects are a primary source of the short-term Na and K density fluctuations during a night.  The work by Gong et al. (2016) for the first time compares the electric field in the E region and F-region heights in the low latitude. We find large discrepancies between the F region eastward E &times; B ion drift and the E region eastward ion drift. Such a discrepancy cannot be explained by potential vertical neutral wind. The observations presented suggest that the E region electric field may not be regarded to be the same from the F region.This may have significant impacts on the practice of using incoherent scatter radar to derive E region neutral winds, and our understanding of the E region current system since the implication of the altitude variation of the electric field is that the current along the magnetic field line is not negligible.   In the work by Yue et al., (2017), the potassium layer characteristics are reported from the analysis of extensive density and temperature data obtained at Arecibo. We find that the wave-induced downward transport associated with the temperature variance can explain the observed semiannual oscillation in the centroid heights of the K and Fe layers at Arecibo. The correlation between K column abundance and the mean background temperature within the height range from 85- to 100-km is strongly negative, which supports that the production of K from K+ is favored at low temperature as predicted by a recent K chemical model.  In the study by Gong et al. (2016) on midnight temperature maximum (MTM), a MTM amplitude of 310 K  has been observed at Arecibo. The MTM is likely generated by an upward propagating terdiurnal tide associated with the SSW. Our observation provides direct evidence to support the model studies and help the understanding of the coupling between the ionosphere and atmosphere.   In the study by Gong et al. (2017) on negative ions, we find that Doppler effect plays an important role in broadening the incoherent scatter power spectra in the lower D-region at Arecibo. Because of the doppler broadening, the ratio of negative ions to electron density inferred by previous incoherent scatter radar (ISR) studies is overestimated. The results improve our understanding on the Doppler effect and ion mass for inferring negative ion ratio  from ISR measurements in the D-region.  In Raizada et al. (2014), we report that sporadic sodium layer can be attributed to the faster neutralization process, which is more sensitive to temperature changes compared with Fe. The temperature sensitivity is also reflected in stronger structures in the case of Na compared with Fe. Simultaneous observations of Na, Fe, electron density, temperature and gravity wave activities provide a more heuristic understanding on mesospheric chemistries and density variations due to both dynamic and chemical processes.   In Gong et al. (2013), we report the largest F-region meridional wind observed at Arecibo. The very large wind was found to be due to travelling atmospheric disturbance instead of electric field during a geomagnetic storm period. Large variations in the F-region peak height and peak electron density were also observed during the storm period. The large ionospheric perturbations were mainly due to the combined effect of electric field, an enhanced meridional wind, and chemical recombination.  The study of Liu et al.

Possible influences of geomagnetic storms/substorms, and variability in magnetic activity, and solar wind speed on the annual and semiannual variations of these typical planetary waves are also discussed.
