<AbstractNarration>This action funds Albert Medina of University of California, Los Angeles to conduct a research project, entitled "Investigating flight enhancement in flexible flapping wings," during the summer of 2012 at Seoul National University in Seoul, Gwanak, Korea.  The host scientist is Professor Haecheon Choi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flapping wing flight has garnered much attention in the past decade driven by our desire to understand capabilities observed in nature, such as in airborne insects and to develop agile small-scale aerial vehicles with similar capabilities.  Nature has demonstrated the breadth of maneuverability achievable with flapping wings.  A wing of an insect undergoes significant bending and twisting as it flaps.  However, the aerodynamic role of this elastic deformation is still poorly understood.  In order to illuminate this role, this study  focuses on the mechanics of a three-dimensional flexible flapping wing and uses numerical simulations to examine the effect of orientations of flexion lines in a model wing, over a broad range of flapping conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Flapping wing flight has garnered much attention in the past decade driven by our desire to understand capabilities observed in nature and to develop agile small-scale aerial vehicles.  Nature has demonstrated the breadth of maneuverability achievable by flapping wing flight. However, despite recent advances the role of wing flexibility remains poorly understood. A given insect wing is characterized by non-uniform stiffness, resulting in significant bending and twisting. In an effort to develop a deeper understanding of wing deflection effects and to explore novel approaches to increasing leading-edge vortex robustness, this three-dimensional computational study explores the aerodynamics of low aspect ratio plates, in hovering kinematics, undergoing prescribed deflection about pivot lines introduced to the plate.  This study explores two distinct modes of deflection reminiscent of those observed in nature, allowing for the root and tip of the plates to pivot.  Focus is on characterizing the response of the surrounding fluid to the deflections imposed, with the rigid plate serving as the control.  This work identifies vortical structure pertinent to the generation of lift and explores the nature of these structures in greater depth in identifying the corresponding circulatory axes.  Ultimately this study demonstrates vortical robustness via insensitivity of the vortex axes to the deflection modes.  Generally speaking deflection, whether prescribed at the root or tip of the wing, provides for a slight reduction in lift, accompanied by a reduction in drag, often providing for increased operational efficiency.  Results contribute to the field unsteady flight mechanics, provide insight into aerodynamic considerations, and shine light on insect biology and morphology.
