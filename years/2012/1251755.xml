<AbstractNarration>This is a three-year project for field operations divided into two parts.  The first two years, 2013 and 2014, will be a field program in Rapid City, South Dakota followed by evaluation and analyses. The third year, 2015, will be the appropriate time to use two high-speed cameras (one for spectra; one for black and white imagery) at the Camp Blanding, University of Florida experimental station.  Three spectroscopic optical input diffraction grating units, two with gratings blazed at 560 nm and 600 nm, and one at 750 nm have also be built in the previous years.  The objective of the current research is to obtain spectral data (380 - 850 nm) from the entire optical channel length with high time resolution for all visible elements, i.e. return strokes, stepped and dart leaders, M-strokes, continuing currents, and recoil leaders associated with positive and negative leader breakdown.  These spectral data will provide estimates of temperature, electron density, and other thermodynamic properties throughout the channel lengths.  In addition, these data will then be matched to National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) and Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) or interferometry measurements on the same flashes for which the polarity, peak current, flash extent, etc. can be derived.  This total information will provide the most complete physical description of natural and triggered lightning channels to-date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research activity is to provide the most complete physical description of natural and triggered lightning channels to-date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;Results from the research will have an immediate impact on the research programs of cooperating scientists and their students.  At the moment, more than ten cooperating institutions have expressed an interest in the Lightning Project and the associated information.  This research will contribute to the education of graduate students who will directly participate in the project. Research results will be incorporated into advanced courses on cloud physics and mesoscale phenomena.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The rise of high-speed video over the past several years has allowed scientists to study lightning in unprecedented detail. In one of the latest findings, researchers have documented fleeting flare-ups, which they?ve dubbed "sparks," that rekindle previously abandoned paths visited by jagged blazes of lightning plunging to Earth.  When cloud-to-ground lightning propagates, it doesn?t take a straight path. Instead, it follows a zigzag channel through the air, known as a stepped leader, which forms after strong electric fields ionize gas molecules, creating a highly conductive plasma. The stepped leader&mdash;which is invisible to the naked eye but can be seen by sensitive high-speed video cameras&mdash;extends itself in segments about 50 meters long apiece, often changing direction and splitting into many ancillary branches because the conductivity of the air is not uniform. A similar channel simultaneously takes shape from below until the two meet. That?s when a powerful upward current of electric charge, called the return stroke, surges through the channel, causing the dazzling flash we know as lightning.  Many of the branches that shoot off the main stepped leader trunk go dark before the leader reaches the ground. But sometimes, these abandoned branches suddenly spark back on again, reconnecting to their parent, according to new observations from Maribeth Stolzenburg, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, and her colleagues.  Surprisingly Common Sparks  "It?s a little surprising to us that no one has described these previously."  "It?s a little surprising to us that no one has described these previously because we see them in all stepped leaders," Stolzenburg said. She presented her findings last month at the meeting of the European Geosciences Union (EGU) in Vienna. She also described the phenomenon last year in a paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres.  The findings are based on data Stolzenburg and her colleagues collected at Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a fruitful 6-week field season in 2011.
