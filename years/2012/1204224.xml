<AbstractNarration>This award funds graduate student participation in the Urbino Summer School in Paleoclimatology (USSP). Held at the University of Urbino, in Italy, the USSP leverages the expertise of top quality faculty from Europe (~2/3) and the US (~1/3) to provide a three-week intensive, immersive learning experience in paleoclimate research topic and methods for both European and American students. These students present their own research and participate in lecture- and lab-style classes while broadening their research networks in an international setting. Faculty and students interact closely during the program in both formal and informal venues. Each session of the USSP brings in a new group of students and provides fresh opportunities for international collaboration. The experience of previous students suggests that participation in the USSP lays a foundation for international collaboration, both with their peers and with more senior (i.e., faculty) researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding provides scholarships for ten US students to participate in the USSP each summer. Scholarships will be awarded on a competitive basis.</AbstractNarration>
