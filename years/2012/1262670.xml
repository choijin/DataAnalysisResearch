<AbstractNarration>The American Student Placements and Internships in Rehabilitation Engineering (ASPIRE) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program is funded by the National Science Foundation Division of Engineering Education and Centers.  Rehabilitation engineering employs a systematic approach to the design, modification, customization and/or fabrication of assistive technology for persons with disabilities. Research efforts in rehabilitation engineering are focused on identifying and addressing problems critical to achieving and maintaining the highest possible level of function in areas related to mobility, communications, sensory (e.g., hearing, tactile, vision), and cognition and in activities associated with employment, independent living, and education. The primary objective of the ASPIRE REU program is to provide an exemplary mentoring and resourceful environment that enables undergraduate students to 1) transition from dependent to independent thinkers, 2) develop a sense of excitement about entering an engineering or technical field and 3) be well prepared for their future careers.  Recruitment initiatives emphasize minorities and students with disabilities. Additionally, students who come from institutions with limited research opportunities will receive special consideration. Seminars, workshops and field trips supplement the educational experience outside of the laboratories.  Students in this REU Site are an active participant of a multi-disciplinary research team and acquire ownership of part of a larger-scale or pilot research project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the ASPIRE REU program is about empowering undergraduate students with the confidence, experience and skills necessary to excel in graduate studies and in their future careers as engineers or scientists, all within the context of rehabilitation engineering projects whose byproducts increase the independence of people with disabilities.  Program mentors are well experienced in providing the appropriate level of guidance needed to support the students' independent development of these attributes.  Students in this REU develop a sense of worth that comes from being an integral part of something 'bigger'.  Moreover, this REU Site provides opportunities for students to work on projects that have direct application to the betterment of society.   Having this experience early in their academic careers not only raises awareness to the social obligations of being an engineer, but also provides a "beyond the classroom experience" that brings purpose and meaning to an engineering curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The comprehensive approach applied to the ASPIRE REU program at the University of Pittsburgh's Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL) has resulted in the successful engagement of undergraduate students - from multiple disciplines - in the tenants of Rehabilitation Engineering.  ASPIRE REU students have gained an understanding of, along with the ability to relate to, the problems faced by individuals with disabilities and serve as messengers in the continuing effort to increase inclusiveness for all individuals.

All ASPIRE REU projects at the HERL are aimed at improving the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. However, before the hard research can begin, the HERL provides a thorough orientation to develop a solid research foundation.

For the past three years, ASPIRE REU students have benefited from tours of the HERL labs, Pitt's Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation Department, and shadowing of clinical staff at UPMC's Center for Assistive Technology (CAT).

The cumulative result of these activities are students who have an expanded understanding of research, acquired new opportunities for professional development, and can effectively demonstrate the role rehabilitation engineering plays in improving the quality of life for individuals and communities.  Effective communication - both on an individual level and in the effective dissemination of information aspect - is an important part of the ASPIRE REU program at the HERL.  Students participate in an Elevator Pitch competition during the program's final week with winners presenting at the Final Symposium and Poster session.  The symposium is attended by faculty, graduate students, and staff from Pitt, Carnegie Mellon University, and our local/national diversity partners such as the Student Veterans of America National Chapter, the American Legion, and the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System.  Over the past few years, the work of ASPIRE REU students has contributed to the advancement of rehabilitation engineering while improving the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. StrongARM allows a person with disabilities to be more independent (in and out of their home) and to reduce the risk of injury to the individual and their caregiver.  PathMET, which measures pedestrian pathway accessibility, leads to greater accessibility, safety, and independence for individuals with disabilities.
