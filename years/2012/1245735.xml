<AbstractNarration>This project develops and evaluates a system for assessing proofs in undergraduate mathematics and computer science classes via peer evaluation. It approaches the problem as an instance of human computation, using computer technology to harness the collective capability of large numbers of people to do useful work. This requires breaking down the task of assessing a proof to make it possible for multiple, nonexpert people to contribute to the assessment. It requires instituting mechanisms to ensure the quality, uniformity, and integrity of the assessment process. The work builds on previous experience with a prototype system that had been used for two years in computer science and mathematics courses that targeted handling large classes using teams of undergraduate graders. Experience indicated the feasibility of the basic strategy, while this project works to ensure the quality of the assessments and of the learning experience for the assessors. In addition, this project takes initial steps toward an assessment system that can scale to support web-scale courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work creates structured frameworks in which to analyze proofs, so that assessment can be decomposed into a number of tasks, suitable for nonexperts. It explores ways to maximize the learning experience students gain by critically evaluating each other's proofs. It creates a platform for performing quantitative experiments on the most effective methods for teaching students how to read and evaluate proofs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported efforts by PhD student Adam Blank on research in supporting the teaching of introductory discrete math and theoretical computer science.  While a student, he played served as an instructor for a course for CS freshman on mathematical foundations of computer science.  In that role, he developed a number of tools for supporting student projects, including one to get students to evaluate proofs written by other students.  The challenge with such a tool is that the students are scarcely qualified to write proofs, much less evaluate those by others.  On the other hand, there is some hope that students will learn to write better proofs by studying both the positive and the negative examples written by other students.  The key idea is to guide their efforts by having the instructor prepare a set of "judgements"---statements that may be applicable to a specific proof.  Students are then instructed to determine which judgements apply to a given submission.  A sample of judgements is shown in screenshot of the tool included in this report.  Adam conducted human subject studies to see whether the effort in grading each other's proofs led to improved proof writing.  Although the sample size was small, he obtained a measurable positive outcome.  In Spring, 2014, Adam completed his masters degree requirements and decided to take a leave of absence from the PhD program.  He took a position as a lecturer at the University of Washington, where he has taught a number of courses, making use of the tools he had developed, including his proof grading tool.  Unfortunately, we were not able to identify other PhD students interested in pursuing this line of research and therefore terminated the project.
