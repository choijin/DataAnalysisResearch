<AbstractNarration>This team of investigators will use three-dimensional magnetohyrodynamic simulations to study the impact of prior solar eruptions and plasma interaction processes on the ultimate properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) reaching Earth's orbit. The team will assess how earlier CMEs precondition the heliosphere and solar wind, as well as how prior CME interactions deflect, rotate, compress, and accelerate subsequent CMEs. The team will identify the causes of enhanced geo-effectiveness in complex CME events at Earth and the extent to which these causes can be forecasted from remote-sensing observations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The team will conduct self-consistent simulations of selected CME events using existing and improved models of CME evolution, the interplanetary magnetic field, and the solar wind, and they will then compare their model output to spacecraft observations. The investigators argue that these direct comparisons will result in better constraints on their numerical models, as well as in new tools to better understand these complex measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team is a collaborative effort among the University of Hawaii (the lead institution), the University of New Hampshire, and the Naval Research Laboratory. The team members will broadly disseminate their research results to the space weather community by organizing and participating in workshops and conferences, as well as through their journal publications and the enhancement of existing community models at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The invesitgators at the University of Hawaii and the University of New Hampshire will integrate local undergraduates in this research. The investigators pledge to recruit under-represented minorities into this effort wherever possible. The lead investigator also plans to take advantage of the Hawaii Center for Advancing Systemic Heliophysics Education for engaging in public outreach, while exploiting the colorful graphics and movies derived from these research simulations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The research funded through this award focused on the interaction of successive solar eruptions (also referred to as coronal mass ejections or CMEs) and combined advanced numerical simulations and the analysis of remote observations and spacecraft measurements. When they interact on their way to Earth, solar eruptions may result in a more complex ejecta, which can sometimes result in more intense effects on Earth's upper atmosphere and magnetosphere. In the most extreme cases, satellite failures and power grid outage may occur. Such interactions occur more than once a month, on average. The main scientific results of the award are:     1- CME-CME interaction may result in the deflection of one eruption by another. This must be taken into account when forecasting the arrival times and hit/miss of solar eruptions.  2- We determined that the nature and characteristics of the complex ejecta resulting from CME-CME interaction is strongly dependent on the initial orientation of the eruptions, and we have identified a new type of compound event sometimes measured near Earth. This type of events has many of the characteristics of a long-duration isolated solar eruption but is in fact associated with CME-CME interaction. Correct identification of such events is required to distinguish between the effects of isolated and successive eruptions.   3- Such long-duration ejecta resulting from interaction eruptions may affect Earth's magnetosphere in an unusal manner, resulting in long-duration storms.   4- Shock waves propagating within a previous eruption is a common occurrence (on average about 4-5 times per year) near Earth and about a third of such events results in strong geomagnetic storms and/or electron depletion events in Earth's radiation belts.   5- Extreme events, and in particular, events with very quick propagation between the Sun and the Earth (less than a day) are often associated with successions of non-interacting CMEs, as was the case for the July 2012 event.   6- CME-CME interaction may sometimes result in a formation of strong fast-forward shock waves preceding the complex ejecta. Sheaths associated with such events may be extremely dense and contribute to the pre-conditioning of the magnetosphere.    These results were obtained by (i) performing the first 3-D MHD parametric study of CME-CME interaction, (ii) performing the first dedicated survey of shocks within CMEs, (iii) identifying a new type of complex ejecta at 1 AU, and (iv), performing selected data analysis studies of interacting eruptions, among others.

In particular, the students in 2015 worked on identifying recent instances of shocks within previous CMEs and were introduced to the causes and consequences of CME-CME interaction.   Lastly, the PI presented some of these results in invited or contributed talks in US, Europe and Asia, for example at the quadriennal SCOSTEP meeting, the triennal International Astronomical Union general assembly, the biennal COSPAR general assembly, the annual American Geophysical Union meeting and at the SHINE workshop.
