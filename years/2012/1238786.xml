<AbstractNarration>The Tuskegee University HBCU-UP Broadening Participation Research in STEM Education project is entitled Fostering Retention in STEM Disciplines at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The proposed study will examine the interplay between psychosocial and academic structural factors that affect retention of minority students at HBCUs. The objectives are to (1) determine the most prominent psycho-social factors that affect student retention in STEM programs; (2) identify the structural factors that lead to the successful retention of students in STEM programs; (3) gain insight into the issues that influence the effectiveness of those structural factors; and (4) develop  a manual describing suggestions for best practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal frames the study by presenting a synthesis of the literature in a model of psychological and sociological influences on STEM retention at HBCUs. The PIs intend to build upon this model to describe what HBCUs are doing to foster student success. The study will employ a mixed methods approach to collect and analyze data from students, faculty, administrators and other non-faculty personnel, and successful graduates of STEM programs from HBCUs in order to investigate three research questions:&lt;br/&gt;1. What psycho-social factors (emotional, motivational, and social factors) appear to affect the retention of students in STEM disciplines at HBCUs? In what ways are these effects manifested?&lt;br/&gt;2. How do structural factors (tangible resources, availability of mentors, supportive programs, etc.) influence retention rates in STEM disciplines at HBCUs?&lt;br/&gt;3. What influence, if any, do psycho-social factors (emotional factors, motivational factors, social factors) appear to have on the effectiveness of structural factors which are intended to support student retention in STEM disciplines?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The study will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of faculty specializing in education, social and behavioral sciences, and mathematics, and it will be conducted in collaboration with other HBCUs.  Through the use of a community-based participatory research methodology, the PIs expect to produce results that will have practical benefits to the larger community. More specifically, the study may provide guidance that will translate into a set of best practices for HBCUs and non-HBCUs seeking to increase minority student retention in STEM, particularly at the freshman and sophomore levels.</AbstractNarration>

The study was led by a diverse team of STEM researchers from psychology, sociology, education and mathematics.? In addition the study recruited liaison from 5 HBCUs (Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science, Howard University, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University, Texas Southern University, and Winston Salem State University) to assist in recruiting participants and disseminating results. The study was guided by a rigorous methodology that utilized community based participatory research and survey methods to produce valid and reliable quantitative and qualitative data.</p> <h2>What did the project produce</h2> <p>A major product of this study is the construction of a multidimensional comprehensive survey instrument designed to address multiple factors in STEM retention at HBCUs. The survey design and questions relied heavily upon input from focus groups with students, alumni, staff, faculty and administrator through highly structured focus group sessions at the 6 participation HBCUs representing geographic regions from across the country.? This is an important development since research instruments do not always address the needs and experiences of underserved populations.?? In addition, a model was constructed and revised to demonstrate the relational patterns associated with STEM retention that can not only be applied to HBCUs but also other minority serving institutions and predominantly white institutions as well.?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The study also provided two very powerful workshops.? The Liaison Workshop provided liaisons with a handbook summarizing preliminary research results and giving an overview of some of the best practices for retention of minority students.? The second workshop, Liaison Writing Retreat, gave liaisons the opportunity to contribute to a manuscript on best practices from the vantage point of HBCU students, alumni, faculty, staff, and administrators. ?The liaisons affiliated with this study are more knowledgeable about key factors influencing retention in STEM fields and will incorporate that understanding into their professional and instructional portfolios.</p> <h1>Broader Impacts</h1> <p>The impact of this study reaches far beyond the scope of the proposal.? The study?s multidisciplinary approach has influenced research collaborations within the participating institutions such as Howard University?s successful research collaboration between Social Work and Biology.? The study has also been a training ground for Tuskegee Co-PIs and provided the foundational framework for a continuation grant proposal which was funded by NSF this fall.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The model developed by the research team helped to guide the study through the implementation of research focus group and survey question development. A study of existing research regarding psychological, sociological, and structural factors guided the initial creation of a theoretical model which was then edited to reflect ideas that emerged from focus group data. The study gathered qualitative data through focus group discussion with students, alumni, staff, faculty and administrators to provide a rich source of firsthand accounts of the STEM experience. The focus groups allowed stakeholders engaged in the instructional development of STEM professionals at HBCUs to share multiple perspectives. The workshop, workshop manual developed by the study, and dissemination presentations at conferences and to institutional stakeholders have provided meaningful data to partner institutions as well as other HBCUs from across the country. The expected shift in demographics in the next forty years will require American institutions of higher education to serve an increasingly diverse student populations in order for America to compete in the world?s global economy, and this work will help HBCUs and other institutions better serve that diverse population.</p> <p>As previously noted, both the model and construction of a reliable survey instrument have been added to the tools that can be used to conduct STEM retention research.?Statistical tests show that the survey instrument is valid and reliable for research purposes. Results from the survey instrument show that emotional factors (self-reliance, confidence in study habits, financial concerns, and ability to cope with stress) and structural factors (people, programs, resources, and institutional standards) are significant predictors as to why students remain in their STEM fields of study.? In addition, the study serves as a guide for providing better service to students and increasing retention.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Another important impact of this study has been the opportunity to work with and train undergraduate research assistants. These students have contributed substantially to our discussion and research processes and as such have been part of the STEM community participation in the project. They have gained valuable research experience that will allow them to go forward and contribute greatly to the desired and much needed increased diversity in the STEM workforce.?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Vivian&nbsp;Carter</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1238786/1238786_10212480_1480307413431_OriginalBPRdiagram(3)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1238786/1238786_10212480_1480307413431_OriginalBPRdiagram(3)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Original Diagram"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1238786/1238786_10212480_1480307413431_OriginalBPRdiagram(3)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Original Diagram"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Original Psycho-Social Diagram</div> <div class="imageCredit">V.
