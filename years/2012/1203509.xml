<AbstractNarration>This work will safeguard and improve accessibility of the University of Hawaii Insect Museum (UHIM), which contains about 250,000 insect specimens from the Pacific Region. Infrastructure of the museum will be updated: dilapidated cabinets, which can't keep specimens safe from pests and mold, will be replaced. The improvements will also make space for additional specimens, since UHIM is currently close to capacity. UHIM will join a team of museums (InvertNet) to copy the data from the specimen labels using an efficient process in which labels are photographed and interpreted by computer. The data from every specimen will be available online, so that anyone can access the collection remotely for research or education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insects are major pests of humanity, affecting agriculture, forestry and homes, as well as being vectors of deadly diseases. Yet some insects control pest insects and others are crucial pollinators of both agricultural crops and wild plants, which form the basis of natural communities. Hawaii has more invasive insects than any other state, and has lost many of its native insect species. UHIM is over 100 years old and houses rare specimens and unique data that allow scientists to track the invasions and disappearances of insects over time. UHIM provides essential information on the health of Hawaiian ecosystems, and guidelines for its restoration.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The University of Hawaii Insect Museum is over 100 years old and contains many irreplaceable species representing not only rare or extinct species, but also records of invasions of pest insects. These two sources of information help us understand environmental changes in Hawaii and also improve quarantine to protect against future pest invasions.&nbsp; As part of this project, the collection was transferred to a more efficient and modern storage system and the over 250,000 specimens in the University of Hawaii Insect Museum are now secure in modern storage cabinets, which protect them for future generations. Many of the specimens are irreplaceable and some are over one hundred years old, representing a very different Hawaii from the one we see today. In fact, through these old scientific samples, we are able to better understand positive and negative environmental changes over time and even guide restoration efforts which would improve resources like water quality, in addition to preserving biodiversity. Insect museum specimens are not only are crucial for understanding conservation challenges and environmental changes in Hawaii, but also for tracking the spread of invasive pests and developing effective control and quarantine procedures to safeguard the future.</p> <p>A second major goal of the project was the digitization of the specimens, and their data labels, to make all the information easily and freely accessible through a variety of web portals.&nbsp; In this way, both scientists and the public can view the holdings of the Museum remotely, and through very high quality images. Over 20 students were employed in the museum helping to digitize the data held by the insect specimens and these data are now available through the Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network (http://symbiota4.acis.ufl.edu/scan/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=50).</p> <p>These undergraduate and graduate students also assisted in free tours which we have provided for hundreds of schoolchildren and the general public, giving our workers experience interpreting science for the public, and giving the public a better understanding of the importance and utility of research museums.&nbsp; Over 120,000 specimens have already been photographed, including all their data, and uploaded onto freely accessible databases for public use.&nbsp; Among the student workers were 10 women and 10 minorities in science, bringing diversity to our program.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/10/2016<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;Rubinoff</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203509/1203509_10182546_1470876616326_UHIMtouruseforNSFreport--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203509/1203509_10182546_1470876616326_UHIMtouruseforNSFreport--rgov-800width.jpg" title="UHIM tour for kids"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203509/1203509_10182546_1470876616326_UHIMtouruseforNSFreport--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="UHIM tour for kids"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Our Museum Mascot, 'Buzz' the fruit fly, gives a tour to visiting schoolchildren at the Uh Insect Museum</div> <div class="imageCredit">Museum Staff</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;Rubinoff</div> <div class="imageTitle">UHIM tour for kids</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203509/1203509_10182546_1470876725991_Bradgivingtour--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203509/1203509_10182546_1470876725991_Bradgivingtour--rgov-800width.jpg" title="UHIM Tour for university students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203509/1203509_10182546_1470876725991_Bradgivingtour--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="UHIM Tour for university students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Museum Staff giving a Museum tour for College Students.
