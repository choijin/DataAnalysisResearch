<AbstractNarration>The development of sustainable and renewable energy supplies represents one of society's greatest challenges.  Biofuels are widely regarded a key component of a new energy economy. The future production of fuels, chemicals and products from biomass will require a complex series of integrated chemical conversion steps ('biorefining').  This REU Site Program engages students in cutting-edge research for the production and conversions compounds that are of importance in biorefining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional focus of this REU site program is integration, both across academic disciplines and across four different institutions in close proximity.  Participant interaction with researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) [central (host) institution], Colorado State University (CSU), Colorado School of Mines (Mines), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provides unique exposure to science and engineering careers. These institutions have partnered to form the Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels (C2B2): a cooperative research and educational collaboration devoted to the conversion of biomass to fuels and other products. As a result of interacting in this dynamic 'virtual center' environment, students exit the site program equipped with an understanding of university, federal, and industry research partnerships. Moreover, during the summer program participants from various disciplines must collaborate to find science- and engineering-based solutions to challenges faced by renewable energy technologies. Students gain first-hand experience in interdisciplinary research and development problem-solving techniques and work together to create meaningful progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A principal objective of this site program is to encourage promising diverse students, particularly women, underrepresented minorities, and students from primarily undergraduate institutions, to pursue careers in engineering and science research. Today's undergraduate students are fueled by the motivation to make a difference in the world.  This program is specifically designed to attract participants from populations traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering and simultaneously reflect the cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional nature of modern research, especially in renewable and sustainable energy. This program introduces participants to the professions of scientific investigation and engineering. It furthermore encourages participants to complete bachelor?s degrees in pursuit of more advanced science, math, and engineering graduate education. Participants gain scientific and engineering maturity and are better prepared to enter a scientific career as a knowledgeable team contributor. It is expected that many participants will utilize this training to become the academic and commercial leaders of the next decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program."</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Colorado Center for Biorefining and Bioproducts (C2B2) NSF REU program supported 34 undergraduate students between 2014 &ndash; 2016 (Table 1).  Since C2B2 comprises the three major universities in the State of Colorado as well as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), those students had a unique opportunity to become aware of the research at these four institutions.  The program ran like a well-lubricated machine and the feedback from participants was exceptional as indicated by an annual assessment after each year &ndash; carried out by a professional assessment expert.   There were over 250 applications each year for only an average of 12 slots, until finally C2B2 elected to restrict GPA in order to reduce the number of applications.  C2B2 also accepted students with disabilities and assigned/supported assistants for those students, one disabled student received a research award and travel support to present their work at a professional society meeting.  Fourteen of the 34 REU students were females, while three were Hispanic.  Twelve of the 34 students received travel grants from C2B2, four each year, to present their work at a professional society meeting of their choice.  A number were from non-Ph.D. degree granting universities in order to provide them an opportunity to experience a research environment and to work alongside Ph.D. students who helped to provide mentoring.   The REU schedule for each of the three years is shown in Table 2.  There was an orientation to start the summer with a seminar "Overview of Biofuels" presented by one of the C2B2 faculty members.  All students had safety training and one of their five seminars during the summer was "Research Ethics &amp; Fraud" to discuss ethical research practices.  Other seminars included "Introduction to Research", "Oral Communication", and Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurial Opportunities".  There were site visits to all four C2B2 partner facilities and group lunches prior to the seminars.  Team building was stressed during the Ropes/Challenge course, there was a mountain hike (in Idaho Springs, or in Rocky Mountain National Park), a whitewater rafting trip, and some culture with the Colorado Shakespeare Festival.  The group outdoors activities were typically held on weekends and the students had the option of attending or not, but almost all did.   The REU experience was organized to be educational and fun.   At the end of the semester, all REU students presented their research in a research poster competition and the judges (mentor faculty) scored the presentation.   Typically, four of the 12 were supported to travel and present their C2B2 poster at a professional meeting of their choice.  A professional assessment was made at the end of each summer REU program in order to work to improve the program.  Tables are included for the following three goals:  Goal 1a: Students will be      involved in projects that they perceive as interesting, exciting,      enjoyable, fulfilling, and an important part of an overall research team      effort. (Table 1) Goal 2a: Program faculty      and staff will provide a well-structured program to insure that students      accomplish something of significance. (Table 2) Goal 2b: Program faculty      and staff will maintain a unique interactive structure that will      facilitate student engagement and a unified group experience across the      four REU sites. (Table 2) Goal 3a: Academic      milestones will be established to allow students opportunities to      demonstrate developing research skills  (table 3)      The following scale was used on evaluating feedback:  4.5 and up = excellent 4.0-4.49 = on target 3.5-3.99 = needs      observation less than 3.49 = needs      action      Overall, here is the evaluation summary of the results  For goal 1, C2B2 was on      target with our overall ratings with 5 of 7 criteria on target and 2      criteria rated as excellent. The highest ratings were for interesting and      satisfying projects. For goal 2a, C2B2 was on      target with our overall ratings with 5 of 7 criteria on target and 2      criteria rated as excellent. Our highest ratings were for appropriate      facilities and equipment For goal 2b, C2B2 was on      target with our overall ratings with 9 of 14 criteria on target and 4      criteria rated excellent. Excellent ratings were for the REU support      staff, the Clear Creek Rafting trip, Orientation Day, and the NREL site      visit. One criterion, site visits to the Colorado School of Mines needs      observation for a rating consistently below 4.0.  For goal 3, C2B2 results      are mixed with an on target rating for our peer presentations, an      excellent rating for our poster session and a low rating on the academic      work plan (3.45).    Overall, students rated the C2B2 NSF REU highly over all three years of the most recent funding.   These results are similar to that for the prior funding round (2011-2013).  C2B2 REU directors worked hard to make this multi-site NSF REU program a well-organized, educational and fun summer.   Many of the REUs eventually enrolled in Ph.D. programs.
