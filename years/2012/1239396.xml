<AbstractNarration>This project demonstrates the synergistic use of a cyber-physical infrastructure consisting of smart-phone devices; cloud computing, wireless communication, and intelligent transportation systems to manage vehicles in the complex urban network -- through the use of traffic controls, route advisories and road pricing -- to jointly optimize drivers' mobility and the sustainability goals of reducing energy usage and improving air quality. The system developed, MIDAS-CPS, proactively manages the interacting traffic demand and the available transportation supply. A key element of MIDAS-CPS is the data collection and display device PICT that collects each participating driver's vehicle position, forward images from the vehicle's dashboard, and communication time stamps, and then displays visualizations of predicted queues ahead, relevant road prices, and route advisories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the increasing congestion in most of the urban areas, and the rising costs of constructing traffic control facilities and implementing highway hardware, MIDAS-CPS could revolutionize the way traffic is managed on the urban network since all computing is done via clouds and the drivers instantly get in-vehicle advisories with graphical visualizations of predicted conditions. It is anticipated this would lead to improved road safety and lesser drive stress, besides the designed benefits on the environment, energy consumption, congestion mitigation, and driver mobility. This multidisciplinary project is at the cutting edge in several areas: real-time image processing, real-time traffic prediction and supply/demand management, and cloud computing. Its educational impacts include enhancements of curricula and laboratory experiences at participating universities, workforce development, and student diversity.</AbstractNarration>

Congestion Pricing Algorithms that, when predicted measures of performance such as heavy delays, emissions, etc., are not acceptable, recommend tolls/incentives and re-routing guidance to move towards more acceptable performances, where the PICT infrastructure provides the recommended congestion prices (or incentives) and parking prices to CVs and to the traffic management system; An Integrated MIDAS (Managing Interacting Demands and Supplies) Proactive Traffic Management System will utilize the interfaces with various developed algorithms, cloud/communication infrastructures, to provide proactive traffic management. It brings together data of CV?s movements via the PICT devices, and of the affected traffic systems, to provide proactive controls and advisories, to influence drivers to make better route choices, and to recommend congestion prices/incentives to effect travel demand.   The four primary investigators, Pitu Mirchandani (PI, ASU), Dijiang Huang (ASU), Baoxin Li (ASU), and Yafeng Yin (U.

In addition the four investigators gave about 10 keynotes based on the project results, several invited university seminars and conference presentations.  INTELLECTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS  The research team has broken new ground in Operations Research (OR) and Traffic Engineering (TE) and Computer Science (CS), through the development of new models and algorithms, new cloud computing approaches and new visual computing methodologies. Most importantly, the team has developed a novel architecture for the MIDAS system that indicates a promising approach for proactive traffic management. Also innovative are the PICT devices that use a Cyber-Physical Infrastructure to connect vehicles and to manage drivers through a complex urban environment.  Specific pedagogical contributions to OR and TE areas are:  (A1) Online traffic estimation and prediction algorithms that use a new mesoscopic traffic model formulated in a "Lagrangian" coordinate system, with a recursive correction module that exploits the information provided by the PICT devices.  (A2) Congestion pricing algorithms use advanced theories in games and equilibria to develop recommendations on congestion prices (or incentives), including but not limited to (a) pricing on routes, (b) pricing on links, (c) pricing for subnetworks in the region, and (d) pricing for parking.  (A3) Proactive traffic management optimization algorithms that use real-time data obtained through the MIDAS/PICT infrastructure, and predictions from area A1, to recommend (a) proactive traffic signal controls, (b) travel route advisories, and (c) and congestion prices to influence travel demand so that the resulting traffic patterns, both recurrent and non-recurrent, enhance mobility and sustainability.  Specific pedagogical contributions to CS areas are:  (A4) A  cloud-based Cyber Infrastructure, which is secure, resilient while maintaining privacy, to perform image processing, execute developed algorithms and interface with the underlying communication systems.  (A5) Visual computing algorithms that use PICT data and images to identify, in real-time, CV?s lane position and detect the current vehicle movements and densities in camera?s field of view, which are subsequently used for proactive traffic management system.  BROADER IMPACTS  The results of this work will be useful to:  State and local agencies that manage traffic to evaluate MIDAS? potential impacts to congestion, environment and sustainability. Federal and regulatory organizations that need to evaluate safety of CVs and AVs operating on the roads.   Last but not least, the OR, TE and CS results from this project have permeated into the classroom where the investigators use cases and problems based on this work.
