<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  RNA polymerase II (also called pol II) is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA (and most other forms of RNA), an important first step in gene expression. This project will elucidate key structural and functional aspects of the assembly of the Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC) of pol II and the mechanism of transcription initiation, i.e. the mechanistic steps involved in starting the transcription of a new gene. Sophisticated solution-based single-molecule fluorescence techniques, combined with microfluidics, will be applied to individual complexes in order to study how pol II assembles at a promoter (gene start site) and how it performs its catalytic function. Because single-molecule approaches remove ensemble and temporal averaging, information about the order and the kinetics of assembly will be unraveled. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The "nano-biotechnology revolution" and the emergence of single molecule biophysics and super-resolution imaging have opened up tremendous opportunities in the investigation of processes that define life. One such process, fundamental to the "Central Dogma of Biology," is transcription. The approach for studying this basic process to be taken in this research could break conceptual and practical barriers that have hindered progress, and offers potential to catalyze discovery in many new ways. The tools and methods to be developed, as well as the general approaches pursued, will have greatest impact if distributed to a broad audience of receptive and innovative young scientists. Through educational and outreach programs, the project will expose a young audience (high school and college students), as well as more mature scientists, to novel research tools and methodologies that could be used to study many other biological processes and molecular machines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has focused on the regulation of gene expression (a.k.a. transcription), which is fundamentally important for all biological processes (e.g. human development, immune response, growth).  As part of a collaborative team of researchers at UCLA and the Univeristy of Colorado-Boulder, we have leveraged innovative ideas with traditional and cutting-edge approaches to make new discoveries about how transcription is regulated.  Among the high-impact findings was the identification and characterization of a new regulatory intermediate in RNA polymerase transcription initiation and establishing that a protein complex called TFIID is required for a universal (i.e. genome-wide) transcription regulatory checkpoint.  New methods and technological advances were also supported by this NSF award.    Because of the basic importance of transcription, these discoveries have not only advanced understanding, they have also informed about potential new strategies to control or manipulate transcription that may yield therapeutic or industrial benefits.  Throughout the project, high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, and professors (Principal Investigators) have worked together toward project goals.  This team effort has delivered in tangible and intangible ways.  In all, 20 scientific papers have been published (as of June, 2019) from NSF support of this project, and it provided research opportunities for 16 undergraduate students (many who have continued toward advanced degrees), 5 graduate students and 3 postdocs (who have gone on to become productive scientists in academia or industry), and 8 high school students. Collectively, this contributes to a capable and talented workforce that maintains American competitiveness.          Last Modified: 06/22/2019       Submitted by: Dylan J Taatjes]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
