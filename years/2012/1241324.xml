<AbstractNarration>While there has been considerable evidence of the utility of social media to enable high levels of collaboration and communication among distributed and diverse scientific communities, there is very little empirical evidence about the utility of social media to help individuals find the right people to connect with in these communities.  Connecting with the right individuals is particularly catalytic in creating large scale innovation and acceptance of global issues such as sustainable development which transcends geography, culture and disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to apply the insights gained from an NSF VOSS project (at Northwestern University) investigating what motivates the formation of effective networks in virtual organizations to enhance mentoring practices in the NSF SEES project (anchored at Colorado State University) developing the Global Women Scholars Network (GWSN).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our goal is to implement and evaluate the utilization and outcome of a social recommender system that will seek to enhance cross-mentoring of grassroots women with academics, policy leaders and students in the globally-scaled knowledge network for sustainability.  We take a risky step in testing the hypothesIs that social network recommender systems are an effective way to address the lingering gap between women and men in the sciences and policy decision-making associated with sustainable development. We posit that social recommender systems create a knowledge network cloud that merges across cultural, geographic, and institutional gaps (grassroots to academic, women to students, and policy makers to graduate students).  Such a cloud network is one way that can make a transformational change in how science is communicated and who is engaged in that communication.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Social networks generate energy and passion that can lead to societal change at alarming speeds. Flash mobs and tweets have overthrown governments and created new ways of shopping, but how can we use such energy for science? While there has been considerable evidence of the utility of social media to enable high levels of collaboration and communication among distributed and diverse scientific communities, there is very little empirical evidence about the utility of social media to help individuals find the righ people to connect with in these communities. Connecting with the right individuals is particularly catalytic in creating large scale innovation and acceptance of global issues such as sustainable development which transcends geography, culture and disciplines.  The goals if this project were to implement and evaluate the utilization and outcome of a social recommender system that could enhance the cross-mentoring of grassroots women with academics, policy leaders and students in the globally-scaled knowledge network for sustainability. A secondary goal was to study the impacts of assembly factors and prior relations on team formations as well as the relation development in teams.  The study resulted in the development of three recommender systems to assist with strengthening one's social network and with the formation of teams: 1) C-IKNOW Semantic Recommender, 2) C-IKNOW VIVO Recommender, and 3) C-IKNOW MyDreamTeam Recommender. The Semantic Recommender creates recommendations for individuals seeking to strengthen their personal network (e.g. a female scholar looking for collaborators on grant proposals). This semantic recommender uses bibliometric network data on co-authorship, co-citation and citation among network members to compute customized recommendations for users in response to a specific query. The VIVO Recommender and MyDreamTeam Recommender help with the building of teams (e.g. students needing to assemble a project team). In this recommender system the users take a network survey which is being used to generate recommendations regarding team membership.   The results of four (completed) user studies of the team recommender tool focusing on the workings of the tool suggest that modalities of assembling teams changes the information individuals attend to. Data-driven assembly through the tool allows members to consider deep level characteristics such as intercultural sensitivity, and while self-organization augments some types of homophily (e.g. age) it eliminates others (e.g. gender). The relational effect is just as important, if not more, than compositional factors - prior relations appear to be an important aspect of team assembly. In terms of team functioning we found that the effects of individual characteristics on team functioning are more visible at the relational and dyad level, and additionally, self organization improves communication and efficacy.  The findings of this project will have a significant impact in several ways. First, the recommender systems developed allow for the strengthening of networks within communities. Second, the results of the study aid in further developing the Global Women Scholars Network (GWSN), and in creating more productive teams for the Rocky Mountain Sustainability and Science Network Summer Academy (RMSSN). Furthermore, the success of many disciplines is based on, to some extent, the formation of high-functioning teams. With a better understanding of how to form such high performing teams, innovative research and scientific collaboration can excel across the discipline.
