<AbstractNarration>As part of the larger CONTRAST (Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics) measurement campaign, which has the main objective of measuring the transport of reactive chemical species into the topical Tropopause Transition Layer (TTL) over the western Pacific warm pool, University of Colorado-Boulder researchers seek to measure the column abundances of a number of trace halogen compounds e.g., bromine oxide (BrO), iodine oxide (IO), chlorine dioxide (OClO) along with other trace gas species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During northern winter, surface tropospheric air masses containing these reactive gases may be preferentially transported by intense tropical convection high into the TTL lower stratosphere over the region of the Pacific warm pool. Here they may impact the chemistry of the lower stratosphere, including its ozone chemistry. The unique low-ozone environments in the upper troposphere are expected to result in very small levels of OH radicals, which can be expected to increase the lifetime of reactive gases whose main loss is through hydroxyl (OH) radical oxidation. The simultaneous occurrence of deep convection and prolonged lifetime of organic compounds in the TTL can have significant impact on the stratospheric halogen budget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The timing of the CONTRAST experiment has been designed to take advantage of collaborations with two international airborne studies planned for the same time and geographic location. These are the NASA EV1 project ATTREX (Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment) and the European CAST (Coordinated Airborne Studies in the Tropics). With complementary instrument payloads, coordinated flights of the NSF GV, the NASA Global Hawk and the UK BAE146 will provide an unprecedented examination of the full atmospheric column, from surface to &gt;19 km, in the Tropical Western Pacific.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tropospheric chemistry of halogens (bromine and iodine) over tropical oceans modifies ozone, oxidative capacity and atmospheric aerosols, which affect clouds and Earth albedo. Measurements at tropical latitudes are particularly relevant, because ~75% of the global ozone and methane, two important greenhouse gases are chemically oxidized in the tropics. Ocean emissions of organohalogens, sea-salt and stratosphere-troposphere exchange modify the abundance of tropospheric bromine monoxide (BrO) and iodine monoxide (IO), which undergo catalytical reaction cycles to modify ozone, HOx radical abundances, and atmospheric mercury. However, atmospheric models remain largely untested due to the extremely sparse measurements of vertically resolved measurements of BrO and IO in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). Our understanding of how marine sources of biogenic gases, pollution, and the processes that control transport affect the atmospheric composition within the UTLS is currently not well understood.   We have deployed the CU AMAX-DOAS instrument aboard the NSF/NCAR GV aircraft and succeeded to measure vertical profiles of BrO (and IO) for the first time in the UTLS over the Western Pacific ocean. These measurements were conducted in conjunction with other measurements of inorganic and organic species conducted as part of the CONTRAST field campaign (CONvective TRansport of Active Species in the Tropics, Jan/Feb 2014). The DOAS measurements on the NSF/NCAR GV find ~10 pptv inorganic bromine (Bry) in the marine boundary layer over the Western Pacific ocean, and 3-5 pptv Bry in the UTLS. We have further succeeded with the first detection of IO from aircraft in the lower stratosphere. Our measuremens show that over the tropical Western Pacific Ocean rapid convective transport injects boundary layer air with elevated Bry high into the free troposphere, and a fraction of that air even can reach the stratosphere. The UTLS is particularly relevant to climate discussions.                Last Modified: 04/12/2016       Submitted by: Rainer M Volkamer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
