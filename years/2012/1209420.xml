<AbstractNarration>Vasseur&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1209420&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator addresses the qualitative properties of solutions to the Navier-Stokes, Euler, quasi-geostrophic, and other important equations in fluid dynamics.  He studies nonlinear problems from meteorology, oceanography, and fluid mechanics, using state of the art mathematical methods from analysis and the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations.  He continues his investigation of regularity theory in 3D fluid mechanics.  A particular emphasis is the consequences of the non-conservation of circulation for the Navier-Stokes equation compared to the Euler equation.  Fractional diffusion operators are crucial to model turbulent motion of passive or active scalars, or hysteresis phenomena (with memory).  He develops a systematic study of this family of equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator focuses on mathematical models involved in fluid mechanics.  The Navier-Stokes and Euler equations are fundamental systems to study the dynamics of fluids.  The understanding of behavior of the solutions is of fundamental importance in engineering, meteorology, medicine, and oceanography.  When tracking the behavior of atmospheric phenomena, crucial for the study of climate change, those equations prove too complex for analytical treatment.  The quasi-geostrophic equation is a simplified equation, derived from the fundamental equations, that still captures important dynamics at large scales of the flow.  The investigator undertakes a systematic study of this important equation, which is commonly used in oceanography.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was dedicated to the mathematical study of equations applied to oceanography, climatology  and classical fluid mechanics.   In a first part, a systematic study of the quasigeostrophic equation was performed.  This model is widely used in the study of meteorology and climate on large time scales.  The project brought the theory of the 3D model on par with what was known before only for the simplified 2D so-called surface quasigeostrophic equation.  In a second part, global solutions in time to viscous compressible fluids with degenerate viscosities have been constructed. This includes the viscous shallow water equation. This work solved a question proposed as an open problem almost twenty years ago.  The stability of shocks has been revisited. Tidal bores are typical examples of shocks. Our stability theory can handle large perturbations. It is based on   a notion of contraction for a certain nonhomogenuous pseudo-norm.  Finally, the theory of regularity for nonlocal operators -common in the study of weak turbulence- has been extended to nonlocal operators in time. They include models with memory, known as hysteresis.  The project has involved several PhD students and Postdocs. It fostered opportunities to train young mathematicians in state of the art mathematical tools for the study of partial differential equations modeling fluid mechanics.
