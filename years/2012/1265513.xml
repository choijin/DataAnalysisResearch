<AbstractNarration>Generic pharmaceuticals are considered biochemical copies of brand-name drugs and have become an important component of contemporary scientific innovation and policy. As the market for generic substitutes has grown--from only 10% of the American pharmaceutical market in 1960 to nearly 80% by 2010--so too have technical and political conflicts over whether generics are truly "the same thing" as their brand-name counterparts. Indeed, generic drugs are never fully identical to their original counterparts; rather, their identity as generic resides in being similar in the particular ways that regulators and scientists think matter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Scholar's Award, funded by the STS program and the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, will support Jeremy Greene, a physician-historian with ethnographic training, as he tracks the emergence of scientific and policy definitions of biochemical equivalence in the late 20th century and early 21st century. Using archival data, analysis of scientific publications, and in-depth interviews, Greene will trace how the question: "when are two medicines the same?" generates different answers depending on the method and discipline from which it is asked. For example, people (at different times and in different countries) have used innovations in chemistry, biology, engineering, and management science to either argue for or contest the similarity of generic pharmaceuticals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to social scientific studies of science policy and regulation as well as the history of science and innovation. A close examination of how generics are defined over time and across countries reveals how different stakeholders promote and contest various ways of defining biochemical equivalence. Grappling with the problems of equivalence and interchangeability also demonstrates how specialization shapes the generalizability of scientific knowledge and the cultural and scientific assumptions that help produce science policy.</AbstractNarration>

For example, people (at different times and in different countries) have used innovations in chemistry, biology, engineering, and management science to either argue for or contest the similarity of generic pharmaceuticals.   Key findings of this project include:  exploration, using archival materials from the World Health Organization and the American Medical Association, of the process by which the modern system of generic drug names was created  reconstruction, using archives of communication between the Food and Drug Administration and the companies that became the early generic drug industry, of the formation of the generic drug market in the United States  analysis, using materials from the archives of the American Pharmaceutical Association and the United States Pharmacopoeial Convention Archives, in concert with clinical and popular literature, of the pronounced disputes over the equivalence of generic and brand-name drugs in the period from the 1960s to the 1980s.  examination, using materials from the New York State Generic Drug Investigation Files, of the local and national legal battles over who had the right to substitute generic for brand-name drugs--the pharmacist, the consumer, the physician, or the state&mdash;during a period of extensive legislative change from the 1960s through the 1980s.  extension of the analysis of scientific, professional, and legal contests over the exchangeability of drugs within the same therapeutic molecule (generic substitution) into more recent disputes over the exchangeability of drugs within the same therapeutic class (therapeutic substitution) and the complexities of the globalized generic market of the 21st century. Research has revealed very different practices of therapeutic substitution between private payors and public payors, and illuminated the processes by which generic drugs can become vulnerable to price hikes and shortages.  The principal outcome of this project was the publication of a scholarly monograph, Generic: The Unbranding of Modern Medicine (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2014), which has seen rapid uptake in the fields of history, sociology, and anthropology of science, technology and medicine, as well as extensive coverage on National Public Radio and other loci for popular discussions of science and society.  Secondary outcomes of this project include the publication of a number of articles in scholarly = journals, dissemination of results in a series of national and international conferences, publications in prominent medical journals including the New England Journal of Medicine, popular periodicals including Forbes, Slate, and The Atlantic, as well as the publication of a new edited book by Wiley-Blackwell early in 2015 called The Pharmaceutical Studies Reader, co-edited...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
