<AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation project from Northern Arizona University (NAU) uses a commercially available, state-of-the-art, powered foot-ankle prosthesis (the iWalk BioM) as a research platform to develop and test a new theory (the 'winding filament' theory) of how muscles work, with the goal of emulating biological actuation in man-made devices. The project integrates biological inspiration and engineering expertise within a business and economic development context. To achieve these goals, engineers at iWalk will modify a prosthesis prototype so that the winding filament model can be integrated into the existing control software. At NAU, engineers will code the winding filament model to fit the required architecture. The modified prosthesis will be provided to engineers at NAU and Electric Torque Machines, a business that will install the algorithms in the prosthesis. Once the new algorithms are installed, three participants with amputation will wear the prosthesis in a series of experiments designed to compare the kinematics, kinetics, energetics and adaptability of walking with the conventional vs. the modified prosthesis. The competitive landscape in powered prosthetic devices will be analyzed and a commercialization strategy will be developed. If the project is successful, the winding filament model will become a market-accepted innovation for controlling a wide range of powered devices, including prostheses, exoskeletons, and robots. The project will also further the understanding of control principles involved in muscle-like actuation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research will enhance the innovation and economic competitiveness of the knowledge enhancement partner (KEP) companies by developing new control algorithms for controlling prosthetic and other devices, including exoskeletons and robots. The innovations have the potential to improve the quality of life for millions of disabled Americans. The long-term goal is to design robotic muscles that, like human muscles, will adapt instantaneously and automatically to changes in the loading environment during operation. This academe/business collaboration will stimulate the technology-based business environment that is growing around NAU's academic community. The project will provide interdisciplinary training in biology, engineering, and business for undergraduate and graduate students and educational advancement for professional engineers. The project has the potential transform the understanding of muscle function and human motor control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are NAU (Departments of Mechanical Engineering and of Biological Sciences and Office of the VP for Research), iWalk, Inc. (Bedford, MA), Electric Torque Machines (ETM), Inc. (Flagstaff, AZ), and NAU Ventures (Flagstaff, AZ). Each of the partners brings significant expertise and experience to the collaborative effort. The iWalk BioM prosthesis represents the state-of-the-art in prosthesis design to emulate the function of the human foot-ankle, with several patents for innovative technology. ETM has a proven track record of commercializing novel motors and controllers featuring unique but practical architectures and designs, with significant improvements in efficiency and high continuous torque. NAU has patented a linear actuator inspired by basic research on how muscles work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The transformative winding filament hypothesis for muscle contraction, developed with funding from NSF, has important implications for understanding muscle physiology and motor control, as well as for improving robotic assistive devices in general. This research has demonstrated the ability to use algorithms that utilize this hypothesis to provide control of a robotic, foot-ankle prosthesis.   The hypothesis-based muscle control model, in combination with a musculoskeletal system framework, has shown a robust capability to allow for varied terrain applications beyond the level walking environment.  This capability shows tremendous promise, given that current control methods for the powered prosthesis market show limited ability to conduct realistic human gait control for environments other than level walking.  Figure 1, attached, demonstrates the winding filament muscle groups (approximated as one anterior and one posterior for ankle control) exerting control over time to produce appropriate ankle toque during a level walking simulation.   This simulation was based upon results from actual experiments with a particular subject using the robotic prosthesis.  Figure 2 illustrates experimental results from controlling the robotic prosthesis, used by a subject, during stair ascension.  The results, though preliminary and with an early control software version, show similar commanded torque results to that of published healthy ankle torque data for stair ascent.  The research provided a baseline for single joint, lower-limb control exploration.  Future research has already been proposed to expand the bio-inspired control approach to lower body dynamics.  A research proposal has been submitted jointly with Ekso Bionics to provide active actuation to both ankles of their exoskeleton platform, in order to explore leg coordination in standing balance, level walking, and ambulation over complex terrain. Testing the ability of the control algorithm based on the winding filament hypothesis to achieve robust control of leg coordination in these tasks will improve our understanding of human motor control. In the long term, exoskeletons also provide the opportunity to test the new bioinspired control approach in multi-joint coordination of active ankle, knee, and hip actuation.  Broader Impacts:   This research has potential to improve our understanding of improved neuro-musculoskeletal models as applied wide applications in biomechanics.  The results will inspire the design of a new generation of actuators and prostheses that have the potential to possess the adaptability and energy efficiency displayed by animal muscles.    Future research has the potential to apply the research technological advances to exoskeletal control.  In the U.S. today, approximately 5.6 million persons live with mobility impairment. Despite the success of the latest technological improvements, significant challenges remain in the development of robotic assistive devices. No exoskeletons available on the market today have ankle actuation or the stability and robustness required for high function in the home setting.

Benefits of a robust exoskeleton with ankle actuation include improved standing postural balance, increased speed of walking, and improved maneuvering over varied terrain. The application of the bio-inspired control algorithms, developed from this research, will potentially expand the exoskeleton market from the clinical setting to the home.   This research has demonstrated the advantages of data streaming and appropriate analysis of the data with the use of robotic prosthesis devices.  Traditional methods of human gait analysis involves synchronizing fast-motion video of a subject with force plate results during walking.  The resulting inverse dynamic analyses produced theoretical torque and kinematic...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
