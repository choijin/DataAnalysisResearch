<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for early career scientists and graduate students to participate in the CCAPP Workshop "Radio Simulations for Neutrino and Cosmic Ray Detectors" to be held February 22nd - 24th, 2012 at the Center for Cosmology and Astro-Particle Physics (CCAPP) at The Ohio State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has two major aims: 1) educating young researchers on developing simulations for neutrino and cosmic ray experiments that use the radio Cerenkov or geosynchotron detection techniques and 2) coming to a consensus on simulation strategies for radio experiments. This will reduce systematic uncertainties and improve the sensitivity of these experiments to the highest energy cosmic messengers. The success of the workshop will rely on the active participation of both young scientists and the world's top experts in these areas of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. A major goal of this workshop is to educate young researchers and further their impact on the science of the projects. Simulation work is an excellent way for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs to learn about both the physics and instrumentation aspects of the experiments and make important contributions to the projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In February 2012, Connolly organized a workshop with the Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP) at The Ohio State University on ``Radio Simulations for Neutrino and Cosmic Ray Experiments'' and was awarded $5k from NSF towards travel for young US researchers.   The goals of the workshop were 1) to educate young researchers on modeling radio emission for cosmic ray and neutrino experiments and 2) to bring together the world's experts in the field to make the first direct comparison of the models for radio emission from showers initiated by cosmic rays and neutrinos.  To address the first of these two goals, the workshop had a strong educational component, including a day of review talks by the world's top experts aimed at a student level.   To address the second goal, for the first time the six major simulations of the geomagnetic emission from cosmic ray showers were directly compared by putting simulated signal emission properties on the same plots.  Also for the first time the complete list of all key features in each of the simulations were tabulated.  The workshop had other unexpected positive impacts on the field.  The community agreed on the best technique to model the radio pulses, known as the semi-analytical modeling approach, for the best compromise between speed and accuracy for simulations of large event samples.  Also, the world's leaders on the topic agreed to change the name  ``Geosynchotron'' to ``Geomagnetic'' due a maturity in understanding of the nature of the radiation over the past decade.   The results from this workshop, including presentations, the table of simulation properties, and comparison plots, have been posted on the web at http://ccapp/workshops/RadioSim/workshop.html.  The workshop also paved the way for a second round of comparisons which were presented at the ``Acoustic and Radio EeV Neutrino Detection Activities'' (ARENA) conference in Erlangen, Germany in June 2012.  Connolly's workshop has led to tangible improvements in the depth of  understanding of the modeling of radio emissions, and improvements in  both their accuracy and speed.  These results are crucial for interpreting measurements of radio emission in both neutrino and cosmic ray experiments.  The NSF funding was leveraged with funds from CCAPP, the OSU Physics Department and Connolly's startup funds.  The NSF funding went towards flights for two postdocs and six students from the US.  Connolly successfully sought attendees from underrepresented groups.  The workshop participants included all of the key modelers and simulation developers in these fields from around the globe.
