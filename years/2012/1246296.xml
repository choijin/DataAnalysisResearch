<AbstractNarration>Ocean acidification (OA) poses a serious threat, particularly to organisms that precipitate calcium carbonate from seawater. One organism with an aragonite shell that is a key to high latitude ecosystems is the pteropod. With OA, the pteropod shell will thin because the aragonite is highly soluble. As the shell thins, it changes the mass distribution and buoyancy of the animal, which will affect locomotion and through it, all locomotion dependent behavior such as foraging, mating, predator avoidance and migratory patterns. A lower shell weight will be counterbalanced by a smaller mucus web potentially decreasing ingestion rates and carbon flux rates. This interdisciplinary research relies on biological studies of swimming behavior of the pteropod mollusk Limacina helicina in their natural environments with fluid mechanics analyses of swimming hydrodynamics via 3D tomographic particle-image velocimetry and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This work will: (a) determine how the L. helicina uses its ?wings? (parapodia) to propel itself; (b) examine whether its locomotory kinematics provide efficient propulsion; (c) identify the factors that influence swimming trajectory and ?wobble?; and (d) synthesize all data and insights into guidelines for the potential use of pteropod swimming behavior as a bioassay for OA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The loss of these sentinels of anthropogenic increases in CO2 may result in an ecological shift since thecosome pteropods are responsible for ingesting nearly half the primary production in the Southern Ocean and also serve as a primary food resource to upper trophic levels like fish. Since locomotory data can be gathered immediately, the bioassay being developed in this proposal may serve as an early warning of the impending onset of OA effects on this important member of the plankton. Students and researchers will collaborate in a rich interdisciplinary research environment by working with a biological oceanographer, a fluid mechanics expert and a CFD expert ? coupled with the teamsmanship needed for work in the Antarctic. By setting up a one-of-a-kind 3D tomography system for visualizing flow around planktonic organisms in Norway and at Palmer Station, we increase international exchange of state-of-the-art techniques. The educational impact of the current research will be multiplied by including in the research team, undergraduate students, high-school students and underrepresented minorities in addition to graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is expected that ocean acidification (OA) will result in a lowering of calcium carbonate levels that will be widespread by 2050.  Ocean acidification poses a serious threat to many organisms but particularly to the pteropod, a shelled marine snail that is a few millimeters in size and uses the calcium carbonate from seawater to create its shell. For example, our measurements show that two species of pteropods, L. helicina and L. helicina antarctica, uniquely employ lift-based swimming instead of drag-based swimming used by nearly all zooplankton.  In lift-based swimming the pteropod "flies" underwater by stroking its parapodia (i.e., "wings") in much the same way that tiny insects, such as thrips and fruit flies, fly in the air. The wing kinematic pattern is uniquely facilitated by the pteropod?s extreme rotation of their shell.  However, this complex combination of body kinematics is significantly altered by the thinning of the pteropod shell, indicating the detrimental effects of ocean acidification.  The loss of pteropods as a result of increases in CO2 may cause an ecological shift because pteropods are responsible for ingesting nearly half the primary production (i.e., organic food) in the Southern Ocean and also serve as a primary food resource to larger marine organisms.  In addition to the scientific results described above, the project delivered a major technological advance by deploying a portable state-of-the-art tomographic system at Palmer Station in Antarctica to measure the three-dimensional flow field surrounding the Southern Ocean species.  This new system was required because these organisms are very delicate, which prevented transporting them to labs outside of Antarctica.  Our Journal of Experimental Biology paper published in February 2016 received enormous media attention due to our comparison of similarities between the marine pteropods and the airborne insects ("flying" through the ocean vs. flying through the air).  The paper has one of the highest Altmetric score ever recorded for a Journal of Experimental Biology paper and appeared in over 80 media articles.  The New York Times, in particular, made a video that serves as an effective outreach mechanism to an audience beyond the science and technology community.
