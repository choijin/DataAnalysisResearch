<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division. It supports theoretical research and education related to the nonequilibrium behavior of small systems, from biomolecular complexes to artificial molecular machines.  The primary aim of the research is to advance basic understanding of the laws of thermodynamics and how they apply to nanoscale systems, where fluctuations are important and unavoidable.  The PI's approach will include exact analysis of tractable models, theoretical and numerical modeling of systems studied experimentally, and the formulation of general principles.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two central questions to be addressed are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) What fundamental constraints does statistical thermodynamics impose on the processing of information by molecular-level systems?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) What are the principles by which the directed motion of artificial molecular machines can be generated and controlled by the variation of macroscopic external parameters?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first question is motivated both by the reality that biomolecular systems do perform information-processing tasks, and artificial molecular machines are beginning to show this capability.  The PI will develop models that capture essential features of information processing by autonomous molecular systems, while remaining accessible to exact analysis or numerical simulation.  By exposing explicit, transparent mechanisms of operation, such models will offer simple paradigms for investigating the thermodynamics of information processing in situations where thermal fluctuations dominate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in the second question was originally motivated by experiments involving the manipulation of ring-like molecules, catenanes, by the variation of external stimuli. The aim is a systematic control theory for artificial molecular machines in the presence of substantial thermal noise.  The PI will approach this problem within the general theoretical framework of stochastic pumps, in which a system makes random transitions among a network of discrete states, with time-dependent transition rates.  Here the topology of the network plays an important role in the analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports graduate student and postdoctoral level training in the methods of theoretical and computational statistical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division. It supports theoretical research and education on biomolecular systems and materials far from the steady state of equilibrium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nature teaches us that small systems such as individual molecules and molecular complexes are capable of exhibiting a rich diversity of dynamical behavior.   Prime evidence of this diversity is found in the biomolecular machines that perform the numerous and often sophisticated tasks required to maintain life: they harness energy, convert it from one form to another, and faithfully copy and translate genetic information.  In recent years there has been growing interest and progress not only in understanding the details of how biological molecules accomplish these tasks, but also in synthesizing artificial molecular machines that mimic such capabilities.  This award supports theoretical research and teaching that aims to uncover and clarify the basic physical laws that govern these phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will develop a better understanding of the means by which nanoscale systems are able to perform tasks that involve the processing of information, as occurs in the replication and repair of DNA.  A deeper understanding of the thermodynamics of information processing will suggest strategies for the synthesis and improvement of programmable artificial molecular machines.  The PI will also analyze how microscopic systems respond to time-dependent variations in temperature, chemical conditions and laser light.  This research aims to advance the ability to manipulate events on the scale of molecules in a controlled manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities funded by this award will prepare graduate students and postdocs for the challenges of research in rapidly evolving topics at the intersection of physics, chemistry and biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The laws of thermodynamics were originally formulated to describe the behavior of macroscopic systems such as steam engines.  In this project, we explored how these laws are modified when they are instead applied to nanoscale systems, such as the biomolecular machines that are found in the cells of every living organism, as well as artificial nanoscale machines that may become integral components of future technology.  Two broad questions that we investigated were:  (1) What fundamental constraints does thermodynamics impose on the ability of nanoscale systems to process information?  (2) What are the principles by which we can control the motion of artificial molecular machines by means of external variables?  In approaching both these questions, we focused on uncovering and clarifying general principles rather than on the study of specific systems realized in laboratories.  Our aim was to provide conceptual insights and mathematical frameworks for understanding thermodynamics at the nanoscale.  With respect to the first question, we have introduced and studied several model systems whose behavior can be analyzed exactly.  These model systems behave in a manner reminiscent of Maxwell's demon, the hypothetical creature who is able to "beat" the second law of thermodynamics by gathering and acting upon information about the motions of individual atoms and molecules.  In our model sytems, the ethereal demon is replaced by a device that is entirely subject to the laws of physics.  These models reveal, by construction, precisely how a purely physical system can behave in the manner of Maxwell's imagined demon, and they confirm the constraints on such a device anticipated in earlier theoretical work by Landauer, Bennett and Penrose.  We have also developed a general mathematical framework, grounded in the laws of classical physics, for understanding the thermodynamics of a system that exchanges not only energy (in the form of heat and work) but also information, with its surroundings.  With respect to the second question, we have contributed to a relatively new topic known as shortcuts to adiabaticity.  It is known that there are benefits to manipulating a system very slowly (adiabatically), and these benefits have potential applications to fields such as quantum computing and the control of Bose-Einstein condensates.  The aim of shortcuts to adiabaticity is to achieve the same benefits even when the system is manipulated rapidly.  This topic has been studied mostly within the laws of quantum physics, but we have developed an approach that takes advantage of the laws of classical physics.  In particular, we have shown that the task of solving for a quantum shortcut is often greatly simplified by solving first for the corresponding classical shortcut.  We have demonstrated the validity of this approach on model systems, as well as for a broad class of systems that undergo so-called scale-invariant driving.  Our results have added a new set of theoretical tools to the toolkit available for controling the behavior of microscopic systems.
