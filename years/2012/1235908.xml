<AbstractNarration>1235908&lt;br/&gt;PI: Sankaran&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When granular materials flow, the particles rub against each other and can become electrostatically charged.  The charging of particles causes several problems, such as disrupting the flow or even initiating explosions.  While ?triboelectric charging? is one of the most well-known areas of science --  everyone notices it when they walk across a rug and get a shock as they touch a doorknob, or when they rub a balloon on their hair and see how the balloon and hair become charged -- its scientific basis is in essence completely unknown. For example, it is not clear whether the species transferred between surfaces are electrons, ions, or bits of material.  This project will take a rational approach to understanding triboelectric charging in granular materials by developing simple model systems that focus on fundamental questions ? these model systems include granular materials with particular properties and special flow geometries, and bulk materials rubbed in controlled geometries to more simply address issues relevant to granular systems.  Our investigation will consist of three thrusts: (1) particle flow experiments with specially chosen particles and flow patterns, (2) asymmetric rubbing experiments as a model for polydispersity effects in granular materials, and (3) experiments with well-defined material surfaces that can be compared with theory/simulation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our experiments will elucidate several key questions, including what type of species (e.g., electron, ion, or bits of material) are transferred during the charging process, what is the role of the particle size distribution in the charging of granular materials, and how does humidity (i.e. water adsorption on surfaces) influence charge transfer.  By understanding triboelectric charging from a fundamental perspective, our work may help scientists and engineers working in industry address problems related to this pervasive issue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Triboelectric charging is the phenomenon that even children are aware of when they rub balloons on their hair.  It also leads to the shock that you get when you walk across a rug and touch a doorknob.  But triboelectric charging also leads to much more consequential effects, such as igniting flammable atmospheres and dusts to cause deadly explosions, creating discharges that destroy microelectronic parts, and causing particles to stick to surfaces and thereby disrupting industrial processes. Despite the fact that triboelectric charging has such major consequences, its scientific understanding is very poor.  We do not know the answers to the most basic scientific questions such as how to predict the direction of charge transfer based on material properties, why do identical materials charge each other where there is no clear driving force, what is the identity of the charge carrier (e.g. electrons, positive ions, or negative ions), and how material properties such as particle size or microstructure influence triboelectric charging.   Our investigation elucidates the scientific basis of triboelectric charging.  The following key outcomes resulted from the research activities:  1. We addressed the question of how to predict the direction of charge transfer based on material properties.  Experiments were carried out on the contact between single-crystal quartz and sapphire, which are relatively easy to model because of their well-defined surface structures.  Density functional theory calculations were also carried out.  For the first time, the triboelectric charging of materials was calculated from first principles physics and shown to be in agreement with experiments, both in terms of the charge transfer direction and the magnitude of charging.   2. We developed and tested a hypothesis that strain on a material causes a higher propensity for the materials to become charged, which we believe occurs in situations like balloons and packing peanuts. Experiments were carried out on permanently deformed polymer materials, which show that strain leads to different charge transfer behavior &ndash; deformed and undeformed samples of chemically identical materials behave just like two chemically distinct materials, in that there is systematic and reproducible charge transfer from one material to the other.  A hypothesis was put forth that changes to the microstructure in terms of voids are responsible for the distinct charging behavior.   3. Experiments and modeling were carried out on the triboelectric charging of granular materials composed of a single chemical composition.  We show a particle-size-dependent charging behavior occurs at low humidities but disappears at higher humidities (&gt;50%).  Control experiments confirm that the particles still become electrostatically charged at higher humidities, but it is only the size dependence that disappears.  A physical basis for these results is proposed: the humidity leads to the adsorption of water on the hydrophilic particles and thus a conductive surface layer, which enables charge carriers to relax to ground states on the same particle rather than transfer to other particles en route to equilibrium.
