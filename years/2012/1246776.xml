<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to continue and expand GPS and seismic for ANET-POLENET Phase 2 to advance understanding of geodynamic processes and their influence on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. ANET-POLENET science themes include: 1) determining ice mass change since the last glacial maximum, including modern ice mass balance; 2) solid earth influence on ice sheet dynamics; and 3) tectonic evolution of West Antarctica and feedbacks with ice sheet evolution. Nine new remote continuous GPS stations, to be deployed in collaboration with U.K. and Italian partners, will augment ANET-POLENET instrumentation deployed during Phase 1. Siting is designed to better constrain uplift centers predicted by GIA models and indicated by Phase 1 results. ANET-POLENET Phase 2 builds on Phase 1 scientific, technological, and logistical achievements including 1) seismic images of crust and mantle structure that resolve the highly heterogeneous thermal and viscosity structure of the Antarctic lithosphere and underlying mantle; 2) newly identified intraplate glacial, volcanic, and tectonic seismogenic processes; 3) improved estimates of intraplate vertical and horizontal crustal motions and refinement of the Antarctic GPS reference frame; and 4) elucidation of controls on glacial isostatic adjustment-induced crustal motions due to laterally varying earth structure. The PIs present a nominal plan to reduce ANET by approximately half to a longer-term community "backbone network" in the final 2 years of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Monitoring and understanding mass change and dynamic behavior of the Antarctic ice sheet using in situ GPS and seismological studies will help improve understanding of how Antarctic ice sheets respond to a warming world and how will this response impacts sea-level and other global changes. Seismic and geodetic data collected by the backbone ANET-POLENET network are openly available to the scientific community. ANET-POLENET is integral in the development and realization of technological and logistical innovations for year-round operation of instrumentation at remote polar sites, helping to advance scientifically and geographically broad studies of the polar regions. The ANET-POLENET team will establish a training initiative to mentor young polar scientists in complex, multidisciplinary and internationally collaborative research. ANET-POLENET will continue the broad public outreach to the public about polar science through the polenet.org website, university lectures, and K-12 school visits. This research involves multiple international partners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the course of this project, Penn State faculty, postdocs and grad students have been involved in all aspects of field work to support the distributed network of seismic and GPS stations that comprise the POLENET/ANET network.  Over the course of the project, the network of stations has been serviced annually, and, during the latter part of the project, reconfigured to focus more on West Antarctica.  The refocusing mainly entailed removing stations from East Antarctica, and also deploying an array of temporary seismic stations in West Antarctica.  The seismic and GPS dataset collected in this project is first-rate and will enable and support a wide range of research for many years.  The research at Penn State for this project has focused on imaging crust and upper mantle structure beneath West Antarctica.  Several approaches have been taken.   Crustal structure has been modeled, upper mantle structure has been imaged, mantle transition zone structure has been characterized, and mantle anisotropy has been investigated.  The results of the Penn State contributions to this project are contained within a number of papers that have been published, or that are in review or under preparation.  The key findings are:  1) Crustal structure.  Ramirez et al. (2016, 2017) map out first order variations in the P- and S-wave velocity structure of West Antarctica, showing a large degree of heterogeneity in crustal structure.  2) Emry et al. (2015; submitted) map variations in the thickness of the mantle transition zone and show regions of thermally perturbed upper mantle that link to lower mantle anomalies.  3) White-Gaynor et al. (2019) and Lucas et al. (submitted) image substantial amounts of heterogeneity in upper mantle structure across West Antarctica and discuss the implications of the heterogeneity for heat flow and mantle viscosity, both which affect GIA and ice sheet stability.  A significant Penn State contribution to this project has been the training a diverse graduate student cohort.  Four women and two Hispanic men have been supported and trained, and they have made significant contributions to the outcomes of the project.
