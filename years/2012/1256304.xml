<AbstractNarration>1256304 &lt;br/&gt;Lenhoff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial travel support for young researchers to attend the 17th biannual International Conference on Biopartitioning and Purification (BPP 2013), which will be held in Newport, RI, October 6-10, 2013. Award funds will be used primarily to subsidize the travel and registration fees for US students to attend the conference; similar subsidies may also be made available to US junior faculty attending the conference.  The scientific scope of the conference will include areas such as thermodynamics of phase formation and the partitioning of biological, molecular aspects of interactions between biologicals and media, multi-mode chromatographic processes, high titer processes, affinity-enhanced bioseparations, purification unit operation modeling and optimization, rational/high-throughput bioprocess design, particle/virus-like particle purification, DNA/RNA purification, and emerging bioseparation technologies.  The goal is to define the topical areas as inclusively as possible so as to attract a wide variety of relevant submissions, select those of highest quality for inclusion in the program, and then to organize the oral presentations into cohesive topical sessions.  A number of invited keynote lectures by internationally recognized leaders from both industry and academia will be invited.  Information on the conference will be made available primarily via the conference website, which is being modeled on that used for BPP 2011 (www.bpp2011.org).  The organizers will seek publication of research presented at the conference in a dedicated issue of a leading journal.  BPP 2013 represents an outstanding opportunity for students to obtain a distinctive perspective over bioseparations and bioprocessing more generally in an integrated context that is not limited to an individual unit operation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided support for student attendance at the 17th International Conference on Biopartitioning and Purification (BPP 2013), which was held in Newport, RI, from 6 to 10 October, 2013.  The conference series was established in 1979 and it remains a premier forum for research and development in bioseparations, which are essential for the successful production of safe drugs produced from biological sources.  At conferences such as these, most of the attendees are industrial practitioners or faculty at universities who do research in areas related to the topic of the conference.  However, it is highly desirable for students to have the opportunity to attend as well, for multiple reasons: to become acquainted with other research in the field, to get to know some of the leaders in the area, and to make themselves known to the community, particularly the industrial community in which many of them are likely to find employment.  BPP 2013 followed the pattern of its most recent predecessors in its attendance of order 100 registrants, its concentration in a single venue outside major urban areas and in having most or all meals included in the registration fee to maximize interactions among the attendees.  Ultimately, of the 85 registrants, fifteen were students, and the NSF funding was used to support the attendance of those from US institutions.  We also obtained industrial sponsorship that allowed international students to attend for the same reduced registration fee as US students.  Almost all the students attending made either oral or poster presentations, and the integration of the full attendee group throughout the conference period allowed excellent interactions of the students with the industrial and more senior academic attendees.  The excellent program and interactions at BPP 2013 maintained the enthusiasm of the audience for the ongoing series.  As a result, not only have the chairs for the next meeting been selected (two academic chairs from Europe and one industrial chair from the US), but the venue has already been determined for BPP 2015, namely Vienna, Austria.
