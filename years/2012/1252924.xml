<AbstractNarration>PI: Shaw, Leon&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1234976&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Connecticut&lt;br/&gt;Title: Novel Supercapacitors with Ultrahigh Energy Densities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of both electric vehicles and renewable energy requires energy storage systems that have high energy density and power density simultaneously with superior cycle life and low cost. It is well known that batteries typically provide high energy densities but with low power capacities, whereas capacitors normally have high power densities but with low energy capacities. However, for widespread market penetration of electric vehicles, particularly for plug-in hybrid vehicles and all electrical vehicles, high energy density is required for long driving distance, while high power density is needed for rapid recharge. Thus, the growing need for both high energy density and high power density cannot be met simultaneously with the existing storage technology. This project is proposed to solve these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a new generation of electrochemical capacitors, also termed supercapacitors (SCs), will be investigated and developed. Through innovative design and manufacturing of the electrode architecture, the key principles for making assembled SCs that have specific energy equivalent to those of batteries (~85 Wh/kg) while possessing ultrahigh rate performance (i.e., charging and discharging in a few minutes) will be established. These underlying principles can be applied in the future to construct SCs with even higher specific energies when the next-generation design of the electrode chemistry and nanostructure becomes available. Recent advancements in the electrode chemistry and nanostructure have revealed that SCs with high energy densities similar to those of batteries (e.g., 85 Wh/kg) are possible if the energy density is computed based on the active electrode materials alone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the high energy density based on the active electrode materials alone is very difficult to be translated into assembled devices with the similar high energy density. Assembled SCs, like Li-ion batteries, contain current collectors, electrolyte, separator, binder, connectors, and packaging, in addition to the electrodes. As a result, the energy density of an assembled device is typically lower than that of the active material by a factor of 3 to 4 or more. The proposed SCs in this project with interpenetrating positive and negative electrodes will solve this challenging problem precisely. Due to the innovative design of the electrode architecture, the thickness, width and height of electrodes can be made as large as possible until electronic conductivity becomes rate limiting. With this transformative technology, the PI will convert the high energy density based on the active electrode material into a comparable high energy density for an assembled device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact of this project will manifest in three fronts. First, the new generation SCs with unprecedented energy densities and superior rate performance are expected to revolutionize the field of energy storage and expedite the market penetration of electric vehicles and utilization of renewable energy, enabling major leaps to ensure our nation?s long-term energy security and a clean environment. Second, this project will provide excellent education and training opportunity to one graduate student and many undergraduate students in the areas of energy storage and alternative energy. Third, this project will make contributions to public education about nano-manufacturing and alternative energy.</AbstractNarration>

The overarching objective of this project is to investigate a novel concept of three-dimensional (3D) supercapacitors with 3D interpenetrating positive and negative electrodes (Figure 1). The advantage of 3D SCs over conventional SCs lies in the innovative electrode architecture having the 3D interpenetrating positive and negative electrodes that allows the electrode thickness to be as large as possible until electronic conduction becomes rate limiting. In contrast, the electrode thickness of conventional SCs is limited to about 100 micrometers because of the slow ion diffusivity issue. As a result, 3D SCs can drastically reduce the numbers of insulators, connectors and packaging materials while still having the same capacitance as conventional SCs. Because of this unique feature the energy density of 3D SCs is expected to be significantly larger than that of conventional SCs. The 3D SCs will be fabricated via a multi-material additive manufacturing method layer by layer.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit:</span></strong><strong> </strong>A multi-material, additive manufacturing machine that contains a multi-material control system, micro-extrusion nozzle assembly and syringe platform for managing and controlling micro-extrusion of two materials simultaneously has been constructed.

Slurry formulation and micro-extrusion of graphene-based slurries containing 12.5 wt% graphene/carbon black with proper pseudoplastic properties have been successfully established. Slurries with 12.5 wt% graphene/carbon black (equivalent to 6 vol% loading) have the highest graphene loading among any extrudable or printable slurries ever reported in the literature. The breakthrough made in this study is expected to drastically improve the production rate for fabricating 3D objects made of graphene in the near future.

We have also reached out beyond college students by working with ASM International Chicago Chapter for the last three years to provide introductions and lab tours to middle/high school teachers during the ASM International Summer Teacher Camps in Chicago. These middle/high school teachers have become our ambassadors to spread the impact of science and technology on society and to stimulate the interest of middle and high school students in pursuing careers involving science, engineering and technology. This summer (2016) we also worked with the Chicago Zoological Society to carry out lab tours and demonstrations, showing how batteries are fabricated to about 300 diverse middle and high school students from across the Chicago metro area as part of "Summer 2016 Teen Conservation Leadership Conference". This three-day conference has featured presentations on a variety of topics from industry experts, college professors and students as well as fellow teen&nbsp;participants of the Chicago Zoological Society's King Conservation Science program. We are glad that we can be part of this effort to promote conservation leadership and college readiness.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/17/2016<br>      Modified by: Leon&nbsp;L&nbsp;Shaw</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1252924/1252924_10185530_1479402663194_3DSupercapswithhighenergydensity--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1252924/1252924_10185530_1479402663194_3DSupercapswithhighenergydensity--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Schematic of 3D supercapacitors"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1252924/1252924_10185530_1479402663194_3DSupercapswithhighenergydensity--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Schematic of 3D supercapacitors"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: Schematic of three-dimensional (3D) supercapacitors with 3D interpenetrating positive and negative electrodes.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Leon Shaw</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Leon&nbsp;L&nbsp;Shaw</div> <div class="imageTitle">Schematic of 3D supercapacitors</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
