<AbstractNarration>The proposed research studies affine Kac-Moody algebras using Kashiwara's theory of crystals. A crystal here is a combinatorial object (a set along with some operations) associated to each highest weight representation of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra. Kashiwara's construction makes heavy use of the associated quantized universal enveloping algebra, but the crystals themselves can often be realized by other means. Some such realizations are purely combinatorial, and others use non-trivial geometry. In finite type, one realization which has generated a lot of interest uses the Mirkovic-Vilonen (MV) polytopes developed by Anderson and by Kamnitzer. Along with his collaborators, the P.I. is currently developing a version of this combinatorics for symmetric affine types, using quiver varieties. Affine MV polytopes have been sought since the finite type polytopes first appeared, so their construction is itself an important development. The P.I. will investigate the connection between these new polytopes and various algebraic and geometric structures related to affine algebras. This work may also lead to a notion of MV polytope in all (not necessarily symmetric) affine types. The proposed research also considers ways of extracting other combinatorial realizations from the geometry of quiver varieties, and develops applications of crystal theory to Macdonald polynomials and Demazure characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses important questions in the theory of affine algebras, and will be of interest to a number of people in that field. Affine algebras are important in mathematical physics, so there is potential for cross-disciplinary impact. The proposal will also fund undergraduate research projects, and more generally contribute to the training and developing of young mathematicians. There are several questions related to this research that can be studied in terms of explicit realizations of crystals. These are ideal for undergraduate research projects, as only a limited amount of background is required in order to approach the questions, yet they can provide an entry point into a rich representation-theoretic story. The proposal will also support student seminars which are designed both to train students in advanced subjects and to develop their skills as presenters. Finally, the P.I. will continue to work with programs such as math circles aimed at high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has been very successful, both in terms of intellectual merit and broader impact. We now address each in turn.     Intellectual merit:      This project produced eight papers published in journals and conference proceedings, which together amount to a significant contribution to the study of quantum groups and their relation to combinatorics and geometry.  Most of the publications were part of an effort to understand Mirkovic-Vilonen polytopes for affine Kac-Moody algebras. This goal was achieved, and in fact was achieved in three different ways. The first exploited the connection between symmetric Kac-Moody algebras and quiver varieties. The second exploited the connection between Kac-Moody algebras and Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras. The third used Lusztig's original algebraic understanding of canonical bases in terms of PBW bases, and the more recent extensions of this understanding to affine types.     Having these three points of view has allowed us to see various connections between the structures, and has led to a better understanding of the structures themselves. For instance, as a result of this project the PI was able to write a short and self contained explanation of Lusztig's canonical bases (in finite type), which completely disentangles the construction from the complicated geometry (perverse sheaves on quiver varieties) that was used in the original work. We were also able to gain new understanding of the combinatorics related to Lusztig's PBW bases in finite type, and the connection between this and more well known combinatorial constructions such as Young tableaux.     In separate but related work, we studied how to extract combinatorics from quiver varieties using torus actions. This led to a much better theoretical understanding of a crystal structure described by Matt Fayers shortly before this grant began.  Very recently it was key in helping us understand the relationship between highest weights for truncated shifted Yangians and product monomial crystals.     Broader impact:     The main broader impact of this project has been in training and development of students and young mathematicians, and in outreach with public school teachers.     In the first year of the grant, the PI co-organized and served as director of the scientific program for a three-day retreat with twelve graduate students and postdocs studying mathematics related to this proposal. This was a focused immersion in the theory of MV polytopes and other topics central to the work of this grant.     In the third year, this grant supported a workshop on the mathematical computation package SAGE, where new computer code was developed and disseminated to the community and new users and developers were introduced to the system. Some of the algorithms developed during the course of this grant were also coded in SAGE, and will shortly be available to the larger mathematical community.     This grant provided support for five undergraduate students and two maters students to pursue advanced research. Two of those students are now in PhD programs, and several more are currently applying. All received valuable training in rigorous mathematical thought as well as other crucial skills such as communication and technical writing.     While working on this project the PI also founded the Chicago Math Teachers' Circle, an outreach program with Chicago public school math teachers focused on problem solving.  The program in ongoing and steadily growing, and over 30 teachers have already participated.           Last Modified: 10/05/2016       Submitted by: Peter Tingley]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
