<AbstractNarration>Marine mammals that inhabit high latitude environments have evolved unique mechanisms to execute a suite of energetically-costly life history events (CLHEs) within a relatively short timeframe when conditions are most favorable. Understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that regulate CLHEs is particularly important in species such as Weddell seals, as both reproduction and molt are associated with large reductions in foraging effort, and the timing and outcome of each appears linked with the other. The long-term mark recapture program on Erebus Bay's Weddell seals provides a unique opportunity to examine CLHEs in a known-history population. The proposed work will monitor physiological condition, pregnancy status, and behavior at various times throughout the year to determine if molt timing is influenced by prior reproductive outcome, and if it, in turn, influences future reproductive success. These data will then be used to address the demographic consequences of trade-offs between CLHEs in Weddell seals. The impact of environmental conditions and CLHE timing on population health will also be modeled so that results can be extended to other climates and species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An improved understanding of the interactions between CLHEs and the environment is important in predicting the response of organisms from higher trophic levels to climate change. Results will be widely disseminated through publications as well as through presentations at national and international meetings. In addition, raw data will be made available through open-access databases. This project will support the research and training of graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher and will further foster an extensive public outreach collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

This project determined the factors that influenced the timing and success of two critical life history events &ndash; reproduction and molting &ndash; in mature female Weddell seals. Over the course of four austral summers, we handled females that gave birth in a given year (moms) and those that did not (skips) and then determined how reproduction influenced summer mass dynamics, hormone profiles, molt timing, diving patterns, and the probability of becoming pregnant and carrying the offspring to term.</p> <p>While we initially predicted that females that skipped reproduction in a given year would do so because they were in poor condition, this was not the case. Skip females were large and fat at the onset of summer, but then lost mass through the summer as they completed the molt more quickly than moms. Skip females spent more time hauled out (i.e. not foraging) during the summer, and this increased haulout time was associated with warmer skin, less heat loss, and faster molt. Females that gave birth lost significant mass during lactation, and then foraged intensively once they weaned their pups.

Skip females ovulated earliest in the summer (mid-November), while moms ovulated approximately 35 days after giving birth. Females that pupped later in the summer ovulated later, and this was associated with a slightly lower probability of getting pregnant, and of carrying a pup to term.

The longer period of active gestation reduces daily gestational costs, which might be critical given the relatively low rates of mass gain through the winter period. While we measured a suite of hormones known to be associated with reproduction, it was not possible to predict which females would become pregnant or carry their offspring to term based on hormone profiles, mass dynamics, or diving patterns.
