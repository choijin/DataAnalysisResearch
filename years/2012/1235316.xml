<AbstractNarration>This PESO award to Boston University by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research is cofounded by the Materials and Surface Engineering program (ENG/CMMI); and the Office of Physical Sciences-Oncology (OPSO) of the National Cancer Institute. This award is for the development of a biologically relevant heterotypic co-culture system as a model for tumor tissue growth and progression. The project will implement an integrated experimental and theoretical approach for developing a platform to obtain unique sets of physical measurements that can provide insight into the mechanisms in which tumors metastasize to specific sites in the body. The major aims of this work are to: 1) develop a novel method of forming tissue units by encapsulating cells into 3-D photopolymerizable hydrogels; 2) evaluate the interactions between the tumor cells with a specific 'metastatic niche' cell type; 3) isolate and recover each cell population for biochemical and molecular analysis; and 4) develop a theoretical approach to analyze the physical data obtained from the engineered system to develop theoretical models that can be validated experimentally in the system. The proposed studies are expected to provide insight into the mechanisms by which tumors metastasize to specific niche sites. The potential scientific broader impacts of this award could be: 1) elucidation of the mechanisms of metastasis; 2) development of surrogate physical measurements to quantify metastasis; and 3) development of potential cancer treatment strategies. The proposed project features an integrated research and education program that seeks to increase the pipeline of women and underrepresented minority researchers into the workforce. To achieve these objectives, the project will target K-12 students through Boston University's Technology Innovation Scholars program, which will implement the curriculum developed by the research team for the Boston area schools that have more than 70% underrepresented minority students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key contribution of this project would be the development of a physiologically relevant model of metastasis that integrates engineering, physical sciences and applied mathematical approaches. The potential impact of this work would be the development of high-throughput screening for agents modulating tumor-microenvironment interactions, and eventually, the metastatic process itself. One of the outcomes of this award would be in providing insight into the mechanisms by which tumors metastasize to specific sites in the body. The ultimate goal of this award will be to design the assembled tissue units such that they disassemble in a controlled manner, thereby enabling isolation and recovery of each cell population for morphological, behavioral, biochemical, and molecular analyses. The scientific broader impacts of this award would be in the elucidation of the mechanisms of metastasis, development of surrogate physical measurements of metastasis, and development of new cancer therapeutics. The proposed work features an integrated research and education program that includes the development of curriculum for Boston University's CityLab, which targets local area middle school and high school students and teachers. This program will develop modules that will demonstrate concepts, applications and hands-on experience in working with biomaterials. The development of modules will also be used to stress the importance of theoretical and experimental models systems. The graduate and undergraduate students will be actively involved in these outreach activities, and these students would gain additional experience in teaching and training. This program will also leverage Boston University's 'Engineering Ambassadors' program in the College of Engineering to engage undergraduate students in reaching out to local public schools.</AbstractNarration>
