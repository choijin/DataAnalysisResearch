<AbstractNarration>The cerebral cortex contains maps that represent various features of the sensory world.  For example, the visual cortex contains a map of an animal's visual space and the auditory cortex contains a map of the animal's frequency hearing range.  In addition to these basic brain maps, there are also maps of features that are behaviorally important to the animal.  Typically these brain maps arise through complex integrations performed by neurons, but the mechanisms of these computations are not understood.  Through the experiments described here, the investigator will provide fundamental insights into the construction and modulation of such computational maps and will determine how neural connections in the brain shape computational maps.  The specific focus of this project is to determine how maps that underlie an animal's ability to localize a sound are formed in the auditory cortex.  The investigator and his students will use electrophysiological methods to record from neurons to determine 2-D spatial sensitivity.  The input/output connections of these neurons will be identified using neuro-anatomical tracing.  The neurotransmitters involved in shaping responses will be determined using pharmacology.  Finally, the behavioral role of these computations will be examined with behavioral testing.  This research will provide insights on how cortical maps are shaped in normal brains and how brain computations may be disrupted in mental disorders.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project will include training of undergraduate and graduate students, including underrepresented minorities.  The research training will be integrated with undergraduate education at the University of California, Riverside and community outreach will occur through collaborations with the California Science Center (serving inner city schools in Los Angeles) and a desert research station (educating federal and state park employees). In addition, novel neural computations discovered here will guide construction of new electronic devices with potentially wide applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A fundamental function of the mammalian auditory system is to identify the location of a sound source.  Accurate sound localization is essential, and in some animals indispensable, for finding prey and mates or avoiding predators.  Despite the primacy of sound localization in survival, there is much debate on how the brain encodes sound locations.  In particular, the auditory cortex is known to be necessary for both horizontal and vertical plane localization.  But how the 2D locations are represented in cortex is not clear.  The major outcome of this NSF funded studies is the development of a novel model to explain how the population activity spread in the auditory cortex varies systematically with 2D locations of sound.  These experiments have also led to a novel hypothesis on how elevation cues are represented in the cortex. The midbrain and cortex represent sound locations using different codes.  The one-to-one space map mechanisms of the midbrain are not seen in the auditory cortex.  Instead, the cortex appears to rely on how the extent (area) of activity varies as sound source is moved in 2D space.  This is the most important and potentially transformative conceptual advance made from these studies.  Future studies in other species need to test this model to know if this is a generalizable model. The 11 publications that resulted in the grant period have firmly established the pallid bat as a suitable neuroethological model system to study mammalian sound localization behaviors and mechanisms.  These studies showed that the pallid bat has one of the most remarkable sound localization accuracies amongst mammals.  These studies were co-authored by up to 5 graduate students and 3 undergraduate students and thereby facilitating their training in neuroscience research.  A number of public presentations, including those associated with the pallid bat exhibit at a Los Angeles area science center, and a Mojave Desert research station, led to dissemination of information about natural history and foraging strategies of bats.  This also resulted in a PBS/KQED ?Deep Look? mini-video about the pallid bat that can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2py029bwhA       Last Modified: 10/09/2019       Submitted by: Khaleel A Razak]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
