<AbstractNarration>This grant is to fund student travel to the International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA), which is a premier forum for presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative architectural ideas and techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This symposium brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture, compilers, chips and systems, for technical exchange on current areas of architectural challenge. This proposal aims to support this highly regarded conference by obtaining travel support for students in order to defray the costs of attending and participating, with attention to broadening participation and building the technical workforce of the future.</AbstractNarration>
