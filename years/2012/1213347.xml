<AbstractNarration>Anne McCoy of The Ohio State University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program within the Division of Chemistry for the development of theoretical tools to unravel the spectroscopy and dynamics of molecular systems that undergo large amplitude motions. The work involves extensions of the Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) technique including the development of "on-the-fly" DMC and using DMC to evaluate measurable quantities including energies and intensities of ro-vibrational transitions. McCoy and her coworkers are using Diffusion Monte Carlo to develop potential energy and dipole moment surfaces. They also employ reduced dimensional approaches to explore photoinduced proton translocation and spectroscopic manifestations of hydrogen bonding more generally.  The research focuses on systems of current interest to experimentalists as well as theorists, and the results will be used to extract physical insights from spectroscopic measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By opening up a broad range of molecular and ionic systems for investigation, the work is having a broad impact on the study of systems of astrochemical and environmental importance in addition to deepening our understanding of hydrogen bonding and proton transfer in aqueous solution. The majority of students engaged in this research are from under-represented groups in the physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work supported by CHE-1213347 focused on developing theoretical and computational approaches for understanding molecules that do not follow the commonly used approaches because they undergo large amplitude vibrational motions, even at very low temperatures.  The molecules that we focus on are chosen as they allow us to explore broader issues.  For example, a central part of this work was to explore the spectroscopy of H5+, a molecule that is expected to be present in the interstellar medium, but which has not yet been detected.  The best method for detecting such molecules is through looking at their spectroscopy (the wave lengths of light that the molecule can absorb).  There are a variety of models that can be used to predict and interpret spectra, but the presence of five light hydrogen models makes H5+ poorly described by any of them.  By developing more flexible models and computational approaches we have been able to greatly improve our understanding of this molecular ion.    Similar studies have been performed on methyl Criegee.  This molecule is an important reactive species in Earth?s atmosphere as its decomposition is responsible for much of the night-time formation of the highly reactive OH radical.  In collaboration with experimental groups at the University of Pennsylvania, we have worked out possible mechanisms for energy transfer from thermal excitation of this molecule to the formation of OH.   We have also developed tools for understanding proton diffusion through aqueous media that allow us to make connections between these physical phenomena and spectroscopic measurements made by our collaborators at Yale University and the University of Leipzig.   The mobility of protons through aqueous solution is much larger than other ions owing to the fact that the excess protons can shuttle between water molecules.  In our work, we have developed several approaches that have allowed us to improve our understanding of this process.  This work culminated in a study that explored the Grotthuss mechanism through an exploration of the spectroscopy of protonated water clusters.  The grant supported five graduate students and three undergraduate students at various times during the funding cycle.  Of these individuals four are women.  Of the studetnts who have graduated, one is now an Assistant Professor, while the two undergraduates who have graduated are currently pursuing PhD's in chemistry.
