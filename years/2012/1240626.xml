<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Evolution of Developmental Mechanisms Program in the Division of Integrated Organismal Systems in the Biology Directorate and by the Sedimentary Geology &amp; Paleobiology Program in the Division of Earth Sciences in the Geology Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All contemporary animal forms, including ourselves, are the result of evolution from prior forms, as demonstrated unequivocally by the fossil record. But observation of fossils cannot inform as to how changes in body plan occurred; that question can only be answered experimentally. This interdisciplinary INSPIRE project capitalizes on a unique opportunity to study the same set of divergent characters from an evolutionary structural vantage point, using fossils; and from a developmental molecular biology vantage point studying processes in living descendants of the fossil lineages. Echinoderms have left a superb fossil record stretching back more than half a billion years because of their easily fossilized skeletons, some aspects of which will be studied with 3-D digital high energy X-ray technology for this project. The developmental processes which generate the specific skeletal structures which have arisen in given branches of echinoderm evolution can now also be accessed experimentally in the laboratory. This project has the unique opportunity of providing an explanation for what actually happened in evolution, in the specific terms of changes in genetically controlled process for building bodily structure. This is among the major, fundamental questions in bioscience. If successful the outcome will indeed transform this area of biology, by demonstrating a new powerful approach to understanding, in which is combined, sophisticated observation of deep time remains, with sophisticated experimental and synthetic exploration of living descendants. The project illustrates the potential power of interdisciplinary marriage between traditionally separate areas. It will require new ways of thought and in the process, joint training and research experiences will be instituted for involved graduate students in the Division of Biology at the California Institute of Technology and in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Southern California.  This type of multidisciplinary cross-training will produce a new breed of evolutionary scientists who will pioneer further advances in understanding the mechanisms of evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF CREATIV Grant  Project Outcomes Report  November 30, 2016     Biology is undergoing a second DNA revolution, through the recognition and understanding of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which are the sets of genes that direct the building of organisms.  The operation of GRNs in modern organisms is now fairly well understood, but the question of when particular GRNs evolved in geological time and how stable they have been through hundreds of millions of years has remained open.  Using modern echinoids as a model system, particularly the euechinoid Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the cidaroid echinoid Eucidaris tribuloides, a major goal of this research has been to determine the differences in the GRNs that were operating during early development of these two representatives of the modern echinoids ("crown echinoids").  Our experiments in the lab have shown a clear difference in the developmental GRNs of these two representative modern echinoids.  Through study of the fossil record we have found the oldest cidaroid echinoid, which is ~268 million years old.  Using these results we set out to test the hypothesis that these differences in cidaroid and euechinoid developmental GRN?s evolved when the crown group echinoids, the cidaroids and euechinoids, diverged, 268 million years ago or earlier.  This analysis shows that this difference in developmental GRN?s of cidaroids and euechinoids has existed for at least ~200 million years.  This is one of the first studies to show GRN evolution through time, and thus will provide a foundation for the growing field of paleogenomics, which aims to combine genomic information with studies of the fossil record to provide the time component for the evolution of novelties in the history of life.  This is a powerful new way to understand how evolution has operated on Earth.       Last Modified: 11/30/2016       Submitted by: Isabelle S Peter]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
