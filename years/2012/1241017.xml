<AbstractNarration>The annual ACM SIGKDD conference is the premier international forum for data mining researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to share their ideas, research results and experiences. KDD 2012 will feature keynote presentations, oral paper presentations, poster sessions, workshops, tutorials, panels, exhibits, demonstrations, and the KDD Cup competition. KDD-2012 will be held at Beijing, China from August 12 to 16, 2012.  Strong student participation is a long running tradition of the KDD conference. This project seeks to encourage and support graduate students enrolled in doctoral programs at US institutions to participate in KDD. Approximately 20 Student Travel Awards will be made to enable the students to attend KDD 2012 and participate in a Doctoral Forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The field of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining has grown rapidly in recent years. Massive data sets have driven research, applications, and tool development in business, science, government, and academia. The continued growth in data collection in all of these areas ensures that the fundamental problem which KDD addresses, namely how does one understand and use one's data, will continue to be of critical importance across a large range of organizations. Due to the recent data explosion in many applications, governments and companies can easily collect data spanning terabytes, petabytes or more. Several traditional data mining algorithms need to be replaced, or drastically re-designed, to handle such volumes. SIGKDD conference focuses on innovative research on all aspects of knowledge discovery and data mining. Examples of topic of interest include (but are not limited to): association analysis, classification and regression methods, semi-supervised learning, clustering, factorization, transfer and multi-task learning, feature selection, social networks, mining of graph data, temporal and spatial data analysis, scalability, privacy, security, visualization, text analysis, Web mining, mining mobile data, recommender systems, bioinformatics, e-commerce, online advertising, anomaly detection, and knowledge discovery from big data, including the data on the cloud. Papers emphasizing theoretical foundations, novel modeling and algorithmic approaches to specific data mining problems in scientific, business, medical, and engineering applications are particularly encouraged. It is important to attract students working on these topics to become the future leaders of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The student travel awards will support will enable US students to participate in one of the leading data mining conferences, and encourage them to pursue research on topics that are at the forefront of the current state of the art. The awards will help broaden the participation of female and minority students who are currently under-represented  within the data mining research community.</AbstractNarration>
