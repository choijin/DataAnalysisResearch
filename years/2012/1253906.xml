<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1253906                 PI: Kloxin, April           ORG: University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Dynamic biomimetic materials with multiscale structural complexity for understanding tissue fibrosis  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Understanding the complex interplay between cells and their microenvironment, the extracellular matrix (ECM), is essential in designing new therapeutic approaches to mitigate disease progression or direct tissue regeneration.  Biomimetic materials have emerged as tools to probe the role of microenvironment signals in cell behavior; however, creating materials that fully recapture dynamic biological processes remains difficult.  This proposal addresses a critical challenge in designing and applying materials that adequately mimic the spatiotemporal and multisize scale complexity of the native ECM to determine the key signals that regulate tissue homeostasis, disease, and repair.  For example, in response to tissue injury or chronic insults, fibroblasts activate into myofibroblasts, a wound healing phenotype responsible for tissue repair and ECM remodeling.  Misregulation and persistence of myofibroblasts, through mechanisms that are not fully understood, leads to deposition and accumulation of excess collagen, tissue stiffening, and ultimately fibrosis.  Innovative tools are needed to recreate microenvironment changes that occur during fibrosis to identify the pivotal signals in myofibroblast activation and persistence.  To address this, the PI proposes to establish a dynamic, structurally complex hydrogel using a combination of light-mediated, multisize-scale biomimetic, and tunable responsive chemistries to mimic temporally evolving collagenous tissue repair and disease progression.  The goal is to design a unique three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel culture system that captures critical components of the native ECM, including nano- to submicron-scale fibrils, nano-scale integrin binding sequences, and spatiotemporally evolving biophysical and biochemical properties, to understand myofibroblastic activation and fibrosis.  To achieve this, she proposes to:  (1) create hydrogels with controlled biophysical and biochemical properties that mimic soft tissues over multiple size-scales, from nano-, submicron-, to macro-scale; (2) demonstrate increasing hydrogel modulus and incorporating integrin-binding peptides in a spatiotemporal fashion to mimic fibrosis progression; and (3) determine magnitudes and rates of increasing modulus that promote fibroblast activation in both 2D and 3D culture within this model system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  Biomaterials and bioengineering have the potential to revolutionize our understanding and control of biological systems through the development and application of novel tools to complex health-related problems.  However, students often have limited knowledge of these fields, owing to insufficient exposure to related engineering concepts and educational and career opportunities throughout secondary schools and college.  The educational goal of this proposal is to create a comprehensive program for increasing the supply of students, especially underrepresented groups, participating and trained in biomaterials and bioengineering through new educational efforts at the secondary, college, and graduate levels.  To address these needs the PI will:  (1) develop and implement a biomaterials and bioengineering museum kiosk and a 5-7th grade student Family Friday and Mini-camp; (2) mentor high school students in biomaterials and bioengineering through research internships; and (3) develop new Biomaterials &amp; Integrative Biology coursework within the engineering curriculum.  The kiosk will allow our team to reach a large and diverse audience (&gt; 100,000 students over 5 years), while the targeted educational programs will enable more in-depth training of students from 5th grade to graduate school and continuing education.  Integrating the proposed research within these educational programs aimed at secondary and college curricula will enable innovation at the interface of materials, engineering, and biology through the increased participation, training, and diversity of workers in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Abstract">Collagens are the most prevalent proteins found within the human body. Their underlying chemical structure dictates their multiscale assembly to produce exquisite hierarchically structured materials with outstanding properties (for example, strength in response to mechanical forces and order within and junctions between different cell and tissue types in the body). In this work, inspired by these natural systems, we set out to design new biomaterials that mimicked aspects of the multiscale assembly of collagens while providing non-natural handles for controlling material properties to probe and direct the activities of human wound-healing cells. Specifically, we designed innovative multifunctional collagen mimetic peptides for the formation of long nano- to micro-scale fibrils and integration within crosslinked, water-swollen polymer networks, known as hydrogels, to create unique materials with robust properties that mimic soft, collagen-rich tissues. The utility of these hybrid materials, as well as other soft materials with multiscale and dynamic properties, was demonstrated for the multidimensional culture of wound healing cells for new insights into key cues that regulate relevant cell responses in wound healing and disease. Using a bottom-up approach, a new materials platform has been established that combines the advantageous properties of covalent and assembling chemistries for the creation of synthetic materials with controllable nanostructure, mechanical properties, and biochemical content for a range of applications, from 3D cell culture and regenerative medicine to membranes and nanoelectronics.&nbsp; In this work, multiple trainees at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral level were educated on the concepts of biomaterials, helping to establish the next generation of diverse scientist and engineers in this important research area and facilitating innovation at the interface of materials, engineering, and biology.&nbsp; Activities to achieve this included the establishment and implementation of i) a biomimicry and biotechnology educational kiosk at the Delaware Museum of Natural History, ii) a Family Friday and mini-camp event on biomaterials for young women hosted at the University of Delaware, iii) a high school internship in biomaterials, and iv) new coursework in methods in biomaterials and biomolecular engineering at the University of Delaware.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p class="Abstract">Articles highlighting education activties along with related images include</p> <p><a href="https://www.delawarepublic.org/post/biomimicry-exhibit-encourages-kids-see-nature-new-ways">https://www.delawarepublic.org/post/biomimicry-exhibit-encourages-kids-see-nature-new-ways</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.udel.edu/udaily/2019/april/april-kloxin-delaware-museum-of-natural-history/">https://www.udel.edu/udaily/2019/april/april-kloxin-delaware-museum-of-natural-history/</a></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/03/2019<br>      Modified by: April&nbsp;Kloxin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1253906/1253906_10232625_1562186358339_SmithmyerACSBiomatSciEng2018--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1253906/1253906_10232625_1562186358339_SmithmyerACSBiomatSciEng2018--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Wound healing cell activation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1253906/1253906_10232625_1562186358339_SmithmyerACSBiomatSciEng2018--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Wound healing cell activation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Wound healing cells, specificially fibroblasts from human lung, form activated clusters reminiscent of foci observed in lung disease (e.g., fibrosis) in response to stiff collagen mimetic materials (f-actin cytoskeleton red, nuclei blue).</div> <div class="imageCredit">ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering, 4, 3304-3316, 2018.</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">April&nbsp;Kloxin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Wound healing cell activation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1253906/1253906_10232625_1562186643251_mfCMP_TOC_2019--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1253906/1253906_10232625_1562186643251_mfCMP_TOC_2019--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Multifunctional collagen mimetic materials"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1253906/1253906_10232625_1562186643251_mfCMP_TOC_2019--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Multifunctional collagen mimetic materials"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Multifunctional collagen mimetic peptides assemble into fibrils and allow subsequent light-triggered polymerization to create nanostructured materials for controlled three-dimensional cell culture.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Amber Hilderbrand and April Kloxin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">April&nbsp;Kloxin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Multifunctional collagen mimetic materials</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
