<AbstractNarration>Prerequisite to designing sustainable stream and riparian restorations with high potential for improved ecosystem services is to increase multi-disciplinary knowledge of how these systems evolve and respond to environmental change and human impacts. The goal of the Big Spring Run (BSR) restoration experiment in southeastern Pennsylvania is to better understand the geological, biological, and environmental mechanisms responsible for development and stability of landscape patterns in shallow vegetated flow systems, and to test a new paradigm of stream-wetland restoration. This new approach is based on the hypothesis that removal of historic sediment that buried a pre-existing Holocene wet meadow for approximately three centuries can effectively restore a number of ecosystem functions.  Goals of the restoration include enhancing hydrologic exchange between stream channels and shallow groundwater within the restoration area, increasing the residence time of groundwater emanating from springs onto an organic-rich floodplain, and improving water quality by reducing sediment and nutrient loads in surface water flowing out of the restored reach.  The exchange of water and nutrients between surface and ground water fosters removal of sediment and nutrients in wetland ecosystems where surface water flow speeds are low and organic carbon availability is high. Comparison of pre- and post-restoration data enables us to determine whether or not these and other restoration goals are achieved, and to evaluate how an incipient wetland landscape evolves after restoration.  With a team of 26 scientists and resource managers from 12 agencies and academic institutions, we recently completed the 3rd yr of pre-restoration monitoring at BSR.  Post-restoration monitoring began after 1 km of valley bottom restoration was completed in August, 2011. Water quality monitoring includes continuous operation of three USGS stream gaging stations (with turbidity sensors and suspended sediment samplers), 18 USGS piezometers, and over 30 shallow groundwater wells installed by USEPA within the restoration watershed.  In addition, we use numerical modeling to 1) investigate the evolution and stability of stream-floodplain systems over a range of environmental conditions, 2) identify ground water flow paths and zones of nutrient transformation, and 3) predict whether this new paradigm of stream restoration will be sustainable under present-day sediment inputs and hydrologic fluxes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this work will have broad implications for restoring streams and improving water quality. Prior to this work, the dominant paradigm for stream restoration was based on the assumption that causes of stream impairment are largely the result of modern land use (e.g., excess storm water runoff from urbanizing areas) rather than a legacy of centuries of human impacts that included the burial of original wetland-stream landscapes beneath several meters or more of historic mud. Restoration at BSR involved removing historic sediment so as to accommodate storm flow within the entire valley bottom, and at a much lower velocity, flow depth, and shear stress than in the impaired state.  We anticipate that such sediment removal and wetland rehabilitation will be a sustainable means of reestablishing ecosystem diversity and function, reducing storm water discharge to downstream reaches, and improving water quality in watersheds where similar impairments have been identified.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

At Big Spring Run, aquatic floodplain wetland restoration via removal of legacy sediment eliminated this impairment and reduced sediment loads downstream. Legacy sediment is an impairment on par with watershed scale storm water and agricultural runoff, but it is stored in and eroded from a valley bottom position in direct contact with streams.  One year after restoration, the sediment flux out of the restoration reach decreased from a 3-year pre-restoration average of 218 tons per year to a 1-yr post-restoration value of 109 tons per year. This reduction is entirely accounted for by the removal of legacy sediment during restoration. Sediment reduction from the restored area is permanent, because the legacy sediment impairment was removed from the watershed.  (2)  Prior to restoration, the BSR was "flashy", meaning that peak flows rose and subsided rapidly as storms waxed and waned. Flow in the channel reached bank full conditions quickly but rarely went overbank, meaning that large volumes of water with high sediment and nutrient loads were transported through the system rapidly.  By removing the legacy sediment stored in the valley bottom, which substantially lowered the stream banks, the restoration was designed to permit flood water to go overbank quickly and at low flow stages, allowing more time for dissolved organic carbon to be in contact with wetland soil microbes that process nitrate-nitrogen, and allowing more water to be stored on the floodplain, reducing flow volume, flow velocity and increasing the time lag for peak discharge through the system.  (3)  Prior to restoration, the "riparian corridor" adjacent to Big Spring Run was overrun with non-native upland plants characteristic of "mesic wastelands". The targeted restoration ecosystem types were based on geobiologic reconstruction of valley bottom characteristics that existed prior to European settlement and burial of the valley bottom by pond sediment.  Landscape scale changes are being modeled using data collected seasonally each year since restoration to better understand how this type of restoration responds to these biogeomorphic changes.  (4)  Nitrate-nitrogen is highly soluble in water, and Big Spring Run, like many streams in the region, is impaired by relatively high dissolved nitrate concentrations.  Prior to restoration, surface water nitrate concentrations in Big Spring Run were near or exceeded the EPA limit for safe drinking water (10 mg/l).  After restoration, surface and groundwater nitrate loading was reduced by 11%.  (5)  Prior to restoration, the three main branches of Big Spring Run within the restoration study area displayed a range of water temperatures &ndash; measured from late spring to early fall &ndash; that indicated substantial warm water impairments during the warm seasons.

Restoration of wetland ecosystems at the level of ground water enhanced ground water and surface water exchange and the storage of carbon in soil, both of which in turn can enhance denitrification.
