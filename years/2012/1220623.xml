<AbstractNarration>This research project is an investigation of the role that examples play in helping learners become proficient in proving mathematical conjectures.  Researchers at the University of Wisconsin and New York University are building a framework that characterizes the development of example use as students advance from middle school into post secondary school.  Using this developmental information, the researchers are creating instructional strategies that help students think about the nature and value of proof as well as how to construct a mathematical proof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers are interviewing middle school students, high school students, undergraduate mathematics majors in college, and practicing mathematicians in order to learn how they use examples in the process of creating a proof or a deductive argument.  They are using teaching experiments to test various strategies on individual students and to learn more about students' thinking about the process of proving.  They are also using small group instruction to experiment with instructional strategies and move closer to a future goal of preparing materials for full class instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creating and understanding mathematical proofs has always been difficult for students, and yet it is a critical foundation for developing mathematical understanding.  Students often cling to the idea that a large set of examples is sufficient for proving a conjecture true.  This misconception has often discouraged instructors from using examples in teaching students to prove conjectures.  However, examples can stimulate thinking that guides a student to construct a proof through valid, deductive reasoning.  This project is advancing  understanding of how students learn to prove and providing tested, instructional  strategies that teachers can use to help students.</AbstractNarration>

Yet, not only do students of all ages struggle learning to prove (including undergraduate students), but teachers also struggle to facilitate the development of students? learning to prove. Researchers have suggested that overreliance on examples as a means of justification is a primary source of students? difficulties in learning to prove, and have advocated that instructional approaches be designed to help students learn the limitations of examples. Although such approaches may indeed help students learn the limitations of examples as well as the need for proof, they essentially view example-based reasoning strategies as a stumbling block to overcome. In contrast, we view example-based reasoning as playing both a foundational and essential role in the development, exploration, and understanding of conjectures, as well as in subsequent attempts to develop proofs of those conjectures. Moreover, we believe that instructional approaches designed to help students learn to strategically think about and productively use examples in proving-related activities will facilitate the development of their learning to prove.  In examining the nature of example use in proving-related activities (such as developing conjectures, exploring conjectures, and justifying conjectures) across a wide range of mathematical expeprtise (from middle school students to professional mathematicians), we developed a framework for examining and characterizing the roles and strategic uses of examples during proving-related activities, documented the example use and thinking of secondary school and undergraduate students as well as mathematicians, and have identified patterns of productive (and unproductive) example use and strategies.  The results provide insights into the ways in which thinking about and analyzing examples may facilitate the development of middle school, high school, and undergraduate mathematics students learning to prove.
