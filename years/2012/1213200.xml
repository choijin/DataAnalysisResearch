<AbstractNarration>In this award funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Brooks H. Pate and his graduate students at the University of Virginia will collaborate with Dr. Michael C. McCarthy and a postdoctoral research associate at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics to develop new tools to discover chemistry in astronomical environments through laboratory broadband microwave spectroscopy and next-generation radio astronomy observations.  Both radio astronomy and laboratory microwave spectroscopy have been revolutionized by high-speed digital electronics that have increased data rates by order-of-magnitude.  The assembled research group will develop new approaches that exploit these technological advances to increase the rate of discovery of interstellar molecules.  They will also develop computational algorithms to extract chemical information from chemical images from ALMA and JVLA including exploring techniques to test proposed interstellar reaction mechanisms through multispecies spatial correlations in radio astronomy images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work is the initiation of a research program in chemistry that explores ways that data enabled science can lead to new insight about the formation of molecules in astronomical and terrestrial environments.  Pate and McCarthy will continue to work with the VA NC Alliance (an NSF LSAMP program) to recruit early career undergraduates in under-represented minority groups for summer research in the area of the chemistry of the universe.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The introduction of scientific instruments for broadband rotational spectroscopy has dramatically improved the measurement sensitivity of this form of spectroscopy.  The broad scientific goal of this project was to explore the potential for developing rotational spectroscopy as a new tool for chemical analysis.  This development includes new instrument designs and data analysis tools to reduce the barriers to using the method.  The project used the field of laboratory astrochemistry as a test bed for technique development.  Molecules in the interstellar medium are identified by their molecular rotational signature and recent advances in the field of radio astronomy have significantly increased the amount of data available to scientists about the chemical composition of the Universe.  As a result, new approaches to creating and identifying unusual molecular species in the laboratory are needed for chemists to keep pace with the data rates of astronomy.     This project developed a "reaction product screening" methodology for laboratory astrochemistry.  The approach required the development of high-sensitivity instruments for rotational spectroscopy at both microwave and mm-wave frequencies.  More important, ways to quickly analyze the data sets from these new instruments that require a minimum of training in spectroscopy are needed.  This project produced new analysis techniques and data analysis algorithms that greatly speed molecular discovery in the laboratory.  The approach was used to identify two new molecules in the interstellar medium that are important in origins of life chemistry.  These data tools have already been widely adopted in the molecular spectroscopy community.       The techniques have found application in other fields of physical chemistry research.  The capabilities of these methods to characterize the structure of molecular clusters was explored in this grant.  The application of broadband rotational spectroscopy to the study of molecular clusters has subsequently produced several important results in the field of water cluster structure and dynamics.  The technology for mm-wave spectroscopy has also been adopted in the field of chemical kinetics where its ability to unambiguously identify isomeric reaction products is viewed as a major advance.  Dan Zaleski, a graduate student supported by this project, is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Argonne National Laboratory and is developing this new application of broadband rotational spectroscopy.     The project made a major effort to identify other areas of analytical chemistry where rotational spectroscopy can address unmet needs in chemistry.  A new instrument design for mm-wave rotational spectroscopy was invented and has been submitted as a patent application.  That work was guided by discussions that a graduate student on the project, Brent Harris, had with several pharmaceutical companies who were looking for new solutions to measuring residual solvents in active pharmaceuticals ingredients.  The opportunity to explore broader applications came through an NSF I-Corps grant based on results from this project.  Brent subsequently helped form a startup company, BrightSpec, to commercialize mm-wave rotational spectroscopy instruments for high-throughput chemical analysis.  Brent?s commercialization efforts at BrightSpec have resulted in Phase II SBIR funding from both ARMY and NSF.  This project also supported the development of a new spectrometer design for chiral analysis of molecules using a new measurement concept developed by Patterson, Doyle, and Schnell.  This technique has the potential to solve important problems in the pharmaceutical industry related to high-speed analysis of chiral reaction products.     This project has supported an important transition of the field of molecular rotational spectroscopy from a niche technique in physical chemistry to a tool for chemical analysis that can broadly impact the field of chemistry.  The project has provided a unique training environment in instrument development, basic science, and technology commercialization.  These students have been successful in starting independent research careers in astrochemistry, physical chemistry, chemical kinetics, and entrepreneurial startup companies: Brent Harris, a University of Virginia graduate student, was a co-founder of BrightSpec.
