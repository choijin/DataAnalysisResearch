<AbstractNarration>Ramanujan 125, a conference to commemorate the 125th anniversary of Ramanujan's birth, will be held November 5-7, 2012 at the University of Florida. A centenary conference in the USA was held at the University of Illinois in 1987. At Ramanujan 125, progress since the centenary conference will be reviewed, emphasing current research in areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan. The conference will cover the following topics: Partition Congruences and Congruence Properties of Modular Forms, Ramanujan's Mock Theta Functions, The Hardy-Littlewood Circle Method,  q-Series and Special Functions, Combinatorics of Partitions and q-series, and Symbolic Computation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematical genius who died in 1920, and who although had no formal training left behind a collection of notebooks filled with mathematical formulae which has intrigued mathematicians ever since. His work has had a profound impact on many areas of mathematics including number theory, combinatorics and generalized hypergeometric functions.  The conference will include eight plenary talks surveying major recent developments relating to Ramanujan's work and their impact on a wide range of areas.  There will also be two History Lectures of appeal to undergraduate students and a number of 30 minute research presentations. Undergraduate  students, graduate students and recent PhDs will be invited to the conference.  Special effort will be given to support women and minority participants.  The talks and papers of the conference will be widely disseminated by  making presentations and abstracts available on the conference web page, and by publishing a refereed conference proceedings.
