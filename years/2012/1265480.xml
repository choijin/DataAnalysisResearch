<AbstractNarration>One of the hallmarks of human intelligence is our ability to flexibly adapt our thinking and behavior based on the overall context of a situation, a trait known as "cognitive flexibility." Among the simplest behavioral tasks that require cognitive flexibility are visual "target switching" paradigms that involve viewing the same visual stimuli in the context of searching for different targets. As an extension, "task switching" paradigms often involve searching for a target based on one stimulus property (e.g., match the shape regardless of color) followed by searching for a different property (e.g., match the color regardless of shape). While interactions between brain areas that lie in the visual, temporal and frontal lobes are thought to play important roles in flexibly switching between targets and tasks, the specific neural mechanisms that allow for cognitive flexibility remain little-understood. Understanding these neural mechanisms has proven to be a considerable challenge, at least in part because the neural activity in the brain areas involved reflect heterogeneous and difficult-to-understand mixtures of different types of information.  With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Nicole Rust and colleagues will record neural signals as subjects perform target and task switching paradigms and they will then use newly-developed computational data analysis techniques to tease apart the neural mechanisms that the brain uses to flexibly switch between targets and tasks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An array of disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder and autism have been linked to deficits in the mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility, thus developing a basic understanding of how these mechanisms function is likely to be important for developing treatments to address the disorders that arise when these mechanisms go awry. Additionally, a basic understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility has the potential to benefit the robotics and computer vision communities interested in constructing artificial systems that can flexibly switch between targets and tasks to assist humans.  Motivated by the notion that the experience of scientific discovery is one that cannot be fathomed through classroom experiences alone, the results of this project will also be incorporated into an undergraduate educational course focused on analyzing neural data.  Finally, Dr. Rust will participate in the big data effort by making the data available to support other coordinated NSF efforts that aim to make use of real data in the teaching of STEM related courses and to enable participation in discovery science by those who would otherwise have no access to such data.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award investigated the remarkable ability that humans have to remember what they have seen, and the brain mechanisms responsible. A first project focused on understanding why it is that some images are better remembered than others. The results of this project led to the discovery of a previously unappreciated neural coding scheme in high-level visual cortex whereby more memorable images evoke more vigorous neural activity. In addition, this coding scheme was found to be reflected in computational models of visual processing trained to categorize objects, suggesting that its origins stem from the optimizations required for visual processing as opposed to those required for memory. These results ultimately challenged the prevailing hypothesis that visual familiarity is reflected in the brain as "repetition suppression" (RS), or as decrements in the magnitude of the neural response with familiarity, whereby smaller responses map to better memory performance. Consequently, a second project focused on understanding the neural activity signatures that can account for behavioral reports that an image is novel versus familiar. Those neural activity signatures were determined to be "sensory referenced suppression (SRS)": reductions in the magnitude of the neural response in high-level visual cortex, corrected for by the magnitude of sensory activation. Finally, the award supported the development of a new proposal about how visual novelty is used to drive curiosity-based exploration and efficient learning.
