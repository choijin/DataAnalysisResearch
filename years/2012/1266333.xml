<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program supports Professor Robert A. Flowers of Lehigh University to carry out mechanistic studies on the chemistry of samarium diiodide (SmI2).  SmI2 is an important reagent in organic synthesis due to its versatility in mediating numerous, fundamentally important reactions in organic synthesis including reductions, reductive couplings, and cascade reactions.  One of the important features of SmI2 is that the addition of cosolvents or additives can be used to control the chemo- and diastereoselectivity of reactions.  There are two scientific objectives of this work.  The first objective is to carry out mechanistic studies that define the impact of the affinity of solvents, proton donors, and coordinating or chelating additives for Sm(II) reagents. The relationship between these variables and the reactivity of Sm(II) will be applied to the development of alternative approaches for the reduction of functional groups by SmI2 using readily available, inexpensive, and non-toxic additives.  The second objective of this work will focus on mechanistic studies designed to examine known SmI2-based catalytic systems and employ the information gleaned from these studies to aid in the development of catalytic reactions employing SmI2 and other Sm(II)-based reductants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high degree of sophistication of many organic reactions that proceed through the transfer of electrons is based on our mechanistic understanding of anions, cations, radicals, and related radical ions. The ability of chemists to interconvert these intermediates through the use of metal-based oxidants and reductants has led to the development of reactions that utilize one or more reactive intermediates in bond-forming events to synthesize complex molecules of great societal importance.  The most widely used single electron reductant is SmI2, but the roles of additives in these reactions are not well understood.  The experiments carried out within the framework of this project are designed to provide a mechanistic understanding of Sm(II)-based chemistry and the role of additives that can be extrapolated and applied to a range of important and useful processes including the development of catalytic reactions.  Studies utilizing this mechanism-centered approach are likely to provide longer-term benefits to the scientific community than the demonstration of a single synthetic application.</AbstractNarration>

Often times additives are employed to accelerate or alter the selectivity of reactions.  In some cases, the additives employed are toxic, or their mechanism of action is not known or fully understood.  The goals of this project were designed to: 1) To determine the impact of the affinity of solvents, proton donors, and coordinating or chelating additives for Sm(II) reagents, and 2)  Carry out mechanistic studies designed to examine known catalytic systems and employ the information gleaned to aid in the development of catalytic reactions employing SmI2 and other Sm(II)-based reductants.  During the course of the work, the role of additives including water and other nontoxic proton donors were studied to determine their mechanism of action. We found that the combination of SmI2 and water reduces many substrates through proton coupled electron transfer (PCET).  A range of other additives were examined to determine if the combination of Sm(II)-water is unique or whether the key features of the system can be replicated or enhanced with other additives thus leading to safe and user-friendly reagent systems for the reduction and cross-coupling of a range of functional groups. Studies of known catalytic reactions of Sm(II) were completed and the mechanistic insight gleaned from these studies are being used to examine and develop new approaches for the catalytic use of Sm(II).  All of these studies are ongoing.  In addition to the scientific merits of the work, this project also provided important professional training to undergraduate and graduate students preparing them for careers in science, technology, and health.  Some aspects of this work were used to develop a course entitled:  Chemistry and National Issues. A portion of this course dealt with energy and the role of electron transfer and on the use of electron transfer in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals.
