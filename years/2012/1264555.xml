<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Elsa Reichmanis and Martha Grover&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Georgia Tech Research Corporation&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1264555&lt;br/&gt;Title: Morphology and Mobility Control for Functional Robust Flexible Electronics and Photovoltaics &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research program is to understand and predict the morphology of conjugated polymer materials applicable to flexible electronics, photovoltaics and sensors. The results of this research will enable the design and optimization of robust materials chemistries and the required, associated large-area, large-scale device fabrication process recipes. To exploit the unique capabilities of organic electronics in flexible devices and economical roll-to-roll high throughput printing, high charge carrier mobility is a prerequisite. However, mobility is highly dependent on the final morphology of the thin semiconducting film that serves as the device active layer. Organic semiconductors exhibit domains of crystalline-like order interspersed with amorphous regions, and the size and extent of order within each type of domain influences the molecular packing and subsequent electronic behavior. The morphology in all regions evolves as the film is deposited and processed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Semiconductor morphology in polymer based organic electronics is highly sensitive to the chemistry of a given material, including monomer selection, polymer molecular weight and regioregularity, the solvent, and the substrate. The time-varying process history also impacts the resulting morphology, including temperature, evaporation rate, and the choice of processing method. Understanding the impact of chemistry and processing on the active layer morphology is very limited and is dominated by tedious, observational approaches. A coherent understanding of how &amp;#960;-conjugated semiconductor chains interact, associate and align to form the inter-connected nanocrystallite structures that are essential for charge carrier transport is lacking, and there are far too many design variables to effectively explore this vast design space using a purely empirical approach. In this research program, the PIs will do a synergistic experimental and modeling study based on two specific chemical systems and focusing on three distinct processing modes. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is the most characterized material to date, and will be used to aid in the initial model-building efforts. They will then build upon the results and extend the studies to promising alternative high mobility systems, such as poly(benzothiazole-sexithiophene) (PBT6), recently designed and developed in the Reichmanis lab.  The close coupling of experiments and morphology modeling is unique and will enable a mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of morphology evolution, which will further enable the rational design of robust, organic electronics manufacturing methodologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Cheap ubiquitous electronics could transform the world, from solar energy to biosensors to food safety monitoring. The PIs participation in the Georgia Tech Center for Organic Photonics and Electronics (COPE) will amplify the impact of this research, through interactions with COPE industrial associates. The PIs will explore opportunities to directly expose graduate students to industrial research in organic electronics through internships as well as regular research discussions. The graduate students will also benefit from participation (as IGERT affiliates) in the curriculum of the NSF IGERT program on Nanostructured Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion, for which Reichmanis is the PI, and Grover is a thrust leader. As part of this program, the PI and co-PI will initiate a new program aimed at educating female graduate students about paths to faculty positions.</AbstractNarration>

To realize this new manufacturing ecosystem, we must first establish control over the processing of these materials. Their rational design requires the development of quantitative process-structure-property relationships through which functional properties and their requisite microstructures can be targeted and achieved. Specifically, the charge carrier mobility of these materials must be improved and controlled to enable many of these applications.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project, we approached this problem through model-guided experimental investigations on the canonical poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-based organic field effect transistor (OFET). P3HT forms nanofibers through a solution-based crystallization mechanism, which, when deposited in a thin film, yield OFETs with enhanced charge carrier mobility. We demonstrated end-to-end experimental and modeling techniques to achieve the fabrication of flexible, stretchable, high mobility transistors through scalable processing routes, while gaining a deeper understanding of the microstructural evolution of P3HT thin films during solution processing.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nanofiber fabrication methods demonstrated include sonication, poor solvent addition, UV irradiation, aging, and continuous microfluidic processing, while thin film deposition was performed <em>via</em> spin coating and blade coating. These led to a wide variety of fibrillar morphologies in the solid state. To analyze these structures, high-throughput image analysis software was developed, available at [gtfiber.github.io]. It provides a robust computer vision protocol and open source code for the extraction and analysis of images of fibrillar materials. It was found that sonication yielded wider fibers that were limited and length and could not pack very densely, whereas microfluidic processing created films with the most densely packed fibers. Ultimately, longer fiber lengths led to higher fiber alignment in blade-coated thin films, which yielded the highest mobility devices (0.2 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs vs. a mobility of 0.01 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs for untreated, spin-coated P3HT). Analysis of packing defects at the thin film surface relevant to charge transport indicated that potentially higher alignment and mobility could be achieved by the elimination of short fibers from the fiber population.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These processing methods were applied to the fabrication of bottom gate, bottom contact transistors on hard silicon substrates at first, but as our fabrication methods matured, they were combined with plastic substrates and gate materials to make flexible and ultimately stretchable transistor devices. Blending semiconducting material with insulating polymers was found to enhance stretchability and flexibility without sacrificing charge carrier mobility, and additionally contributed to greater ambient device stability.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results of these experimental studies were incorporated into a central process-structure-property database, from which quantitative relationships were mined. Fiber alignment was the structural feature most highly correlated with mobility, a relationship that held across multiple experiments and could also be extracted from images in the broader literature. This suggested that inter-fiber connectivity (or inter-grain, in the case of non-fibrillar conjugated polymers) played a crucial role in enabling charge transport, but also that the bending and curvature of those inter-fiber transport pathways affected the mobility. This was the first set of studies performed on a standard OFET device platform for which quantitative structure-property correlations could be extracted across multiple studies.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach taken in this project demonstrates how the synergy of database-driven informatics and nanomaterials experiments produces quantifiable improvements in technology as well as deep, informative, scientifically relevant insight into the physical and chemical phenomena governing nanomaterials processing, structural evolution and functional properties.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Elsa&nbsp;Reichmanis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1264555/1264555_10262227_1501595990426_OutcomesImage1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1264555/1264555_10262227_1501595990426_OutcomesImage1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1264555/1264555_10262227_1501595990426_OutcomesImage1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Flexible OFET device and its performance as a function of semiconductor/insulator blend ratio.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Georgia Institute of Technology</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Elsa&nbsp;Reichmanis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1264555/1264555_10262227_1501596070356_OutcomesImage2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1264555/1264555_10262227_1501596070356_OutcomesImage2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1264555/1264555_10262227_1501596070356_OutcomesImage2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Anisotropic charge transport behavior in P3HT-based OFETs and schematic of mechanisms responsible for this behavior.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Georgia Institute of Technology</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Elsa&nbsp;Reichmanis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1264555/1264555_10262227_1501596474164_OutcomesImage3compressed--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1264555/1264555_10262227_1501596474164_OutcomesImage3compressed--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1264555/1264555_10262227_1501596474164_OutcomesImage3compressed--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Examples of GTFiber applied to the extraction and analysis of orientational order in images of fibrillar materials.
