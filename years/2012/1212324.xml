<AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor John Berberian and his students at St. Joseph's University will explore the molecular dynamics of glass forming systems, from their melting points to below their glass transition temperatures, Tg.  The exemplary systems chosen for this study are the relatively simple symmetrical alkyl halides (specifically, 3 bromo 3 methylpentane, 3 bromo 3 ethylpentane, 1 bromo 2 ethylbutane and 1 bromo 3 ethylpentane) since they are devoid of hydrogen bonds and long range steric entanglements.  This molecular system provides a systematic change in the length of the carbon chain at specific sites in the chain.  Both modulated differential scanning calorimetry and dielectric relaxation are used to assess the changes in the configurational entropy with temperature (all of the molecular systems are dielectrically active) to test effect of molecular interactions in the Adam-Gibbs theory (cooperative rearranging regions). Additionally, the kinetics of the cold crystallization above Tg for these systems are investigated using isothermal modulated calorimetry and the measurement of the static permittivity both as a function of time and as a function of temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study, along with previous results of similar systems, will provide deeper insights into the intermolecular interactions that give rise to the glass forming properties, and phase transitions in general. In turn, the understanding of the structure of materials on a molecular level will allow the team to predict the mechanical, thermal, and other properties of materials, such as polymers and polymer blend. The importance of such structural knowledge extends to a number of areas (drug industry, construction industry, health industry, etc.) which have the potential to increase the quality of life. As a Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project, the undergraduate researchers engaged in this project will receive a solid foundational experience in physical chemistry, as well as an opportunity to see direct implications in the materials sciences and beyond.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The molecular dynamics involved in the crystallization of a number of alkyl bromides have been studied in an effort to understand the process involved in supercooling and the spontaneous crystallization that occurs above their glass transition temperatures but well below their melting points.  The particular systems studied in this research were chosen for their relative molecular simplicity and their systematic increase in structural complexity.  The molecules in the first group studied, 2-bromopropane, 3-bromopentane and 4-bromoheptane, are structurally symmetric molecules differing in backbone length by 2 carbon atoms with the bromine atom attached to the center carbon atom.  The other groups studied are: b) 1-bromo-2-methylpropane, 1-bromo-3-methylbutane and 2-bromopropane and c) 1-bromo-2-ethylbutane, 1-bromo-3-ethylpentane and 3-bromopentane.  The former group of molecules has a 3 carbon atom backbone with the bromine atom attached successively away from the backbone (i.e, the bromine atom attached directly to the center carbon atom, attached one carbon atom away from the backbone, or attached 2 carbon atoms away from the backbone), and the latter group is similar to the former group of molecules but with a 5 carbon atom backbone.     In simple terms, conditions for crystallization occur when the available thermal energy is less than the Free Energy required for crystallization.  The crystallization process requires energy for proper molecular alignment with crystal lattice sites.  If the rate of loss of thermal energy is fast enough, lattice alignment will be incomplete, and the molecules will be trapped, forming a supercooled liquid.  One of the parameters affecting crystallization is the structural complexity of the molecule, such as chain length.  This study determined the glass transition temperatures and the kinetics of crystallization of several of these supercooled liquids using modulated differential scanning calorimetry and dielectric permittivity, both as a function of time.  The kinetic data fit the Avrami theory for crystallization very well, and if one takes the coefficient of time in this theory as a rate constant, an energy activation barrier for the crystallization process can be calculated.  A plot of these energy activation barriers for 3-bromopentane, 4-bromoheptane, and 1-bromo-2-methylpropane versus their specific glass transitions temperatures (Tg) is shown in Figure 1.  The implication of this limited study of increased backbone length (increase in structural complexity) is that the higher Tg for the molecule, the larger the activation barrier for crystallization.  Even though the bromine atom in 1-bromo-2-methylpropane is removed from the backbone by one carbon-carbon bond, its Tg seems to follow the trend line established by 3-bromopentane and 4-bromoheptane of increasing activation barrier with increasing Tg (see Figure 1).      In addition to providing long time crystallization data, the dielectric permittivity measurements on these compounds, analyzed at specific isotherms, showed that loci of the permittivity data in the complex plane fit the skewed-arc function very well.  Though the skewed-arc is only a fitting function, the fact that all of the alkyl bromides studied (except 2-bromopropane, which did not supercool under the thermal quench conditions available) have the same type of dielectric response deviation from Debye behavior implies a similar environment for the reorientation of polar moiety of these structurally different molecules.
