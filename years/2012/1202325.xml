<AbstractNarration>The objective of the research is to investigate and promote the use of pico-liter scale droplets for encapsulation and monitoring of bacterial growth, mammalian cell growth, and PCR reactions. The approach is to ascertain both experimentally and numerically, the device design, mechanisms of encapsulation, and biological reactions inside the droplets. The research is expected to result in increased understanding of the fundamental mechanisms as well as realization of practical devices for point-of-care diagnostics and screening applications.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the proposed work include the development of novel numerical techniques for simulation of the cell encapsulation process, obtaining fundamental insight into the process of cell encapsulation in the droplets of cell media or buffer, examining the effect of ionic liquid medium on the cells, a systematic experiment and simulation approach to design the devices for optical capture, and whether single cell reactions can be interrogated inside these droplets.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed work is that a further understanding of the mechanism of cell encapsulation process in micro-channels will directly guide the use of droplets as reaction vessels for cells and molecules in biochemical applications. Thus, the proposed study can serves as generic platform that allows the biological activities to be monitored in real time using electrical means resulting in compact devices. The devices would be used to demonstrate fundamentals of microfluidics and bioassays to high school students in science fairs at OSU and as part of a microfluidic module in a 2 week long summer school at UIUC.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In many biomedical applications ranging from diagnostics to therapeutics, monitoring of cell growth and cell function is very important. Typically response of large number of cells, as an average, is measured using traditional technqiues. Measurement of large number of single cells can be important as some of the individual cells can be resistant to certain drugs and be subsequently harmful. Thus, techniques to manipulate and monitor cell populations at the single cell levels need to be developed.  In this project, we developed the experimental and theoretical foundation of droplet based microfluidic devices to monitor the electrical activity of droplets containing just a few or one cell. These approaches can be used in state of the art point of care devices to analyze cells in various applications. Instead of using oil or organic solvents as typically done, we used room temperature ionic liquids to make the droplets electrically accessible. The effect of the physical and chemical properties of the RTIL such as viscosity, density, hydrophobicity, and the device design parameters were examined numerically and experimentally. The novel approaches developed in this project could enhance the advancement of high throughput screenign of drugs candidates, and also to perform fundamental studies at the single cell level.
