<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2012 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. These fellowships support a research and training plan at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to David S. Bland is "Differential Geometry, Poisson Geometry." The host institution for the fellowship is University of California, Berkeley, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Alan Weinstein.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Twentieth century research showed that the forces of nature can be understood in terms of symmetries. To explain this, we start by remarking that the measurements we make must be made with respect to some gauge or system of coordinates which are arbitrarily chosen, and symmetries (such as rotations) relate the various choices of gauges/coordinates we could make. Forces arise to balance the fact that these arbitrary choices of gauge are local: they can be chosen distinctly at distinct points in space.  To give an economic analogy, the value of commodities can be measured using currency. This fact gives rise to the `economic forces': if a commodity is assigned a higher price in New York than Chicago, the commodity travels (is `forced') from Chicago to New York while the currency flows in the opposite direction to restore balance. The underlying symmetry here is the fact that the value of currency is arbitrary; it is determined by being pegged against commodities which have an intrinsic value.  Forces in nature behave similarly, with matter-particles (such as electrons) playing the role of commodities and force-mediating-particles (such as photons) playing the role of currency.  What is intresting is that the relevant symmetries change from point to point in space time: they were different at the start of the universe than they are now, for instance. In this research project, we studied the global geometry associated with these changes in symmetries (Chern-Simons theory over surfaces with varying structure group).  Our research accomplished several goals:  1) we were able to give explicit mathematical constructions of the moduli spaces of flat connections over surfaces with varying structure groups; along with the induced structure (a Poisson structure) they inherit from the physics. This yields novel and useful constructions for known mathematical objects, providing new and geometric insights into them.  2) we gave a straightfoward and geometric deformation quanitzation of these objects; among other things, this yields a new proof that Poisson Lie groups/Lie bialgebras can be functorially quantized to quantum groups.  3) the dynamics in this setting are encoded in terms of coisotropic or lagrangian correspondences; unfortunately it is a well known problem that such correspondences do not compose continuously. We studied the linearization of this problem, and showed that a) the `derived composition' is continuous b) the coarse moduli space of `derived lagrangian correspondences' has the simple description of assigning an `index' to classical lagrangian correspondences. c) There is a natural quantization of the (linear) derived symplectic category (whose objects are derived symplectic vector spaces, related by derived lagrangian correspondences).
