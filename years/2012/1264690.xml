<AbstractNarration>1264690 &lt;br/&gt;Coronell Nieto&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves an interdisciplinary university-industry partnership between UNC-Chapel Hill and Agile Sciences, Inc. with the objective of: (1) developing innovative reverse osmosis (RO)/nanofiltration (NF) membranes with enhanced anti-biofouling properties, and (b) building a fundamental understanding of how targeted incorporation of small molecules in the structure of RO/NF membranes affects their physico-chemical properties and performance. The anti-biofouling behavior of the proposed membranes is based on the incorporation of 2-aminoimidazole (2AI) into the structure of the polyamide active layer of RO/NF membranes. 2AI molecules are the only small non-toxic organic molecules that have been shown to inhibit biofilm formation for a wide range of bacteria, and to retain their anti-biofouling properties when attached to a surface. The 2AI molecules will be incorporated both throughout the entire membrane active layer (bulk incorporation) and only at the surface (surface incorporation). Once the 2AI molecules are incorporated into the polyamide active layer, the extent and location of incorporation will be varied systematically to build a fundamental understanding of how targeted incorporation of 2AI small molecules in active layers affects the active layer physico-chemical properties and membrane performance. Equipped with this understanding, the PIs will optimize membranes for anti-biofouling activity, fouling/scaling behavior, water flux and salt rejection. The optimization process will use a series of screening performance tests that will evaluate biofilm inhibition in static conditions, anti-biofouling activity under accelerated biofouling conditions during membrane filtration, conservation of anti-biofouling activity upon successive fouling-cleaning cycles, and organic and colloidal fouling and scaling behavior. The tests will use cross-flow membrane systems, bacterial solutions and natural waters provided by treatment plants.  In this project the PIs plan to develop the first non-biocidal biofilm-inhibiting membranes that actively interfere with bacterial signaling mechanisms that trigger biofilm formation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The development of anti-biofouling water filtration membranes based on 2AI molecules will help establish this new chemistry as a viable approach to achieve anti-biofouling behavior. This development will benefit all fields where antibiofouling surfaces are important (e.g., medical implants, fuel cells, food processing, etc.). The fundamental understanding of the effects that membrane modification with small molecules has on membrane physico-chemical properties and performance will serve as valuable information for membrane developers to accelerate development and optimization cycles. The educational and outreach activities in collaboration with the Chapel Hill High School, Institute for the Environment (Chapel Hill, NC), and Elizabeth City State University (NC), a historically black university, will foster and broaden the participation of women and minority students in engineering and sciences and produce water-related educational materials for dissemination to the broader education community. The PI also plans to disseminate information regarding procedures based on time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as useful methods in the study of the structure and properties of RO/NF membrane active layers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biofouling is a main operational problem plaguing membrane use in the water purification industry. Biofouling limits water productivity, water quality, membrane life, and increases operational costs. Therefore, developing an effective, widely applicable technology to control biofouling would facilitate membrane implementation and enable efficient use of membrane technology. Accordingly, the first major goal of this project was to develop and evaluate the performance of a novel anti-biofouling reverse osmosis (RO) membranes with 2-aminoimidazoles (2-AIs) incorporated as the active compound. 2-AIs are non-biocidal, bioactive compounds that actively disrupt biofilm formation mechanisms. 2-AIs are unique because they are one of the only compound classes that actively disrupts biofilm formation across different bacteria phyla, classes, and orders.  For all RO/NF membranes, not just antibiofouling membranes, analytical and numerical modeling studies in the literature have shown that water and solute permeability are a function of geometrical (thickness, pore structure, surface roughness) and intrinsic transport properties (partition and diffusion coefficients) of their desalting barriers. Nevertheless, the relative importance of these properties with respect to the substantial differences observed in water and solute permeability among commercial membranes is not well understood. Thus, the second major goal of this project was to advance the fundamental understanding of property-performance relationships in RO/NF membranes.  To achieve the two major goals of the project, the following specific objectives were met:  (1)       To develop an anti-biofouling water purification membranes through 2-AI incorporation onto the surface commercially available RO membranes.  (2)       To develop an anti-biofouling water purification membranes through 2-AI incorporation into RO membranes during membrane fabrication.  (3)       To characterize 2-AI membrane performance in terms of biofouling inhibition, water productivity, and contaminant removal.  (4)       To characterize physico-chemical properties of a suite of RO/NF membranes with a broad range of performance properties.  (5)       To perform mechanistic and statistical analysis of membrane physico-chemical and performance properties to elucidate property-performance relationships.  Experimental results led to the following conclusions regarding 2-AI membranes:  (i)         2-AI membranes significantly inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms (39-96%) due to the presence of 2-AI molecules in the membranes and not changes in membrane physico-chemical properties caused by 2-AI incorporation.  (ii)       Compared to (2-AI lacking) control membranes, 2-AI incorporation decreased initial membrane water permeability by 0-44% and salt rejection by -0.4-4.3 percentage points, without efforts to optimize these parameters.  (iii)     Incorporating 2-AI onto the surface of commercial RO membranes produced a more effective membrane than incorporating 2-AI during membrane casting.  (iv)     Under operationally realistic conditions, biofilm formation was significantly inhibited (98%) by 2-AI membranes; when biofouling occurred, 2-AI membranes had higher water permeability (10-11%) and organics rejection (11-12 percentage points) than (2-AI-lacking) control membranes.  Results also led to the following conclusions regarding property-performance relationships in RO/NF membranes (not just antibiofouling membranes):  (v)       While geometrical properties of membranes (thickness, pore volume fraction, roughness) play a role in water and salt permeation, they do not account for the differences in salt and water permeability observed among membranes.  (vi)     Intrinsic water and solute transport properties, especially diffusion coefficients, were the principal factors determining differences in each water and solute permeability among membranes.  Overall, this work constitutes the proof-of-concept for 2-AI membranes and 2-AI incorporation represents a promising, novel enhancement for biofouling prevention and control. Based on these results, further 2-AI membrane optimization and performance testing is warranted. Results on property-performance relationships from this study inform membrane developers on which membrane properties substantially change with current membrane fabrication procedures, thus providing useful information to identify which properties could be targeted for further membrane optimization.
