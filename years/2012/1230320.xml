<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation  Research Phase II project  will  focus on the  refinement  of catalyst compositions  identified during  the  Phase I program  for  production  of  fuels  from  biomass.   New catalyst  materials are needed to make liquid fuels and hydrogen from biomass more economical and efficient.  In  this Phase II project a scalable synthesis method  will  be utilized  to prepare 1kg/day batches of high surface  area catalysts with  proprietary additives  to improve  low  temperature shift activity.  During  the  Phase II research, pH Matter  will  demonstrate  the  performance  of the  novel catalyst compositions under additional customer-specific gas feed environments  and demonstrate  a method  for  scaling up  the  catalyst  synthesis process for  delivery  to  BTL system developers  and commercial  catalyst  manufacturers.  The  end  goal is  production of  catalysts  and  generation  of performance data demonstrating that the catalyst can operate in the full range of contaminants found in biomass sources,reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of fuel production from biomass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is potentially quite large. The production  of energy and liquid  fuels from  biomass will  have a number  of  beneficial societal impacts. Biomass gasification processes are carbon neutral, since it uses C0 2  that was captured from plants; therefore, biomass gasification will  replace energy production  from fossil fuels, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Unlike fuel crops, biomass can be garnered from  second generation  sources like waste products that have no use for human consumption, so the technology does not compete with  food sources. Further,using biomass as a source of liquid fuel will reduce the dependence of our nation on foreign  sources of energy.   The technology  developed  and refined  during  the  Phase II NSF SBIR program  could  have application  to  a wide  range of  other  catalytic  reactions  as well.  Potential applications include: lean burn diesel engine exhaust treatment,hydrocarbon reforming for fuel cells, electrode materials in fuel cells,and gas-to-liquid processes. Overall,the project will contribute novel results to the body of literature in catalysis and materials development.</AbstractNarration>

Chemical processes were identified for making the catalysts and we are currently pursuing a licensing opportunity as a means of commercializing the catalyst.  The development of biomass based sources of fuel will reduce the need for foreign sources and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  Biomass gasification processes are carbon neutral, since it uses CO2 that was captured from plants.  Unlike fuel crops, biomass can be garnered from second generation sources like waste products.  The development of an alternative catalysts that do not utilize chromium will have environmental benefits.       Last Modified: 04/15/2015       Submitted by: Chris Holt]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
