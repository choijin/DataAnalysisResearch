<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for the 2012 NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases PI meeting in Berkeley, California. The meeting will facilitate scientific exchange by connecting investigators supported through NSF's EEID program. Each investigator will present new discoveries and receive feedback from peers. The conference will provide a venue for scientific exchange and discussion on research questions and challenges of relevance to the EEID grant program. The meeting will enhance the quality of research supported by NSF's EEID program, by promoting networking and peer review among funded investigators. It will foster productive new research collaborations among scientists in related areas of study, integrate young investigators into a research community and enrich their training, and accelerate the pace of learning, by exposing researchers to others' work.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases (EEID) program supports a network of scientists at more than 20 universities and research institutes throughout the U.S. Collectively, the network is investigating a range of complex human and wildlife disease systems, generating insights into the spatial dynamics of pathogen transmission, the evolution of zoonoses, the emergence of drug resistance, and the many variables influencing disease spread-- including environmental conditions, ecological features and land use patterns, the behavior of vectors and intermediate hosts, and host-pathogen interactions. This project convened 135 members of the EEID network at an annual 4-day research summit, in order to share results from ongoing studies, synthesize learning across projects, and identify new opportunities for collaboration. Activities included nearly 40 presentations of new research, an interactive poster session displaying another 75 research projects, a series of networking sessions, and a talk on communicating science with the public.<br /><br />In addition, the project hosted field site visits and workshops designed to stimulate new scientific discovery and disseminate novel research tools. One workshop highlighted funding opportunities for US-UK international collaboration in the areas of ecology and infectious disease. Another provided an introduction to a new software package (NOVA) developed by EEID investigators for simulation of complex agents, with application to infectious disease epidemiology. The site visits included trips to Tomales State Park and Muir Woods, where EEID-funded researchers at UC Davis are investigating the spread of Sudden Oak Death, a syndrome caused by a fungus-like plant pathogen that affects forest ecosystems in the Western United States. The sites are part of a long-term monitoring program to assess pathogen presence and inventory vegetation over time, in order to investigate the impacts of pathogen invasion on native forest dynamics.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/02/2012<br>      Modified by: Wayne&nbsp;M&nbsp;Getz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
