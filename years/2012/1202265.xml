<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to demonstrate one of the most critical components of Silicon nanophotonics  - systems consisting of optics and electronics in a single chip for low power high data computing- an on-chip optical isolator.  The program will investigate the feasibility of the device from its theoretical requirements and performance to a fully demonstrated device. Optical isolators used to eliminate parasitic reflections that are detrimental to the stability of the system. The program will aim to demonstrate a small footprint isolator device that is electrically operated and is CMOS compatible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the program is the advancement of nanophotonics research and all of its practical implementations as it will provide a solution to the long-standing problem of on-chip optical isolation while maintaining CMOS compatibility. Furthermore, the fundamental knowledge gained in this research is also applicable to other novel photonic structures as its foundation lies in studying allowed photonic transitions in different optical structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are the enhancement of knowledge and broader participation of undergraduate and graduate students across a variety of disciplines related to photonics. Among the proposed activities the PIs will develop a seminar series to provide a forum to enhance the knowledge transfer between students across different field, introduce novel research areas in the ECE curricula and involve undergraduate students in the research program. The PI will also expand the current Women ECE program in Cornell university which has already impacted a large number of female graduate students in Cornell University.</AbstractNarration>

Electrically Driven Nonreciprocity Induced by Interband Photonic Transition on a Silicon Chip: Optical nonreciprocity is the basic requirement to achieve optical isolation. Optical isolators are import- ant devices for telecommunications because  they prevent  unwanted backreflected light  from  interfering with the transmitted signals and degrading communications. Isolators are typically fabricated using magne- to-optic materials.

The device is CMOS compatible and does not require any special materials. We demonstrated up to 3dB of optical isolation using 25dBm of electrical driving power. Our theoretical predictions show that full isolation is possible.  Non-reciprocal Phase Shift Induced by an Effective Magnetic Flux for Light: The interaction of light and a magnetic field would enable new physical phenomena for photons,  such as bending the direction of  light  and  one- way edge modes. Because photons are neutral particles, their interaction with  a magnetic field relies on using magneto-optical materials.  We demonstrated the effective magnetic field for photons using active coupled waveguides. This phase non-reciprocity demonstrates a gauge potential for photons and therefore an effective magnetic field.
