<AbstractNarration>For fifty years, the Tibetan Plateau has been recognized as the largest topographic feature that perturbs atmospheric circulation.  It serves as an ideal field laboratory for understanding the geodynamic processes that build high terrain.  Accordingly, the growth of the plateau should have altered atmospheric circulation and therefore written an evolving paleoclimatic signature not only on eastern Asian regional climates, but on global climate as well.  Despite many recent studies, we still do not know precisely when the Tibetan Plateau reached its current dimensions and how it perturbs atmospheric circulation.  This project brings together geodynamicists, atmospheric scientists, and paleoclimatologists in a multidisciplinary study of the when and the how.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major goals of the project is to quantify the extent to which Tibet has grown by crustal thickening, by thrust faulting and folding, by flow within the crust that redistributes material there, or by replacement of cold mantle lithosphere with hotter material (all in a state of isostatic equilibrium). Such quantification will take big steps toward the understanding of how high plateaus are built and how continental lithosphere deforms, topics at the forefront of geodynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determining how Tibet has grown will require determining when crustal shortening and thickening occurred, using basic field methods and modern laboratory techniques, and quantifying paleoaltitudes with new isotopic tools. Applying such paleoaltimetric techniques, however, requires an understanding not only of how the atmosphere transports isotopes, but how the evolving high terrain affected surface temperatures at times in the past.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overall goals: (i) to better constrain the history of the orography and geometry of Asia over the past ~50myr, (ii) to understand how this changing geometry has affected climate, (iii) and to help build an understanding of the interaction between climate and orography on geological time scales &ndash; in particular, how orography shapes climate by way of altering circulation and precipitation.  This project involves many PIs from institutions in the US and China. The larger goals germane to UW team are: (i) to illuminate the impact of plausible scenarios of topography and continental geometry of Asia on global climate and isotopic composition of precipitation over the past 50Myr; (ii) to compare these changes to those due to changes in greenhouse gases and orbital forcing over the past 50Myr; and (iii) to contribute to building a general understanding of the impact of orography and continental geometry on climate. The purpose of (i) and (ii) is to help inform the interpretation of the geological records (50Myr &ndash; present); the purpose of (iii) is to contribute to the understanding of the general circulation of the EarthÆs atmosphere.  Key outcomes: First, insolation variations due to EarthÆs orbital precession dominate over other geologic forcing factors on climate (temperature, precipitation, isotopic composition of climate). Extreme phases of precession fundamentally reengineer the dynamics of EarthÆs monsoons in Africa, the Arabian peninsula, and the Levant. A second key finding is that the major orographic features on the planet today and for the past 50M yr have a profound impact on climate and the isotopic composition of precipitation local to the large orographic features &ndash; Tibet, the Andes, the Mongolian complex, and the North American Cordillera.

Our results also provide further support for the newly emerging understanding of the monsoons in the present day climate. Specifically, our results add further evidence that the Indian monsoon is largely due to atmosphere-ocean interactions, and the east Asian monsoon is fundamentally due to a dynamical adjustment of the atmosphere to the orography of the Tibetan plateau.  In both cases, our results support the modern day view of these two monsoons: land heat...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
