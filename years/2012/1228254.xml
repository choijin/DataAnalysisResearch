<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding to design an integrated, portable neurovisual assessment system with the following capabilities: 1) custom software with user-friendly script language to program independent and multiple, simultaneous visual stimuli to the left and right eye for non-engineers, 2) simultaneous eye movement and sensory neuro-electrical activity quantification from visual stimuli, and 3) data analysis algorithms to determine potential physiological measurements or biomarkers that are sensitive and specific in identifying neurological and visual deficits. This transformative project will enable basic and clinical research scientists to assess neuro-visual functions in normal and impaired populations. This system will be integrated into the PIs' undergraduate and graduate courses. It will enable about 200 students annually to train in imperative skills needed in the growing Biomedical Engineering field (e.g. collect and analyze physiological data). It will be used for tours to introduce over 350 4th to 12th grade students annually to Engineering and Mathematics. The first application of this project will be to evaluate biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).</AbstractNarration>
