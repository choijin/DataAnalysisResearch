<AbstractNarration>Over the past 30 years, the incarcerated population in the United States has grown by close to 300 percent. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2009, 7.2 million adults in the United States, or 1 out of every 31 adults, were under "correctional supervision," a status that includes probation and parole in addition to incarceration. The wide reach of corrections activity translates into roughly $51.7 billion dollars or 7.4 percent of state budgets in fiscal year 2011. Despite the size of this social program in the United States, little reliable evidence exists to quantify the costs and benefits of incarceration and justify its widespread use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to help address this problem through estimating the impacts of criminal sentencing at the individual, family and community level using new data from the United States. Original data collection efforts by the researchers have created a new empirical dataset comprising 30 years of criminal court cases from Harris County, Texas. It includes over 2.7 million distinct cases and 1.1 million unique defendants. Defendants can be followed over time in the court record data, allowing the research to consider affects on recidivism and escalation in criminal behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, unique data sharing agreements with local county agencies will allow the criminal court data to be linked with administrative records concerning defendants' labor market activity, marital behavior, family formation, children's educational attainment, and neighborhood arrest records. Linking criminal sentencing to a variety of lifecycle behavior and intergenerational outcomes will generate an unprecedented dataset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To surmount the challenge of omitted variables bias, the research will leverage a source of plausibly exogenous variation: random assignment of criminal court cases to judges. As criminal charges are filed against defendants, cases are randomly assigned to courtrooms in an effort to maintain balanced caseloads between the judges. The judges in the Harris County criminal court system then hold significant discretion in both the day-to-day operations of their courtrooms as well as the precise sentences delivered to defendants found guilty of a crime. Due to the combination of randomization and discretion, some variation in the sentencing outcome for defendants is due to random chance. This research will seek to isolate that degree of sentencing variation in order to make causal statements regarding the impact of criminal sentencing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To advance this literature's methodology, the researchers will further refine their novel estimation technique: heterogeneous response instrumental variables (HRIV). The HRIV model, which non-parametrically estimates the judge's decision rule process, can reduce bias and improve efficiency in empirical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the conclusion of this research, the criminal court data will be archived for long-term preservation with the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). Efforts will also be made to make an anonymized version of the linked data available for future work also through ICPSR.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    After three decades of rapid growth in the prison population, the United States now stands as the global leader in the use of incarceration. In 2012, the annual U.S. correctional population included roughly 7 million adults, and combined federal, state and local justice-related expenditures topped $260 billion per year. Theoretical models generate ambiguous predictions for incarcerationÆs effects on long-run behavior and social externalities raising the need for empirical research, yet credible causal evidence remains scarce.   In this paper, I investigate the impacts of incarceration on criminal and economic activity using original data from Harris County, Texas. I linked over 2.6 million criminal court records accounting for 1.1 million unique defendants to state prison and county jail administrative data, unemployment insurance wage records, public assistance benefits as well as future criminal behavior.

The courts are staffed by judges and prosecutors who differ in their propensity to incarcerate.

This increasingly popular identification strategy has been used in numerous applications where judges, case workers, or other types of program administrators are given discretion on how to respond to a randomly assigned caseload.  This empirical strategy is contaminated by two sources of bias in my setting. First, sentencing takes on multiple dimensions (e.g. incarceration, fines, etc.) and second judges display non-monotonic tendencies (e.g. hard on drug offenders but easy on property offenders). Failure to account for these features leads to violations of the exclusion restriction and monotonicity assumption. I propose a new estimation procedure that addresses both biases through estimating a model that simultaneously instruments for all observed sentencing dimensions and that allows the instrumentsÆ effect on sentencing outcomes to be heterogeneous in defendant traits and crime characteristics.      My empirical results indicate that incarceration may be less attractive compared to prior work. While I find evidence of modest incapacitation effects while defendants are held in jail or prison, I show that these short-run gains are more than offset by long-term increases in post-release criminal behavior.

These results are paralleled by an increased take-up of Food Stamps and cash welfare. Whether through reduced tax revenue or increased public assistance spending, the findings imply that public finance is affected in ways that extend beyond the direct administrative "bed" costs.   With these new estimates, I conduct a partial cost-benefit exercise that accounts for the administrative expenses, criminological effects and economic impacts. What is absent are the general deterrence effects which cannot be measured in my study. As such, the findings need to be evaluated relative to the number of crimes that would need to be prevented in the general population to achieve welfare neutrality. Using the most conservative estimates, I find that a one-year prison term generates $56,200 to $66,800 in costs. In order for this sentence to be welfare neutral, it would need to deter at least 0.4 rapes, 2.2 assaults, 2.5 robberies, 62 larcenies or 4.8 habitual drug users in the general population...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
