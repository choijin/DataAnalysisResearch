<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for student travel to the 43rd Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. The travel awards ensure the training and education of the next generation of scientists at this conference, widely accepted as the leading venue in the United States for atomic, molecular and optical physics. The science addressed includes control of quantum dynamics, cold atoms, dipolar quantum gases, molecular structure and spectroscopy, positron-matter interactions, antihydrogen, ultrafast and intense x-rays, single-atom optical interfacing, dipolar gases, interacting Bose gases, Fermi gases and magnetism, quantum measurement, strongly interacting cold gases, ultrafast molecular ionization and high harmonic generation, advances in gaseous electronics, interactions between hybrid quantum systems, fundamental symmetry tests, heavy particle collisions, atom circuits, atomic structure and spectroscopy, attosecond spectroscopy, fundamental symmetries and precision measurements, excitations in Bose and spinor gases, few-body and molecular collisions, uitrafast molecular dynamics, advances in quantum communication, cooling of atoms and molecules, photoionization spectroscopy, atomic clocks, cold collisions and photoassociation, recollision physics, quantum information methods, in-situ imaging of ultracold atomic gases, magnetism in optical lattices, quantum measurement and control of spin ensembles, ultracold molecules, degenerate quantum gases and alkaline earth atoms, time resolved spectroscopy, atomic and molecular photo-processes, progress in cavity opto-mechanics, few-body ultracold systems, collision studies, low temperature plasmas and Rydberg atoms, intense field physics, novel optical technologies and quantum information, synthetic gauge fields in ultracold systems, dissipation in cold atom systems, matter wave interferometry, nanoparticle structure and properties, and non-linear optics!</AbstractNarration>
