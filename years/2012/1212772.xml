<AbstractNarration>R/V New Horizon will be operating along the West Coast of the United States during 2012, primarily in and out of San Diego. However, the vessel will transit to Newport Oregon to support work funded by the Navy as well as NSF. NSF-funded scientific objectives supported by cruises on R/V New Horizon in 2012 include: Marine Geology and Geophysics in support of the Cascadia Initiative; Biological Oceanography is support of the California Current Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research project; Instrumentation development in support of pressure sensors for ocean observatories as well as a Carbon Flux Explorer Development project; and a UNOLS training program for new chief scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R/V New Horizon is well suited to support these programs in terms of equipment and crew experience. This proposal represents year one of a five year renewed cooperative agreement. The amount of the award in out-years on this agreement will be negotiated yearly, and is dependent on the number of days at sea in support of NSF funded research programs. Scripps Institution of Oceanography executed the previous cooperative agreement (0505770) very well, meeting all requirements for performance and reporting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed work is indirect. It derives from the intellectual merit of the individual research projects that depend upon the shipboard work at sea. NSF-funded scientific investigations for 2012 operations include: marine geology; seismic hazard studies; climate observations; and instrumentation development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The mission of R/V Horizon includes the provision of educational opportunities both to students of the marine sciences, and, through educational outreach. R/V New Horizon operations also contribute significantly to a wide diversity of scientific disciplines, the data from which benefit oceanographic research beyond those studies directly funded to participate in cruises.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit.  At Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and throughout the U.S. oceanographic research community, the observation, measurement, and collection of samples and data are accomplished at sea on a global scale by operations aboard seagoing research vessels. National Science Foundation (NSF) support for the operations of oceanographic research vessels enables NSF-supported scientists to project their ability to observe, measure and sample the planet worldwide, facilitating scientific endeavor across a broad range of disciplines including biology, chemistry, geology, geophysics, physics, atmospheric sciences, and many others.  SIO-operated ships have played a critical role in the exploration of our planet since 1907, and continue to contribute significantly to the U.S. ocean research effort.  Shipboard research, such as that provided by SIO-operated vessels supported by NSF, offers the transformative potential to understand societally-relevant issues, such as global change and the health of ocean ecosystems, on which human well-being may ultimately depend.  This award supported the operation of the Research Vessel (R/V) New Horizon during the period 01 APR 2012 through 31 MAR 2017.  During this period R/V New Horizon carried to sea 66 different research missions, 30 of which were NSF-sponsored projects.  Each scientific program assigned aboard R/V New Horizon was individually selected through peer review processes, and was directed by its own Principal Investigator with unique objectives, outcomes and intellectual merit. The scheduling of scientific programs aboard the vessel was conducted collaboratively within the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), which has established a system for prudent shared use of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet by NSF as well as other federal, state, and local agencies. During this award period, R/V New Horizon conducted 527 operational research days.  Of those, 269 (51%) supported NSF-sponsored projects, with the remainder supported by the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (133 days, 25%), the United States Navy (36 days, 7%), Scripps Institution of Oceanography (16 days, 3%), and other programs (73 days, 14%).  After 36 years of service to the U.S. scientific community, R/V New Horizon completed its final mission on 29 APR 2015 and was withdrawn from the academic research fleet.  Broader impacts.  The spectrum of research projects enabled by these improvements to NSF-supported research vessels collectively achieves far-reaching broader impacts through the enhancement of infrastructure that is critical to the promotion of training and learning, increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in research, advancing scientific and technological understanding and informing policy making for the benefit of society.  For example, research and research training are fundamental elements of the SIO mission that benefit significantly from the proposed improvements.  Since 1903, Scripps has awarded more than 1,500 PhD and MS degrees to women and men from more than 47 countries.  Our alumni include a college president, five college deans, 21 academic directors, 234 tenure-track professors at 93 universities in 19 countries, and 142 research scientists at 32 universities in 12 countries.  In the five-year period ending in 2010, 630 graduate students and 253 undergraduate students obtained first-hand experience at sea aboard SIO research vessels.  Practical experience aboard research vessels is a cornerstone of SIO?s exemplary research training program, and this experience has contributed to the Institution?s success in producing outstanding new research scientists.  As shared-use resources for the U.S. oceanographic research community, SIO-operated vessels host scientists from throughout the country, and contribute similarly to the education and training missions of other institutions.  As a charter member of UNOLS, SIO is actively involved in coordinating research vessel operations with scientists and funding agencies so that our capabilities can best meet the current and anticipated needs of the entire community.  Through UNOLS, SIO ship operations and technical support personnel collaborate with ship operations departments at other institutions to broadly communicate best practices, lessons learned, and operational practices that benefit the entire U.S. research community.  During the period of this award, R/V New Horizon served NSF and the U.S. scientific community by safely, capably and efficiently carrying out its mission to advance our understanding of the oceans, climate, and Earth.
