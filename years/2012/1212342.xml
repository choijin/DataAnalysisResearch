<AbstractNarration>This award supports the education and public outreach program at the Soudan Mine Underground Laboratory, the country's only operational underground high energy particle physics and astrophysics facility. The Lab is hosted in a Minnesota state park, where each year approximately 4,000 of the Park's visitors venture 2,341 feet underground to see the facility, the Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS)  and Super- Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiments, and to learn about neutrinos and dark matter.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Soudan Underground Mine is a historical site operated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in an old iron mine in northern Minnesota. Around 28,000 people per year take the "historical" tour in the park, visiting the workings at the bottom of the half-mile deep mine. The Laboratory is also on that lowest level of the mine, where experiments benefit from the vast reduction in the cosmic ray background compared to the Earth's surface. These experiments are looking for individual interactions of weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos or proposed Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP) dark matter candidates. The coincidence of an established education and outreach program, a top-notch research facility, and an unusual and impressive location provide a great opportunity to bring students and the general public into the lab where they learn about the often esoteric world of particle physics in an intriguing and accessible fashion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supports education and public outreach based at the Soudan Mine Underground Lab in northern Minnesota, where neutrino and dark matter experiments are a half-mile underground in a state park.  College students and high school teachers join our year-round outreach coorindator for the busy summer tourist season, helping to explain the lab and its science to visitors while participating in the research itself.  "Popular Science" magazine called visiting our lab the "#1 Nerd Road Trip in America" (http://www.popsci.com/science/gallery/2013-07/25-best-nerd-road-trips).  The Soudan Outreach Program had a very successful three years supported by this grant.  We had almost 10,000 people take tours at the Soudan Lab, with 850 more attending community open houses.  In addition, 1500 people signed in our visitor book at NOvA, a new lab on the surface and further north.  As it has been for a long time, the number of walk-in tours to the Soudan Lab is about 10% of the traffic seen by the historical Soudan Mine state park tour.   Additional outreach contacts are made by the outreach coordinator.  Throughout the year he gives presentations in the community and at schools, and also brings a poster exhibit and gives talks at large science and engineering festivals in the region, reaching an estimated 12,000 people.  Together, these comprise very significant broader impacts, furthering the NSF mission.   The summer crew participated in other activities.  Some education centric participants produced new outreach materials, building models on display in the lab, and began preparations for the outreach program after the SuperCDMS experiment relocates to the Sudbury Lab.  One intern who is a geology student led a geology walking tour in the drift outside the lab.  Physics majors who were summer interns played a role in the hardware or analysis of experiments, and contribute to the scientific merit of this project.  This included maintenance and shifts for both MINOS and CDMS detectors.  Two of them analyzed data from the MINERvA experiment, determining how well we can identify neutrons in the detector.  One assembled a QuarkNet cosmic ray detector in preparation for running it in coincidence with NOvA.     Riding on a trip to the ICHEP2014 conference supported by separate research funds, we shared the form and success of the outreach program with a poster presentation.
