<AbstractNarration>This research project will examine relationships between outbreaks of spruce bark beetles and wildfire activity in coniferous forests of the Rocky Mountains.   Coincident with warmer temperatures, since the early 1990s synchronous outbreaks of native bark beetles have been occurring throughout coniferous forests of western North America from Alaska to the U.S. Southwest.  Extensive tree mortality caused by bark beetle outbreaks is triggering major changes in forest landscapes and their associated ecosystem services.  This collaborative research project will address the following questions about interactions between wildfire and spruce beetle outbreaks under varying climate and their consequences for ecosystem services:  (1) How does climatic variation affect the initiation and spread of spruce beetle outbreaks across complex landscapes?  (2) How does prior disturbance by windstorm, logging, and fire affect the subsequent occurrence and severity of spruce beetle outbreak?  (3) In the context of a recently warmed climate, how do spruce beetle outbreaks affect forest structure and composition?  (4) How do spruce beetle outbreaks affect fuels and potential wildfire activity under varying climatic conditions?  (5) How will climate change and the climate-sensitive disturbances of wildfire and spruce beetle activity affect future ecosystem services in the subalpine zone of the southern Rocky Mountains under varying scenarios of adaptive forest management?  The first four questions will be addressed through empirical research, including extensive tree-ring reconstructions of past disturbances, re-measurement of permanent forest plots, field measurements of effects of spruce beetle outbreaks on fuels, fire behavior modeling, and spatiotemporal analyses of the spread of recent spruce beetle outbreaks. The fifth question will be examined through simulation modeling of future forest conditions and their consequences for key selected ecosystem services, including biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and resilience to environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to understanding of fire-beetle interactions under varying climate conditions and their consequences for ecosystem services.  The project will provide new information and insights about climate impacts on bark beetle outbreaks, feedbacks to and from wildfire and other disturbances, and sustaining ecosystem services.  The project will provide current science information in support of forest management and decision making needs through evaluation of different adaptive management strategies to maintain biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and ecosystem resilience in the face of climate change.  The project will develop pre-collegiate and collegiate-level curriculum material on wildfire and bark beetle interactions.  It will create field and laboratory educational and training experiences for graduate and undergraduate students as well as an early-career postdoctoral researcher.  To further enhance public education on fire-beetle topics, the project will produce a documentary video as well as a website of frequently asked questions about bark beetles and wildfire in the face of climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The frequency, magnitude, and size of forest disturbances are increasing globally, which increases the likelihood that two or more disturbances may interact to affect forests and other ecosystems &ndash; sometimes in counterintuitive, unpredictable, and dramatic ways.  As an example, extensive outbreaks of bark beetles have killed trees across millions of hectares of forests and woodlands in western North America.  At the same time large wildfires have become more frequent across this region.  This research examined how outbreaks of tree-killing beetles interact with forest fires across the western United States.     Among the most important finds of this research are:     1. Over the past three centuries, synchronous outbreaks of mountain pine beetle have occurred in lodgepole pine forests across western North America. Although this study did not address the intensity of past outbreaks, it did find that previous outbreaks appear to have been highly synchronous across much of western North America. The subcontinental, rather than purely local, nature of these outbreaks is important for putting recent and future outbreaks into a broader context and implies that extremely extensive outbreaks of mountain pine beetle may be normal in the pine forests of the western United States.     2.  Warm temperatures and reduced precipitation have been the major drivers of spruce beetle outbreaks.     3.  Forest treatments that reduce densities of the Engelmann spruce trees (which is the host for spruce beetle) have not measurably reduce the intensity of spruce beetle outbreaks.     4. Severe wildfires can reduce susceptibility to spruce beetle outbreaks primarily by reducing the size of live trees (in post-fire stands versus in unburned stands) and only secondarily by modifying stand structure. One implication of this is that management strategies that aim to modify stand structure over large areas in order to reduce susceptibility to spruce beetle outbreaks may be unnecessarily intensive.      5. Severe wildfires especially reduce forest susceptibility to outbreaks of spruce beetle if outbreaks occur during relatively cool and wet climatic conditions. However, as climate warms and outbreaks become more intense, the dampening effect of fires on subsequent outbreaks decreases.  In other words, the strength of interactions among disturbances is likely to be contingent on the severity of disturbances as well as on climatic conditions.     6. The occurrence of wildfires over the past three decades in lodgepole pine forests of the western US was determined primarily by climatic variability (especially high temperatures and low precipitation) but was unaffected by pre-fire outbreaks of mountain pine beetle.  Trends of increasing co-occurrence of wildfires and outbreaks are due to a common climatic driver rather than interactions between these disturbances.  One implication of these findings is that reducing wildfire risk hinges on addressing the underlying climatic drivers rather than treating beetle-affected forests.
