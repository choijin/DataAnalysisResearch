<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial funding for the 2014 meeting of the Working Group in African Political Economy.  This meeting brings together an interdisciplinary group of social and behavioral scientists who are actively engaged in cutting edge research on the political economy of African development.   The meeting includes many graduate students and junior scholars as full participants and it serves as a training ground and a crucial research network for these participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WGAPE attendees publish in leading scientific journals.  The research results are widely disseminated to policymakers, including sessions at the World Bank, presentations to African policymakers, and books and articles for non-technical audiences.   Africa's rapid growth and political liberalization over the past decade has led to increasing business interest in Africa as a trade and investment destination.  Therefore, insightful research on African development patterns is increasingly important for US businesses and US policymakers.</AbstractNarration>
