<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Ryan Bailey and his group at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are developing a scalable and cost effective chemical and biochemical analysis platform based upon chip-integrated silicon optical devices. The intellectual merit of this scientific program lies in the application of novel mechanisms for detecting very small numbers of analyte molecules from within highly complex sample matrices. Fundamental advances in these approaches, which center around the monitoring of dynamic, rather than steady-state, sensor responses, will broadly facilitate the ultrasensitive detection of chemical and biomolecular species in a range of demanding analytical applications, including food quality assurance, homeland security, forensics, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the scientific goals of this project, which offer significant potential benefits to society, this award also supports a rich interdisciplinary training environment for graduate and undergraduate students. In particular, students from diverse backgrounds benefit from hands-on education, mentoring, and active research training towards future careers as measurement scientists. Students are also actively encouraged and supported to participate in a multitude of local educational outreach opportunities that work to improve science education at the primary, high school, and undergraduate levels. Dissemination of program successes to both technical (scientific publications and conferences) and non-technical (popular press and educational outreach) audiences helps maximize the broader impacts that this research has in meeting our country's current and emerging scientific and educational needs.</AbstractNarration>
