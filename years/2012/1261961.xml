<AbstractNarration>This project plans result in the design and development of a new type of location-aware mobile-social application. This application is designed to provide a new approach to event creation, discovery and management among groups. It provides user-location and social-activity aware information to users.  By leveraging its end-to-end social mobile platform, users initiate activities and manage real-world attendance. Using the same system, businesses may engage with customers through direct and timely communications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team plans to engage students in the research and development process.  The application is designed to allow a user?s current social activities and interests to be taken into account when presenting location-based information. This will enable the application to use user-mobility and locatability to connect local businesses with potentially interested individuals.</AbstractNarration>
