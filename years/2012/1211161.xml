<AbstractNarration>Dynamic scaling behavior in models of aggregation and clustering.  Numerous complex systems exhibit clumping behaviors that are observed to scale in well-defined ways that are rather poorly explained by current theory.  The plan is to study dynamic scaling limits in coagulation models that (a) are fundamentally related to branching processes and genealogy, (b) describe phase separation, mixing continuous growth and clustering, (c) model interstellar smoke, and (d) relate to repair mechanisms in chromosomes.  A key goal is to develop renormalization-group ideas that strengthen methods previously used to study scaling-symmetric systems.  Following the remarkable recent discovery of Menon concerning complete integrability for random shock clustering in scalar conservation laws, work will try to identify and understand important families of solutions, and extend the theory to handle more general models of ballistic aggregation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existence and stability theory for solitary waves in fluids and lattices.  Solitary waves are one of the earliest and most prominent kinds of coherent structures to be studied in nonlinear science.  Recent work has provided a proof of linear stability for solitary water waves of small amplitude, and has opened up new avenues for investigation.  Stability is explained using spatially weighted norms that measure the scattering of infinitesimal perturbations away from the nonlinear wave.  The proposed work is directed toward issues for which the use of weighted norms promises to produce progress, especially: i) existence of solitary wave fronts in periodic media, including multi-dimensional particle lattices and localized water waves with periodic bathymetry; and ii) stability of multidimensional soliton fronts for the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili model of three-dimensional water waves.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research carried out under this grant broadly aims to address the question: How do coherent structures emerge on the large scale from the complicated interactions of a multitude of individual components?  The mathematical models that exist to study such questions involve dynamic change in systems with infinitely many variables, such as the populations of groups of all possible sizes or the energy and phase of a wave at every frequency.  Outcomes of research under this grant resulted in progress in particular on models of clustering, branching, and wave-like behavior in energy spectra.  Many things in nature form clusters or aggregates: Aerosols agglomerate to form soot; animals form herds, flocks, and schools; interstellar dust forms asteroids, star clusters, galaxies.  The statistical distribution of sizes of such clusters or groups is often found to be a robust feature of large systems that is little understood.  One principal outcome of this research is the discovery of a new distribution of group sizes that is logically implied by very simple rules for merging and splitting.  This distribution is consistent with data from fisheries science on the size of mid-ocean fish schools. The distribution of the sizes of these schools is highly skewed (non bell-shaped), which suggests that standard statistical methods may lead to overestimates of fish populations.  Some classic models of population growth involve branching, the reverse of merging.  In another outcome, we found a mathematically natural way to analyze a general kind of branching process by using methods developed for models of clustering or coagulation.  We succeeded in mathematically explaining exactly what branching rules yield processes that approach a form that remains invariant over time as population growth continues.  A third type of outcome concerns certain mathematical models involving elementary particle physics that describe how photons scatter off electrons, as in intergalactic space or inside stars.  Such models are used in cosmolosgy, for example, to understand changes in the energy distribution of background microwaves during their long journey across the universe.  We were able to prove something previously suspected but counterintuitive, that it is not correct to specify that photons cannot develop zero energy.  Because the model involves some oversimplifications, this does not contradict fundamental physics, but our analysis helps clarify how one needs to be careful using these models in cosmology and plasma physics.  In addition, this project had significant impact on the training of two postdoctoral fellows and one graduate student who completed his PhD with partial support from this grant.
