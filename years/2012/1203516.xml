<AbstractNarration>Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are a common feature of the Earth's magnetosphere and strongly affect ions, thermal electrons, and thermal/suprathermal ions in ring current.  EMIC waves also play in important role in the formation and loss of  relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt.  This project will use a combination of observational data and theoretical modeling to obtain the EMIC wave power spectral density (PSD) on a global magnetospheric scale.  The project will examine how the EMIC PSD develops throughout the different phases of geomagnetic storms. It will use a quasi-linear approach to the Ring Current-EMIC wave system that is based on a set of the kinetic equations that self-consistently treat the coupling of the ring current and EMIC waves. The model will be a development and enhancement of existing model.  The major tasks will be (1) to develop a self-consistent, non-bounce-averaged, model of EMIC waves in the magnetospheric plasma, (2) to include a self-consistent magnetic field calculation in the global RC model, (3) to verify the modeled EMIC waves against the observational data from the Cluster satellite mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is relevant to NSF's Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) program.  It will proved a self-consistent model of processes that are important in space weather and will enhance our ability to forecast space weather phenomena in the ring current and out radiation belt. The project has educational impacts as well. An undergraduate student will be trained and involved in this study.</AbstractNarration>
