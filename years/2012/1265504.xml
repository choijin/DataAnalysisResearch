<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael J. Krische of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin will explore new strategies for the formation of C-C bonds via hydroaminoalkylation. In such processes, hydrogen exchange between amines and pi-unsaturated reactants generates transient imine-organometal pairs that combine to form products of imine addition in the absence of stoichiometric byproducts. Unlike classical imine additions, direct amine-unsaturated C-C couplings (a) bypass discrete preparation of stoichiometric main-group organometallics and, consequently, circumvent generation of molar quantities of metallic waste, and (b) avoid discrete imine formation to enhance step-economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies could offer more efficient, byproduct-free routes to important commodity chemicals (plastics, foams, pharmaceutical and agrochemicals) through the direct C-C coupling of basic chemical feedstocks. Byproduct-free catalytic methods for chemical manufacturing eliminate chemical waste at the source and, hence, are environmentally benign.  In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Metal catalyzed reductive coupling of &pi;-unsaturated reactants with carbonyl com&shy;pounds has emerged as an alternative to clas&shy;sical carbonyl addition. While such processes bypass stoichiometric organometallic reagents and the issues of safety, selec&shy;tivity and waste associated with their use, in many cases the requisite termi&shy;nal reductants are just as problematic as the organometallic reagents they re&shy;place. Catalytic reductive coupling via hydrogenation or transfer hydrogena&shy;tion - <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>processes pioneered in our laboratory - provides a more ideal strategy for carbonyl addition as relatively safe, in&shy;expensive reductants with low molecu&shy;lar weights may be used (H2 or 2-propanol). Carbonyl addition via hy&shy;drogen auto-transfer is most ideal. In such processes, hydrogen embedded within a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">reactant </em>alcohol mediates reductive coupling. By allowing alcohols to serve dually as reductant and proelectrophile (carbonyl precursor), this strategy completely bypasses the use of exogenous reductants, enabling byproduct-free carbonyl addition from the alcohol oxidation level, that is, the direct conversion of lower alcohols to higher alcohols. The primary focus of NSF-CHE-1265504 involves application of this new pattern of reactivity to the conversion of lower amines to higher amines (i.e. hydroaminoalkylations) and related imine reductive couplings. The amine reaction products are high-value building blocks for the construction of diverse chemical products. Hence, among the broader impacts embodied by this work, &ldquo;designing new routes to commodity and fine chemicals&rdquo; &ndash; as given by the Division Director in 2002 &ndash; lies at the very heart of this research.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="color: #221e1f; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 8.5pt; mso-bidi-font-family: MillerDaily; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"> <p> <p> <p> <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #221e1f; font-size: 8.5pt; mso-bidi-font-family: MillerDaily;">The work accomplished during the prior funding period has been presented in over 40 invited seminars at academic and industrial venues in the us and abroad.
