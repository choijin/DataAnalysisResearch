<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to create an efficient computer method for high-resolution topology optimization of structures in three-dimension (3D) so that fine details in 3D can be topologically optimized. The new approach aims to improve the efficiency and resolution of topological design by decoupling the topology representation from the analysis elements. More specifically, we will create a new method: using efficient higher-order elements for analysis and embedding multiple density variables in each element for high-resolution topology representation. Our research objective is thus to understand how the order of the analysis elements and the distribution of density variables within each element affect the resulting design resolution, the analysis efficiency and optimization stability, and upon which to further develop a formal method that enables efficient and stable high-resolution 3D topology optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this research would result in both theoretical breakthroughs and practical advances in topology optimization. Theoretically, this research would offer a new method for topology optimization: the use of higher-order multi-density elements. It represents a significant shift in topology optimization methods where traditionally only single-density linear elements are used. Practically, this research would lead to an efficient method for high resolution topology optimization of 3D structures, which is prohibitively expensive with existing methods. This research would positively impact a host of industries ranging from automotive, aerospace to manufacturing industry where topology optimization of 3D structures are urgently needed. The resulting method, when applied to multiphysics systems in hybrid-vehicle development, would provide a key enabling technology for the advancement of modern vehicle systems. The method would also enable the utilization of additive manufacturing capability to cost-effectively fabricate previously difficult to-manufacture, topologically optimized geometries for substantial performance improvements in aviation and transportation industry.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><pre><pre>We have developed a new form of density based topology optimization where the design space is restricted to the B-spline space. An arbitrarily shaped design domain is embedded into a rectangular domain in which tensor-product B-splines are used to represent the density field. We show that, with proper choice of B-spline degrees and knot spans, the B-spline design space is free from checkerboards without extraneous filtering or penalty. We further reveal that the B-spline representation provides an intrinsic filter for topology optimization where the filter size is controlled by B-spline degrees and knot spans. This B-spline filter is effective in removing numerical artifacts and controlling minimal feature length in optimized structures when the B-spline basis functions span multiple analysis elements. Due to the tensor-product nature of B-splines, the storage of the filtered density variables is linear with respect to the effective filter size instead of the cubic order as in the usual density filter. Further, this B-spline based density representation decouples the design representation of density distribution from the finite element mesh thus multi-resolution designs can be obtained without re-meshing the design domain. This approach is versatile in the sense a variety of finite element and isogeometric analysis techniques can be used for solution of equilibrium equations and a variety of projection methods can be used to approximate B-spline density in analysis.
