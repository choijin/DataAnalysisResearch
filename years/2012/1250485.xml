<AbstractNarration>Addressing the gap between scientific evidence, behavior, and policy is central to moving society toward a sustainable energy path. An increasingly rich body of work in the social and behavioral sciences is examining human motivation and decision making. This research may hold the key to understanding energy sustainability, but its results are seldom integrated into the technical and energy policy communities. This researcher will manage a workshop to develop detailed plans for building a Research Coordination Network focused on energy production and use decisions that bridges the social science, technical, policy and practitioner communities. The workshop will also establish a standing forum at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences to facilitate ongoing dialogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By connecting social science researchers whose work can directly inform government agencies, professional societies, academic researchers and non-governmental organizations, this workshop will facilitate new interdisciplinary collaborations that will have a lasting impact on future social and behavioral energy research.  It will provide the basis for new energy technologies and policies and will advance an agenda for future social and behavioral research on energy production and use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Technologists and policy makers are often unaware of the important role that non-technological factors can play in the adoption of new energy technologies and the success of energy policies.  It is therefore important both to establish strong interdisciplinary research programs to study these factors and to promote enhanced communication between researchers, technology developers, and policy-makers.     To meet these objectives, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences convened a group of experts in energy and behavior from the government, academic, and industry sectors to discuss how research on individual and institutional decision-making could better inform the development of energy technology and policy.  The goals of this workshop were 1) to connect scholars and engineers from multiple disciplines who are experts on social, behavioral, and technical aspects of energy production and use; 2) to establish a formal research network to evaluate novel approaches to understanding and overcoming the social and behavioral barriers to the adoption of new energy technologies; and 3) to establish a forum for researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners to share information and tools developed through their work.     The meeting established a foundation for a research network on the social and behavioral aspects of energy technology adoption and determined how the networkÃ†s activities and membership could be designed to maximize the exchange of data and research tools. Participants explored how lessons drawn from existing research efforts could be applied to new initiatives, how to make better use of research in the social and behavioral sciences within energy programs, and how to scale up successful state and local initiatives to the regional and national levels.     The research network that was established through this project will create new opportunities for researchers to interact with public utilities, government agencies, corporations, and nongovernmental organizations. These interactions will provide a means for researchers to design and test strategies for evaluating the use of social and behavioral research to improve energy policy. By demonstrating effective applications of this research, the network will promote communication among researchers, policy-makers, and program managers, and will have a lasting impact on efforts to encourage the adoption of new energy technologies and practices.
