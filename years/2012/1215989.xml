<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding in partial support of the Symposium on Deformation, Damage, and Fracture of Light Metals and Alloys, which is to be held at the TMS 2012, 141st Annual Meeting March 11-15, 2012 in Orlando, FL. This annual conference is organized by The Minerals Metals &amp; Materials Society (TMS), to bring the Metals and Materials community together to present, learn about, and discuss recent developments in the field. This symposium will focus on deformation, damage, and fracture of light metals and alloys at room and elevated temperatures in their service environments. NSF funding will be used for registration-fee waivers for 6 students and 5 selected speakers or attendees, and partial support of the symposium proceedings. Qualified students, postdoctoral fellows, and select speakers or attendees will be identified by the organizing committee. In addition to student, postdoctoral researchers, and other authors that have already submitted abstracts for the symposium, the organizing committee may invite such candidates by contacting university departments and/or laboratories that are known to have strong programs in areas related to the symposium topic. Every effort will be made to encourage candidates from underrepresented groups to apply for the registration fee waivers.</AbstractNarration>
