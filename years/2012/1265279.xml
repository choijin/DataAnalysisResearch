<AbstractNarration>Traumatic shoulder dislocation occurs in approximately 1.7% of the US population, and can result in chronic instability, pain and limited range of motion. Orthopaedic shoulder braces are a primary treatment method for the re-stabilization of the shoulder, and are an alternative palliative, low-cost treatment method to surgical reconstruction of the shoulder. The growing active and elderly populations are placing a high demand for innovation of orthopaedic bracing devices that can provide supportive shoulder bracing, while enabling sufficient ranges of motion to facilitate the return to sport and leisure activities. A new orthopaedic shoulder brace has been developed that enables active ranges of motion for most sport and leisure activities, while limiting specific ranges of motion that are at high risk of recurrent anterior dislocation. The brace consists of a soft, breathable upper torso and shoulder wrap, adjustable compressive straps, and a custom heat-moldable stabilization insert. Preliminary testing of the device has validated its ease of application, comfort, the ability to limit at-risk shoulder motions, and the maintenance of functional shoulder motion.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Although traumatic shoulder dislocation occurs most commonly in young active males between the ages of 15 and 29, the impact of recurrent dislocation risk (as high as 90%) affects the population as a whole in cumulative medical costs, lost wages and lost productivity. Recurrent dislocation risk is strongly inversely correlated to the age of initial dislocation, and older patients are more likely to incur higher rates of rotator cuff tears with dislocation. Although initial trauma is usually required to induce dislocation, re-dislocation can occur more easily during common sporting and work-related tasks. The design of a functional brace that limits at-risk shoulder behavior and supports active shoulder function will broadly impact the fields of rehabilitation, physical therapy and sports medicine. Reduced incidence of re-dislocations will reduce medical costs, increase workplace productivity, and promote a more active population.</AbstractNarration>
