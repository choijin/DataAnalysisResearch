<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to unify the capability of full duplex (FD) communications and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications to allow a flexible way of using the available RF chains to increase the capacity and reliability of wireless networks. Recent advancements in multi-antenna wireless systems have allowed wireless nodes to use either all of their antennas for transmission (or reception), or to use half of them for transmission and the other half for reception. The first system is called a MIMO system and the latter is called a full duplex system. Traditionally, MIMO and full duplex have been seen as competing technologies. This research shows that they can be combined in innovative ways to fundamentally increase the capacity of a wireless link compared to the case when they operate separately. This combination allows a node to dynamically allocate radio resources for transmission and reception. It further shows that informing routing and scheduling protocols about this flexible radio resource feature can significantly improve network capacity. The research proposes innovations in the hardware, protocols and software needed in the current wireless network architecture to achieve significant network-wide capacity increases. Thus, this research will produce highly flexible radios that will combine full duplex and MIMO. This flexibility will allow future wireless nodes to dynamically allocate radio resources for simultaneous transmissions and receptions. Second, it will develop MAC and network layer protocols that can fully reap the benefits of this flexible system. Third, it will develop a new network simulator that incorporates the fundamentally new wireless features proposed by this research so that advanced network protocols can be effectively and more realistically studied.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this work, we set out to explore enabling in-band full duplex capability in wireless nodes. We delivered multiple frameworks that enable this. First, we showed that a multiple antenna full duplex wireless node is possible. We enabled a new feature that allows a multi-antennae full duplex node to be full flexible, FlexRadio. With this new feature, we showed that we can combine all the existing multiple antennae techniques together such as MIMO, multi-user MIMO, full duplex and so on. By this flexibility, we showed that the fundamental capacity can be doubled, even when compared with full duplex systems. Second, we showed that cut-through routing can be enbaled in wireless networks and showed that two nodes that are multiple hops away can talk to each other with an end-to-end delay that is NOT proportional to the number of hops. Third, we showed that we can enable cut-through routing where both the nodes that a multiple hops away can talk to each other simultaneously.
