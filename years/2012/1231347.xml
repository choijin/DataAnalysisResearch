<AbstractNarration>This proposal involves the analysis of data from the Michigan Study of Adolescent Life Transitions (MSALT) and the Childhood and Beyond Study (CAB), two longitudinal datasets originally created by the principal investigator.  The researchers will also collect additional waves of data collection for each of the two datasets. The project draws theoretical support from Expectancy Value Theory, also developed by the principal investigator.  The researchers will collect new data to expand the existing datasets as a way to explore issues of generational effects on STEM engagement, analyses of non-STEM and STEM majors from across multiple disciplines, and additional psychosocial variables that may contribute to STEM engagement. Additional issues of interest include predictors of individual differences in STEM career trajectories and labor market experiences as predictors of STEM career choices. Data analytic techniques include structural equation modeling, hierarchical linear modeling, and person-centered techniques such as cluster analysis and latent class analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goal of this project is investigate gender differences and within-gender individual differences in the development of STEM-related interests. The under-representation of females in many STEM fields continues to be a striking labor force statistic. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the factors influencing females' choices to pursue specific STEM fields. Such information is vital to devising programs and policies aimed at changing gender-role stereotypes and gender differences in the value of STEM related majors and occupations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project utilized data from the 30-year longitudinal Childhood and Beyond study (CAB) and from the 25-year longitudinal Maryland Adolescent Development in Context Study (MADICS) to meet our aims of understanding adolescents? motivational beliefs and their experiences in school especially around math classrooms, in determining their later educational and occupational aspirations in STEM-related careers. We explored how contexts such as parenting and teaching, as well as race and gender, were associated with stereotyping in facilitating or hindering their later occupational choices. Several major findings emerged:  a) that parents and teachers make a difference in the youths pursuits? of STEM careers; and b) that students? beliefs in their abilities in math and English predict their later STEM career choices in complex ways.      First, we found that parents and teachers make a difference in the youths? academic pursuits.  Parents with nontraditional attitudes about gender roles transmit these attitudes toward their children which during their high school years set the youth on a pathway that affects their career choice during emerging adulthood.  Few choose STEM careers, but those who do have held nontraditional views on gender roles since childhood.  Further, children?s worrying about their academic performance in such core subjects as mathematics and English has profound implications for their learning and well-being in school. Our analyses show that when children perceive high academic performance as potentially difficult to attain, their parent?s valuing of that achievement indirectly negatively predicts children?s performance-related worrying. Thus, parental valuing of their children?s academic performance can contribute not only to children?s own valuing of academic achievement, but can also have an emotional cost&mdash;increased worry&mdash;especially when children?s perceived abilities are relatively low.     Being treated differently by teachers in the 8th grade plays a role in the importance students place on math and on their math achievement. By the 11th grade female students? belief in their math ability was especially susceptible to teacher differential treatment.  Relevant math instruction promoted and teacher differential treatment corroded students? math beliefs and achievement over time. Further, teacher discrimination undermined students? perceptions of their teacher.    Second, students? beliefs in their abilities in math and English predict their later STEM career choices in complex ways.  The combination of having high perceived ability in both math and English led to a somewhat lower probability of pursuing math/science-related careers, relative to those who felt they had high math but lower English abilities. This suggests the importance of considering the influence of more than just math in the STEM career choice process, especially as females tend to have high grades in both math and English.     Which occupation to pursue is one of the most consequential decisions people make, and represents a key developmental task. Earlier research suggests that career aspirations and choices are strongly influenced by adolescents? academic beliefs such as their expected success in and the subjective valuing of academic subjects like math.
