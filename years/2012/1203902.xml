<AbstractNarration>The project will utilize results from several Arctic measurement sites, including long-term observations at Barrow, Alaska, and shorter-term observations from Summit, Greenland, and two measurement campaigns over the Arctic Ocean to improve upon previous estimates of Arctic aerosol-cloud interactions. To do this a critical first step will involve understanding the conditions under which surface aerosol conditions, as generally used in the compilation of statistical datasets addressing this issue, are comparable to those at cloud level. Using a variety of techniques, the distinction between surface-coupled and decoupled cloud states will focus evaluation of aerosol-cloud interactions on appropriate cases, reducing statistical contamination. From these cases, a statistical evaluation will be performed to reveal co-variation between key cloud (e.g. liquid water path, ice water path) and aerosol (e.g. concentration, size, hygroscopicity) properties. Combined with surface radiation measurements and idealized radiative transfer simulations, the results from this evaluation will provide an improved estimate of the net radiative impact of aerosols on Arctic clouds. Additionally, it will provide an overview of the seasonal evolution and surface-state dependence of these relationships.  Outreach plans include several visits to Arctic regions, with a focus on the North Slope of Alaska and Greenland. The primary aim of these visits is to disseminate information relevant to the proposed research to seminar audiences consisting of local people (including underrepresented native people), primary school students, and local officials. A secondary aim of these visits is to give Arctic researchers (particularly early career researchers) who have never had a chance to visit the Arctic themselves an opportunity to see firsthand the region on which their efforts focus.  This project will also support two early career scientists at the University of Colorado.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Clouds are one of the major modulators of energy transfer in the Arctic atmosphere.  They reflect the sun?s energy back to space and increase the amount of infrared energy directed towards the Earth?s surface.  Because cloud droplets and ice crystals generally form on natural and man-made aerosol particles such as dust, sea salt and emissions from industry, changes to the aerosol population in a given location will result in changes to the number of droplets or ice crystals present at any given time.  These changes impact how the cloud interacts with energy transfer, and it is this response that we evaluate in this work.  Over the past four years, we have used a variety of datasets collected over the Arctic, with an emphasis on northern Alaska, to assess and quantify influence of aerosol loading on the radiative impact of thin, liquid containing clouds.  This includes analysis of long-term measurements obtained at the surface in Barrow, Alaska, ship-based measurements from the Arctic Ocean, and aircraft-based measurements from across northern Alaska.  In performing this analysis, we find that polluted conditions change the efficiency with which clouds emit infrared radiation (or it?s "emissivity") by 0.05-0.1.   Given that these clouds are generally found in an atmosphere that is between -10 and -30 C, this results in an increase in energy emitted by the cloud of 20-35 watts per square meter under polluted conditions.  This means that a shift in atmospheric aerosol concentration, resulting from increased pollution, changes in surface cover, and shifts in wind regimes, will generally result in a greater amount of energy reaching the surface of the Earth, accelerating melt of snow and ice.  This work has been presented to the research community in a total of 34 peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.  In addition, this work included a substantial, multi-purpose outreach component.  The primary aim of this outreach was to provide information on the processes discussed in the previous paragraph to the people of northern Alaska.  In this light, six outreach trips were conducted to Barrow, Alaska, with supported researchers visiting Barrow schools (K-12) to discuss their work, providing public lectures in a variety of settings, giving radio interviews with the local radio station, and assisting with the execution of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) camps conducted during the summer months.  The secondary objective of these outreach trips was to provide opportunities for early-career and under-represented scientists to present their research and visit the environment which they are studying.  In this light, four of six trips were conducted by early career researchers, and three of the six were conducted by female scientists.  Additionally, three of the outreach trips were conducted by Arctic researchers who had otherwise never been to the Arctic.
