<AbstractNarration>Large-scale atmospheric circulation systems affect the geographic distribution of precipitation in western North America, yet little is known about how these systems may have varied before the instrumental period of the last 150 years.  The main goal of this project is to reconstruct the history of precipitation in Alaska during the last thousand years using ice core records of snow accumulation.  The researchers plan to collect several new ice cores from the Mt. Hunter Plateau in the Alaska Range of Denali National Park and the new ice cores will be combined with an existing spatial array of ice cores in the region to map changes in the spatial patterns of precipitation.  Because changes in atmospheric circulation patterns caused by ENSO and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) affect where the precipitation falls, this spatial array of ice cores will provide a record of how these larger scale climate systems have varied during the last thousand years.  The project will focus on determining the differences in the precipitation patterns at the Little Ice Age (approximately 200 to 600 years ago) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (approximately 800 to 1,200 years ago).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will evaluate how changes in the climate state affect atmospheric circulation and precipitation.  In addition the project includes K-12, undergraduate and graduate education activities, and, in conjunction with the National Park Service, the development of an interactive display showing the climate history of the region and the history of glacier advance and retreat in Denali National Park.</AbstractNarration>

Hunter in Denali National Park. In 2013, a collaborative team of scientists from Dartmouth College, the Universities of New Hampshire and Maine, and the Ice Drilling Program Office successfully collected two parallel ice cores, each 208 m long, through the entire thickness of the Mt.

Detailed chemical measurements of the ice cores reveal annual snow layers throughout the cores, allowing us to count individual years back to at least 800 AD. When corrected for density and ice flow, these annual layers reveal that snowfall rates in central Alaska have doubled since 1800 AD, and modern snowfall rates are unprecedented for at least the past 1200 years. The seasonally resolved chronology of the Denali ice core record reveals that 75% of the snowfall increase since 1870 AD has occurred during the winter. We interpret this rise as resulting from a combination of an intensifying Aleutian Low, reflecting increased Alaska storminess, and the increased moisture capacity of the atmosphere as it warmed by approximately 2<sup>o</sup>C over the past century. We hypothesize that the Aleutian Low may be intensifying as a result of rising greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities. In contrast, during the so-called Medieval Warm Period approximately 800-1000 years ago, our record indicates that the Aleutian Low was considerably weaker, consistent with several other climate records from the region.

Melt frequency and percent were both 20-fold higher from 1900-2012 than from 1700-1900 AD. A detailed analysis of the relationship between Mt. Hunter surface melt production and summertime temperature reveals that a warming of 2-4&deg;C is required to create the 20-fold increase in melt. This is consistent with the magnitude of warming observed in other Alaskan paleoclimate records (e.g. tree-ring records) over the past 200 years associated with natural (rising solar intensity in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century) and human-caused (rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations) forcing.
