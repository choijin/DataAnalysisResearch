<AbstractNarration>This award will support the continuation of a longstanding program to observe mass-transfer close binary stars.  Long-term observations of such systems are important for determination of the orbital period and for detecting changes in the period that result from angular momentum loss.  These observations can also yield basic data on the mass ratio and the mass-radius relation of the secondary stars, which are important tests of stellar evolution theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed activity will come from the involvement of the amateur astronomical community in the monitoring of cataclysmic variables.  The program is also expected to produce valuable information on the space distribution and lifetimes of cataclysmic variables in the Milky Way, and on how close binary stars end their lives.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><pre class="western">Project Outcomes Report for AST-1211129  Three results from this research program have had broad impact on our understanding of stars, and even on how science is done.  (1) The first is the citizen-science network - the Center for Backyard Astrophysics (CBA) - which is the central engine of the research.  This consists of ~30 "amateur" astronomers, scattered around the world, who carry out all-night-every-night observations of selected variable stars. In principle we achieve 24-hour coverage of these stars, although the width of the Pacific Ocean is a significant barrier.  Because it is rapid time-series photometry and extends for months, we are able to <br />study the stars' behavior on many timescales, from ~1 minute to tens <br />of years.  And during this report period, we obtained two very surprising <br />results concerning the nature of exploding stars known as classical <br />novae.  (2)  For ten years we have studied the peculiar "novalike variable" BK Lyn.  Ancient Chinese records show that on December 31, 101 AD, a very bright naked-eye star was seen in its location - to an accuracy of less than one square degree. In other words, the variable star we know as <br />BK Lyn is the same star observed by the Chinese.  Throughout our 2013 <br />campaign, we found that it had changed into a dwarf nova, a change <br />that is expected for all classical novae.  But theory had suggested that <br />the timescale should be 50-100 years, not 2000 years.  BK Lyn is the <br />only nova which has made this transition, and now we understand why - <br />because there are hardly any astronomical observations available from <br />2000 years ago!    But why do classical novae take so long to die?  This is a tasty morsel for theorists to chew on.  Details in MNRAS, 434, 1902 (2013).  (3) The most famous nova in the sky, T Pyx, erupted again in 2011... <br />and we began a frantic program of time-series photometry on all <br />timescales.  Over the next 5 years, we found that the precise orbital <br />period lengthened by 0.01%, a change which indicates a sudden <br />ejection of 0.0001 solar masses in the nova explosion.  Since the star <br />only has 0.1 Mo (the mass of the donor star in the binary system) to <br />play with, this means that only about 1000 more eruptions can occur.  <br />And since the recurrence period is 30 years, the nova can only last for <br />30,000 more years - at which point the donor star evaporates.    This probably explains something we have wondered about for years.  <br />There are about one million cataclsymic binaries out to the distance of <br />T Pyx. If any of them had its properties (extremely bright, frequently <br />erupting), we would have discovered it long ago.  Yet we haven't.  <br />Here's a possible resolution: <strong>because such binaries annihilate</strong> <br /><strong>themselves very fast</strong> - probably by evaporating their donor stars.  <br />This yields only a solitary white dwarf, which leaving no trace of its <br />earlier fireworks.  Details in MNRAS, 466, 581 (2017).    We look forward to many more years of citizen-science projects, which crucially rely on the organized and pooled observations across a wide range of longitudes (in order to follow the stars "around the clock" as the Earth rotates).</pre><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/20/2017<br>      Modified by: Joseph&nbsp;Patterson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
