<AbstractNarration>This project will evaluate commercial potential of the novel approach of plasma-based method of  graphene. The technical part of the project will be focused on creation of an industrial-scale prototype system for graphene synthesis.  The proposed interdisciplinary project has both fundamental and technological significance. The fundamental significance is that our understanding of the fundamental role of plasmas in graphene synthesis will be greatly expanded. The technological and scientific significance lies in exploring the possibility of using various means to control graphene synthesis in arc discharge, possibility to enhance graphene production yield and ultimately pave the way for graphene mass production and industrial applications. Many important sectors of the national economy will be potentially affected. Successful development of the technology for producing graphene in a scalable manner (to produce large volumes of such) would have an enormous impact on energy storage, electronics, aerospace, mechanical, civil, and biomedical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has potential for a variety of industries. Since graphene was first created in the lab in 2004, graphene has been considered a material with significant promise. The two dimensional sheets of carbon atoms are the strongest material known, and graphene's electrical properties make it a potential replacement for silicon in faster computer chips.  Together with industrial partners, the team is developing graphene-based electrochemical energy storage applications.  They will evaluate the commercial potential of the material and will optimize its performance based on specific requirements from potential customers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has tremendous potential to a variety of industries. Since graphene was first created in the lab in 2004, graphene has been considered as a wonder material. The two dimensional sheets of carbon atoms are the strongest material ever tested, and graphene's electrical properties make it a potential replacement for silicon in faster computer chips.     In this project commercial potential of the novel approach of plasma-based method of graphene synthesis has been evaluated. This process is characterized by exceptional product properties for electrochemical energy storage applications, namely for electrodes in supercapacitors and fuel cells as well as plastics additives. Technical part of the project was focused on creation of industrial-scale prototype system for graphene synthesis.  We have identified that the main commercial application of graphene is the plastics industry. To this end we have interview 85 customers.  It was demonstrated in experiment and theoretically that controlling plasma parameters can affect synthesis of new structures such as a few-layer graphene. Among clearly identified parameters affecting synthesis are magnetic and electric fields. In particular, it was determined that formation of the plasma jet in a magnetic field leads to synthesis of the graphene. Knowledge of the plasma parameters and discharge characteristics is crucial for ability to control synthesis process by virtue of both magnetic and electric fields.  3 undergraduate students were attracted to the project and 3 graduate students (two are female) were involved in the project.
