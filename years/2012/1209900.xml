<AbstractNarration>This action funds Tanya Gordonov of University of Maryland, College Park to conduct a research project, entitled "Controlling genes with electricity," during the summer of 2012 at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.  The host scientist is Dr. Matthew Wook Chang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is in developing a way to control genes with electric signals.  This will introduce a new way to control cells much more precisely than presently possible. Possible applications include studying otherwise intractable genetic problems that need novel treatments and solutions and creating cells that can better produce biofuels, act as sensors, clean up oil spills, and help in the treatment of diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
