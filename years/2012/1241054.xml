<AbstractNarration>Microorganisms are abundant in the atmosphere and play an important role in controlling cloud development, cloud chemistry and ultimately weather patterns. They do this primarily by producing enzymes that catalyze the formation (nucleation) of ice crystals at significantly warmer temperatures than would normally be required for ice formation (-2 C vs. -36 C). Despite the atmosphere?s fundamental role in their dispersal, the abundance, diversity and flux of microorganisms in the atmosphere remain largely unknown. The potential of ice-nucleating microorganisms to significantly impact meteorology and promote microbial dispersal during precipitation events motivates this research.  The RAINS project will sample rain, snow and air samples at ground level, and in the lower atmosphere using remote-controlled aircraft.  The project will: (1) characterize microbial taxonomic diversity, including in precipitation that occurred between 1794 AD and present, and which is preserved in glacial ice; (2) determine the genetic diversity of microbial assemblages and of individual ice nucleating bacteria and (3) examine the functional diversity with respect to the role of precipitation and biological ice nucleation on patterns of microbial distribution.  The work will also determine which microbes carried to the Earth?s surface via precipitation present possible inoculum sources for diseases that impact humans, domestic animals, and plants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RAINS project will increase understanding of biodiversity in the planetary boundary layer of the atmosphere, where important meteorological phenomena such as precipitation occur.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommended developing a better understanding of the effect of aerosols and atmospheric ice formation in order to improve climate models and forecast the impact of rising global temperature. The proposed study will increase knowledge on the nature of the most active ice nucleators in the atmosphere. Microbial ice nucleation may also allow microorganisms and certain plant pathogens to efficiently cycle between the atmosphere and surface habitats, and RAINS will contribute to ongoing efforts to assess the movement of ice nucleating microorganisms across geographical scales. Outreach efforts will take these advances into high school and college classrooms in the form of hands-on research experiences for students at both levels and will serve as the basis for high school educators to develop unique classroom activities. In addition, an international network of scientists collecting field data on the relationship between biological ice nucleator abundance, cropping patterns and precipitation in dry land regions will be established. RAINS will sponsor an international conference that brings together 10 young career scientists in the network to highlight the advances of these investigations and identify the outstanding scientific questions.</AbstractNarration>

The <em>RAINS</em> project was born in a period of growing concern that science needs to facilitate research on interdisciplinary questions of broad importance for society and for the environment. The goal of <em>RAINS&rsquo;</em> mentoring workshops was to enable a corps of early career scientists with passion for research about microorganisms at the interface of land-atmosphere feedbacks (MILAF), with excellent disciplinary competences, and with strong wills to engage in interdisciplinary research in spite of the potential obstacles and inconveniences. The initial workshop (2014) transformed, by popular demand, into a series of meetings and into a tight-linked community that is contributing to setting and advancing a research agenda on land-atmosphere feedbacks. Collectively, through 3 in-person meetings (France 2014, Italy 2016, Sweden 2017) and several video-conferences, this series brought together 25 early career scientists with 15 mentors from the US and European research institutions, led to multiple collaborations and has been a means for participants to find post-doctoral research opportunities.</p> <p>We believe that an important factor in the success of the MILAF meetings was the format of organization that we (the PIs from MSU) put into place, being particularly attentive to the following processes.</p> <p>1. We scouted talent among early career scientists through an application procedure where the applicants wrote essays about their motivation for the workshops, how attending the workshops would allow them to contribute to the field in the future, and describing their interest in interdisciplinary research in general &ndash; plus a CV.</p> <p>2. We stimulated the early career scientists during the workshops in two ways in particular. Firstly, we brought in mentors that represented a broad scope of disciplines (from atmospheric physics to agronomy, microbiology, modeling and land use analysis) and pertinent socio-economic questions including water rights. Secondly, we favored broad-topic presentations, ensuing discussions and break-out groups more so than formal presentations of each person&rsquo;s research.</p> <p>3. We assured that every workshop focused on building a vision of the future to assure that the community had long term goals to which the participants had a strong sense of dedication. This was an important means to foster cohesiveness of the network of MILAF participants. The vision for the future of research on microbially mediated land-atmosphere feedbacks that we built consisted of the following themes:</p> <ul> <li>Coordinating research activities that target the main scientific challenges that we identified for the upcoming decades</li> <li>Promoting the cohesiveness of the bioprecipitation community, mentoring young scientists and fostering deployment of interdisciplinary competences</li> <li>Creating a sense of urgency and educating the public</li> <li>Identifying and engaging stakeholders</li> <li>Translating research into practical applications to mitigate drought.</li> </ul> <p>The research challenges that were identified by the group for which significant progress was made due to the collaborations set up via the MILAF meetings were:</p> <p><strong>A.
