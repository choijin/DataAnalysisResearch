<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1202832            PI: Dillen, J. A.       ORG: Materials Research Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Spring 2012 MRS Symposium OO: Structure-Function Design Strategies for Bio-Enabled Materials Systems &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  This symposium, to be held in the context of the 2012 Spring Meeting of the Materials Research Society (MRS), will focus on developing novel strategies to design and construct novel materials useful for a broad range of biologically relevant functions.  It is one of eleven scheduled symposia with a bioimaterials theme.  Abstracts have been solicited in the following topic areas:  (1) peptide, oligonucleotide, or virus-mediated assembly or precipitation, (2) peptide or oliogonucleotide-based aptamers for specific targeting, (3) 3D cellular mimics as therapeutic or diagnostic vehicles, (4) 2D ligand-functionalized SAMS or bilayers, and (5) hierarchically structured biomaterials.  These approaches are appropriate for development of materials that may be employed for gene and drug delivery, of self-assembled nanoscopic arrays that may be used for biosensing or bioactivation, of cellular mimics that may have therapeutic or diagnostic applications, and of functionalized surfaces and matrices that may be used to support tissue culture or to suppress bacterial colonization or fouling by protein deposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  Recently, bio-enabled strategies in which biological components are incorporated into otherwise abiological systems, have proven powerful approaches to obtaining intricate hierarchical structures with unique properties that are not otherwise accessible.  The challenges involved in these strategies include successfully interfacing nonbiological materials with biomacromolecules, cellular components, or cellular mimics to achieve the desired function.  Successful realization of these bio-inspired or bio-enabled hybrid materials often stems from specific associations between heterogeneous components that enable unique synergistic behavior such as controlled precipitation events, precise pattern formation, or molecular recognition-based assembly.  Recent successful examples include peptide-driven nucleation of inorganic particles, spontaneous organization of organic and inorganic components to form nanocomposites, and self-assembled monolayers or bilayers to promote cellular activity on a material surface.  The symposium will provide opportunities for younger and more established scientists to learn of recent developments from the leading practitioners.</AbstractNarration>
