<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a set of algorithms to optimize the operation of an electric power distribution network incorporating demand response practices in combination with solar photovoltaics and energy storage technologies to absorb the new crop of electric vehicles (EVs). The approach is to apply the traditional knowledge of electric power distribution system analysis, together with agent-based technologies and mathematical models of various supply/demand devices, to address EV penetration challenges at the distribution feeder level.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit - The proposed algorithms are expected to potentially modernize current practices of electric power distribution network operation by contributing to load factor improvement and allowing EVs to interface with the grid without adding new peaks. Additional major contributions lie in the methodology to analyze and quantify demand response potentials, as well as the approach to quantify values of solar photovoltaics and storage to mitigate the impact of growing EV penetration. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts - The proposed algorithms will contribute greatly to a more efficient operation of the electric power distribution network. It will allow electric distribution companies to manage end-use demand without compromising customers? way of life, while avoiding/deferring extensive upgrades of transformers and switchgears with the large-scale penetration of EVs. Regulators and policy makers can make use of the research outcome to decide what technology combination makes sense in mitigating growing EV penetration. The research outcome will also contribute to the development of a demand response laboratory at Virginia Tech, which will broaden student exposure beyond the academic environment.</AbstractNarration>

During the course of this project, an approach for coordinated control of major loads in buildings (i.e., Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), lighting and plug), including ice storage discharge and strategically deployed solar PV, was developed. Instead of focusing on an individual building, the developed approach considers both technical and economic benefits of the whole distribution network by focusing on reducing distribution-level peak demand, feeder losses and improving distribution-level load factors, while maintaining occupant comfort in buildings. Models of demand-responsive buildings were developed in EnergyPlus, a whole building energy simulation program. The distribution-level one-line diagram and circuit information were obtained form a utility and modeled in Distribution Engineering Workstation (DEW).    To understand the impact of EV penetration in a distribution circuit, demand responsive commercial building load profiles and field recorded EV charging profiles were added to a real world distribution circuit.

Specifically, this research offers the following contributions to the body of knowledge: (a) Design of an approach to improve the electrical distribution network?s performance with EV penetration through coordinated control of demand responsive commercial buildings, ice storage discharge and strategically deployed PV; (b) Design of an integrated control for small- and medium-sized commercial building demand response (DR) applications (an untapped resource) that can evaluate DR potential for commercial buildings by load type; (c) Development of dynamic plug load models integrated with EnergyPlus, thereby improving its functionalities; (d) Development of EV models, representing real-world charging scenarios, integrated with EnergyPlus; and (e) Design of an integrated automation of ice storage and PV in demand responsive commercial buildings.  By improving distribution network load factors, the developed approach has the potential to increase distribution-level operating efficiency, provide better utilization of existing power distribution assets and defer investments in distribution system upgrades. It offers an insight into building?s peak demand reduction potential as a result of performing load control while maintaining occupant thermal and lighting needs. This research is also expected to benefit building owners/operators by providing an improved understanding of building?s load shapes with end-use load control, PV and ice storage systems.
