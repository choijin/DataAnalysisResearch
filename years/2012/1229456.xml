<AbstractNarration>This award to the University of Chicago is for the development of a unique instrument that will enable simultaneous three-dimensional imaging and optical manipulation of soft material samples and biological cells.   The instrument will combine hybrid Holographic/scanning optical tweezers with an advanced confocal microscope endowed with spectral, thermal, and magnetic control.  The integration will be enabled by a novel approach that combines optical design with 3D printing of instrument parts.   The new instrument will make possible research at the interface of condensed-matter physics, physical chemistry, and biophysics.  Moreover, it will enable new types of investigations in cell biology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of this instrument will have a direct impact on research on the University of Chicago campus, providing previously unavailable capability.  Crucially it will have an impact well beyond the local area.  A significant effort will be dedicated to the integration of optics with three-dimensionally printed support structures that will hold the holographic optical tweezing unit in position on the microscope.  The design will be made available online, enabling the immediate transfer of large portions of the finished instrument via download and printing (in 3D), thus significantly lowering the barrier for reproduction of this instrument at other institutions throughout the world.  In addition, the lessons learned in the technological development of this instrument will be applied, through a combination of high-school and REU outreach, to the design, printing and assembly of both a lower-cost alternative for research and a very low-cost printable microscope kit aimed at bringing advanced science into classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   We developed and constructed CHOMP (a Confocal with Holographic Optical Manipulation in Parallel): a unique instrument that enables simultaneous three-dimensional imaging and optical manipulation of microscopic particles.  Unlike commercially available systems, which can either image in three dimensions (3D) or manipulate in 3D, our instrument is capable of performing both simultaneously. This was achieved by combining a commercially available confocal microscope with custom-designed optical tweezers. In addition, the instrument provides for sample temperature control and the application of magnetic fields to samples. The magnetic field control is achieved by a 3D printed holder for a set of coils that can be seamlessly integrated into any microscope.  A demonstration of the capabilities of CHOMP is provided by the two accompanying images that show a collection of micron-sized fluorescent particles held in place by optical tweezers. In the three-dimensional image freely-floating (non-optically-tweezed) particles can also be seen, these are blurred by the temperature-induced brownian motion they undergo.   The instrument is enabling research at the interface of condensed-matter physics, physical chemistry, and biophysics. Moreover, it enables new types of investigations in cell biology.   In addition to its scientific capabilities, the development of the instrument provided educational opportunities at many levels, from the postdoctoral to the undergraduate. At the graduate student and postdoctoral level, building the instrument provided a tremendous opportunity for training a postdoc and a graduate student in optical design and microscope modification.   At the undergraduate level, it provided an opportunity for training in optical design and 3D fabrication.    To enhance impact for our local and national research infrastructure, we are making the CHOMP microscope available to as many users as possible. We are in the process of creating a new shared instrumentation core facility, the Dynamic Optical Manipulation &amp; Microscopy Laboratory, to house the instrument. The Facility will be managed by our NSF Materials Research Science &amp; Engineering Center (MRSEC). MRSEC currently oversees 9 shared user facilities and has the experience and resources necessary to manage user access, training, and operation of the microscope. Dr. Justin Jureller, manager of the MRSEC Materials Preparation &amp; Measurement Lab (MPML), and Vishal Soni, graduate student in the Irvine group, will initially be responsible for the microscope and facility. The CHOMP microscope and Dynamic Optical Manipulation &amp; Microscopy Laboratory will be advertised on University websites, the MRSEC website, and integrated into the Materials Research Facilities Network (MRFN).
