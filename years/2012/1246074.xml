<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) will investigate the role played by Alfvén waves in heating the solar chromosphere and corona, as well as in excitation of atmospheric oscillations in these layers. To this end, he will pursue a comprehensive study of the generation, propagation, and dissipation of Alfvén waves in the solar chromosphere and corona. The PI will use numerical codes to simulate linear and nonlinear Alfvén and Alfvén-like waves in the solar atmosphere (specifically, transverse and torsional waves within solar magnetic flux tubes) with multidimensional magnetic field geometries. The PI will test these results against available observational data and will develop a theoretical basis for interpretation of the future observations expected from the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) and the current observations from the European GREGOR telescope.  Through this investigation, the PI hopes to identify the principal energy sources of the solar atmosphere and the basic physical processes responsible for creating the heliosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research results will be widely disseminated through the PI's project website, journal publications, and special sessions at major science conferences. The PI will enhance graduate and undergraduate education by directly involving undergraduate and PhD graduate students in this project, and by incorporating this research into existing graduate and undergraduate courses in astrophysics and solar physics. The PI will create demonstrations featuring science results from this effort for a new planetarium located on the campus of the University of Texas at Arlington, reaching out to thousands of K-12 students and large public groups who visit the campus planetarium each year. In addition, all of the PI's computer codes, demonstrations, and preprints will be made available at the project website for other interested researchers and educators to download.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most solar energy needed to sustain life on the Earth comes from the Sun?s photosphere, which is the primary source of all visible radiation coming from the Sun, and often called ?the solar surface?.  Below the photosphere, there is the solar convection zone, where vigorous turbulent motions exist.  However, above the photosphere, there is a tenuous solar atmosphere whose very dynamic structure can be seen  in many observationally collected images of the Sun.  The observations show that the solar temperature reaches minimum in the photosphere and then increases through three atmospheric layers, called chromosphere, transition region and corona. The solar chromosphere is a source of the prominent calcium and magnesium emission lines. There are also strong ultraviolet lines, which are formed in the solar transition region, and intense X-rays and the solar winds that originate in the solar corona. Moreover, each atmospheric layer supports oscillations of different periods and amplitudes. Despite the vast amount of solar data collected during numerous ground and space observations, and significant theoretical efforts, it is still unclear how different regions of the solar atmosphere are heated and why these regions support different atmospheric oscillations.    In our research supported by NSF, we investigated the role of Alfv&eacute;n waves in the problem of heating of different layers of the solar atmosphere, and the origin of solar atmospheric oscillations.  Alfv&eacute;n waves are incompressible and transverse oscillations of magnetic fields that travel along the magnetic field lines; thus, their physical picture resembles oscillating guitar strings. The waves are named after Hannes Alfv&eacute;n, who received a Nobel Prize in 1970 for their prediction. The existence of these waves has been verified in many laboratory experiments but no ground-based observations or space missions could unambiguously prove their existence on the Sun. This observational barrier has been recently broken by the Hinode Solar Obseravatory and the Swedish Solar Telescope, which found clear signatures of Alfv&eacute;n waves in different parts of the solar atmosphere.  The observational verifications of the existence of the waves on the Sun have triggered a lot of their theoretical studies, and our investigation supported by this NSF grant is a prominent part of these studies because it accounts for the generation, propagation and dissipation of Alfv&eacute;n waves in the solar atmosphere.   We performed both analytical and numerical studies of Alfv&eacute;n waves in the solar atmosphere, and our obtained results demonstrate how impulsively generated Alfv&eacute;n waves propagate in the solar atmosphere, how far they can carry their energy, how much of this energy is locally deposited and how much heating and wind acceleration is produced by the wave energy.  We explained the observed spectral line broadening in polar coronal holes, and wind acceleration in the so-called coronal funnels.  Moreover, we predicted the existence of magnetic twisters and plasma swirls, the existence of cutoffs and their role in the wave reflection and tunneling, as well as investigated dipole-shaped eddies in solar magnetic flux tubes, and the excitation of small-scale interacting magnetic vortices as manifestation of solar chromospheric swirls, all related to Alfv&eacute;n waves.   Our main results were already published in 18 refereed papers, and presented to the solar physics and astrophysics communities at 5 different national and international meetings.  As a result of this NSF grant, 2 graduate students were supported by the grant and they completed their PhD degrees, and 4 undergraduate students were also supported by this grant and completed their B.S. degrees. Our research supported by this NSF grant has already played an important role in current efforts to understand the principal energy sources of the solar atmosphere and the basic physical processes responsible for creating the heliosphere, which determines space weather and environment in which our Earth exist.
