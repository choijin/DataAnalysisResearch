<AbstractNarration>The CALIPER Project (Catalyst to Assess Learning and Instructional Practices for Evidence-based Reform) is leveraging Boise State University's recently reformed general education curriculum to transform undergraduate STEM instructional practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the CALIPER project is 1) documenting the use of evidence-based instructional practices in STEM foundational courses; 2) assessing the learning outcomes achieved by students in these courses; and 3) associating these observed instructional practices with the learning outcomes achieved. The Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) is being used to document evidence-based instructional practices. Student work (e.g. written assignments and exams) is being collected and assessed to evaluate the degree to which students achieve intended learning outcomes, such as "apply quantitative reasoning to draw appropriate conclusions" and "understand the process of inquiry and analysis in response to evidence." This process is building a sustainable assessment system for collecting and analyzing data to understand the relationship between instructional practices and student learning outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By integrating assessment of evidence-based instructional practices and student learning outcomes, the CALIPER project is informing the national dialogue on effective education of future STEM professionals and a more scientifically literate citizenry. Successful implementation and dissemination of this model will provide both an incentive and a roadmap for other educational institutions that wish to take effective action to improve STEM learning for their students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The initial goals of the CALIPER project were to:  1) document the use of evidence-based instructional practices in STEM foundational courses, with a focus on those taken by STEM majors;  2) Assess the learning outcomes achieved by students in these courses; and  3) Associate the instructional practices observed in the courses with the learning outcomes achieved.  As the project evolved over the three-year implementation, the goals expanded to include documenting and analyzing the ways in which faculty members internalize the integration of instructional practices, learning outcomes and assessment. The project also sought to understand the role of faculty development and social networks play in the internalization, integration and implementation of evidence-based instructional practices, assessing and achieving learning outcomes. The final year included the goal of achieving a sustainable assessment system to gather and analyze data to understand the relationship between instructional practices and achieved student learning outcomes.  Structured observations of teaching (Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol RTOP) and assessment of learning outcomes were collected over a three year period.  Faculty participants engaged in workshops to gain knowledge of evidence-based instructional practices, intended learning outcomes and assessment strategies.   While we cannot compare RTOP scores between participants across the three years of the research study, 15 individuals participated in multiple years.  In most cases, their scores increased,  The narratives analyzed for the forthcoming article (Stieha, McGuire, Shadle, in progress) indicate intentional efforts to integrate active learning practices to increase scores.  Narratives also reveal faculty reported increases in studentsÆ learning performance (e.g. fewer students dropping or failing the course).  Efforts to quantitatively compare Year 1 assessment data resulted in our understanding that, while we could not draw statistical data from the report, asking faculty to connect teaching activities and assessment reporting highlighted these previously disconnected processes for the participants.   Assessment activities contributed to establishing a four-phased system of learning outcomes reporting and a vehicle for collecting that data (see http://academics.boisestate.edu/fsp/university-learning-outcomes/assess/) for our general education courses (including STEM courses).  Importantly, knowing that our own STEM faculty contributed to the development and pilot stages of the assessment reporting system has been pivotal in its acceptance elsewhere in the curriculum.  A great deal of insight was gained as to how faculty members respond to the experience of being observed and having their teaching "measured".  Our data illuminate the institutional levers (e.g., the request for learning outcomes documentation, the use of an observation instrument) that had impacts on faculty at the individual level. While we seek to institutionalize a culture in which faculty pedagogy is linked to assessment and learning outcomes, our results make clear that this culture shift involves supporting individual faculty to make these connections in an authentic way.  Our analysis makes clear that one very important influence on faculty pedagogical choices is the connections that faculty members have with each other.  Thus, as we continue our work to build a culture of evidence-based practice and authentic assessment of learning outcomes, it is clear we must attend to the network of teaching colleagues.
