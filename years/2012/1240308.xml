<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1240308&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Paul D. Ronney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to help support travel and living expenses for about 25 graduate (and possibly undergraduate) students to attend the 34th International Symposium on Combustion and present their research at that venue. All students supported by this grant will be (i) U.S. citizens or permanent residents (ii) Full-time Ph.D. students at an accredited U. S. university (iii) Supported by their academic advisor, as evidenced by a letter of recommendation, and (iv) An author or co-author of a contributed paper accepted by the Program Committee. NSF funds are targeted to increase the participation of graduate students at the meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combustion research is a multi-disciplinary field encompassing diverse disciplines in engineering and science. Society relies on combustion for power generation, transportation, and manufacturing. The combustion symposium provides a forum for international exchange of technical ideas. Policymakers will also be in attendance to participate in the exchange of information. The intellectual merit of this activity arises from the participation of international combustion experts from various countries, dissemination of their technical findings, their communications with students, and their visions of future research directions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 80% of the world's energy production and use is based on the combustion of fossil fuels. Combustion is ubiquitous in traditional energy conversion systems such as automotive engines, stationary and aircraft gas turbines, rocket and space propulsion, electrical power generation, industrial furnaces, and home and institutional space heating. Moreover, emerging technology areas such as hypersonic propulsion, micro scale power generation and material synthesis depend critically on chemically reacting flow processes. The world's dependence on combustion processes has led to many technological challenges including air quality, energy efficiency, global warming, and fire/explosion safety. Thus, combustion is an active, vital area of research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over 80% of the worldÆs energy production and use is based on the combustion of fossil fuels.  Combustion is ubiquitous in traditional energy conversion systems such as automotive engines, stationary and aircraft gas turbines, rocket and space propulsion, electrical power generation, industrial furnaces, and home and institutional space heating.  Moreover, emerging technology areas such as hypersonic propulsion, microscale power generation and material synthesis depend critically on chemically reacting flow processes.  The worldÆs dependence on combustion processes has led to many technological challenges including air quality, energy efficiency, global warming, and fire/explosion safety.  Thus, combustion is still an active, vital area of research.  The International Symposium on Combustion is by far the largest and most important international meeting for dissemination of the results of basic and applied combustion research.  It is held biannually, in a different location each time.  Practically all of the most published, most cited and most respected members of the international combustion research community attend this Symposium.  Students attending this Symposium have a unique opportunity to meet these members of the community, discuss their research with them, and exchange ideas with both senior researchers as well as their student peers from around the world.  Thus, it is almost essential that fledgling combustion researchers attend the Symposium and present their work therein.   This project supported travel for 22 students to the 34th International Symposium on Combustion, held from July 29 to August 3, 2012.  The Symposium included a full 5-day agenda including 1 keynote speaker, 4 plenary lectures, 4 topical review lectures, more than 350 contributed oral presentations (which had undergone a full rigorous peer review process; less than 40% of the submitted papers were accepted).  All students supported by this grant were  U.S. citizens or permanent residents Full-time students (priority was given to Ph.D.      students) at an accredited U. S. university Supported by their academic advisor, as evidenced      by a letter of recommendation An author or co-author of a contributed paper      accepted by the Symposium Program Committee.   A request for applications was advertised via the Combustion Institute website (http://www.combustioninstitute.org) and email announcements were sent to the US section members of the Combustion Institute.  The applications included:  A letter of endorsement by the academic advisor  A list of other potential funding available to attend the Symposium  Complete mailing address and e-mail address   The Combustion Institute supported this project by  Posting the announcement on its server Sending emails advertising the support to the      appropriate US members Collecting the applications and forward them to the      PI for approval and payment via USC        Last Modified: 01/10/2013       Submitted by: Paul D Ronney]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
