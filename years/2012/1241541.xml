<AbstractNarration>The CybercorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at California State University San Bernardino (CSUSB) promotes cybersecurity excellence through a dynamic curriculum, unique applied learning requirements, and a diverse student population. The curriculum is designed around the needs of government organizations seeking well-qualified students. While many SFS programs across the country focus on policy; management of technology; or secure programming, design and development; CSUSB has created a curriculum that combines the elements of various programs, including some elements of national security studies. A typical CSUSB Cybercorps student is well versed in cyber security policy, tactics, threat analysis, counter intelligence, networking, database, offensive and defensive hacking and penetration testing, and forensics, all with applied professional experiences.  All SFS Cybercorps students are challenged in a variety of ways including SCADA security; cyber defense and forensics competitions; and extracurricular activities such as social engineering, physical security, and intelligence gathering. CSUSB's service area is richly populated with residents from diverse ethnic backgrounds, including those groups that are currently underrepresented in cybersecurity field. Most CSUSB Cybercorps students are first generation minority students, transferring from community colleges, often from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds, coming to college less academically and socially prepared than their non-first generation peers. From tutoring to etiquette to professional behavior, CSUSB places great emphasis on ensuring this diverse student cohort (50% Hispanic, and 43% female) learns the skills necessary to successfully obtain and retain professional employment. The CSUSB Cybercorps program's 98% placement rate supports the federal cybersecurity mission.</AbstractNarration>
