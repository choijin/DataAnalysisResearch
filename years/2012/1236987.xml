<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this program is to explore the feasibility of photonic devices on paper substrates, with the ultimate goal of developing a new paradigm of ultra low cost photonics printed on paper using roll-to-roll approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is in combining of one of the oldest and most widely utilized natural materials ? paper (cellulose) ? with one of the newest and most exciting categories of devices ? photonics. Paper is a very attractive substrate material for selected device applications: very low cost, available in almost any size (from pre-cut to roll-to-roll), versatile (surface finishes can greatly alter its properties), portable (light weight) and flexible. The photonics-on-paper is a transformative concept that has possibility of revolutionizing the field of photonics by enabling ultra low cost fabrication of integrated chips on the most ubiquitous renewable and biodegradable material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader national impacts are: (a) potential revival of the American photonics industry, which has experienced loss of initiative and market share to Asia-based competitors, through close collaboration with American paper companies; (b) potential for using low-cost photonics in the developing world, where cost is paramount; (c) significant step forward in the development of ?green? devices through the use of a renewable natural material as a major component. The broader local impacts are: (d) involvement of undergraduate engineering students in research projects through specifically designed capstone ?senior projects? in Electrical Engineering; (e) increase in underrepresented student participation through the Emerging Ethnic Engineers Program and the Rowe Center for Women.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall objective of this project is the demonstration of the integration of photonics onto low-cost flexible paper substrates.  To demonstrate the feasibility of this general direction a specific target was selected, namely the integration of organic optoelectronic components with paper-based lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices intended for lab-on-chip based applications. This goal was pursued with several tasks:  Light source integration: organic light emitting diode (OLEDs) integrated with fluorescent quantum dot based LFIA for better sensitivity. Light detector integration: Organic photodiodes (OPDs) integrated as detectors with OLEDs as light source for LFIAs.    Potential applications for this integration technology will be rapid and quantitative detection of biomarkers. By accomplishing these goals an assay with good sensitivity may be obtained.  In this project OLEDs were integrated as light sources in conjunction with fluorescent lateral flow immunoassays. Such an integration will improve the visual sensitivity and hence the limit of detection. OLEDs can be fabricated on plastic or paper that can be integrated within the LFIA device.The resulting integrated device ise self-contained, disposable and easily fabricated.  A significant improvement in signal intensity, contrast and limit-of-detection (LOD) was achieved in integrated OLED devices compared to conventional LFIA. The LOD for OLED-excited QD-LFIA was a concentration of ~3 nM compared to 21 nM for the conventional LFIA, or a 7&times; improvement. Combined with other attractive factors of LFIA and OLEDs, such as low cost and large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturability, these results show that integrating OLEDs in paper-based diagnostic system is a high potential path for lab-on-chip device applications.
