<AbstractNarration>Water management in south Florida is characterized by the need to balance multiple objectives. Among the objectives are the maintenance of high groundwater levels to limit seawater intrusion and flood control measures that are also used to mitigate  dry-season water shortages. In addition, south Florida's current population of 6 million is projected to grow to 10 million over the next 20 years, and urban water demand must be reliably managed. In this exceptionally vulnerable region, sea level rise and salt water intrusion have already impacted drinking water supplies and threaten the integrity of low-lying and highly-valued built and natural environments as diverse as Miami Beach and the Everglades. Long-term adaptive strategies are needed to ensure sustainable water resources for expanding populations, agriculture, and wetlands that serve multiple functions, including support of Florida's fishing industry. Development of such strategies has been hampered by conflicting stakeholder interests and technical, economic, and political challenges. This project will conduct highly interdisciplinary research, utilizing the expertise of multiple institutions, to investigate the hydrologic, economic, ecologic, and human behavioral dimensions of sustainable water management and land use planning under various climate change, economic, population, and sea level rise scenarios. The research will employ hydro-economic optimization approaches based on robust decision making to develop management strategies that ensure the resilience of water supplies for the built and natural systems, while also accounting for the broad-sector value of water use. Optimization criteria will incorporate the results of project research linking water management, ecological function, and the economic value of ecosystem services. New experimental approaches will be implemented to better understand the impacts of scenario information type and uncertainty on both selection of decision criteria and evaluation of model predictions among individuals and groups of local stakeholders. These experiments are designed to improve understanding of the roles of cognitive and perceptual biases in decision-making when stakeholders examine hydro-economic projections coupled with scenario forecasts. Comparative behavioral analyses of stakeholder evaluations and institutional decision-making will provide unique insights into how information type, information content, and cognitive biases combine to influence risk perception, and how the perceived risks to individual and collective well-being influence scenario selection. Finally, with agency and stakeholder involvement, the project will collaboratively develop recommendations for adaptive water management plans that foster long-term support from the stakeholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-lying coastal regions subject to sea level rise, climate change, and diverse water demands, including growing populations, will benefit from the development of innovative, pragmatic approaches to optimizing the social-ecological benefits of water resources allocation. The research will include novel approaches for dynamically incorporating economics into stakeholder evaluations of adaptive land use and water management strategies. Local, state, and federal agencies responsible for managing south Florida"s water resources will benefit from analyses of adaptive schemes that explicitly incorporate uncertainty estimates of potential outcomes. The multiple societies that exist in south Florida, whose options for managing public water resources are limited by climatic, physical, and/or legal constraints, require this type of integrated assessment to promote cooperative decision-making while preparing for uncertain hydro-climatic conditions and socioeconomic futures.</AbstractNarration>

Wetland restoration often involves re-flooding drained wetlands to meet historic or target hydro pattern regimes. Drained wetland soils can lose soil C more easily through aerobic microbial respiration and therefore often store less soil C long term.As is the case with the current study, many restoration efforts lack information on pre-restoration soil C levels or how much SOM may have been lost during if systems were previously drained.&nbsp; The data from this study suggest that preserving land cover of C-dense systems such as bay swamps may have a higher net C storage benefit than restoring degraded marshes, which generally store less soil C.&nbsp; However, marshes account for a much larger portion of the landscape in the Northern Everglades region, and restoring hydrology of marshes, including riverine marshes accounts for the majority of wetland restoration efforts in the region.&nbsp; Varying services of different types of wetlands are often ignored for wetland mitigation, which can result in a net loss of ecosystem services in some instances, but C sequestration goals could be targeted to wetland types based on their sequestration value.Hydrologic restoration is important for improving ecological condition of drained or degraded wetlands and several projects such as the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Program (CERP), Conservation Reserve Program, and the Northern Everglades Payment for Environmental Services program aim to increase water storage in the Everglades watershed. These programs target water quality and hydrologic services but their potential to increase soil C storage in the Northern Everglades watershed is unclear. Drastic hydrologic restoration of drained wetlands does increase soil C in some, but not all, cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;More important for wetland preservation and restoration efforts is the recognition that SOM plays an important role in wetland function and characterization.&nbsp; Returning previously drained wetland systems to a more natural hydrology that increases water retention in the landscape enables wetland communities to sustain long-term patterns of interaction between hydrology, soil, and vegetation.&nbsp; Forested swamps, particularly mixed hardwood and bay swamps, store large amounts of soil C that are critical to the function of these systems and that serve an important role in soil C sequestration at the landscape scale.&nbsp; Freshwater marshes occupy a larger landscape area than swamps, and thus contribute important to hydrologic functions at the landscape scale, but generally do not store as much soil C as swamps.&nbsp; Water and wetland policies that aim to restore hydrology or increase water retention in the landscape help sustain these wetland functions but their effects on soil C storage will depend on what type of wetland community, degree of inundation, and historical patterns of organic matter accumulation and loss.&nbsp; This study advances base knowledge in this field by providing insights on hydrologic and ecological controls on carbon storage in a large restoration landscape. The results from this project provide information that may be useful for any future public policies that relate to managing, crediting, or evaluating wetland carbon storage, particulary in the Northern Everglades ecosystem.The project supported one full-time Master's student (Alicia Huber) with a year-round research assistantship, and also supported and a post baccalaureate research assistant.&nbsp; The graduate student continued to gain expertise in wetland ecology, soil carbon dynamics and sequestration, and handling basic hydrology data.&nbsp; She also developed leadership skills by interviewing and hiring several undergraduate students, training and supervising them, and organizing them in a significant field sampling campaign. She is now an environmental scientist with a major environmental consulting firm, who hired her based on significant technical skills she acquired while working on this project.&nbsp; These skill included significant ecological field experience, mastery of ArcGIS and large geographic databases, and complex data analysis involving model building and analysis using advances algorithms in the R statistical package.&nbsp; The project involved training of several undergraduate research students, who are listed in the "Participants" sections. These students received in-depth training and experience in: field sampling techniques; proper use of accurate global position systems for navigating to and marking sampling waypoints; scientific record keeping; understanding rigorous sampling designs; and laboratory techniques for basic soil sample processing.&nbsp; Alicia Huber organized a journal club for the undergraduate students in the 2016 fall semester, in which the students are reading primary peer-reviewed scientific articles on the subject of carbon dynamics and sequestration in wetland ecosystems, and are then participating in 1-2 hour long discussions of those articles with the graduate student and project PI.&nbsp; Two of these students have gone on to graduate school, including one who will begin a graduate program in a wetland biogeochemistry lab in fall 2019.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/08/2019<br>      Modified by: Patrick&nbsp;Bohlen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div
