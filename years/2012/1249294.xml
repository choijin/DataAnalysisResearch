<AbstractNarration>The University of California at Oakland is awarded a grant for planning workshops develop and implement the University of California Natural Reserve System (UC NRS) Strategic Plan that will build capacity in the UC NRS to improve science by developing shared vision and expertise across the Reserve System. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 1965 the UC NRS has offered unique opportunities to study California's world-renowned, diverse ecosystems through a system of 38 natural reserves, research centers and gateway reserves dedicated to teaching, research, and public service and spans more than 750,000 acres with access to millions of additional acres of federal lands. The UC NRS provides strong legacies of data, land, specimens, and accumulated knowledge, and promotes convergence of disciplines and cross-fertilization typical of 21st-century science. Such legacies represent an essential framework for documenting and understanding the nature and pace of ecosystem, regional, and global changes in environmental conditions, ecological processes, and biodiversity. As California's population growth continues to be the highest in the country the UC NRS is critical to understanding natural phenomena at multiple spatial scales and informing stewardship of the state's resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of today's most pressing scientific questions, including how climate change and population growth will affect California's plant and animal species and ecosystem functions providing essential ecosystem services. Planning for a fully integrated informatics and collaboration infrastructure to catalyze more effective long-term, cross-site integrative research motivated by comprehensive scientific studies will capitalize on the diversity of data and intellectual resources encompassed by the UC NRS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UC Natural Reserves are well utilized by individuals and institutions at every educational level within California, from K-12 up through all units of the state higher education system. The reserves serve as important training centers for students and teachers and as research platforms for a variety of individuals and organizations concerned with advancing understanding and appreciation of the natural environment. Research and education within the UC NRS are widely publicized in scholarly journals and books, technical reports, conference proceedings and presentations, and in media ranging from the web to radio, television, documentaries, newspapers, and other forms of dissemination. Strategic planning will help ensure that research and teaching conducted at the UC NRS reserves uses collaborative technologies that enable integrative ecological science research as well as informed resource management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the University of California Natural Reserve System please visit: http://nrs.ucop.edu/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Founded in 1965, the UC Natural Reserve System (NRS) is the largest university-managed suite of protected natural areas in the world. Consisting of 39 sites and more than 765,000 acres in California, the NRS provides a unique opportunity to conduct field research, educate students, engage the public, and conserve CaliforniaÆs biodiversity.  The mission of the UC Natural Reserve System is to:  Contribute to the understanding and wise stewardship of the Earth and its natural systems by supporting university-level teaching, research, and public service at protected natural areas throughout California.  Additionally, the University is designated under the California Environmental Quality Act as a Trustee Agency with regard to sites within the NRS. As one of only four designated Trustee Agencies, the University bears a fiduciary responsibility to the State of California to manage and use the NRS reserves in a manner that protects the long-term integrity of the reservesÆ natural resources, avoids significant impacts on the reservesÆ environment, and seeks to prevent such impacts on the reserves by others.  A Strategy for Excellence in Environmental Stewardship: The NRS Systemwide Office has devoted a significant portion of the last three years to the identification and articulation of a strategy of stewardship that will define the first decade of its next 50 years. More than 150 stakeholders from the NRS community, dispersed across much of the state, were engaged in the development of this Strategy for their comments, advice, and vision. Emerging from this strategic planning process is the vision that the NRS will strive to:    Vision  Serve as the global leader in university-managed protected areas, field stations, marine laboratories, and research centers to achieve scientifically and ethically responsible stewardship of the worldÆs biodiversity.  2015&ndash;2025 Goals   To achieve leadership position outlined in the vision, the NRS has set eight goals and identified 40 initiatives to achieve the goals. The timeline for implementation is 2015&ndash;2025. This strategy will be regularly reviewed and course corrections made when appropriate.  The goals are:  Goal 1:  Achieve financial sustainability  Goal 2:  Develop a fully coordinated, high-functioning NRS faculty and staff  Goal 2a: Develop a smooth-functioning administrative structure  Goal 2b: Develop uniform but flexible job descriptions  Goal 3:  Articulate and disseminate more broadly the value and influence of the NRS by all key stakeholders, the general public, and the broader global community of land stewards and natural and conservation scientists and practitioners  Goal 4:  Train the University community of students and scholars in the natural, physical, and social sciences to ensure responsible decision-making affecting the worldÆs environments  Goal 5:   Engage groups that are not well represented in the conservation community in environmental stewardship  Goal 6: Encourage the arts and humanities at NRS reserves   Goal 7: Continue to foster world-class scientific research while supporting investigations addressing climate change and the effects of climate on CaliforniaÆs biodiversity  Goal 8: Exceed NRS stakeholder expectations for meeting the responsibilities of environmental stewardship and ecosystem protection.  Implementation: The NRS Systemwide Office will begin implementation of this strategy for excellence in environmental stewardship by working in partnership with the Universitywide NRS Advisory Committee to prioritize the initiatives identified here and develop an implementation plan. Once the priority list has been developed, the NRS Systemwide Office will work closely with willing faculty, managers, and staff to finalize a work plan to which each committee will be held accountable. NRS Systemwide staff will participate in each committee. The NRS Systemwide Director will report regularly to the UC Office of the President upper administration, and a yearly ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
