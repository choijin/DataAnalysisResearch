<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of graduate students and postdocs attending the Advances in Nonlinear Science  that will be held on March 14-16,  2013, on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop aims to bring together leading experts and researchers in nonlinear partial differential equations (both on the applied and theoretical sides), with an emphasis of the Theme Semester on the modern game theory with applications. The proposed conference builds on the relevance and applications of stochastic methods applied to non-linear partial differential equations that stem for recent developments in game theory. The keynote speakers  have been confirmed and represent top figures in mathematics. These are: E. DiBenedetto of Vanderbilt University, R.V. Kohn of New York University, L. Mahadevan of Havard University and G. Strang of MIT. Between 30-40 participants are expected to participate in the workshop, the majority of whom will be from outside of the University of Pittsburgh. Special attention will be paid to the recruitment of women and minorities participants.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop aimed to bring together leading researchers in nonlinear partial differential equations, both on the applied and theoretical sides, with an emphasis of the Theme Semester. The main topics range from the classical regularity theory, to the deterministic game theoretic interpretation of motion by mean curvature and other PDEs, aspects of mathematical biology pertaining to the organization of matter in space and time, and signal processing and computational science, including as well: random tug-of-war games, stochastic homogeneization, viscosity solutions, numerical solutions of non-linear PDE, and symmetrization.  The workshop hosted 15 speakers, with research emphasis related to the topic of the Semester and including: game theory, probability, p-harmonic theory and calculus of variations.

Smart , Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Scaling limits of the Abelian Sandpile   Yifeng Yu , University of California Irvine  Flame front quenching and homogenization of a non-convex and non-coercive Hamilton Jacobi equation   The abstracts of all lectures are available from the conference website: http://www.math.pitt.edu/~lewicka/Semester_GamesPDE_13/adv_non_sci_workshop.html  The workshop was well-attended, with about 50 mathematicians participating. Among them, 22 mathematicians were offered financial support to cover their hotel and transportation expenses. Of them, 15 were students and young postdocs, and 4 were young faculty members at the beginning stages of their careers.
