<AbstractNarration>Due to the resources required to support student labs, experiments are rarely designed with sufficient time for students to explore concepts on their own. Nor is the laboratory equipment available to students outside of proscribed hours because it is needed for too many classes, is too hard to use without supervision, and is, in some cases, too fragile and easily damaged. However, the continued revolution in electronic miniaturization is making possible portable, low-cost, robust experimental platforms that allow for ubiquitous hands-on experiences for students anywhere and anytime - integrated with lectures in the classroom on campus or online, as assignments in take-home project, or when students want to try out their own ideas. Ubiquitous hands-on experiments enable a new pedagogical model that promotes a more complete integration of theory, design, and practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mobile Hands-On STEM (MOHS) project is a collaboration among Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, University of Albany, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Howard University, and Morgan State University. The project is developing standardized assessment tools for the mobile hands-on-learning experiences in order to measure student learning as well as its ease of adoption by instructors. The project is building a community of practice composed of developers, users, industry partners, and commercial device suppliers in order to share information across a large, diverse collection of schools and across a diverse set of portable experimental platforms. Building on this community of practice, the project is holding workshops for both instructors who currently use mobile hands-on education and for new instructors to introduce them to mobile hands-on learning. This proactive dissemination strategy gives the project insight into the barriers to adoption and helps form the next steps toward wide dissemination.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Remarkable progress has been made in the development and implementation of hands-on learning in STEM education. The mantra of <em>See One, Do One, Teach One</em> overly simplifies the idea but does provide a helpful structure to understand how many engineering educators are attempting to change the learning experience of our students. Until recently, this effort has been faced with a major limitation. We can easily incorporate traditional paper and pencil and numerical analysis, synthesis, and simulation in our classrooms. However, the remaining key aspect of doing the job of an engineer &ndash; experimentation &ndash; has only been included through the use of expensive and limited-access lab facilities. Small, low-cost Mobile Hands-On STEM (MHOS) learning platforms (e.g., mobile personal instrumentation and control devices like NI&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>myRIO &amp;</em> <em>myDAQ, </em>&nbsp;Digilent&rsquo;s <em>Analog Discovery</em> and Analog Devices <em>ADALM1000 &amp; ADALM2000 </em>and processors/microcontrollers like <em>Arduino, Raspberry Pi, </em>Cypress&rsquo;s<em> PSoC</em><strong>, </strong>Arm&rsquo;s<em> Mbed, </em>TI&rsquo;s<em> LaunchPad</em>) provide unlimited opportunities to solve this remaining problem in engineering courses. Pedagogy based on these tools has been successfully implemented and studied in many institutions in the US and elsewhere, impacting thousands of students each year. This has occurred&nbsp; even in traditionally theory-only courses, resulting in more engaged students and instructors.
