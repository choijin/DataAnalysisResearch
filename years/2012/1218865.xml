<AbstractNarration>In 2009 the American Academy for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) held a workshop/meeting that included a representative segment of the nation's biology university and college faculty (500 attendees in all) in a discussion of the need for change in the way we approach biology undergraduate education in light of the vast changes in the discipline itself.  That meeting resulted in a 2011 publication, Vision and Change in Biology Undergraduate Education: A Call for Action, that has, so far, been distributed to more than 6000 people and a web page that has had about 5,000 hits.  The essential outline and general contents of the publication reflect the discussions at the 2009 meeting and were, in fact, written by a consortium of attendees.  That meeting and the subsequent dissemination of its findings benefitted from the support of representatives from the National Institute of Health, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the National Academy, and the Directorates of Biology and of Education and Human Resources within NSF.  The current project is a follow up to the initial effort and fulfills a request by meeting attendees to determine the community's response to the meeting and its publications (both in print and on the web).  Representatives of the United States Department of Agriculture have joined the group planning this meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This project involves a large segment of the biology community.  It is concerned with discovering how change occurs within biology undergraduate education and covers such topics as: what have faculty, institutions of higher education, and professional societies done in response to the widespread call for change; what were the outcomes of these actions for change; how were these outcomes documented; and has the unit of change included more than just one or two faculty members to involve a department or set of departments in a coordinated effort to change teaching approaches within courses and across the department.  This sort of information can provide a useful base for educational researchers interested in describing change efforts in academia, as well as provide information to interested faculty and institutions on how to uccessfully institute new approaches in teaching their discipline.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The breadth of institutions, fields within biology, and faculty that are included speaks for the broader impact of this project.  In addition AAAS serves all STEM disciplines so the publicity given this effort can result in other disciplines trying similar efforts to improve their approaches to undergraduate education.  The original effort has already catalyzed an interest from the engineering community.  The fact that recent published efforts by both the American Academy of Medical Colleges (as concerns the preparation of pre-medical and medical students) and the Educational Testing Service (as concerns AP Biology) mirror the concerns and suggestions within the original Vision and Change publication heightens community interest in the results of this seminal meeting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  To capture what was happening as a result of the Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education initiative started in 2006, AAAS and its advisors and collaborators implemented a project to:  ***Chronicle outcomes of the 2011 report (http://visionandchange.org/files/2013/11/aaas-VISchange-web1113.pdf) and the initiative;  ***Document the trajectory of change following the report; and  ***Identify a set of exemplars of how the community could accomplish the changes needed in a variety of institutions.  Data and information was collected via online project abstract submissions, conference registration, and posters and presentations at the 2013 Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology: Chronicling the Changes Conference. The Vision and Change conference served as a vehicle for bringing together faculty, administrators, staff in teaching and learning centers, and graduate students and postdocs to identify strategies related to:  ***How to lead change;  ***How, as a faculty member (including all instructional staff), to be an agent of change;  ***How to change the student experience;  ***How to build networks for change;  ***How to amass evidence of change; and  ***How to use the evidence amassed to evaluate change.  Questions in the abstract and in the online conference registration tool focused on identifying:  ***How the Vision and Change report was being used to promote change at both the departmental and the institutional level;  ***Challenges encountered in instituting change;  ***The course level(s) at which strategies are being focused;  ***The type of approaches that are being used to change undergraduate biology education; and  ***Sources of funding for change activities.  Also, Google Scholar was used to identify citations of the Vision and Change report and its presence on the World Wide Web.  Broader Impacts  (A) With the help of professional societies and collaborative efforts such as the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (PULSE), the Vision and Change report is penetrating the biology community.  We have distributed over 8,500 copies of the 2011 Vision and Change report via conferences and request from individuals and the number of Google Scholar citations related to the report is 401 as of the end of August 4, 2016.  The Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: Chronicling Change, Inspiring the Future report was released in August 2015. We have distributed over 2,400 copies of the 2015 Vision and Change follow-up report via conferences and request from individuals and the number of Google Scholar citations related to the report is 7 as of the end of August 4, 2016 (http://visionandchange.org/files/2013/11/aaas-VISchange-web1113.pdf).  (B) Between 2010 and August 3, 2016, Google analytics indicates that Vision and Change website has had 84,673 sessions: 60,649 users, and almost 182,000 page views.
