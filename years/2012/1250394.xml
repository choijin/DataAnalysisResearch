<AbstractNarration>Technical description.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In this project, we apply quantum cascade laser infrared absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS) to precisely measure abundance of doubly isotope-substituted methane (13CH3D) as a new and robust proxy for the source of methane in geologic environments.  On the first order, 13CH3D abundance would indicate the temperature at which the methane was produced or internally equilibrated for its 13C-D bond abundance.  On the second order, kinetic process may produce different clumped isotope effect that may be used to fingerprint unique processes, as has been seen for the 13C16O18O system.  The QCLAS instrument has already been installed in the PI's laboratory and the precision of 0.1 to 0.5 permil have been achieved for four major isotopologues of methane (12CH4, 13CH4, 12CH3D, and 13CH3D).  The goal of the project is to further optimize the QCLAS and sample inlet system, and calibrate the 13CH3D clumped isotope thermometry scale by using thermally scrambled methane (&gt;200 °C) as well as microbially produced methane (&lt;100°C).  Some geologic methane will be analyzed as a pilot study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tunable laser spectroscopy is an emerging new technology only recently applied in the field of stable isotope geochemistry.  This research explores its application to precise measurements of isotopologue species that are technically challenging by conventional magnetic sector-isotope ratio mass spectrometry instruments.  Applications of this new technology are not limited to 13CH3D, and it could be applied to other clumped isotopologue systems (e.g., CO2, N2O and SO2).  The proposed project will facilitate the close collaboration between Aerodyne Inc. (US small business) and MIT, as well as other US and international collaborators, for the development of new generation isotope monitoring equipment. One graduate student will actively participate in development and be trained as a future isotope geochemist with a strong instrumental background in this emerging new optical technology. This project will be included in undergraduate class materials.  This project also helps to add to scientific infrastructure via development of an instrument that will be available to researchers at MIT and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methane is both an alternative energy source as well as being a potent greenhouse gas. It is likely to play a significant role in future diversification of our energy resources through new harvesting technologies such as fracking.  Further harvesting of methane has the potential for increase release of methane to the atmosphere, which may impact climate.  The project outlined in this proposal is for the development of a new, lower-cost method to measure carbon and hydrogen isotope abundances in methane from natural sources (e.g. wetlands, permafrost) and anthropogenic sources (e.g. agriculture).  These measurements can provide us with a far better understanding of methane cycling, which may have implications for environmental management of methane.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Methane is an important energy resource as well as significant greenhouse gas. Our goal was to develop a new geochemical tool that allows us to identify sources and sinks, and the temperature at which methane was generated.   Methane is a simple molecule made of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms.  Carbon has two isotopes (13C and 12C) and hydrogen has two (1H and 2H or deuterium, D). Thus, methane can come in a series of isotope configurations called isotopologues.  Researchers have measured singly substituted isotopologues 13CH4 and 12CH3D and used them as a tool to fingerprint its sources.  Recent studies suggested that measurements of doubly substituted species, 13CH3D provide a novel and further information about the source of methane. In general, isotope measurements provide information about the sources of carbon and hydrogen atoms, and how they are fractionated by natural processes. Isotopologue measurement provides information about the source of C-H bonds, which is directly related to the methane formation.  At the time this project was proposed, however, there was no instrument capable of measuring the isotopologue ratios accurate enough to be useful. This is because of its low abundance (about 6 ppm) and mass-interference from formation of adduct ions, 13CH5+ in the ion source.    In this project, we applied a tunable infrared direct absorption spectroscopy instrument (TILDAS) for precise measurements of clumped methane isotopolouge (13CH3D).  During the project period, we 1) constructed an inlet manifold that allows static operation (as opposed to continuous flow as normally TILDAS is used), 2) established a protocol to calibrate isotopologue scale, and 3) established a protocol for measuring natural samples (Ono et al., 2014).  Our research is the first to demonstrate capability of optical measurements for the precise measurement of rare clumped isotopologues.   We then collected methane samples from a variety of sources, including non-conventional gas deposits, coal bed methane, methane hydrate, methane from cows, lake, swamps, and sites associated with serpentinization, and applied this novel technique (Wang et al., 2015). We confirmed that clumped methane isotope is a powerful tool that can tell the temperature of methane formation for a set of samples.  This is extremely useful in terms of natural gas exploration as the information can be used to calibrate the basin model and also put constraints on the timing and depth of gas generation.  We also found methane generated in surface environments (e.g., cows, swamps) carried clear kinetic signals. This signal can be used to distinguish methane formed from active microbial methanogenesis from those generated slowly and stored in geologic environments. This isotopologue systematics was used to identify the source of methane in sites associated with serpentinization.    During the third year of the project, we constructed a flow reactor to culture methanogens to examine the conditions at which methanogens produce kinetic signals.  We also studied isotopologue effects of aerobic methane oxidation, which was published recently (Wang et al., 2016).  We now have a new field open for us to explore isotopologue systematics of methane from a variety of geologic and natural settings.  The TILDAS instrument is smaller and costs less compared to high resolution-mass spectrometry instrument, and can be widely used by other researchers.
