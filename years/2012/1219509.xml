<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding a collaboration between the solid state NMR (ssNMR) group of Gary Drobny at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA, and the optical spectroscopy group of Tobias Weidner at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, Mainz, Germany.  The NSF will be funding the U.S. team and the Deutsche Forshungsgemeinshaft will be funding the German team.  This collaboration is aimed at elucidating to high resolution, the structures of proteins and peptides in biosilica composites. Not only will this research provide an atomic level structural picture of how proteins structure when in contact with silica, but the information will be helpful in understanding how biogenic silica is modeled into elaborate macroscopic structures under relatively mild conditions compared to the extreme conditions (high temperatures, pressures etc.) that are involved in the production and manipulation of anthropogenic silica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are potential long term goal implications of these collaborative studies toward understanding the nature of an important problem in chemical biology; namely peptide-silica interactions and the roles played by peptide secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure as well as amino acid modifications in controlling the morphology of biosilica composites. These approaches will develop further a set of spectroscopic techniques for structurally characterizing proteins as they exist in other types of biomineral composites.  The interdisciplinary and international nature of the collaboration is expected to be beneficial for both the U.S. scientists funded by the NSF and the German scientists funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinshaft.</AbstractNarration>

Synthetic amorphous silica is used today in a wide range of applications: reinforcing fillers in rubber and tires, anti-caking agents in powder materials, and as a carrier for liquid active ingredients in human and animal nutrition. Fused silica glass has been used to produce optical fibers (Figure 1, right upper), where its advantages include: good optical transparency, high mechanical strength, and  chemical stability.  The processing of silica and other hard materials requires extremes in temperature and/or elaborate measures to control shape, porosity, etc.,  all of which are demanding of energy and labor.  Living organisms produce hard tissues composed of inorganic compounds at ambient temperatures and within physiologically relevant pH and pressure ranges by a process called biomineralization. The most abundant mineral of biological origin is biosilica. Figure 2 shows examples of amorphous biosilica morphologies that are formed from dissolved silicic acid by various marine organisms.  Intellectual Merit and Broad Impact   The formation of biosilica morphologies in the diatom and other organisms occurs as a result of regulation by proteins. The intellectual challenge of this project is to determine what specific properties and interactions of proteins with silica are important for silicifying activity,   and how the controlled formation of biosilica morphologies can be duplicated in vitro using small molecule mimics of biosilicification proteins.  The broad impact of our project is to use principles derived from studies of biocilicification proteins to produce hard materials with great control, but at more moderate cost and in an energetically more sustainable way than is the case with current industrial methods.  Research Project Outcomes  In  the diatom, proteins called silaffins are associated with silica production from silicic acid. Silaffin consists of over 260 amino acids, many of which are modified chemically (Figure 3). Silaffin forms silica nanospheres  in vitro. However, small peptide "R domains" derived from silaffin are sufficient for duplicating the silica formation activity of  the intact protein. See Figure 4.  The R5 domain with the amino acid sequence SSKKSGSYGSKGSKRRIL was the objective of our three year study.  To determine the structural properties of R5 in silica composites we used solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (ssNMR). Studies of 2D planar silica deposites were conducted by Sum Frequency generation (SFG) Spectroscopy.  By the end of Year 1 we obtained chemical shift perturbation i.e. "DCS" maps of the R5 peptide in silica. See Figure 5. These DCS maps indicate perturbations of the electronic environment of the peptide side chains due to interactions between atoms in the amino acid side chains of the peptide and surrounding silicon atoms. This information tells us what parts of R5 are important for forming silica.  During Year 2 we also studied LKa14, a peptide designed to assume an a-helical structure at air-water interfaces. Like R5, LKa14 precipitates silica nanospheres, but LKa14 is only 14 amino acids in length and is composed solely of lysines and leucines.   We discovered that LKa14 forms tetrameric bundles. This study shows that peptides with disparate secondary structures likely direct silica morphogenesis via aggregates.  Also during Year 2 we conducted a SFG study of how silica morphology varies with LK peptide structure. See Figure 6. Based on these data and MD simulations we proposed a model of solution precipitation where the distribution of hydrophobic areas on the surfaces of LK peptide aggregates determines the silica morpho...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
