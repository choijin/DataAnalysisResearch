<AbstractNarration>The objectives of the proposed research are to quantify the connection between seasonal warming of arctic surface waters and the absorption of solar energy, and additionally to identify the presence and seasonal cycling of materials responsible for this absorption.  Seasonal changes in the attenuation of solar radiation within the sea ice and upper 30m of the water column will be measured at high temporal resolution (hourly) by a new proof of concept buoy system. Temperature and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) irradiance measurements will be made using optical sensors paired with thermisters within the water column and sea ice. A fluorometer will be used to quantify chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic material (CDOM) and light backscattering within surface waters. These sensors will be used to calculate diffuse attenuation coefficients (Kd) within the ice and water column, and to determine the seasonal cycling of phytoplankton and CDOM under the ice. The relationship between these optical and temperature observations will enable one to constrain the daily water column absorption component of the Arctic heating budget. The ultimate goal of this concept would see a network of these buoys throughout the Arctic, in both ice-covered and open waters. The work plan includes several deployments in multiyear ice, including the Beaufort gyre and the Geomission ice base in early spring. Data at this site will be augmented by additional measurements made whilst at the camp, along with complementary studies by other Geomission projects. Results will be disseminated through collaboration with Science Alliance Live, at Polar Science Weekend, and in curricula at the University of Washington.  Buoy data will also be visualized in near real time on the project website. All data will be submitted within 1 year to CADIS.</AbstractNarration>

The buoy was designed to be robust enough to survive melting out of the ice pack in the summer and refreezing back in to the ice in the fall.  Four of these so-called "WARM" (Warming And iRradiance Measurement) systems have been deployed. Each was deployed in spring on first-year ice (ice that formed the previous winter). To install a buoy, a hole is drilled through the ice floe and the instrument string is lowered through the hole. The attached surface float was then anchored to the surface of the ice. The ice hole refroze within 24 hours, so that the uppermost sensors were within ice. The buoys measured light levels and ambient temperature in the water column through the spring, summer, and fall providing a total of 1781 days of data.  An upward-looking underwater camera on each buoy string captured the changing conditions in the ocean as the ice melted and more light penetrated the water column. The onset of phytoplankton growth was clearly seen in the green color of the ocean. Using mathematical modeling, we were able to determine that the light availability under the ice was sufficient to allow for significant phytoplankton growth.  The seasonal pattern of warming both under the ice and in open water was observed by buoy #3.

The water column did not start to warm up until mid-June when a slow increase in temperature was observed, likely tracking the freezing point as ice melt contributed fresh water to the surface mixed layer. Daily warming and cooling was seen in July and August, with a nascent Near Surface Temperature Maximum (NSTM) layer forming just beneath a colder surface layer.  In August, the buoy dropped into open water and surface temperatures rose above freezing via solar warming.  By September, surface radiative cooling and then ice melt created a deepening surface mixed layer, with a newly formed NSTM layer below.  The WARM buoy provides a unique view of spring-summer-fall upper ocean thermal and radiative structure.       Last Modified: 05/01/2017       Submitted by: Bonnie Light]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
