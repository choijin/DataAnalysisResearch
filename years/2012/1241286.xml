<AbstractNarration>Providing innovative approaches in graduate and postdoctoral training that encompass emerging opportunities in continental ecology is the critical focus of this project. Thirty-two faculty from nearly two dozen universities will combine efforts to develop such a training program that addresses ecological challenges at regional to continental scales. The approach will include the integration of stable isotopes with other datasets and computer models. Stable isotopes play a critical role in evaluating scalable temporal and spatial data streams and allow underlying processes and patterns to be identified and quantified across scales of space and time. Key themes to be addressed include gas exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere, animal migration, ecohydrology, and pathways of photosynthesis and consequences for animal diets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes four elements of training across the participating universities: (1) multidisciplinary and multi-university instruction through two week lecture and laboratory courses, with the first focusing on principles and practices and the second on linking isotopes, processes and patterns, modeling, and scaling; (2) extended hands on training after the courses, where graduate students will obtain additional training and expand their theses through visits and collaborations with course instructors at other universities; (3) inter-university postdoctoral training, focusing on modeling and syntheses across the thematic research areas of migration, carbon cycle, water cycle, and disturbance; and (4) developing, integrating, and disseminating over the web databases, data analysis tools, and training modules to be used by others. Training of cohorts will be sustained through workshops in advance of major scientific meetings and participation with postdocs at the host institutions. Students will also organize sessions at national meetings as a component of their professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide training and network building opportunities to more than 150 graduate students and postdocs over five years, preparing future generations of ecologists to use existing and new isotopic data streams from regional to continental scale ecology programs. Recruitment will emphasize diversity and inclusion of women and members of underrepresented groups in these opportunities. Teaching modules and web products developed by the instructors will be incorporated into courses at their respective home institutions. Data and model synthesis efforts will greatly increase the accessibility of existing large scale isotopic datasets and data analysis tools within and beyond the ecological research community to further help develop the discipline of macrosystem biology.  A formal evaluation framework will guide the improvement of our data and educational products in each of the five years of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Problems addressed by the disciplines of ecology and environmental science are increasing in scale and scope. Most critical challenges in these fields involve interactions across scales and between natural and human systems. Many tools are available to address such challenges, but traditional training programs, which emphasize testing theory using tightly controlled experiments, do not prepare students to use them. In this project we developed a model for training the next generation of scientists to tackle large-scale ecological and environmental science challenges. An annual, intensive, 2-week interdisciplinary summer course was designed to introduce cohorts of graduate students and postdocs to key concepts, skills, and resources supporting deductive, data-intensive science. Students were offered opportunities to extend on their course-based learning through inter-laboratory exchanges in which they could leverage their new knowledge and network to extend on their core graduate research. A cohort of postdoctoral researchers was engaged in the process throughout, serving as instructors and mentors to the student participants, designing tools and assembling data resources used in instruction, and collaborating with a multi-institutional team of faculty to tackle their own large-scale research projects. The Intellectual Merit included the design and demonstration of this multi-tiered, cross-institutional training model. Formal evaluation throughout the program indicated that participants were strongly impacted by their experience, particularly in terms of their sense of belonging and connectedness within the academic community. Numerous disciplinary research discoveries also resulted from the efforts of the postdoctoral researchers and collaborations between students, postdocs, and faculty involved with the program. Major contributions included new quantification of key land-atmosphere fluxes in the water cycle and methods for studying water systems at scales from cities to the globe, and advances in data resources and methods for studying migration patterns using the chemistry of animal tissues. The Broader Impact of the work includes the direct outcomes of the training, which included 130 short course participants (~60% women) and 6 postdoctoral researchers over six years. Instructional content was also disseminated through a series of short &lsquo;podcast&rsquo; type videos.
