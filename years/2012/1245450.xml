<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to change physiology teaching methods not only at SUNY College at Oneonta but also at institutions to which these methods will be disseminated. A new instructional strategy emphasizing an active-learning approach and requiring students to engage in the practice of science is being utilized. This strategy promotes learning through hypothesis testing and involves the use of new technology combined with methods of instruction shown to enhance understanding of fundamental physiological principles. This project involves student use of physiological instrumentation in experiments that test hypotheses derived from highly focused case studies, each of which emphasizes a fundamental physiological concept. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's intellectual merit lies in encouraging the adoption of active-learning pedagogies as well as skirting limitations of large class sizes and limited instructional resources. An expected major outcome is a new conceptual framework for teaching physiology with a set of specific instructional modules that are aligned with the case-study approach. This conceptual framework includes presentation of case studies, deep questioning and instructor intervention, hypothesis testing, and critical analysis/instructor intervention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project are being realized in several ways. First, a website is being constructed to disseminate resources and to create a learning community dedicated to using and promoting this new paradigm in physiology instruction. The case studies, videos of the experiments, and data resulting from the experiments are also being made available to other institutions through this website. Instructors having appropriate resources can utilize this case study approach and replicate the experiments and compare their results; instructors that lack the necessary instructional resources can also utilize this approach using the website to access virtual exercises and data. Additional broader impacts are being realized via preparing scientifically-literate students who are admitted to post-graduate training or direct entry into critical STEM-related careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of the project was to provoke fundamental changes in the way physiology has been typically taught at the undergraduate level.  To this end, the work focused on developing a web site comprised of at least six problem-based learning modules that incorporate two effective instructional strategies:  case studies and instructor intervention.  The project also dealt with assessment of this pedagogy.  Success of the project was dependent on acquiring of state-of-the-art physiology equipment, adapting use of this equipment to problem-based laboratory instruction, developing reliable laboratory exercises, and creating a website to disseminate the learning modules.   The broader impact (beyond the realm of the physiology discipline) of the project is development of a format for laboratory exercises that is an alternative to the "observe and record" formats commonly used in the STEM disciplines.   The learning modules developed from the project are student-focused and engage students in analysis, experimental design, prediction and assessment of experimental outcomes.  Based on student assessments, the newly developed modules were effective in helping students learn basic principles and were viewed as enjoyable by students.  All of the specific aims of the project were achieved.  A total of nine modules were developed, each of which incorporated the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation.  Six of these modules were routinely used in a human physiology course.  A website (http://www.oneonta.edu/rfc/) was developed with the assistance of 13 student assistants, and collaboration with two faculty members from the Art Department.  Four of the modules were made available through the site.  Students enrolled in an advance human physiology course and an introductory human anatomy and physiology course completed and evaluated one of the modules.   Results indicate that the majority of students learned basic concepts and skills and viewed the exercise as effective and enjoyable.   In spite of these successes the project fell short of its goal of disseminating the learning modules to an audience outside of SUNY Oneonta.  It is important to note, however, that all of the necessary resources remain available and the college has pledged to support student assistants from its Art and Biology departments.  The two colleagues from the Art Department agreed to continue work on the project.  Plans are in place to add an additional four modules to the website and release the web site to the public within the next academic year.  New student assistants have been recruited and we are discussing ways to improve the website to make it more interactive (using interactive animations).
