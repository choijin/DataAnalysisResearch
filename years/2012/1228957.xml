<AbstractNarration>This award to the University of Maryland College Park is for the acquisition of a Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) system for the characterization of nanoscale structures in materials.  Nanoscale characterization is a critical step in the design of new materials for applications in areas as diverse as energy, microelectronics, civil infrastructure, defense and health and for the understanding of the basic science underlying these applications.  The SAXS instrumentation will allow the determination of the relationship between structure and function in a very broad range of nanostructured materials, a partial list includes: (i) nanoparticle systems for a broad range of applications; (ii) RNA folding, multi-domain protein and DNA/protein complexes, (iii) novel block copolymer architectures and chemistries and block copolymer templated structures, (iv) nanostructured electrodes for advanced batteries and fuel cells and (v) plasmonic structures for high sensitivity sensors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new SAXS instrument will allow the creation of a multi-user campus and regional state-of-the-art SAXS facility for research and education in the nano- and bio-sciences.  This facility will help to catalyze interactions among physical scientists, biologists, and engineers in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  The facility will further enhance the education and outreach efforts by attracting highly qualified students and faculty to work on interdisciplinary research projects involving nanoscience and technology.</AbstractNarration>
