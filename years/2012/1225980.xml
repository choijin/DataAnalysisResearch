<AbstractNarration>The microbial lifestyle of sulfate reduction is central to the oxidation of organic matter both in the Modern and throughout Earth?s history.  This linkage to the carbon cycle, and in turn climate, is commonly inferred through sulfur isotope studies, which are themselves informed by experiments with extant bacteria that perform this process.  At its core, however, bacteria are driven by a suite of enzymes, or catalysts, that conduct much of the critical chemistry.  In this proposal, investigators look to place the first direct isotopic constraints on the two key enzymatic steps within this metabolism: dissimilatory sulfite reductase [DsrAB/C] and APS oxido-reductase [APSr].  This data will allow for a more mechanistic understanding of cellular fractionation processes, which will then sharpen our capacity to read environmental records.&lt;br/&gt;This research project will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ines Pereira of the Instituto De Technologia Quimica E Biologica, ITQB, Portugal, who will provide the biochemistry expertise necessary for the project. A Harvard graduate student will travel between the Pereira and Johnston's labs, acquiring valuable interdisciplinary training in isotope geochemistry and biochemistry. Travel costs for the international component of this research have been provided by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The stable sulfur isotopes are one of the most powerful vehicles for reconstructing Earth history.  The generation of sulfur isotope varaibility is linked to microbial processes inhabiting marine sediments, where they consume organic matter and generate sulfide.  This sulfide is then transformed to pyrite (or fools gold), where it can be preserved for geological time, and carries the isotopic fingerprint of the microbiological processes active at the time of the mineral formation.   This biological signal is captured in both modern sedimentary pore-waters and minerals throughout geologic time.  Therefore, precise interpretation of isotopic records requires an understanding of the biochemical controls on sulfur isotope fractionation.  Put differently, what is happening within a microbial cell to generate this effect?  Here we provide the first direct measurement of the kinetic isotope fractionation imparted by a central enzyme in the sulfate reduction pathway &ndash; dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB).  During sulfite reduction, the major and minor sulfur isotope fractionations for DsrAB (34&epsilon;DsrAB and 33&lambda;DsrAB) are 15.3&plusmn;1.0&permil; and 0.5150&plusmn;0.0006, respectively. The major isotope fractionation is consistent over a range of temperatures in both Bacterial and Archaeal enzymes. This value is a mere 30-60% of the magnitude of previous estimates (which range 25 to 53&permil;).  This is the first minor sulfur isootpe value reported in the literature.  Direct examination of fractionations imparted by individual enzymes is a fundamental step toward a biochemical foundation for reinterpreting the geobiological sulfur isotope record in modern and ancient systems and, in turn, models for the oxidation of the EarthÃ†s surface.  Finally, and in parallel to characterizing this isotope effect, biochemical studies with these enzyme components, and speciafically DsrC, has allowed us to better understand how these organisms actually gain energy from the use of sulfate. Thus, this NSF award both elucidates modern microbial processes and Earth history.       Last Modified: 11/10/2015       Submitted by: David T Johnston]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
