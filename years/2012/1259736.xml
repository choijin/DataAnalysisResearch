<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to elucidate materials factors that control the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the equiatomic compound FeNi with the chemically-ordered tetragonal L10 structure that holds very high potential for rare-earth-free advanced permanent magnet applications.  Fundamental exploratory research on magnetic alloys in the near-equiatomic compositional region of the Fe-Ni phase diagram will take place in materials with and without the ternary alloying additions of Ti, V, and Al.  These materials will be synthesized in both bulk and thick-film form, with insight gained from film analogs of the focus alloys used to guide rational design of bulk alloys.  Correlations between chemical ordering and magnetic properties such as magnetization, anisotropy and Curie temperature will be determined and quantified to facilitate trend prediction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astronomers have identified the L10 FeNi phase in selected meteorites and attributed its presence to an extraordinarily slow cooling rate that fosters long-range chemical ordering over a period of 4.6 billion years.  Confirmation of the L10 structure in the Fe-Ni system is extremely significant because the tetragonal distortion that accompanies the chemical ordering in this structure gives rise to appreciable anisotropy.  The development of rare-earth-free permanent magnet materials is essential to offset supply limitations and ensure U.S. competitiveness.  Attainment of a rare-earth-free magnetic material with very high magnetocrystalline anisotropy would carry tremendous impact that ranges from the basic science realm all the way to advanced applications of great societal importance.  Students supported by this grant will obtain an interdisciplinary research experience via educational exchange at three geographically diverse, strong science and engineering schools.</AbstractNarration>

For the sub-100 nm period multilayers, the activation energy and pre-exponential term were measured as 1.6&plusmn;0.1 eV and 4&times;10-3 cm2/s, respectively. In order to produce L10 FeNi from the disordered matrix through isothermal annealing at a laboratory time scale, the diffusivity below the reported order-disorder temperature of 320oC must be high enough to allow the phase transformation to proceed at a reasonable rate. The measured diffusivities in Fe/Ni multilayer films are more than five orders of magnitude higher than lattice diffusivity below 320oC, and are comparable to interdiffusivities in Fe/Pt multilayers measured with XRR. Previous reports show that in FePt films the A1 to L10 disorder-to-order transformation is completed within hours at an annealing temperature of 300&deg;C. Therefore, the measured diffusivity in nanocrystalline FeNi is sufficiently high so as to not be the limiting factor for the formation of L10 FeNi. Thus, it is c...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
