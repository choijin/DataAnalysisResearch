<AbstractNarration>An improved understanding of the process of evolutionary genetic adaptation must rely in part on a better understanding of how genetic changes are linked to changes in structural and functional characteristics of organisms (phenotypes) that result in improved reproductive success (i.e., fitness).  However, the relationship between genotype and phenotype is not well understood, limiting an understanding of the evolutionary process. The work funded by this award will investigate the relationship between genotype and phenotype on an unprecedented scale in the bacterium Escherichia coli.  The bacterium has been adapted through artificial selection experiments to thermal stress (42.2 C) for one year in over 100 replicate populations. A clone from each population has been genotyped completely by genomic sequencing.   This grant will characterize the phenotypes of these replicate populations and then relate these phenotypes explicitly to the known genotypes.  The phenotypes that will be measured include patterns of gene expression and features of cell metabolism. Of particular interest will be a contrast between clones that adapted by mutations in either the transcriptional termination gene rho or the RNA polymerase subunit gene rpoB.  The work will determine whether these different genetic solutions lead to similar functional changes in phenotypes and whether the two adaptive pathways are mutually exclusive.  To address the latter issue, mutations of both rho and rpoB will be introduced into a single genetic background, and the evolutionary fitness of double mutants will be determined at high temperature. By characterizing both phenotypic changes and genetic interactions associated with adaptation, this work will impact the heart of evolutionary theory, including classical views on the adaptive process.   In addition, this project will continue a successful outreach project that introduced K-12 teachers to lab modules that facilitate "hands on" teaching of evolution in the classroom, based on the E. coli model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work was designed to better understand the effects and consequences of evolutionary change.  The basis for this project came from previous work in which we evolved the bacterium Escherichia coli to 42 degrees centigrade (C).  E. coli usually grows at 37C, and it barely survives at 42C.  However, over the course of a year at 42C, our bacteria gradually became better able to grow in high temperature and eventually to thrive.   From this previous experiment, we were able to identify the genetic changes that adapted E. coli to high temperature.  The focus of this grant was to better understand the effects of these adaptive mutations. Do these adaptive mutations change the way the bacteria grows?  If so, how?  And are all adaptive mutations alike? The answer to these questions help provide insights into the evolutionary process and have practical consequences for understanding adaptation outside  the lab.  We measured the effects of adaptative mutations in a few ways.  One was growth at different temperatures.  As expected, we found that all of the mutations helped E. coli grow better at high temperatures.  To our surprise, however, some hindered growth at low temperature, while others seemed to have no effect on growth low temperature.  This gave us a unique insight that some adaptive mutations involve trade-offs - i.e, they improve gowth in some conditions but worsen growth in others.  We also learned that not all adaptive mutations are alike in their ultimate effects.   We studied these mutations further using techniques like gene expression.  By examining mutations in one gene (a piece of RNA polymerase that transcribes genes), we found some fairly astounding results.  Just a single mutation in RNA polymerase affects the ultimate expression of thousands of genes.  We found that these mutations of large effect tended to occur early in our evolution experiment; they were like a sledge-hammer that somehow produced the needed effect of better growth at high temperature.  Moreover, they tended to move gene expression from a stressed state (high tempature) to be more like expression when the cell is growing in normal conditions at 37C.  Even more remarkably, we found that once this sledge-hammer effect was produced, evolution tended to make smaller changes thereafter.    We were also able to compare alternative pathways to adaptation.  One pathway included adaptive mutations in the RNA polymerase gene, but another included adaptive mutations in the rho gene, which helps terminate transcription.  In our original experiment, we noticed that adaptation tended to include a mutation in one - but not both - of these genes.  We compared the effects of mutations in these two genes and found that mutations in rho were like mutations in RNA polymerase.  In other words, a mutation in rho was again like a sledge-hammer because it affected the expression of hundreds of genes.  But it was a smaller sledge-hammer, because it changed only a subset of the genes that were affected by RNA polymerase mutations.  Like the RNA polymerase mutations, the rho mutations tended to restore gene expression to an unstressed state.    What have we learned?  Altogether, this grant has highlighted the remarkable flexiblity of evolution, even in a controlled experiment.  We found that evolution proceeded in at least two pathways that both alter gene transcript.  There were clear differences between the two pathways, because one (RNA polymerase) included trade-offs, but overall they caused similar phenotypic effects that returned a stressed cell back toward the physiological state of the unstressed ancestral phenotype.   The Broader Impacts of this project have focused chiefly on the retention and training of URM students in STEM.  The grant contributed to training for two Ph.D.  students and for one postdoctoal student; two of these three trainees were URM women.  The award also included outreach to the campus community of URM students.        Last Modified: 07/02/2018       Submitted by: Brandon S Gaut]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
