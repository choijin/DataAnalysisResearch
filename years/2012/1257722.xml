<AbstractNarration>C. Robertson McClung&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IOS 1257722 Reciprocal regulation between the circadian clock and the iron homeostasis network in Arabidopsis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to understanding the role of circadian regulation of iron homeostasis in plants, which is important for two reasons. First, iron often limits plant growth and agricultural yield. Second, although most people acquire iron from plant sources, plant-based diets are poor sources of iron, and iron deficiency represents the single most common human nutritional disorder, affecting approximately one-half of the world's population. The circadian clock integrates temporal information and coordinates many aspects of biology, including metabolism and responses to stress. Specifically, the plant circadian clock regulates the iron homeostasis gene network and, in turn, iron status modulates clock function. This project should help to shape a temporally integrated picture of iron homeostasis; the goal is to understand the network of genes responsible for integrating information about iron status and orchestrating a coordinated response that is temporally as well as spatially regulated. This should transform efforts towards sustainable improvements of crop yields in terms of plant productivity and nutrient content. The project will test the hypothesis that impaired circadian function adversely affects iron homeostasis and thus contributes to reduced fitness and, in agricultural settings, to reduced yield and reduced nutritional quality of food. Understanding the circadian regulation of iron homeostasis may contribute to crop productivity and to nutritional quality of food, particularly in crops grown over broad latitudinal ranges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will implement Genetics teaching modules in middle school classrooms in Vermont and New Hampshire in collaboration with the Montshire Museum of Science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genetic resources (mutant lines and constructs) will be deposited with the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Molecular data will be deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Iron (Fe) is a micronutrient essential for plant growth. One-third of the world?s soils are iron deficient, making iron acquisition important and often limiting to plant productivity. Furthermore, most people derive their dietary iron from plants. Because plant-based diets are poor sources of iron, human iron deficiency (anemia) is the most common nutritional limitation in the world today. Therefore, understanding plant iron acquisition and homeostasis is an important goal in terms of plant growth and yield and, ultimately, human nutrition.      Iron is typically acquired from the soil by plant roots, and that iron must then be transported to the shoots.  Iron stored in the root can impact long-distance iron transport by altering the amount of available for root-to-shoot transport. We have identified a key root protein that defines the balance between root iron storage versus root-to-shoot transport.  This root protein can now be targeted by traditional breeding or by genetic engineering to optimize the balance between root storage versus transport to the shoot.     We have also sought to characterize the key proteins that regulate the iron deficiency response in both roots and shoots.  A family of key basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor proteins play critical and overlapping roles in regulating the iron deficiency response, and we have identified one of those, bHLH38, that plays an essential role in iron acquisition.     We have observed that time-of-day plays a critical role in limiting the iron deficiency response, which indicates that the circadian clock, an endogenous time-keeping mechanism, plays a role in regulating the iron deficiency response.  In addition, plant iron status feeds back to modulate the pace of the circadian clock.  We have shown that bHLH38 is part of the mechanism by which iron status is communicated to the circadian clock, and we have identified key clock components that are regulated by bHLH38, although the full details of this regulatory interaction remain to be resolved. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the mechanistic basis of this loop linking the circadian clock to iron status and vice versa. This understanding will offer the opportunity to manipulate this reciprocal relationship in order to optimize the temporal regulation of the iron homeostatic network and enhance plant growth and yield as well as the nutritional quality of crops.
