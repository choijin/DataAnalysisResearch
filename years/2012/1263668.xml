<AbstractNarration>Under this international collaborative project, Jonathan Bobaljik, David Koester, Michael Krauss and Chikako Ono (Chiba University, Japan) will work towards the completion and publication of a comprehensive dictionary of the Itelmen language, comprising all known lexical resources, work that was begun under the aegis of a 2012 RAPID award (ARC-1155973). The centerpiece of the project is the large lexical card file (12,000 + cards) assembled by A. P. Volodin (St. Petersburg) from 1962 into the 1980s. The project is coordinated with a larger effort to publish comprehensive dictionaries of the languages of "Beringia" (the Bering Sea region), and comes at a key juncture in the language's history. Itelmen is critically endangered: at this time, the number of native speakers has dwindled to fewer than 10. At the same time, there is growing interest in the Itelmen language within the Itelmen community, as well as growing scholarly attention to the languages of this region in the context of language contact across the Bering Strait.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The primary objective of this grant was to complete digitization of Itelmen language lexical data for preparation and publishing of a comprehensive Itelmen dictionary and for use by both linguists and the Itelmen community.  The compiled materials included the main source, the card file (12,281 cards) of Russian linguist A. P. Volodin, the 11,618 card file of Itelmen ethnographer N. K. Starkova, data from scholars, explorers and officials from the 18th to the 20th centuries and the more recent work of linguists on this project C. Ono and J. D. Bobaljik.  When the PIs of this project began research in Kamchatka in the 1990s there were 80 to 100 speakers of the Itelmen language. Two decades later, this project intervened at an important moment as the last half dozen heritage speakers and the major Russian linguist to have studied the language, A. P. Volodin, were still available for consultation.  In coordination with a previous grant to provide audio-visual documentation of Itelmen language data, this project involved working with the active speakers to expand and elaborate the recorded Itelmen lexicon. Consultations with A.P. Volodin, were also an important contribution to the refining of the data before he passed away in 2018.  The revised data were combined with data gathered by collaborating PI Jonathan Bobaljik and Japanese linguist Chikako Ono.  At the same time, systematic sound recordings with the various available speakers were compiled to make possible a digital Itelmen-Russian dictionary application, for both scholars and the Itelmen community, with audio recordings of thousands of words.  This project contributes to linguistics by expanding the empirical base of the discipline with significant data from a typologically underrepresented language.  SIL's FLEx software was used to facilitate documentation in accord with the latest standards for accessibility and long-term digital storage of lexical data.  The FLEx Itelmen database contains a total of 17,561 entries.  This database has been submitted to the Alaska Native Language Archive to ensure long-term public access.   A total of seven articles, five book chapters and seven conference presentations resulted from work associated with this project.  Two of the conference presentations were specifically descriptions of the project itelf and the consultation work with Itelmen speakers.   The Comprehensive Itelmen Dictionary is scheduled to be submitted for publication in January, 2020.   Broader Impacts:  Information about the project was disseminated in the Itelmen community in Kamchatka by a series of presentations and by the participation in the project of Itelmen scholar and language revitalization specialist, Tatiana Degai.  The presentations to the community included a talk by PI Koester in the village of Kovran explaining the goals of the project and obtaining ideas from the community about how the materials selected might best serve their needs.  From that meeting it was decided that the best delivery method of the dictionary data, apart from the printed dictionary, would be via smart phone or tablet.  Given limitations and expense of internet access in Kamchatka we decided to provide the Itelmen village of Kovran with a Wifi server (RACHEL-PLUS) containing the dictionary and audio-visual corpus.  A prototype of the dictionary server was given to the village Cultural Center which, after testing it, turned it over to the village school for teaching purposes.  The school is now offering Itelmen language in grades 1-12 and has found the Wifi server to be very useful.  We plan to deliver the 50-portal server to the school in summer 2020.  This is a mode for delivery of research results that could be used by other projects in remote communities with limited internet access.  The second community presentation was given in the provincial capital city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a regularly scheduled  Itelmen language and culture evening event. It was attended by students, educators, Itelmen leaders, and other enthusiasts.   The third talk about the project was presented at a scholarly conference, also held in Petropavlovsk. The audience for that talk was primarily educators and other curious conference goers. These presentations about the project contribute to informing various communities of interest, locally as well as internationally, about the creatoin of a valuable asset that can help in their efforts to preserve and revitalize the Itelmen language.   Beyond communication with the Itelmen community, presentations for the general public given by the PIs -- a public lecture in Berlin, Germany, and radio programs for Athabascan radio in Fairbanks, Alaska -- have promoted awareness of endangered languages and the pressing need for their documentation.
