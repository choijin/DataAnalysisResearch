<AbstractNarration>Terrestrial-based wireless transmitters can often cause interference to space-based remote sensing instrumentation, such as satellites that are designed to probe the Earth's land, ocean, and atmosphere. Remote sensing observations of the Earth are often acquired using low-Earth orbit satellites that scan a narrow swath of the Earth at any one time, and orbit the Earth once each 90 minutes or so. The satellite detectors are often exposed to specific interference sources for only a few tens of milliseconds as the satellite passes overhead and the detector beam passes over the Earth's surface at very high speed, but that exposure is sufficient to produce substantial interference to the very sensitive observations being acquired by the satellite. One method of mitigating the interference is to synchronize very brief blanking of terrestrial interference sources as a remote sensing satellite using the same band passes overhead, leveraging the fact that satellite orbits are very well known and the specific point of time at which a sensor pixel will be passing over a particular point on the Earth can be determined with high accuracy. This method is one example of a broader application of coordinated interference mitigation techniques that will be explored as part of this research. The broader applications may extend beyond satellites to cases of interference between and among a large variety of land-, air-, and space-based users.</AbstractNarration>

This research devised, outlined, and demonstrated a scalable system within which up to thousands of users of radio frequency spectrum over a modestly sized downtown urban area and open access band can coordinate data transmission while allowing access for public service and other less financially intensive or public benefit uses of spectrum (for example, police, fire, air traffic radar, and weather forecasting satellites). The system is based on a spectral broker that takes regular coded requests for use of "electrospace" from both passive and active users, and compares these requests in real time to determine sharing potential among all user pairs. In this context, electrospace conflicts are based on spectral, angular, and spatial overlap, with consideration of anticipate radio frequency interference power (RFI) relative to each participating system's RFI threshold. The result is an interference flag that is sent to each user, indicating that either no RFI is anticipated, or that there will be potential interference between the user and another user. The broker is able to perform such calculations for users over a ~10-50 km urban zone rapidly enough to coordinate use of spectrum over time slices small enough to cause imperceptible dropouts in most voice telecommunications, but permit applications that are critical to the public good such as satellite weather sensor beams to observe during their brief overpass times on a regular daily basis. The broker subscribes users on a voluntary basis so that its effectiveness in providing RFI-free communication pathways increases with the number of users that participate in using its service. It does not rely on (but can benefit from) spectral usage measurements that would assist in assessing RFI potential, but that would not identify, for example, a passive user of the spectrum.</p> <p>The basic concept for this spectral broker was developed by considering three levels of RFI interference possible between any pair of participating users. At the highest level (a) users are compared according to their spatial locations within a range of contiguous regions where their transmissions occur. All user pairs with a common region or neighboring regions are then (b) compared to determine if their beams could contain each other&rsquo;s radio receiver. If so, then (c) a more computationally intensive calculation based on the Friis formula is performed to determine interference potential. If no potential exists, a "clear" flag is issued within ~1-10 msec of the request. If not, a "no-clear" flag indicating the possibility of RFI is issued, in which case a user can transmit but at their own risk of interference. These three basic RFI culling operations are depicted in Figure 1. By reducing the probability of repeated retransmissions and wasted transmission energy the value of following the broker's signals increases with user participation.</p> <p>Implementation of the broker for use in coordinating a region of electrospace with physical dimensions comparable to the size of a major downtown urban corridor (e.g., the downtown Chicago loop area) over bandwidths exceeding 10 MHz was studied in the context of issues such as propagation delay, user message coding, and required number of floating point operations per second.
