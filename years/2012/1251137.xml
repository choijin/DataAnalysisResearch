<AbstractNarration>Scientific Bigdata sets are becoming too large and complex to fit in RAM, forcing scientific applications to perform a lot of slow disk and network I/O.  This growth also makes scientific data more vulnerable to corruptions due to crashes and human errors.  This project will use recent results from algorithms, database, and storage research to improve the performance and reliability of standard scientific data formats.  This will make scientific research cheaper, faster, more reliable, and more reproducible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) standard is a container format for scientific data.  It allows scientists to define and store complex data structures inside HDF5 files.  Unfortunately, the current standard forces users to store all data objects and their meta-data properties inside one large physical file; this mix hinders meta-data-specific optimizations.  The current storage also uses data-structures that scale poorly for large data. Lastly, the current model lacks snapshot support, important for recovery from errors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new HDF5 release allows users to create more versatile storage plugins to control storage policies on each object and attribute.  This project is developing support for snapshots in HDF5, designing new data structures and algorithms to scale HDF5 data access on modern storage devices to Bigdata. The project is designing several new HDF5 drivers: mapping objects to a Linux file system; storing objects in a database; and accessing data objects on remote Web servers.  These improvements are evaluated using large-scale visualization applications with Bigdata, stemming from real-world scientific computations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the world collects more and more data at an accelerated pace, the incredible value of that data is becoming very clear.  Yet, it is hard to process such data.  This project developed techniques, algorithms, data structures, and software to process big data faster than ever -- often orders of magnitude faster than prior techniques.  Our data structures allow us to consicely index or summarize vast amounts of data: this enables us to query and update the data much faster than was every previously possible.  We published many conference papers and journal articles, filed patents, and helped transition some of this technology to industry sucessfully.   We have released software and massive multi-terabyte data sets for the community to use, and we published many papers.  Already other researchers have been busy using our releases and several published papers based on those releases.   We graduated several PhD students and dozens of MS students thanks in part to this project.  Our graduated students are gainfully employed in the high-tech industry.  We also engaged several undergraduate students in this project and even one high-school student.   We integrated topics from this project into many of our graduate and undergraduate courses, and helped direct the evolution of our CS programs to include more big data topics.  Through our efforts, hundreds of Stony Brook University students were exposed to topics related to this project.          Last Modified: 09/23/2017       Submitted by: Erez Zadok]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
