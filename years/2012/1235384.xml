<AbstractNarration>The PIs request funding to propose to design and test a new type of seafloor strainmeter that will have sensitivity much higher than has been available previously for seafloor use. The PIs will install the sensor on the seafloor and establish its noise floor, response, and sensitivity by observing the solid Earth strain tides, which have an amplitude of approximately 50 nanostrain. Many scientific targets, including slow earthquakes (episodic tremor and slip), volcanic inflation and deflation, mid-plate strain signals, spreading center events, and possible seafloor slide precursors, can be addressed by successfully developing this instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed device has the potential of becoming a standard instrument for a high-quality undersea observatory, allowing real time geodetic measurements and to assess hazards from undersea slides, faults, and volcanoes. Monitoring small tectonic strains in marine areas will provide new data with a precision so far unavailable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we designed, tested, and deployed an optical fiber strainmeter on the seafloor.  Tectonic forces cause the oceanic plates to move laterally towards the continents and away from mid-ocean ridge spreading centers, ultimately sliding beneath the continents at subduction zones.  As the oceanic plate moves beneath the continent, friction causes stress to build up in both plates.  The continental plate develops an accretionary wedge where sediment from the subducted oceanic plate is scraped off  over millions of years.  It has been hypothesized that strain in this accretionary wedge could be released in major earthquakes, posing a hazard from tsunamis.  On land, such strain can be measured using GPS measurements.  GPS signals, however, do not  penetrate seawater.  Therefore alternative methods are needed to detect strain buildup and release on the seafloor, especially near subduction zones.     The expected strain signals accumulate very slowly: a few tenths or hundredths of a part per million per year.  That is, strain, defined as the ratio of the change in a baseline?s length to the baseline length itself can be as small as 10 raised to the minus 7 or minus 8 power.  For example, the distance between two markers on the seafloor separated by 1 km may change by only a tenth or a hundredth of a millimeter in a year.     We developed an optical fiber strainmeter to detect such tiny displacements.  The sensor consists of a 200 meter long optical fiber cable stretched elastically between two seafloor benchmarks.  A laser at one end of the optical fiber sends light to the far end, where it is reflected back to the source.  There it is interfered with a second light beam.  As the length of the optical fiber cable changes, the two interfering light beams go in and out of phase with each other, producing a fluctuating total light level that changes from bright to dim when the cable length changes by only a thousandth of a millimeter.  Battery operated electronics track these light fluctuations and determine the change in length as a function of time.     A remotely operated vehicle was used to deploy the strainmeter 100 km off the Oregon coast in 1900 m deep water.  The batteries operated the sensor for about 100 days.  The results showed a drift in the sensor caused by imperfect anchoring of the two ends in the soft seafloor mud.  However, after correcting for this drift, strain changes as smaller than 0.1 part per million were detected.  The experiment demonstrated the capabilities of a seafloor optical fiber strainmeter for detecting earthquake related signals, and provides a guide for further advancement of this technology.
