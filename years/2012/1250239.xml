<AbstractNarration>The proposed experimental study will elucidate the effect(s) of magma mixing on the mobility of sulfur and sulfur-affine elements. In particular, this study investigates the interaction of sulfur-rich magmas coming from the mantle that mix with more evolved magmas that are typically stored for extended times in magma chambers below the volcanic edifice and have relatively low sulfur concentrations. Understanding the behavior of sulfur during such mixing should significantly improve our ability to forecast volcanic behavior. In the atmosphere, volcanic-released sulfur (often during magma mixing) modulates climate and leads to acid rain in humid volcanic regions. Furthermore, sulfur mobility during magma mixing is thought to facilitate metal transport from silicate melt to magmatic aqueous fluids that are responsible for the evolution of societally important magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quantitative understanding of how sulfur is mobilized and how it facilitates mass transport during magma mixing of andesite and dacite magma remains unexplored experimentally. As magmas hybridize during diffusive re-equilibration, sulfur-bearing phase stability is investigated as a function of time and oxidation state. Given differential diffusivities of different components in diffusion-couple experiments, diffusive gradients lead to transient local environments, in which sulfides and/or sulfates may in one spot be precipitated while in another area they may be dissolved. This drives complex mass transfer between the mafic and felsic magma. Reduced and oxidized conditions will allow the team to assess the role of sulfur oxidation state on these processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Sustainability of modern society depends on the availiability of resources embedded in every aspect of daily life, from the resources that make modern travel possible (planes, trains, automobiles, ships) and those that afford humanity ever-increasing lifespans (fertilizers and medicine).  One specific type of mineral deposit, known as a porphyry-type mineral deposit, forms within the plumbing system of active volcanoes along the edges of continents, where ocean crust is subducted beneath continental crust (for example, the Andes volcanoes of South America). Porphyry-type deposits are the primary source of the metals copper and molydenum, and also gold and silver, for modern society.  Every member of society who plugs a device into an electric outlet and uses motorized vehicles is using all four of these metals without knowing they are embedded in your built environment.  In this project, we investigated the possible role that mixing of mafic magma and felsic magma within the plumbing system of an active volcano may have for the development of porphyry-type deposits in volcanic systems.  Mafic magmas are enriched in elements such as sulfur, iron and magnesium, whereas felsic magmas are enriched in elements such as silicon, sodium and potassium.  There is some evidence that the formation of porphyry-type ore deposits requires the transfer of sulfur, and possibly metals, from mafic magma to felsic magma.  In this project, we performed experiments to simulate processes that occur beneath active volcanoes that lead to the formation of porphyry-type mineral deposits.  The most exciting result is that the experiments revealed a significant gradient in the abundance of oxygen at the interface of mafic and felsic magma.  The abundance  of oxygen plays a critical role controlling the mobility of sulfur and, in turn, metals such as gold, copper, silver and molybdenum. The results indicate that magma mixing likely plays a more important role in the ability of volcanic systems to form porphyry-type mineral deposits than was previously thought.
