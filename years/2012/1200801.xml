<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the Wabash Seminar and associated annual Miniconferences during the period 2012-2014. The Wabash Seminar will meet four times each year at the Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, two in spring and two in fall. The associated Miniconference will be held each fall at the IUPUI campus in Indianapolis. The Wabash Seminar and Miniconferences bring together both experienced and junior researchers, including graduate students, and postdocs to discuss recent work and advances in analysis. The meetings take advantage of the presence of strong groups of operator algebraists and operator theorists in the Midwest region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wabash seminar series offers an excellent opportunity for junior researchers and graduate students to be exposed to, and informed about, the latest major mathematical developments in Modern Analysis. This exposure often serves to develop their mathematical taste and to influence very beneficially the future directions of their research. The seminar has also helped develop collaborative efforts between the specialists invited to address it and researchers in this geographical area. Scientifically, there is potential for advances in operator algebras and operator theory and their related disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Wabash Seminar, along with its annual mini-conference, is devoted to the stimulation and dissemination of significant contributions to analysis in the Midwest region.  For about 40 years of operation, it has earned a national and international reputation for its success, and has provided a unique opportunity and an excellent environment for young researchers, visitors, postdocs and graduate students to meet regularly and exchange ideas with leading experts in the fields.  The Wabash Seminar and mini-conference are jointly sponsored by analysts from the mathematics departments at Indiana University, IUPUI, Purdue University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the Wabash College.  Three regular seminar meetings were organized each year at Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, two in Spring and one in Fall. Two one-hour speakers were invited for each seminar for presentations devoted to major areas of functional analysis. On average, half of the number of our invited speakers for the seminars were postdocs.  Weekend-long, annual mini-conferences  were held at IUPUI in Indianapolis each Fall during the award. They featured seven main speakers along with shorter contributed talks given by graduate students and postdocs. These meeting provided an excellent opportunity for junior mathematicians to present their work and be stimulated by the work of their peers. It allowed the students and postdoctoral associates in our region to get acquainted with the newest developments in the field, and fostered several collaborations.   With the support of this grant, we were able to invite distinguished speakers and leading experts in the fields to the seminar and mini-conference. The travel funds of the seminar also made it possible for students from a wide mid-western area to participate in the regular meetings of the seminar and especially in the mini-conference.
