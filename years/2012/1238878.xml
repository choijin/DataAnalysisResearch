<AbstractNarration>The Research Initiation Award entitled - Understanding Risks and Disruptions in Supply Chains and their Effect on Firm and Supply Chain Performance - has the overall goal to develop strategies for risk management for supply chains to enable organizations and their engineers, decision makers, and technology managers to create more effective strategies and to manage and mitigate risks and disruptions in their supply chains. The specific research objectives are to identify the sources and scope of risks and vulnerabilities in supply chains, and to determine the effects of different sources and scopes of risk on firm and supply chain performance. The educational objectives are to promote interest and motivation of students to study risk management for supply chains, to develop new instructional materials, and to educate the technical community about risk management for supply chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is innovative in its approach to risk management because it encompasses both the stages and scope of risks and defines and develops a matrix for risk management for supply chains. It is transformative since it provides the first comprehensive view of managing risks and disruptions within supply chains in different industries with respect to the stage and scope of the risks. It facilitates the formation and establishment of an integrative discipline - risk engineering/risk management - based on foundations from engineering, technology, and management. Both qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to collect data and information regarding the nature of risks and disruptions. Based on the review of the literature and identification of key variables, a survey instrument will be developed for the collection of data.  In order to re-validate the findings from the survey data, data on the US airline industry will be used.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project outcomes include development and validation of a survey instrument to measure supply chain risk management practices, which can be used to assess the effect of different supply chain disruption risk derivers on firm performance and supply chain performance. The findings showed that the impact of supply chain disruption risk drivers on firm and supply chain performance is different.  The result of our mathematical models showed that firms need to balance the trade-off among disruption risk, cost, and investment in supply chain capabilities to mitigate supply chain disruptions.  The analysis of the data from the airline industry showed that disruptions have a negative effect on service quality, where a firm's competitive strategy moderates the effect of service disruptions on service quality. The results demonstrated the impact of organizational and operational factors on mitigating service disruptions.  The project also provided the opportunity to educate several graduate and undergraduate students about the principles and premises of supply chain risk management. These students were involved in research and scholarship of supply chain risk management. The results of the study were disseminated through presentation at regional, national, and international conferences, seminars, and invited meetings. In addition, several articles were published and/or submitted for publication at peer-reviewed journals to further disseminate the result of the research.  The project provided an opportunity to develop a course module in supply chain risk management, which can be incorporated into supply chain management courses. This improves students? understanding of the current thinking and practice of supply chain management.  The project also provided an opportunity to examine the relationship between risk management and innovation management, and to address the challenges facing entrepreneurial firms in terms of managing their supply chains from a supply chain risk management perspective. This provides a new direction to incorporate technological entrepreneurship concepts with principles and premises of supply chain risk management.
