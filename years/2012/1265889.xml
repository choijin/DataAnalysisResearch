<AbstractNarration>An international team consisting of Teresa Head-Gordon and Martin Head-Gordon (University of California, Berkeley), Paul Nerenberg (Claremont McKenna College), David Case (Rutgers University), Jay Ponder (Washington University), Mark Tuckerman (New York University) with their UK collaborators: Lorna Smith and Neil Chue Hong (University of Edinburgh), Chris-Kriton Skylaris and Jonathan W. Essex (University of Southampton), Ilian Todorov (Daresbury Laboratory), Mario Antonioletti (EPCC) are are supported through the SI2-CHE program to develop and deploy robust and sustainable software for advanced potential energy surfaces.  The greater accuracy introduced by improvements in the new generation of potential energy surfaces opens up several challenges in their manifestation as algorithms and software on current or emergent hardware platforms that in turn limits their wide adoption by the computational chemistry community. The research team is overcoming these obstacles via multiple but integrated directions: (1) to optimally implement advanced potential energy surfaces across multi-core and GPU enabled systems, (2) to develop a hierarchy of advanced polarizable models that alter the tradeoff between accuracy and computational speed,(3) to create new multiple time stepping methods; (4) to write a Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM ) application programing interface (API) that fully supports mutual polarization, (5) to adopt software best practices to ensure growth of a self-sustaining community and (6) to provide exemplar calculations with the new software in the several emerging application areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular simulation and quantum chemistry software is an integral part of chemistry and chemical biology, and has been broadly adopted by academic researchers and industry scientists. Next generation scientific breakthroughs that utilize chemical software will be enabled by the deployment of state of the art theoretical models and algorithms that are translated into a sustainable software framework rapidly implemented on emergent high performance computing platforms. Potential energy surfaces describe the interactions between atoms. Advanced and highly accurate potential energy surfaces encounter software-related obstacles that inhibit their application to grand challenge chemistry problems. This UK and US consortium, representing a broad cross section of the computational chemistry software community, is working to directly tackle these obstacles.   This US and UK collaboration between universities and High Performance Computing centers works to endure that chemical software investments made in advanced potential energy surface models has a long term payoff in community sustainability and the training of the next generation of scientists. Outreach and training workshops are organized around the emergence of the advanced potential energy software including an introductory molecular simulation software boot camp for undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US based investigators are supported by the CHE and ACI divisions within NSF; the UK based investigators are supported by the EPSRC.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Computational modeling of complex chemical systems has become widespread in the molecular sciences both as a tool to rationalize experimental results that are difficult to interpret on their own and as a means of predicting new phenomena and engineering new materials.  Examples include predicting the positive and negative effects of certain drugs by modeling their interactions with different enzymes in the body, understanding the workings of proteins by modeling how they fold into their biologically active forms or misfold into shapes that lead to diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and cataracts, and accelerating, via the synergy between computation and experiment, the design of novel polymers for use in energy technologies, such as fuel cells, or environmental technologies, such as water desalinators.         One of the most commonly used computational modeling approaches, called Molecular Dynamics , starts with the basic Newtonian laws of mechanics and employs high-speed computers to solve the complex equations that generate the motion of each atom in the system.  These equations require the input of the complete set interatomic forces, which are often intricate functions of the atomic positions.  The accuracy of these forces is often of paramount importance for a reliable model of a complex system, and unfortunately,as a general rule, the more accurate the forces, the greater the time needed to calculate them and run the associated computer simulation.  This is a significant bottleneck in computational modeling, as it is typically important to generate very long computer simulations in order to gain a deep understanding of the chemical processes and microscopic mechanisms at work in a complex system.           In principle, the exact interatomic forces arise from the solution of the highly celebrated Schr&ouml;dinger equation of quantum mechanics that describes the distribution of electrons in the system.  However, this equation is so complex that exact solution of it is simply impossible for systems containing more than about ten atoms, and approximations are needed.  The approximation employed should be based on the phenomena one hopes to capture with it.  The force model employed in this project is an empirical one that captures enough of the physics encoded in the Schr&ouml;dinger equation to model structure and to approximate dynamics in a complex system provided no chemical bond breaking, i.e., no actual chemistry, occurs, and this is sufficient for many of the problems mentioned above.  However, this model still carries a high computational overhead, and it has been our objective in this project to develop algorithms for reducing the cost of these force calcualtions.       The forces in our model can be broken down into contributions that are rapidly varying yet very fast to calculate and contributions that are slowly varying and highly time-consuming to calculate.   Thus, this natural separation of the forces can be exploited to increase the efficiency of the computer simulations by evaluating the slow forces, which are the computational bottleneck, less often than the fast forces.  In principle, it should be possible to calculate the slow forces roughly once for every 100-200 evaluations of the fast forces!   In practice, however, this ratio can never be achieved with standard algorithms due to numerical stability issues that cause the energy of the system to increase without bounds resulting in a calculation that generates incorrect results.  We have developed an algorithm that implements a new energy stabilizing condition that entirely removes this numerical instability, thus allowing the full ratio between fast and slow force evaluations to be achieved.  The breakthrough of our algorithm is that it achieves this energy control without affecting any of the structural or thermodynamic properties of the system.  Moreover, it appears to be only a minimal perturbation of the dynamics.   Thus, while stan...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
