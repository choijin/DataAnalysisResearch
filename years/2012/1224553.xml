<AbstractNarration>Language is an imperfect medium for communication, and although this quality can be exploited for positive effect (e.g., poetry), it can also result in communicative misunderstandings. What the current project seeks to provide is an in-depth analysis of words that are likely to be a prime source of misunderstanding:  uncertainty terms. Uncertainty terms are words that are not fixed and include probability words (possible, likely), quantifiers (some, all), frequency terms (often, frequently), preference terms (like, love), and terms of evaluation (good, excellent). Because they are not fixed, these types of words can admit a range of interpretations.  Hence understanding what people intend to convey when they use an uncertainty term, and how people interpret another's use of an uncertainty term, is critical for understanding human communication and miscommunication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objective of the proposed research is to develop and test a comprehensive account of the role played by interpersonal processes in the production and interpretation of a group of uncertainty terms. A series of experiments is planned that will: (1) examine how people interpret and process uncertainty terms in an attempt to uncover basic interpretive principles involved in their use, (2) explore the production of uncertainty terms and the possibility that speakers and recipients may sometimes fail to coordinate in their use of uncertainty terms, (3) extend the analysis to interpersonal variables such as power and examine the impact of these variables on the interpretation of uncertainty terms, and (4) apply the analysis to the manner in which people interpret uncertainty terms in self-report measures.  The results of this project will help advance social psychological theories of social communication as well as cognitive theories of language comprehension and production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impact, the proposed research will contribute to the training of several graduate and undergraduate students and improve the research climate at the PI's home institution. Students who participate in this project will be extensively trained and participate in all facets of the research process. In addition, the results will have practical implication by bringing to light interpersonal processes that influence how people interpret, and misinterpret, uncertainty terms.  Uncertainty terms appear frequently in communications with important and far-reaching consequences such as the description of subjective experience (e.g., pain assessment in a medical setting), conveying estimates of risk (e.g., financial, environmental), and self-report instruments in general.  Hence, the potential impact of the results of the proposed research is extensive.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to undertake a systematic, empirical investigation of a set of common words that are ambiguous and hence open to interpretation (and sometimes misinterpretation).  These words are referred to as uncertainty terms and include quantity expressions (e.g., some), expressions of frequency (e.g., sometimes), probability expressions (e.g., possible), and so on. These words have both a semantic meaning (e.g., the semantic meaning of "some" is at least one) and a pragmatic meaning (e.g., the pragmatic meaning of "some" is "not all").  I argue that there are multiple motivations for the use of these words, and that these multiple motivations can influence how these words are processed, interpreted, and sometimes misunderstood.  Several experiments demonstrated that if there is a possible interpersonal reason for the use of an uncertainty term (e.g., protecting someone?s image), people will calibrate their interpretation to take this motivation into account, and as a result, interpret utterances containing these words more negatively than they would otherwise.  Other experiments in this vein demonstrated that the status or power of the speaker can influence the salience of image maintenance, and hence how these words are interpreted. That the interpretation of so many different types of uncertainty terms is affected in the same way suggests the operation of a fundamental principle of language use, one with important implications for the communication of risk, subjective experience, and so on.  Subsequent studies explored some of these implications.  One set of experiments demonstrated that people often use these words when communicating uncertainty about sensitive information (e.g., It?s possible you?re a poor student).  In these experiments, participants created messages designed to convey uncertainty regarding some topic;  a second set of participants read these messages and interpreted the amount of uncertainty being conveyed.  Participants created messages that conveyed greater uncertainty when the information was sensitive (i.e., face-threatening) than when it was less threatening, and greater conveyed uncertainty resulted in significantly lower probability estimates by the recipients of the utterance. Hence, the more threatening the information, the lower the estimated probability.  In addition, recipients of these messages sometimes, but not always, adjusted their interpretations to take the threatening nature of the information into account.  When they did not do so, there was a divergence between the speaker?s intended meaning and the recipient?s interpretation.  Uncertainty terms are also used frequently in self-report items designed to assess personality, attitudes, behaviors, and so on. Several experiments demonstrated that respondents will interpret these terms differently as a function of the content of the item.  Specifically, if an item is requesting content that is sensitive (i.e., has a strong social desirability component), people will interpret the same uncertainty term as conveying greater certainty than if the item is requesting content that is less sensitive. For example, participants judged "likely" to indicate greater certainty when the item was low in social desirability (e.g., It?s likely that I cheated on my taxes) than when it was high in social desirability (e.g., It?s likely I read a new book).   These findings have important implications for designing and interpreting self-report measures of personality, attitudes, behaviors, and so on.   Other experiments in this project used electrophysiological techniques to examine the online processing of uncertainty terms.  These results demonstrated that the pragmatic meaning of these words, when embedded in conversational contexts, is the default interpretation, but that this can vary as a function of the interpersonal context (i.e., the degree to which the content is sensitive or threatening).  Finally, another set of studies examined the role played by conversational markers (e.g., Well) in the interpretation of uncertainty terms. The results demonstrated how these markers interact with the interpersonal context to influence the interpretation of these words.
