<AbstractNarration>This collaborative award will support formation of a Physics of Living Systems Graduate Student Research Network, a trans-institutional community-based network of graduate students and graduate student educators all working on the physics of living systems. The initial participating institutions are the University of California, San Diego (which will coordinate the program), the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Princeton University, Yale University, Cambridge University, and University College, London.   The network structure will allow students at participating institutions (and a select number of other students) to meet their peers (both in-person and in-silico) and collectively help define the research agenda for this field. It will also allow for the creation of visiting internships, which will serve both as a way of broadening students perspectives on possible approaches to difficult research topics and as a way of creating collaborative ties between groups at the various sites. This structure will also enable the exploration of various means of educating these students in biology, while also ensuring that they develop and maintain a firm grounding in physics.   This award is supported by the Physics of Livings Systems Program in the Physics Division in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, as well as Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award, NSF 1216435 Collaborative Research: Physics of Living Systems Student Research Network (PoLS SRN), was provided to teach graduate students to use the analytical methods from fields such as physics and chemistry to study life science questions.  Usually students who studied physics in college will remain in physics when they go to graduate school.  Having students change fields and study life sciences in graduate school helps scientists see problems differently, allowing them to find solutions that they might not have discovered before.  While students from these fields were entering graduate programs in life sciences prior to the formation of the Physics of Living Systems (PoLS) program, it was not common and those students were at a disadvantage, as they had to learn basics about life science while taking graduate classes.  Now, students still have to learn the basics, but they are in a community of students sharing their experience and they receive support and training from peers, faculty, and the program.  The PoLS program holds an annual meeting each summer that provides opportunities for students to meet both other students and faculty from schools in the network.  At the meetings, students give brief presentations on their work, or present posters of their work.  During the meeting, students can learn about different techniques that might be useful, or about a model system that might be better for a particular question.  Discussions at these meetings can lead to collaborations, post-graduate positions, and a strong network for students? future careers.  In addition to the summer meeting, there are also workshops, seminars and other gatherings that students can attend to get to know other students, learn more about a particular area of study, or simply new techniques.  Over the past six years, hundreds of papers have been published by students in the PoLS program.  Examples of their research include the folding of DNA, interactions between RNA and proteins that affect gene expression, how snakes move on sand, how bacteria optimize their growth, how cancer cells metastasize through the body, and using tiny proteins to attack disease.  By using their physics training to study these questions, they have been able to mathematically model the behavior of cells or molecules in ways that biologists do not, and those models can be used to predict or explain the behavior of the cells or molecules.  This ability to model and predict behavior can provide many answers to the questions found in life science.          Last Modified: 11/14/2017       Submitted by: Herbert Levine]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
