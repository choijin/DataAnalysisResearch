<AbstractNarration>The Activate Computational Thinking (ACT) exploratory research project of California State University-San Marcos is a two-year professional development model to support a cohort of 16 middle school science teachers of underrepresented students as the teachers gain computational thinking (CT) competencies and design and teach CT-integrated classroom science lessons that will provide students with CT learning experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design of the ACT professional development (PD) supports an iterative process where teacher training is followed by the cycle of design, field-test, and refinement of CT lessons. The overall PD is then refined before the next training begins. Close monitoring of teacher and student responses to project activities will show how (1) teachers gain understanding and knowledge of CT concepts and capabilities; (2) teachers design science lesson plans that integrate CT learning experiences; (3) teachers implement science CT-integrated science lessons; and (4) students exhibit the use of CT skills in the course of completing their class assignments. Training will occur over two years in two summers and after school. The project combines participant learning and team teaching of a cohort of middle school students by trained participants during the first summer term. This will be followed by yearly training and mentoring. Teachers will produce science lesson plans that incorporate computational thinking.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the understanding of what it takes to empower middle school science teachers as designers of CT learning opportunities for students from underrepresented groups. With an estimate of 90 students per middle school teacher per year, the project is expected to impact more than 2,800 students as the 16 project teachers implement CT-integrated science lessons into classroom activities over two years.</AbstractNarration>

The students survey also provided&nbsp; project leadership and Teacher Participants with an understanding of students' level of knowledge and their perception of the use of CT vocabulary and skills in their science lessons.</p> <p>&nbsp;In the first year, the Student Survey was piloted as a pre/post survey with a group of 44 &ndash; 7<sup>th</sup> an 8<sup>th</sup> grade students who participated in the ACT student summer camp. While the size of the sample group was not large, it was a good representation of the ethnic, gender, and language diversity of the ACT project classrooms and therefore an appropriate pilot group for the survey. The results of the pilot survey indicated that a majority of the 43 students believed they gained knowledge of the meaning of the 9 CT vocabulary terms and had used the associated skills during the Summer Academy.</p> <p>&nbsp;In Spring 2014, the survey was administered to students from project classrooms. A total of 940 student surveys were compiled from 14 ACT teacher participants. While this did not offer a pre-post comparison for the first year of ACT implementation, it did give staff a sense of the students&rsquo; CT knowledge after participating in an ACT classroom.&nbsp; Survey results indicated that by the end of the year only 1 of the 9 CT vocabulary terms was known by less than 50%, and 5 of the terms were known by over 80% of the students.&nbsp; Regarding the use of the CT skills, over 50% of students reported using 6 of the 9 CT skills; 4 of the CT skills were used by over 80% of the students.</p> <p>The ACT Student Survey was implemented twice during the second year, 2014-15 of the ACT Project to allow for a pre / post comparison of students&rsquo; knowledge and perceptions. In the Fall of 2014, 1,165 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grade students in 15 ACT classrooms were surveyed.&nbsp; In the Spring, 911 students in 12 ACT classrooms took the survey.&nbsp; To provide the most accurate data possible, only those students who had both a pre and a post survey (604 students) were used in the 2014-15 analysis. The pre/post comparisons (Figures 7 -10) suggest that substantially more students reported they knew each of the CT vocabulary terms at the end of the school year.&nbsp; The CT Vocabulary which showed the most growth was <em>Problem Decomposition </em>(the least know on the pre survey) with an increase of 57 percentage points.&nbsp; Other terms which made over 50% growth were:&nbsp; <em>Abstraction</em> (52%), <em>Parallelization</em> (50%), and <em>Automation</em> (50%).&nbsp; The terms with the least amount of growth were those terms that students knew most frequently on the pre-survey, <em>Data Collection</em> (25%), and <em>Data Analysis</em> (29%).&nbsp;</p> <p>A classroom observation tool was developed by the ACT project to track teacher progress in implementation of CT in their science lessons. The instrument used three questions or categories to gather evidence:</p> <ul> <li>How does the lesson help students to use and understand CT vocabulary?</li> <li>How does the lesson help students understand and implement CT Skills?</li> <li>Are the CT skills integrated into the science lesson?</li> </ul> <p>A five-point scale (introductory, beginning, intermediate, approaching, and accomplished) was used to guide the observers as they determined rankings.</p> <p>During the second year of implementation, first year teachers improved in all 3 observation categories from Fall to Spring and second year teachers&nbsp; showed growth in all 3 categories over their first year.

Other terms which made over 50% growth were:  Abstraction (52%), Parallelization (50%), and Automation (50%).  The terms with the least amount of growth were those terms that students knew most frequently on the pre-survey, Data Collection (25%), and Data Analysis (29%).   A classroom observation tool was developed by the ACT project to track teacher progress in implementation of CT in their science lessons. The instrument used three questions or categories to gather evidence:  How does the lesson help students to use and understand CT vocabulary? How does the lesson help students understand and implement CT Skills? Are the CT skills integrated into the science lesson?   A five-point scale (introductory, beginning, intermediate, approaching, and accomplished) was used to guide the observers as they determined rankings.  During the second year of implementation, first year teachers improved in all 3 observation categories from Fall to Spring and second year teachers  showed growth in all 3 categories over their first year. These teachers started the year higher than the first year teachers, indicating sustained impact of the project from their first year participation.
