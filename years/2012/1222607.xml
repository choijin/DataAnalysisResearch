<AbstractNarration>WGBH Educational Foundation will create PEEP'S WORLD/EL MUNDO DE PEEP, a Web-based "Digital Hub," in both English and Spanish, to significantly increase the impact of the extensive collection of proven preschool science and math assets from the Emmy Award-winning TV show PEEP AND THE BIG WIDE WORLDÂ®.  This project will: (1) redesign the PEEP Web site, creating interactive media experiences that will contextualize existing content and take advantage of new Web design; (2) provide professional development for preschool educators; and (3) reach a new audience of family childcare educators, one that is woefully underserved when it comes to educational resources about science.  Dissemination through a network of national organizations, including National Association of Family Child Care, National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, National Head Start Association, National Education Association, AVANCE, and Committee for Hispanic Children and Families, will help engage the maximum number of educators and parents in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PEEP'S WORLD/EL MUNDO DE PEEP will provide resources for targeted audiences.  Specifically these resources will provide: Children with multiple ways to engage with science or math content areas, including interactive games, animated stories, and live-action videos; Parents with guided experiences to facilitate their child's math and science play; Center-based preschool educators with a media-rich, year long science curriculum and professional development materials; and Family childcare educators with curriculum modules, integrated with media, focused on six science content areas, and professional development materials for home-care settings in English and in Spanish.  The University of Massachusetts's Donahue Institute will conduct a formative evaluation of the family childcare educator resources: 200 Spanish-speaking and 200 English-speaking educators will pilot the curriculum modules and professional development videos.  Concord Evaluation Group, Inc. will conduct a summative evaluation, consisting of a Family Web Site Experiment and a National Observational Study, to assess the extent to which the project is successful at achieving its intended impacts.  A multifaceted national dissemination plan will include a robust social media strategy, implemented by a Spanish-speaking online community manager, to reach parents, and collaborations with early childhood education statewide systems to reach educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects intended impacts are to: (1) help English- and Spanish-speaking preschoolers effectively apply science and mathematical inquiry and process skills; (2) empower English- and Spanish-speaking parents to feel more equipped and inclined to facilitate science and math exploration with their preschoolers; and, (3) provide center-based and family childcare educators with resources for incorporating math and science into their curricula and boosting their confidence in teaching these subjects.  While many parents know how to read to their children, they do not typically know how to approach science or math investigations with their pre-schoolers.  After parents, preschool educators are the most important promoters of a young child's learning.  Yet, center-based and family childcare educators do not receive significant training in science, and thus lack confidence when conducting preschool science activities.  By providing parents and educators resources for approaching preschool science and math, which meet their specific needs, PEEP will help alleviate these challenges.</AbstractNarration>

With this project grant, we were able to achieve a number of significant accomplishments, including:    Completion and Launch of the New PEEP Website  The website includes the following new features:  A ?responsive? design that adapts to whatever device the web site is viewed on, whether a computer, a tablet, or a smartphone. PEEP?s debut as a fully bilingual project. To better serve our Spanish-speaking audiences, the entire contents of the PEEP website was translated into Spanish.   New resources and digital experiences for children. A major goal for PEEP?s World/El Mundo de PEEP was to create new ways for kids to interact with PEEP content. The site now invites children to explore different science and math topics through a series of "curated pathways," each one featuring a collection of thematically connected animated stories, live-action videos, and interactive games.  Six new interactive games covering the science of light, shadow, motion, sound, patterns, and animals.      New Educator Resources    Preschool educators have enthusiastically embraced PEEP for its developmentally appropriate introduction of science and math content.

New Resources to Support Parents  We also redesigned the Parent section of the site to make it easier for parents to navigate.  Anywhere Activities (hands-on science and math activities designed to be done by anyone, anytime, anywhere) and related videos and games can now be searched by math or science topic.  Videos for Parents: We?ve added a collection of 10 short educational videos for parents of preschoolers, which WGBH produced with a Race to the Top Early Learning Challenge grant. The videos feature best practices for supporting children's development.       Wide Dissemination through PEEP?s Organizational Partners     Since the launch of PEEP?s website, WGBH has collaborated with our five strategic partners&mdash;National Association for Family Child Care, AVANCE, National Education Association, National Head Start Association, and Child Care Aware of America, and other organizations&mdash;to reach and engage a large audience of English- and Spanish-speaking preschool educators, raising awareness of the PEEP curriculum and professional development resources with their member educators and families.     Formative and Summative Evaluation Results   The UMASS Donahue Institute conducted a formative evaluation in 2014 whose major recommendations included giving educators more options and flexibility in how they use the curriculum (given the busy and often unpredictable schedules faced by family childcare educators) and providing more thorough professional development trainings (given that many family childcare educators are new to science).     The Concord Evaluation Group conducted a two-part summative evaluation in 2016:        Evaluation of PEEP and the Big Wide World Resources for Families was designed to measure the impact of the PEEP website on English- and Spanish speaking families. Results found that parents who used the PEEP resources were significantly more likely to find enjoyment exploring science with their children and to believe that it is their role to help their children learn science and math.      A User Experience Study measured PEEP?s impact on families and educators. In addition to finding that PEEP fostered student learning of math and science concepts, educators reported an increased level of engagement among their students when using the resources. The study also found that the reorganization of the website into "curated pathways" was successful. When children navigated the pathways on their own, they tended to stay longer and explore more deeply.                   Last Modified: 12/27/2016       Submitted by: Marisa Wolsky]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
