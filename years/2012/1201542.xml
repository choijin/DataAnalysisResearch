<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to exploit recently developed techniques in the study of projective homogeneous varieties to pursue several questions in the theory of semisimple algebraic groups over an arbitrary field, their Galois cohomology, and their cohomological invariants.  The new techniques have already produced some extremely strong results and the investigator proposes to push them further.  Previous work on these topics has had applications to other areas of mathematics and to physics, and further such applications are expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The family of semisimple groups includes familiar matrix groups like special linear and special orthogonal groups. These groups appear in many areas of mathematics, and may be viewed as an essential outgrowth of the linear algebra developed in the early 1800s and now taught to undergraduates. The groups became prominent objects of mathematical interest in the late 1800s via Sophus Lie's famous general theory of Lie groups. In algebra, the notion of semisimple group unifies various historically distinct areas of study. For example, it connects Jordan algebras -- discovered by physicists -- with quadratic forms and division algebras.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A detailed study performed with Robert Guralnick produced a description of overgroups of simple algebraic groups with the same ring of invariants, which gave many consequences including two interpretations of groups of type E8 as automorphism groups. This answered a question posed by Wilhelm Killing in his classic 1888 paper classifying simple Lie algebras over the complex numbers, which had remained unanswered since that time.  Serre's injectivity question which has been open for the last six decades asks whether the  existence of zero cycles of degree one guarantees the  existence of rational points on principal homogeneous spaces under connected linear algebraic groups. This question  is answered in the affirmative for classical groups of type other than D4. A spinor norm criterion is formulated for the case of D4.  Results on local-global principles for homogeneous spaces under unitary groups over function fields of p-adic curves  with respect to discrete valuations were established,  verifying conjectures of Colliot-Thelene, Parimala and Suresh.  Local-global principle  for gerbes over function fields of curves over complete discrete valued fields in the patching setting of Harbater-Hartmann-Krashen in terms of bitorsor factorization was proved; a Mayer-Vietoris sequence for a certain  non-abelian hypercohomology which places in a far more general context an analogous sequence of Harbater, Hartmann and Krashen for commutative group schemes has been proved.
