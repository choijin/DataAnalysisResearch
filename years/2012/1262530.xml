<AbstractNarration>This REU site integrates undergraduates into research focused on reconstructing the environmental, cultural and temporal landscapes of Angel Mounds, a palisaded Mississippian town located on the Ohio River. The REU objectives are to provide students with 1) significant field and laboratory training in archaeology, geoarchaeology, geochemistry and geophysics, including: excavation, remote sensing, hands-on use of instruments, modern laboratory analyses, and the assembly and dissemination of results, 2) an opportunity to build cohort and professional networks that will serve them throughout their careers, and 3) an opportunity to participate in a project of regional and historical significance. The project will be evaluated by formative and summative assessments. Long-term success will be measured with post-program mentoring and tracking of the professional engagement of REU alumni.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Angel Mounds is a National Historic Landmark that figured prominently in the late prehistoric socio-political and population dynamics of the Midwest. The site is the furthest upstream Mississippian town in the Ohio Valley and, like its sister sites Kincaid in the Black Bottom and Cahokia in the American Bottom, its settlement was a major socio-political and population reorganization for the area. Unlike these other sites, its chronology, developmental history, and place within the local settlement and ecological systems are less well understood. Using multidisciplinary methods and instruction, REU undergraduates will be trained to examine questions surrounding anthropogenic transformation of the landscape, environmental change during the Medieval Warm and Little Ice Age, and local and regional patterns of warfare and demography. Because most excavation at Angel Mounds occurred during the WPA-era, some gaps will also be filled via reanalysis of legacy collections curated at the GBL. In addition, targeted geophysical survey, solid-earth coring and selective new excavation will be used to contextualize and modernize the earlier, less rigorously collected data. Students undertake these investigations through directed research as part of the REU Site. The development and evolution of the site and region are examined through: 1) earthwork construction episodes, 2) paleoenvironmental reconstruction for region, 3) the timing and relationship of palisade construction, and 4) the excavation of detected ?neighborhoods? on site to determine their chronological association with settlement growth during the Medieval Warm and village abandonment during the Little Ice Age. From this perspective, the proposed project simultaneously addresses the landscape and built environment of Angel Mounds. The REU students participate in every phase of the project from research design and data collection to laboratory analyses, archival research, and interpretation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Archaeological research has evolved from the prototypical multiyear site exams to more targeted research projects with refined questions and multidisciplinary research teams that build upon the accumulated body of knowledge. The Angel Mounds REU creates such a research environment. Talented students from the natural and social sciences and institutions with limited STEM research opportunities are actively recruited and encouraged to apply to the program. Given the underrepresentation of Native Americans in archaeology, recruitment of students from descendant communities are actively pursued through extant, IUPUI-based relationships. With rotating on-site projects designed to answer specific questions and the reanalysis of extant collections, the Angel Mounds REU prepares students to conduct targeted projects that rely simultaneously on traditional and state of the art field and laboratory methods. Project participants are expected to present the results of their research projects at conferences, such as Midwest Archaeological Conference (MAC). Students will also publish their research reports in the Report of Investigations (GBL-ROI) series.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Between 2013 and 2015, 30 undergraduates from around the United States participated in the REU Site: &ldquo;Multidisciplinary Training for Students in Environmental and Social Sciences through Archaeological Research&rdquo; based out of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and Indiana University-Bloomington (IUB). The goal of this REU was to provide students with significant field and laboratory training in archaeology, geoarchaeology, geophysics, geomorphology, geochemistry, and paleolimnology, fostering cooperation and multidisciplinary thinking among participants. Four weeks of field investigations and an additional month of laboratory analyses resulted in a research experience and training that included excavation, remote sensing, the hands-on use of instrumentation, modern laboratory analyses, and the assembly and dissemination of results pertaining to two large, late Pre-Columbian Native American villages in mid-continental North America, as well as a series of floodplain lakes adjacent to archaeological sites in the lower Midwest. The research questions and training were organized around yearly thematic questions: anthropogenic transformation of the landscape in 2013, environmental change and the built landscape in 2014, and late Pre-Columbian warfare and demography in 2015. These foci encouraged REU participants to think creatively about how the methods and techniques used during the eight-week program could be applied to a range of prehistoric and modern research contexts that they will encounter throughout their professional careers. At no cost to the NSF or federal government, faculty and research scientists from IUPUI, IUB, Purdue University, the University of Southern Indiana, and the University of Notre Dame served as mentors to the REU participants. The program provided an opportunity to build cohort and professional networks that will serve the former participants throughout their professional careers. Over 75% of the federal funds provided by the NSF went directly to support the REU participants in the form of stipends, travel reimbursements, and payments for lodging in the field and while working in the laboratories at IUPUI and IUB. The remaining federal funds were utilized to support graduate student research assistants and cover expenses related to the students&rsquo; research projects, including field equipment, radiometric assays, and reagents related to a host chemical (isotopic) and biomolecular analyses.The 30 undergraduate participants included 22 females and eight males pursuing degrees in Anthropology, Biology, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Environmental Sciences, and Geology. Ten students self-identified as originating from an ethnic group historically underrepresented in higher education and the sciences, including Native American ancestry (17%). Eleven of 30 participants were first-generation college students, while nine identified as originating from low-income households. Meanwhile, 55% of the participants originated from institutions where the STEM disciplines and undergraduate research opportunities are limited. Each year the program culminated with student presentations of their research projects in symposia at the Midwest Archaeological Conference. Ninety-seven percent of the REU participants presented on a host of research topics ranging from anthropogenic transformation and earthwork construction to material culture analyses and the geochemical properties of lake sediments. A handful of former participants have also presented their research results at national or international scientific meetings or utilized data and results from the REU program to complete theses at their home institutions.Long-term tracking of the former REU participants reveals that 97% (29/30) have graduated from their home institutions as of May 2017, with 53% (16/30) now pursuing graduate degrees in Anthropology, Earth Sciences, Geology, and related fields. Eleven (37%) former participants are now employed in the private or public sector, including AmeriCorps and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Park Services. A majority of former participants with private sector jobs are involved to environmental and cultural resource management industry, as well as education and human resources. Collectively, the REU site succeeded in increasing disciplinary connections among undergraduates through peer-to-peer relationships, providing students with the vocabulary to communicate with peers in other disciplines, creating a greater awareness of the importance of multidisciplinary research, and increasing the overall level of diversity of archaeological and related research environments.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/06/2017<br>      Modified by: Jeremy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wilson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499365223054_4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499365223054_4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2015 REU Excavations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499365223054_4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2015 REU Excavations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2015 REU program participants exposing and investigating the fortification the protected the late Pre-Columbian Native American village in the Illinois Valley</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jeremy Wilson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeremy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wilson</div> <div class="imageTitle">2015 REU Excavations</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499364403871_img_3522--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499364403871_img_3522--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Remote sensing at Angel Mounds State Historic Site"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499364403871_img_3522--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Remote sensing at Angel Mounds State Historic Site"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2013 REU participants perform electrical resistivity testing on the lower platform of Mound A at Angel Mounds State Historic Site (Evansville, IN)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jeremy Wilson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeremy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wilson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Remote sensing at Angel Mounds State Historic Site</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499364591144_IMG_7410_DxO--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499364591144_IMG_7410_DxO--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2013 REU Symposium at MACs"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499364591144_IMG_7410_DxO--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2013 REU Symposium at MACs"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Caitlin Rankin (Beloit College) presents her research results at the 2013 Midwest Archaeological Conference in Columbus, OH</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jeremy Wilson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeremy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wilson</div> <div class="imageTitle">2013 REU Symposium at MACs</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499364781528_43--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499364781528_43--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2014 REU Lake Coring"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499364781528_43--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2014 REU Lake Coring"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dr. Broxton Bird (IUPUI) and REU participants coring Anderson Lake in the central Illinois River valley.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jeremy Wilson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeremy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wilson</div> <div class="imageTitle">2014 REU Lake Coring</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499364972175_32--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499364972175_32--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2014 REU Investigations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262530/1262530_10229843_1499364972175_32--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2014 REU Investigations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Drs.
