<AbstractNarration>It is proposed that a carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen (CHNSO) elemental determinator be procured to augment the chemistry analytical instrument suite presently in use for research and instruction at Kettering University. Kettering University, formerly known as General Motors Institute is located in Flint, Michigan and is a non-PhD granting institution that specializes in cooperative education and experiential learning in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields. A CHNSO elemental determinator, if awarded, would be used by a multidisciplinary group of faculty in the Biochemistry, Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering programs engaged in applied and fundamental research in a wide variety of areas including alternative energy, organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and materials research. The investigators in these programs employ and mentor undergraduate students to aid in their research efforts. For some students, this work is incorporated into their undergraduate thesis. In addition, many students become coauthors on peer reviewed publications and/or presentations at local, regional, and national meetings. In addition to supporting student/faculty research, a CHNSO would enhance the educational mission of the department by broadening the educational background of junior- and senior-level chemistry and chemical engineering students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to acquire a carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur elemental determinator for research and instructional use at Kettering University and surrounding institutions.  Kettering University, formerly known as General Motors Institute, is a 4-year private, non-profit, non-doctoral degree awarding institution located in Flint, Michigan.  Elemental determinators are used to measure the amount and type of atoms in a combustible compounds.  All matter whether food, plastic, pharmaceuticals, or plants contains a mixture of different types of atoms.  Organic compounds are compounds that contain carbon and examples include coal, food, plants, or oil.  In addition these compounds, like coal and plants, will also contain hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and to a lesser extent other elements.  What makes these compounds different is how the elements that make up the compounds are arranged and the proportion of the different types of elements they contain.  For example, pencil lead, or graphite, is going to contain more carbon and less hydrogen than table sugar.  It is important to measure the proportion of these types of atoms to identify chemicals and to determine how some compounds change after a chemical reaction or an extraction.  Elemental determinators are used to measure the amount and proportion of elements in a substance.      The procurement of an elemental determinator for Kettering University has enabled research on a variety of projects.  These projects include the production of biogas from sanitary waste water and crude glycerol, production of biodiesel, finding new ways to use corn waste, and the extraction of beneficial medical compounds from a variety of plants.  All of these projects have impact on research and production of energy, pharmaceuticals, food supplements, and agricultural wastes.  The addition of the elemental determinator has also enabled work at institutions outside of Kettering University, namely the University of Kentucky.  Given the long life of an elemental determinator, this instrument will be valuable in enabling research and instruction at Kettering University for many years.     The addition of the CHNS elemental determinator not only has enabled new research at Kettering University, but has also made a significant impact on education.  Kettering University is a cooperative education school specializing in training young men and women in science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) and business.  Kettering University students go to school for a quarter taking laboratory intensive classes and following a school quarter go to work at a company.  The addition of an elemental determinator has increased Kettering University Department of ChemistryÆs ability to train future generations of scientists and engineers.  This instrument is not commonly available at many schools and rarely available for use by undergraduate students.  At Kettering University, undergraduate students use the instrument to identify and quantify chemicals in the chemistry laboratory courses.  The addition of the instrument allows for better trained and competitive graduates.        Last Modified: 11/26/2014       Submitted by: Jonathan Wenzel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
