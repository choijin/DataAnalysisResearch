<AbstractNarration>The need for automotive technicians who can service alternative-fuel vehicles is increasing rapidly due to technological advance. Automotive manufacturers are now offering diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. The training on this type of vehicles in community and technical colleges, however, is lagging behind the industry. Many new automotive graduates from these colleges hired by dealerships and independent shops must be sent to extensive manufacturer training to service diesel and other alternative-fuel vehicles. To change this situation, Texas State Technical College Waco (TSTC), working with partners from industry, other higher education institutions and high schools, is developing a new Advanced Technical Certificate in Advanced Vehicle System, focusing on light-duty diesel, CNG and hybrid vehicles.  The project involves skill analysis, curriculum development, lab equipment identification and acquisition, and curriculum implementation and refinement.  The curriculum developed will be submitted to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board for inclusion in the state's Workforce Course Manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course and laboratory materials develop by the project can be adopted by other institutions, spurring the training of automotive technicians in alternative-fuel technologies in two-year schools nationwide, and addressing the unmet demand for this type of automotive technicians.  To facilitate this effort, the project will hold a conference that will invite other community colleges to the TSTC Waco campus to learn the curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Texas State Technical College Waco Development of an Advanced Technical Certificate in Advanced Vehicle Systems NSF 1204999 Project Outcomes Report     Partners for this NSF ATE project were Texas State Technical College (TSTC) in Waco, TSTC in Harlingen, and Pittsburg State University of Pittsburg, Kansas.  The goal of the project was to establish the curriculum for training automotive technicians in "advanced vehicle systems," which included hybrid-electric (HEV) vehicles, compressed natural gas vehicles, and light-duty diesel vehicles (diesel cars).  A study of required knowledge and tasks was completed based on employer surveys and literature studies (including review of ASE skills standards).  A curriculum was then developed to address the required knowledge and tasks for maintenance of the targeted vehicle systems.  As part of the preparation for offering the program, additional vehicles for training use were secured and selected faculty went through specialized manufacturer service training.  TSTC then applied to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) for approval to offer the curriculum as a one-semester, stand-alone advanced certificate program focused on HEV vehicles to be completed after students had completed an associate of applied science in automotive technology.  After THECB approval, TSTC in Waco started offering the complete certificate program as a summer offering.   The industry advisory board at TSTC in Waco reviewed the program after its initial offering, and approved it as an ongoing offering of the college.  To meet local demand, the TSTC in Waco program focuses primarily on HEV vehicles.  The courses that comprise the certificate program are AUMT 2407 Hybrid Systems Diagnostics, AUMT 2357 Automotive Alternative Fuels, and AUMT 2470 Automotive Compression Ignition Engine &amp; Fuel Systems.   To meet local needs, TSTC in Harlingen does not offer the complete certificate program, but it does offer as an elective AUMT 2357 Automotive Alternative Fuels.  A workshop was hosted at TSTC in Harlingen on alternative fuels and attended by local high schools and colleges.  Training was presented on alternative fuels and the curriculum and project were shared with attendees.  Visits to local high schools, colleges, and industry partners have been conducted in order to establish collaboration on this project.  Other training on alternative fuels has been presented to different summer camp groups and to international instructors.  This project has benefited TSTC students because they have been able to gain more knowledge on alternative fuels and get experience using trainers and diagnostic equipment that were purchased through the grant.  Pittsburg State University has incorporated compressed natural gas curriculum elements into its Automotive Service Technology AAS degree program.  Information about the curriculum in advanced vehicle systems developed during the project has been shared with local industry groups and the Texas state curriculum committee for automotive programs.  The complete curriculum is stored electronically at TSTC in Waco and is available to the public.            Last Modified: 07/05/2016       Submitted by: Michael Huneke]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
