<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to provide funding offsetting registration and travel expenses to enable 83 undergraduate and graduate students to attend the 2013 joint conference of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (ASME MSEC) and the Society of Manufacturing Engineers North American Manufacturing Research Conference (SME NAMRC). The attending students will participate in the conference by giving technical papers, participating in a poster session to display their research, and taking part in a design competition. The conference will be held June 10-13, 2013, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The funding opportunity will be broadly announced, affording students ample notice and time to apply. Applications will be reviewed by committee, and $300 in support will be provided to each winning student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students who attend this conference will have a chance to see the latest work in their respective fields and to talk to the investigators directly. This will both give them a better perspective on the world of manufacturing and better prepare them to complete their thesis research. There is also an international aspect to the conference, enabling the students to become more internationally oriented. The benefits to the nation in the long term will include a better educated manufacturing engineering workforce.</AbstractNarration>
