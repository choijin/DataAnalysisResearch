<AbstractNarration>The next volcanic super-eruption will have global consequences for humanity.  During one of these large eruptions, the explosive potential and the amount of lava and ash erupted are largely controlled by what happens in shallow magma reservoirs in Earth's crust.  This project combines the study of frozen magma reservoirs trapped below-ground - plutons - with their associated above-ground volcanic rocks for two ancient super-volcanoes: the Lake City Caldera, Southern Rocky Mountain Volcanic Field in Colorado and the Turkey Creek Caldera in Arizona.  The results of this study will provide unprecedented insight into processes occurring within shallow magma reservoirs that lead to super-eruptions, and ultimately will be applied to predict the behavior of potentially extremely hazardous active volcanic regions such as the Taupo Volcanic Zone, the Bay of Naples, and the Aegean Arc.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis being tested is that the plutonic porphyries in both the Lake City Caldera and the Turkey Creek Caldera are the quenched magma reservoirs remaining in the crust following caldera collapse. If this hypothesis is confirmed, these porphyries provide a unique snapshot of the evolution and post-eruptive conditions of the mushy rootzone associated with a super-eruption. The methods that will be applied to the volcanic and plutonic lithologies are: (1) detailed field mapping of the plutonic porphyries and field sampling of the volcanic units, (2) geochemical characterization of all units, (3) quantitative investigation of primary and accessory crystals in all units using electron microprobe analysis (EPMA), laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), and (4) high resolution U-Pb dating and trace element analysis of zircons (CA-TIMS-TEA) in selected lithologies. This multi-analytical approach to the sub-volcanic intrusions and overlying silicic volcanic units is applied to establish the genetic relationship between the large, zoned ignimbrites and their plutonic roots, and to unravel the processes involved in chemical differentiation of large silicic magma chambers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During large volcanic eruptions, the quantity and nature of the erupted lava, ash and pyroclastics are influenced by what happens in underground reservoirs of magma.  A recent scientific discussion regarding large caldera-forming volcanic eruptions has centered around to what degree the below-ground plutons &ndash; with crystallized magma that never reached the surface &ndash; may be related to above-ground volcanic deposits. Multiple scientific approaches were combined to test the potential relation between the pluton and volcanic rocks at the Turkey Creek Caldera, Arizona.  Samples of plutonic and volcanic rocks were collected from the Turkey Creek Caldera, and the age, composition, and texture of these rock samples were investigated. The age of the plutonic rocks overlapped with that of the volcanic rocks.  This age data, combined with the spatial relations observed in the field, were interpreted to indicate that the magma from the underground (plutonic) magma reservoir was related to that of the volcanic deposits.  Furthermore, the age data combined with the composition and textural data allowed insights into the processes within large silica-rich underground magma chambers.  Significantly, mineral crystals accumulated in the chamber over a protracted time, lasting thousands of years, before the volcanic eruption and associated caldera collapse.        The results of the project were shared through presentations at geoscience conferences and articles in geoscience journals.  The project facilitated undergraduate research training at a small liberal-arts college.  Undergraduate students participated in the field sampling, and in laboratory data collection using petrographic light microscopes and a scanning electron microscope.  One undergraduate student received honors upon completion of a senior theses based on samples from the Turkey Creek Caldera. Field photos and rock samples were used to support student learning about minerals, rocks and volcanoes in undergraduate courses.  Laboratory techniques and approaches developed for this project have been applied by faculty and students in other projects that seek to further elucidate the relation between below-ground reservoirs of now crystallized magma (plutons) and above-ground volcanic deposits.
