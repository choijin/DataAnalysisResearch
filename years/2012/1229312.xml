<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to acquire a state-of-the-art e-beam evaporation thin-film deposition system to enable researchers at the Alabama A&amp;M University to fabricate the micro- and nanoscale devices. The approach is to combine the thin-film deposition capability with the state-of-the-art UV and e-beam lithography tools to enable expanded research efforts in the fabrication of micro- and nanoscale devices.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Multiple research projects at Alabama A&amp;M University require an advanced thin film deposition capability. The acquisition of the advanced deposition instrument will make these projects to be completed successfully. The research projects include carbon nanotube field-effect transistors and logic circuits, thermoelectric devices, phase shifter and nano antennas, metal-insulator-semiconductor structures, nanostructured solar cells, single crsytalline tin oxide nanowires, and magnetic properties of Co/Cu. The research accomplishments will greatly benefit the research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Acquisition of the e-beam system will greatly enhance educational opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students. The use of the state-of-the-art instrument provides essential training to the majority underrepresented students who will become tomorrow?s researchers in government, academia, and industries. Undergraduates will be exposed to the exciting and rich possibilities of nanofabrication through the research projects. High school teachers and students will be trained on the instrument. Collaboration between the researchers and local industrials will be enhanced by the instrument. This project will further promote the development of local and national economy, and contribute to meeting the Congress? goals for enhancing national education, research, and economy.</AbstractNarration>
