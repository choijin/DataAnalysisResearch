<AbstractNarration>The proposed research aims to deepen our understanding of the combinatorics of infinite sets, to develop new techniques, and to explore new applications of infinite combinatorics in other fields of mathematics.  One component of the research is foundational: it aims to better understand the relationship between classification problems (such as the basis problem for the uncountable linear orders and the metrization problem for compact convex sets) and the value of the cardinality of the continuum.  Currently we have an acceptable understanding of how to produce models of set theory in which the continuum is the second uncountable cardinal; the methods for producing models of set theory in which the continuum has some other value is considerably more limited.  Part of the present proposal aims to develop better techniques for producing models of set theory in which the continuum is larger than the second uncountable cardinal, while maintaining the ability to control other combinatorial properties of sets in the model.  Additionally, the proposal aims to further develop techniques in Ramsey theory needed to solve problems arising in other fields and in particular arising in the study of the amenability of groups.  Specifically the amenability of Thompson's group F - the subject of a longstanding problem in the field - is equivalent to a new type of Ramsey-theoretic statement relating to generalizations of Hindman's theorem to nonassociative operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frequently in mathematics it is necessary to find a guiding heuristic in order to gain intuition in a setting where our own human experience falls short.  Two examples of this need are provided by the study of the combinatorial properties of infinite sets and the geometry of high dimensional spaces.  In both cases, guiding intuition is provided by a classical piece of mathematics known as Ramsey's theorem, concerning colorings of edges in a graph, a mathematical abstraction relating to networks.  The proposal aims to develop new techniques in Ramsey theory in order to improve our understanding of foundational issues relating to infinite sets and high dimensional geometric objects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The following are the most significant results which were produced during the grant period:  A new example of a finitely presented group which does not contain a nonabelian free subgroup and yet does not support a finitely additive translation invariant probability measure.  Groups which contain a nonabelian free group necessarily can not support a finitely additive translation invariant measure and the extent to which this is the only obstruction to the existence of such measures has long been an important theme lying at the interface between algebra and analysis.  The group's presentation uses 3 generators and 9 relations; previously only two examples of such groups were known and their presentations were estimated to require 10200 relations. It is consistent with the usual axioms of mathematics (ZFC) that there are no minimal non &sigma;-scattered linear orders.  Here a linear order is &sigma;-scattered if it can be covered by countably many subsets which do not contain a copy of the rational line.  A non &sigma;-scattered linear order is minimal if it embeds into all of its non &sigma;-scattered suborders.  In the 1970s, R. Laver proved that any infinite sequence of &sigma;-scattered linear orders contains an earlier term that embeds into a later term (i.e. they are well quasi-ordered).  The present result shows that Laver's result can not be improved without using additional axioms of set theory.  The PI also established a classification of the non &sigma;-scattered linear orders under the assumption of PFA+, a well studied extension of the usual axioms of mathematics.  Specifically assuming PFA+, a linear order is non &sigma;-scattered if and only if it contains a copy of a linear order of the one of the following types: an uncountable subset of the real line, a Countryman line, or a ladder system indexed by a stationary subset of the first uncountable cardinal, equipped with either the lexicographic or reverse lexicographic order.   The project also supported 6 graduate students working in algebra and set theory at Cornell University.       Last Modified: 07/13/2016       Submitted by: Justin T Moore]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
