<AbstractNarration>The PI requests funding for The Third International Conference on the Effects of Noise on Aquatic Life will take place in Budapest, Hungary, August 11-16, 2013. This meeting follows two successful meetings in Nyborg (2007) and Cork (2010), both of which NSF provided partial support. The major goal of the conference will be to define the current state of knowledge on the impact of underwater noise and, in particular, explore the progress made in this field in the three years since the second Conference. The third Conference will place strong emphasis on recent research results, the sharing of ideas, discussion of experimental approaches, and analysis of regulatory issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting should help shape future research and understanding of effects of noise on aquatic life. Based on experience from the earlier meetings, the interactions and networking that took place has resulted in new collaborations between investigators, a broader understanding of the science that can be used in their work by regulators, a better understanding of regulatory issues by scientists and industry, and substantial cross-fertilization of experimental design and approaches by investigators.</AbstractNarration>
