<AbstractNarration>The researchers will use new genomic approaches to study hybridization between native cutthroat trout and introduced rainbow trout in the northern Rocky Mountains.  Their primary goal is to understand how genetic and evolutionary processes influence hybridization within and among populations.  This research will transform our understanding of the spread of hybridization by combining laboratory description of genomic variation, study of fitness in the wild, and description of dispersal rates of native and hybridized individuals in complex landscapes.  This work will test for the presence of certain chromosomal regions that spread rapidly among populations because of natural selection, and will also test if increased dispersal by hybrids accelerates the spread of hybridization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hybridization and species invasions provide exciting evolutionary experiments because natural selection on novel gene combinations can be studied in ecological time and in different environments.   Hybridization between native and invasive species is one of the most serious threats to global biodiversity. The rate of hybridization is increasing with habitat degradation, translocations, and environmental change.  Natural selection and dispersal by hybrids are thought to play key roles in the spread of hybridization.  However, the mechanisms underlying this dramatic increase in hybridization and introgression remain unknown.  These mechanisms can now be assessed using the application of thousands of genetic markers to assess the genomic basis of hybridization, fitness, and dispersal.   The researchers have worked in collaboration for decades with tribal, state, and federal management agencies to conserve native cutthroat trout and protect them from hybridization with rainbow trout.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[          Widespread species introductions and invasions have contributed to unprecedented extinction rates of many species.  Hybridization between native and introduced species is one of the most serious threats to global loss of species, including many native fish that are crucial to local and regional economies. Our project developed and applied new tools to measure the effects of introduced hybridization on native westslope cutthroat trout threatened by nonnative rainbow trout, the world?s most widely introduced invasive fish. Our overarching project goal was to understand how genetic and micro-evolutionary processes influence individual fitness, introgressive hybridization, and the spread of nonnative genes into different environments.         To achieve this goal, our research combined genomic DNA sequencing, extensive field studies, lab experiments, and computer simulations to test if hybridization reduces fitness (growth, survival, and reproductive success) in a consistent way in different environments.  Our results suggested that hybrids grow more slowly than non-hybridized native westslope cutthroat trout during winter and spring.  Full analyses of fitness data (annual growth, survival, and reproductive success) will be completed in late 2018.  Genome-patterns of rainbow trout admixture suggest that selection against non-native alleles is widespread throughout the genome. Nevertheless, patterns of spread of hybridization suggested that hybridization is rapidly spreading because of increasing stream temperatures and reduced spring flows (due to climate change), both of which facilitate rainbow trout hybridization. Computer simulations showed that even strong natural selection again hybrids will not prevent the spread of hybridization, although it can slow or delay the spread.  More broadly, our results suggested that mitigating chronic human stressors such as the introduction of nonnative species and habitat modification will be crucial for conserving biodiversity across scales, from genes, to species, to ecosystems.            This project had substantial broader impacts beyond advancing science and conservation. Our results are helping natural resource managers from state, federal, and tribal agencies protect native trout populations that support local and regional economies, ecosystem services and health, and socio-cultural needs.  Other broader impacts include the training of over 20 undergraduate students from 10 states, 3 graduate students, 5 technicians, and 3 young research scientists (postdocs) to conduct field and laboratory work, genomic data analyses, and computer simulation modeling.  This project developed novel genotyping approaches (e.g., RAD capture), along with computer software packages (e.g., admixR) that are freely available to help advance research and population genomic monitoring in many species.  This project supported an annual course (?ConGen?) that trained students, postdocs, university faculty, and government biologists from many countries worldwide in genomic data analysis.
