<AbstractNarration>The PIs propose a three-year project to investigate the origin of the Younger Dryas cooling. New evidence suggests that glacial Lake Agassiz released fresh water to the Arctic through the Mackenzie River and they propose that this signal should be detectable along the western margin of the Canadian Archipelago in the oxygen isotope ratio in the shells of planktonic foraminifera. The project involves a three-week expedition to survey the seafloor and subbottom layers and collect sediment cores from the eastern Beaufort Sea, a region that is remote and has not been well explored. Besides the sediment processing and micropaleontology that are part of generating the isotope data that reflect sea surface salinity, two complementary shore-based projects are proposed. The first is to integrate the new geophysical data on the continental margin with the climate history of the open sea, sediment transport, relative sea level change, and terrestrial climate, as they have done previously for the Chukchi Sea. The second is to compare the geochemical data with results from a high resolution General Circulation Model that is configured to reveal the path and the mixing of the melt water. Although the paleoceanographic data will be spatially limited, model runs will show the low salinity distribution in the Arctic as well as in the Nordic seas where the freshening may have affected deep ocean overturning and caused the Younger Dryas cooling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Younger Dryas was a period of climatic cooling that began about 13,000 years ago and lasted more than 1000 year.  It reversed a period of climatic warming, even though insolation continued to increase.  This study will attempt to determine the mechanism that allowed such a reversal in temperature trend to occur and, thus, inform discussions of whether similar changes are probable in the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2013 colleagues from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (Univ. of California, San Diego), and Oregon State University were funded by NSF to embark on the USCG icebreaker Healy to survey and sample the seafloor between Barrow, Alaska and the Canadian Archipelago in the western Arctic (Beaufort Sea).  Our main goal was to recover long cores of sediment to study the history of climate change in the region since the end of the last ice age.       In 1975 it was reported that a massive flood of melting ice that flowed down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico ended abruptly about 13,000 yrs ago (13 ka).  Those authors measured the oxygen isotope ratio in planktonic foraminifera (microscopic shelled invertebrates) that is related to surface ocean salinity. Because there was still considerable glacial ice that remained in North America, the authors of that paper reasoned that as the ice margin retreated northward across the continent, the St. Lawrence River system would have captured that flow and diverted it eastward to the North Atlantic.  However, years of searching for that event off eastern Canada never found the oxygen isotope signal. Meanwhile, others predicted that the flood might have gone north to the Arctic via Mackenzie River, and suggested that the flood could have caused an abrupt and persistent cold epoch known as the Younger Dryas (YD).       The YD and other abrupt climate events are thought to have been caused by freshening of the surface ocean in the Norwegian and Greenland Seas which interrupted the sinking of dense waters there and the compensating northward warm and salty surface flow of a branch of the Gulf Stream.  Today that northward flow maintains a warm climate in northern Europe, and the loop of deep southern flow and shallow northward flow is sometimes referred to as the "Ocean Conveyor."     In two cores near Mackenzie Delta we found the oxygen isotope signal of flooding and radiocarbon dated it to 12.9 ka.  Those data are supported by the presence of coarse sand and pebbles in the same core samples, and geophysical data that show the coarse layer is extensive. Our results show that prior to 12.9 ka the eastern Beaufort Sea was already freshened although northern hemisphere climate was relatively warm and the so-called Conveyor was active.  We suggest that the sudden addition of water that previously flowed down the Mississippi, plus water that accumulated in lakes around the margin of the ice sheet, entered the eastern Beaufort Sea and flowed north and around Greenland to the Norwegian-Greenland Seas. This flow was the trigger that caused the return of near-glacial conditions for the 1000+ year duration of the YD.      This research (doi: 10.1038/s41561-018-0169-6) is relevant to today?s climate because we are melting Greenland ice at an alarming rate.  We know the Conveyor has slowed in recent decades, and we learned 10 or so years ago that Greenland can melt faster than previously thought.  It seems unlikely that Greenland can melt fast enough to cause an episode such as the YD, however we do not know how sensitive the Conveyor is to changes in surface ocean freshening.
