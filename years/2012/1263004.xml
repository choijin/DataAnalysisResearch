<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;The importance of affordable and high efficiency technologies for renewable energy has been well established and there is a demand for scientifically and technologically competent students who have sufficient experience in research methods, ethics, and teamwork for them to pursue advanced technology careers. To address these needs, an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program focused on Renewable Energy Generation and Storage will be established on the Binghamton University, State University of New York campus. Working with the Center for Autonomous Solar Power (CASP), an interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineering faculty, this REU program will bring up to 10 STEM undergraduate students (sophomore and junior level) and two STEM faculty from four-year colleges together each year for a 9-week summer experience in a stimulating and supportive research environment. A special focus will be placed on incorporating students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines with a plan to reach &gt;50% minority and female participation, and to accomplish this goal, the REU site will work with established minority serving partner institutions. Along with conducting research, the students will participate in education and training programs to support their professional development, present their work to industry members of the CASP technical advisory board, and have access to travel funds to present their work at professional meetings in the year following their experience. Support for this REU is provided by the National Science Foundation's Division of Materials Research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;Affordable and efficient energy generation and storage is a critical technology for the future success of the U.S. and world economy. With the support of the Division of Materials Research at the National Science Foundation, this REU site will build a new research program at the Center for Autonomous Solar Power on the Binghamton University, State University of New York campus. Targeting undergraduate students from groups typically underrepresented in the science and engineering disciplines, a supportive and challenging research experience has been created for each participant that focuses on creating new solutions to current global energy challenges. Students will benefit from both carefully planned, open-ended experimental problems designed to yield significant results and the opportunity to contribute as a member of a research team to the scientific knowledge in their discipline. The program focuses on the development of the REU participants into future leaders in the science and engineering energy community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   A total of 38 students participated in the program in its four year span, including 30 with NSF stipend support, and 8 with matching support from the campus.    The pool of participants included a good representation across chemistry, physics, and engineering.   The diverse pool of students included 42% that were women, 31.6% that were ethnic minority students, and 57.9% from small 4 year colleges and community colleges. 68.4% of students were housed in residence halls on campus and all of the students participated in joint social activities in the evenings and on weekends.  The students that were fortunate enough to be chosen to participate in the Binghamton University REU "Renewable Energy Generation and Storage" were able to engage in a true immersion program in research and in the graduate school experience.  They were able to move from the classroom setting in which identified problems already have answers which they are supposed to understand and master, to an environment in which the problems haven?t yet necessarily been crisply identified, much less resolved with a clear answer.  Working side-by-side with graduate students, they were able to experience "several weeks in the life" of those graduate students while pursuing their own unique research questions.  As a consequence, participants in this program left their summer experience with a much broader and more grounded view of whether a career in research, including the imposing requirement of earning a Ph.D., was a good match to their ambitions, skills, and temperament.   The program not only exposed its participants to the graduate school experience, it resulted in a large proportion of the students (63% in 2013, 60% in 2014, 77% in 2015, and 100% in 2016) planning to apply to graduate school.  Each year of the program, 100% of the participants would strongly recommend the program to future applicants.   Both faculty mentors and REU students felt the REU students had significantly increased their independent research skills.  Specifically, each year, the REU students and the faculty mentors felt that the students had gained significant skills in using the hardware and software in the lab, gaining knowledge independently, taking initiative, and working independently     Across the course of the grant, each of the following objectives were met:  Increase number of students in the program Increase percent of minorities in the program Increase the number of faculty and breadth of disciplines in the program             Last Modified: 12/21/2016       Submitted by: Wayne E Jones, Jr.]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
