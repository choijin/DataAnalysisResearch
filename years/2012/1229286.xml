<AbstractNarration>The primary purpose of the proposed SPASRT telescope is uninterrupted 24-hour radio coverage of the Sun from a single location that would provide unique data for potential transformational studies in solar physics and solar-terrestrial environment. The Antarctic continent, and specifically the South Pole, provides the only practical location on Earth to measure the radio Sun 24/7 for nearly six months of every year. Such continuous 24-hour studies of the radio-emitting Sun, across a wide range of frequencies, would fundamentally advance our knowledge of solar processes that are concurrently observed in the X-ray, UV, and visible regions of the spectrum from both ground and space. This proposal is seeking funds for the development, construction, installation, and testing of SPASRT at South Pole across the 0.5-18 GHz frequency band. The radio telescope design is mature and based on similar telescopes currently in use by the NJIT at the Owens Valley Solar Array in California and by the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute in South Korea; all built by the assembled team on this proposal. The SPASRT antenna mount would allow for the 2.1-m solar radio dish, housed in a Radom, to turn 380-deg around to follow the Sun, with a daily, randomly determined, "unwrapping" period of 60-sec or less. The entire system is designed to withstand the difficult operating conditions of the South Pole and to operate autonomously during the austral summer season. The SPARTS construction and installation will enable immediate studies of (a) solar radio bursts, and (b) a sensitive search for p-mode activity transmitted through the solar atmosphere. Solar radio bursts can dramatically impact technological systems on Earth and in space, both as an indirect consequence of a large source and consequent Coronal Mass Ejections (CME), or as a large source of "noise" in radio systems such as GPS, cell phones, and satellite receivers. 24/7 coverage of burst-prone active regions will yield significant new knowledge. Continuous radio data streams will address the issue of how solar modes, such as p-modes, "propagate" through the solar atmosphere and, potentially, couple into the solar wind, and then cause near-Earth space weather events. The SPASRT system is envisioned as a community-wide instrument with the open data access. SPASRT will make continuous solar radiation measurements for the space weather community and will provide complimentary observing support for other non-polar solar telescope facilities. The project will continue contributing significantly to the training of next generation of scientists by integrating undergraduate education with technology and instrumentation development, field observations, and scientific analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In September 2012 the South Pole, Antarctica, Solar Radio Telescope (SPASRT) was funded by an NSF-MRI award.  This grant enabled the development, construction, installation, and testing of a solar radio telescope to be [eventually] placed at the South Pole station (SPA) for 24-hour continuous, long-term austral summer observations of the sun across the 1-18 GHz frequency band.  This range of frequencies allows for coverage of the solar atmosphere, namely the chromosphere and lower corona (i.e., higher frequencies correspond to lower altitudes).  Such frequency coverage allows for observations of solar flares from a variety of regions, and the 24-hour uninterrupted operations allows for the first continuous solar flare monitoring.  In addition, the SPASRT system will be able to make absolute F10.7 solar radio measurements, a key space weather index, and will not suffer from cloudy conditions, unlike optical solar observations.     The SPASRT radio telescope design utilized mature technologies and is based on similar radio telescopes currently in use.  The receiver made use of recent technological advances in digital technologies to simultaneously cover the full radio band.  The SPASRT system utilizes two sets of 9 parallel IF channels, each of 2000 MHz instantaneous bandwidth, to permit dual-polarization sampling of the entire 1-18 GHz range without frequency or polarization switching.  The RF signal from the dual polarization feed is/will be transmitted directly to a warm control room [at SPA] via optical fiber, and is then down converted and filtered into 9 bands that are simultaneously sampled on each polarization with multiple ADCs.  The entire system is designed to withstand the difficult operating conditions of the South Pole and to operate autonomously during the austral summer season.     The SPASRT system is currently in operations at OVSA.  We are in discussions with NSF-OPP and the Antarctic Support Contractor on SPA siting.  We note that SPASRT data will give uninterrupted, 24-hour coverage of the sun for ~5.5 months of the year. Such data will yield continuous F10.7 measurements and solar radio burst detection.
