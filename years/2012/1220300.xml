<AbstractNarration>The Himalayan range and Tibetan Plateau represent the world?s tallest mountain range and largest area of elevated land, and are the type-example of a mountain belt that formed as a result of continent-continent collision.  This system is still actively growing; therefore, study of these mountains provides a unique opportunity to understand how the crust evolves during this type of plate collision.  Across much of the Himalayan range, rocks that have been buried to depths as much as  approximately 35 km below Earth's surface and taken to temperatures hot enough to partially melt are observed at the surface today.  These rocks have been studied in many parts of the Himalaya, and there is currently a vigorous debate over how these rocks were exhumed to the surface.  The channel flow model predicts that these deeply buried rocks lost much of their strength after partially melting, and were then translated southward and towards the surface.  In comparison, other proposed models argue that faults and shear zones were responsible for their exhumation, and are less focused on the driving force being the weakness of the rocks.  In this project, we propose to test the applicability of these different models to rocks in the kingdom of Bhutan, which lies in the eastern part of the Himalayan range.  We will do this by collecting rock samples during field expeditions, and determining the pressure, temperature, timing, and evolution of deformation that they experienced.  In the past, Bhutan has been relatively isolated for geologic researchers so the majority of the rocks exposed in Bhutan have not been well studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will make a valuable contribution to the debate over how continental crust evolves during collisional mountain building.  In addition, multiple graduate students will be trained in the field and laboratory, including one Bhutanese citizen and current employee of Bhutan's geologic survey.  After he finishes his degree, he will return to Bhutan to take on a leadership role in the study of natural resources, natural hazards, and public policy.  Undergraduate students will also be involved with laboratory analyses and will obtain training, education, and research experience.  Finally, this study will support the research efforts of two early career researchers, as well as foster valuable international collaboration between UNR and scientists at Bhutan?s geological survey.</AbstractNarration>

This system is actively growing; therefore, study of these mountains provides a unique opportunity to understand how the crust evolves during this type of plate collision. Across much of the Himalayan range, rocks that have been buried to depths as much as ~30&ndash;40 km below Earth's surface and taken to temperatures hot enough to partially melt are observed at the surface today. These rocks have been studied in many parts of the Himalaya, and there is currently a vigorous debate over how these rocks were exhumed to the surface. In this project, we analyzed deeply exhumed rocks that are part of the Greater Himalayan (GH) unit exposed in the eastern Himalaya Kingdom of Bhutan. We performed geologic mapping along two north-south transects in central and eastern Bhutan. The transects crossed nearly the entire structural thickness of the unit, and our geochronology, thermochronology, pressure&ndash;temperature estimates, and structural data all suggest that the rocks were exhumed during two stages. The first stage of exhumation was driven by progressive stacking of ductile GH rocks at deep crustal levels, a process known as underplating. The geochronology and pressure&ndash;temperature estimates have defined multiple shear structures, including the previously mapped Kakthang thrust, along which the underplating occurred. This stage of exhumation began in the Oligocene (&gt; ca. 27 Ma) and continued into the Miocene (ca. 14 Ma) in the eastern transect. For the rocks exposed along the central Bhutan transect, initial exhumation occurred as early as ca. 36&ndash;30 Ma. Our data shows, however, that the rocks remained at high temperatures (~550 &ordm;C) until ca. 13 Ma, and therefore, that this initial exhumation event did not drive the rocks to shallow levels. Our GH thermochronology results from the two transects are coeval with published cooling age data from the Lesser Himalayan (LH) rocks, structurally below the GH. Collectively, these results suggest that duplexing of LH rocks caused uplift and erosion of the GH unit, likely driving the second stage of exhumation.
