<AbstractNarration>Richard Schwartz plans to continue his work in geometry and dynamical systems.  The first area of his focus will be the dynamics of particles in the complement of planar polygonal regions. Building on his solution of the 1960 Moser-Neumann question, Schwartz plans to continue developing the theory, finding connections to such subjects as Diophantine approximtion, self-similar tilings, and polytope exchange transformations. The second ares of his focus will be on optimization problems, such as the question of how a finite number of electrons optimally distribute themselves on the sphere.  Specifically, Schwartz would like to extend his solution of Thomson's 5-electron problem to the case of other power laws.  Finally, Schwartz plans to study a variety of geometric iterations, such as high dimensional iterated barycentric subdivision. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part, Schwartz's research involves studying what happens when one makes a simple geometric construction over and over again. For instance, one could follow a ball as it bounces endlessly inside a triangular table, or follow the motion of traffic as it moves along an infinite grid of one-way streets according to certain rules, or study the shapes one gets when one cracks a tetrahedron into smaller and smaller  tetrahedra. Often these simple constructions, when done repeatedly, produce very beautiful and unexpected patterns.  Schwartz likes to study such problems, at first, by doing computer experiments and then, later, by trying to construct rigorous proofs that the phenomena uncovered by the experiments actually exist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the period of this grant I made progress on 3 research projects.  I also wrote and illustrated two picture books about infinity.  I will describe these 5 projects in turn.  The first picture book I wrote is called "Gallery of the Infinite".  It explains some basic concepts about infinity in a colorful and whimsical way. It is designed for high school students and curious adults.   The American Mathematical Society  (A.M.S.) is publishing this book, and it should be in print by the end of the summer.    The second picture book I wrote is called "Life on the Infinite Farm", and it features a hypothetical farm on which the animals are infinitely extended in various ways.  This book is meant for children who are curious about infinity. The A.M.S. has indicated some interest in publishing this book, but I do not yet know whether they will for sure.   For the first math project, I extended my work on the well-known Thomson 5-electron problem from 1904.  Previously I had proved that the triangular bi-pyramid, a particular arrangement of 5 points on the sphere, minimizes the total electrostatic potential amongst all configurations of 5 points on the sphere.  The electrostatic potential corresponds to a particular power-law potential.  Recently I extended my result so that it works for all power laws within a range of potentials.    The second math project deals with a geometric construction which starts with one polygon and produces another one with the same number of sides.  The operation is adapted to projective geometry, the geometry of our vision, and somehow mimics the flow of heat.  I wrote a research monograph, called "The Projective Heat Map", which describes what happens when this operation is performed over and over again on a pentagon.  This monograph is being published by the A.M.S. and will come out next year.  The third math project deals with the construction of cubes filled with very crinkly polyhedral surfaces, sort of like a head flled with the surface of the brain.  When these surfaces are sliced in one direction, they produce curves which are closely related to outer billiards, a dynamical system which is a cousin of ordimary billiards.  When the surfaces are sliced in other directions, they produce patterns related to Pat Hooper's Truchet tile system. These patterns look somewhat like some of the Alhambra frieze patterns.  I wrote a research monograph on my construction, which I called "The Plaid Model".            Last Modified: 07/01/2016       Submitted by: Richard Schwartz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
