<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Science in Action:  Understanding and Sustaining Student Engagement in Environmental Science in Urban, Poverty-Impacted Schools is a proposal to the Research and Evaluation on Education in Science and Engineering (REESE) program to study how domain knowledge, literacy, and the social context of classrooms and schools afford and constrain student engagement and learning in a project-based environmental science course in urban, poverty-impacted high schools. The course concerned, Project-Based Learning  Advanced Placement Environmental Science (PBL-APES), was co-designed with a suburban school district.  The investigators propose in this (2.5 year, medium empirical) project to study the migration of PBL-APES to two diverse, poverty-impacted urban districts. A design-based implementation research approach will be employed to develop and test specific supports for productive disciplinary engagement that address the wide range of student literacy and domain knowledge that the investigators and others have observed in urban settings.</AbstractNarration>

APES, the focus of SIA, is built around inquiry into the question, "How can we live more sustainably?"  (see Figure 1). The yearlong course comprises a series of project cycles that provide multiple opportunities for students to apply scientific concepts and processes to this overarching course master question. Each project cycle casts students in roles as active problem solvers in the context of real-life and simulation-based projects.  SIA enhanced the original PBL-APES course by supporting productive disciplinary engagement through the addition of three synergistic instructional strategies: material tools, framing, literacy supports.  Findings  Material tools are concrete supports (e.g. graphic organizers, question sets, interactive maps, a framework for recording debate arguments, etc.) that are designed to  (1) scaffold student participation in disciplinary practices, (2) provide students and teachers with concrete, shared evidence (formative assessments) of student thinking, and (3) foster, rather than short-circuit, students? own analytical and problem-focused thinking by avoiding over-scaffolding (flipping students into "worksheet mode"). The tools are not ends in themselves&mdash;they are used by students as resources&mdash;as  apply disciplinary concepts in small and large group setting to complete a task or a project  We found that materials tools helped students learn and engage productively in project work when they were viewed, by both teachers and students, as tools&mdash;means to an end&mdash;rather than as worksheets or tasks to be completed and turned in to the teacher (see Framing).  Effective material tools were structured to make thinking about environmental science visible to students and teachers. This helped teachers not only hold students accountable for understanding key concepts and facts but also helped them provide needed support and instruction for learning just by examining the tool as students were working with it.  It further helped students notice what they understood and where they had confusion.  Framing is a teacher practice that provides students with the "connective tissue" to tie together activities, content, and projects: Teachers orient students to their work by describing what, why and how they should approach and think about specific activities and by making explicit to students how the project, task, or activity fits into the course. Using prompts provided in the curriculum, framing highlights for students the connections between prior knowledge and future learning, facilitating adaptive transfer.  Our results of revealed that when teachers explicitly framed project tasks and material tools, students were able to engage in more sophisticated and disciplinary-specific research practices in the APES course.  Framing required teachers to have a deep understanding of the core concept of this course&mdash;sustainability&mdash;and to address the interdisciplinary nature of the natural world as well as the tensions and synergies among competing "views."  Literacy supports were implemented to address prior findings indicating that most teachers and students avoided relying on reading to learn content. Teachers lectured or used other non-reading means to deliver the content covered in the readings. We developed three literacy strategies to help teachers and students actually use texts: -Text-Task Alignment- content experts and teachers collaborated to identify specific, available texts (articles, online sources, newspapers) or sections of texts to make the reading load more manageable for students and to align the readings with the projects. - Before-During-After &ndash; teachers implemented a routine to provide students with a clear purpose for reading a text (Before), strategies to use while reading to help them deal with challenging texts, technical vocabulary, lack of sufficient background knowledge, etc. (During), and opportunities to use what they learned from text to solve a problem or perform a task (After). - Homework reading routines &ndash; explicit directions telling students the purpose of each homework reading (Before), how they should go about doing the reading (During), and how they would be expected to apply what they had learned the next day (After).  Results indicated that teachers with experience implementing the PBL APES curriculum were more willing and able to implement learning from text strategies.
