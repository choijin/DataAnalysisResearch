<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry of the National Science Foundation Professor Raphael Raptis from the Florida International University develop new, bio-inspired, water-oxidation electrocatalysts. This research is based on the idea that a catalyst leading to dioxygen-to-water reduction (such as that observed in an enzyme having a tricopper oxygenase) can be judiciously modified to catalyze the water-to-dioxygen oxidation. Specifically, the work plan consists of efforts to synthesize a hexanuclear copper-pyrazolato scaffold, which will be able to deprotonate water twice, forming coordinated oxide-ions, and template the formation of oxygen-oxygen bonds, upon oxidation. The synthetic work will be theory-driven and will aim at tuning the redox properties of the copper-oxo assembly as to favor O-based oxidation over a Cu-based one. Structural, spectroscopic, magnetic and electrochemical studies of the new complexes will guide the computation of the thermodynamic parameters for this process. The new electrocatalysts will be anchored on electrode surfaces in order to evaluate their electrochemical performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will aim at low-cost electrocatalysts development using Earth-abundant metal, copper, which will achieve the oxidation of water to dioxygen at a low redox potential. This will make the splitting of water an economically viable means of producing hydrogen fuel.  The project also provides its participants with training opportunities in a contemporary, multidisciplinary research field, exposing them at the same time to the work of our local and international collaborators. Dissemination of the project results is accomplished via a host of community outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Multicopper oxidase and oxygenase enzymes play a vital role in the metabolism of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, including humans. Their catalytic properties rely on the cooperation among the metal centers and are fine-tuned by the topology imposed by the protein backbone.  This project studied the chemical and spectroscopic properties of complexes containing three or six copper atoms in close proximity, held together by pyrazolido and oxido/hydroxido ligands. We probed the properties of these new materials by various spectroscopic, electrochemical and magnetic susceptibility methods. Our studies have revealed a trend towards easier oxidation as peripheral ligands higher in the spectrochemical series are introduced to the periphery of the multinuclear clusters. In their oxidized form, the copper clusters are reactive towards organic substrates, which may eventually lead to the synthesis of new industrially-important biomimetic catalysts.  An unexpected discovery of our work was that nitrite  -- a toxic environmental polluter, which, nevertheless, acts also as a store of NO with an important role in human physiology &ndash; is catalytically reduced on our tricopper cluster releasing NO.  Our studies are relevant to understanding the metal-metal interactions in the aforementioned multicopper proteins, while the discovery of a new NO-releasing catalyst may lead in the future to the development of new drugs.  Importantly, the project has also provided training opportunities for two postdoctoral fellows, two graduate and three undergraduate students: The two graduate students included data obtained by the project in the doctoral Theses, while the undergraduate students are now continuing their education in other graduate programs.
