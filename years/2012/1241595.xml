<AbstractNarration>The possibility that human evolution in Africa has been  strongly influenced by Earth's climatic and environmental history over the last several million years has been an important question at the forefront of paleoanthropological research. One fundamental question is: can any of the potential envionmental drivers of evolutionary change be reconstructed with enough precision to allow us to relate them with confidence to the episodes of speciation, extinction and cultural evolution known to anthropologists, and thereby test their relationships in time and space?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team of paleoanthropologists and earth scientists plans to analyze climate and other environmental histories to provide direct tests of key hypotheses linking environmental  history and mammal (including early human) evolution by collecting and analyzing detailed paleoenvironmental data at three key anthropological sites in Africa. They will collect continuous paleoenvironmental records by drilling long sediment cores from ancient lake beds in the northern Afar, Ethiopia (~3.8-2.9 million years ago-Ma), the Baringo Basin, Kenya (~3.2-2.35 Ma), and the Turkana Basin, Kenya (~2.3-1.42 Ma), and relate these records to the outcrops in the same basins that contain early human and other mammal fossils, as well as stone tools in the younger time periods. As a group these basins contain some of the most critical evidence for human evolutionary history in Africa. Although past investigators have reconstructed climate and other environmental histories from the outcrops in which the fossil humans and artifacts have been found, such environmental records are highly discontinuous due to the nature of the sediments where the fossils occur, and are unsuitable for many of the most informative geochemical records available today because of the weathering that has affected outcropping sediments. Drilling lakebeds near the fossil sites gets around these problems, because lake sediments accumulate much more continuously, and because drilling into the subsurface allows unweathered samples to be collected  Funding for the drilling costs for this project has been secured from other sources: with the IPG funds the team will analyze the cores to generate quantitative and high resolution records of changes in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, fire and volcanic activity and other factors which may have influenced human evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary research goal is to obtain long cores from these basins, each of which span critical intervals in human evolution and are close to hominin fossil and archaeological sites. The researchers will apply state-of-the-art paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate methods to these cores to assemble high resolution records covering much of the past four million years of East African environmental history. The team will then evaluate existing hypotheses and generate new hypotheses linking climate history to early human physical and cultural evolutionary adaptations. The paleoenvironmental and paleoecological data collected from the drill cores will be linked directly in time and space to the nearby fossil human, mammal and stone tool records by way of the numerous volcanic ashes present in both the cores and outcrops, along with other dating techniques. By comparing the new records to similar records from nearby ocean sediment cores the researchers plan be able to distinguish local from global drivers of environmental change and in the process test a series of hypotheses linking key events in human evolution with climate and other aspects of environmental history. Finally, the team will use these new, combined paleoenvironmental and paleoanthropological data sets, combined with novel modeling techniques to better understand how landscape and climate change across various scales of time and space may have affected the availability and predictability of critical ecosystem resources upon which early humans would have depended. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will greatly expand our understanding of African climate history and will be an opportunity to invigorate interest in human evolution and its relationship to climate with the US and African public. The project will train many American and African students during its field, analytical and internship/synthesis phases, and will generate numerous informal science learning opportunities  through our collaborations with the National Museums of Kenya and Ethiopia and the Smithsonian Institution.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Understanding whether earth system processes have impacted human evolution is an enduring scientific challenge that generates broad interest among scientists and the general public. Research on environment-human evolution relationships is interdisciplinary, involving studies in solid earth sciences, climatology, and anthropology. The Hominin Sites and Paleolakes Drilling Project (HSPDP) takes on this challenge, by bringing together a wide range of scientists with the breadth of expertise needed to transform our understanding of the environmental dynamics that may have impacted human evolution in Africa. This project has vastly expanded the paleoenvironmental data set upon which hypotheses about the relationship between environment and human origins must be based, by obtaining continuous paleoenvironmental records from long paleolake drill cores from five high-priority, carefully selected coring areas in Ethiopia and Kenya.</p> <p>This collaborative research grant contributed funding to 1) the initial core description and sampling of sediment cores from the northern Awash drilling area in Afar, Ethiopia, 2) the analysis of the volcanic ash layers that are used to correlate the cores to each other as well as to nearby fossiliferous outcrops, and 3) analysis of soil carbonates to determine the varying proportions of woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) and grasses that existed on the landscape through time. This region of Ethiopia is famous for the preservation of abundant fossil remains of the early hominin <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> (e.g., &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Selam&rdquo;), as well as rich mammalian faunal and floral records. The drilling target for this site were the sediments of &ldquo;Lake Hadar&rdquo; that existed between ~2.9-3.6 million years ago (Ma) and located ~30 km northeast of the <em>A. afarensis</em> bearing exposures of the Hadar and Dikika paleoanthropological sites. The goal for this site was to test environmental hypotheses related to the evolution of <em>A. afarensis</em> with new, high-resolution paleoclimate data.&nbsp;</p> <p>Three drill cores were collected from the N. Awash drilling area. Two cores were collected at the Oso Isi site (NAO) to a maximum depth of 187m, and a third 245m core was collected at Weranso (NAW, ~3km east). Given the overlapping sections of the two sites a total stratigraphic thickness of ~275m was recovered. Overall, the core indicates a lacustrine dominated sequence that includes multiple phases of deep lake conditions throughout the core with periodic episodes of regression/subaerial exposure and soil formation in the upper half of the core.</p> <p>In combination with other NSF awards funding additional analytical work, geochronological and volcanic ash correlations indicate an age range of ~2.93 Ma to ~3.3 Ma for the cores. The geochemical analysis of volcanic ash from the cores have established multiple core-to-core and core-to-outcrop correlations for up to 30km away. These new correlations will be critical to tie in the lake core paleoenvironmental records to the fossiliferous outcrops. Results from isotopic analyses of soil carbonates from the cores have similar values/ranges as from the surrounding paleontological localities and are generally dominated by wooded grasslands. There is a slight upcore trend towards the presence of more C4 (grassy) values, but with broad variability and still within the context of a mixed wooded-grassland to grassy-woodland. Additional paleoenvironmental records to compliment this work are being generated with funding from additional grants.</p> <p>HSPDP maintains a project website (<a href="http://hspdp.asu.edu">http://hspdp.asu.edu</a>) and Facebook page, (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/HSPDP">https://www.facebook.com/HSPDP</a>) for both scientists and the general public. A Human Climate: A 3D film documenting the HSPDP drilling work and its connection to hominin evolution has been produced and shown in 3D at museums affiliated with the project. A 2D version of the film is also available (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1iU0fBTfUw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1iU0fBTfUw</a>). The Northern Awash component of HSPDP has also provided significant opportunities for training in scientific drilling, initial core description, and sampling for a large team (&gt;20) of US and Ethiopian students and junior level scientists as well as graduate student support for two female geoscientists who have focused on the core material for their Ph.D. dissertation work. &nbsp;</p> <p>Questions about human origins and the origins of "human" behavior feature prominently in today's society, even if controversial in some realms. Similar sentiments exist regarding broader scale issues of climate change and human evolution. As scientists, gathering evidence and testing hypotheses, which this project does, is critical to improving public knowledge about these topics. Results from the HSPDP will significantly improve our understanding of environmental history for the study regions in the Kenyan and Ethiopian rift valleys. When combined with our understanding of hominin, fossil vertebrate and stone tool records from nearby outcrops, the results of the project data sets and modeling are intended to allow us to test various theories about climate's role in human evolution. Results from this project will have an impact on our broader understanding of how species (including humans) react to, and either evolve from or go extinct as a result of climate change, a critical topic given concerns over anthropogenic climate change in the modern world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/03/2017<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;Campisano</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1241595/1241595_10218532_1496525613351_Fig3-CoreImages--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1241595/1241595_10218532_1496525613351_Fig3-CoreImages--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1241595/1241595_10218532_1496525613351_Fig3-CoreImages--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Examples of lithologies from the HSPDP drill cores.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Christopher Campisano</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;Campisano</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1241595/1241595_10218532_1496525512133_Fig2-Rigs--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1241595/1241595_10218532_1496525512133_Fig2-Rigs--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1241595/1241595_10218532_1496525512133_Fig2-Rigs--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photos of the HSPDP drilling operations.
