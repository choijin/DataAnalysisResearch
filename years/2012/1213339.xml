<AbstractNarration>This is a two part project that will make use of a set of flexible, small scale seismic arrays. The design of the arrays will be optimized to estimate the spatial gradients of regional and teleseismic wavefields. In the first portion of the project, a single, fourteen-element array will be deployed with the goal of determining the optimal array geometry and aperture to estimate wavefield gradients, as well as to quantify the uncertainty of these measurements.  The second portion will consist of two, simultaneous deployments of seismic arrays in two adjacent locations.  The first location is a former floodplain, with approximately 700m of unconsolidated alluvium overlying bedrock.  The second location has bedrock within one meter of the surface.  The goal of this portion of the project is to rigorously document the effects of near-surface geology on parameters estimated from seismic spatial gradients (such as strain, rotation, P-S energy partitioning, etc).&lt;br/&gt;Up to now, there has been no study to quantify the accuracy and/or precision of seismic wavefield gradients using small-scale seismic arrays (termed gradiometers).  However, previous studies suggest that gradiometers are highly sensitive to uncertainties in instrument location, noise in the recorded seismograms, and local subsurface geology.  This study will investigate these issues in detail and attempt to 1) produce a set of guidelines for deploying seismic gradiometers, and 2) quantify the effects of local geologic conditions on the estimation of seismic attributes derived from gradient estimations.   By developing a standard of seismic array design, future gradient measurements will be uniform allowing a more direct comparison from one experiment to another.  Furthermore, by rigorously quantifying the effects of subsurface geology on parameters derived from seismic gradients, our interpretations of Earth structure will be more accurate, as well as our interpretations of the nature of the seismic source.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For this project, we had two primary goals, both centered on the concept of seismic gradiometry.  The first goal was to create a series of best practices, in regards to array aperture and instrument configuration, for seismic gradiometric arrays.  We found that to minimize the effects of uncertainty in instrument response and geographic location it's best to have an array aperture of at least three percent of the horizonatal wavelength of the wavefield under investigation.  Also, we found that to best instrument configuration places the instruments on the perimeter of the array, with no instruments in the center.  The second goal was to usetwo simultaneioulsy deployed seismic gradiometers to measure the effects of near-surface geology on the partitioningof P to S energy.  The arrays (designed according to the principles found in the first portion of this project) weredeployed in two geologically distinct areas within a few tens of kilometers of each other.  We found that the ratioof S to P energy in the seismic coda is frequency dependant and heavily dependant on near surface geologic conditions.These observations were predicted in models but have never been directly obseved before.  The broader impacts of this  project are the development of design criteria for the deployment of seismic gradiometers and the intellectual merit of  this work is the direct observation of near-surface effects on the observation of S to P energy partitioning.
