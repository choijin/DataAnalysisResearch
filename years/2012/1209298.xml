<AbstractNarration>This action funds Brian Damit of The University of Florida to conduct a research project, entitled "Determining how airborne bacteria die by high temperatures," during the summer of 2012 at Peking University in Beijing, China. The host scientist is Professor Maosheng Yao.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the first detailed experimental study to test an existing theory of how high temperature kills airborne bacteria. Pathogenic airborne microorganisms in bioaerosols pose a risk of infection. Recently, it has been shown that they can be killed by infrared radiation that exposes them to high temperatures for a short time. This research seeks to determine the inactivation mechanism by observing possible cell structure damage using transmission electron microscopy (TEM)and DNA degradation using gel electrophoresis.  Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacterium, will be used as the model microorganism in these studies. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Airborne microbes (bioaerosols) transmit diseases like influenza and tuberculosis and are a danger to human health that must be addressed.
