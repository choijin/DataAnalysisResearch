<AbstractNarration>Licensed spectrum services today are offered by a few large providers with a national presence, and market competition is realized only at the national scale. Typical provider-customer contracts are relatively long term with few standard contract choices, which does not lead to the best value realization for the customer. Furthermore, mobile users are often restricted to using long range communication to the provider's base stations, even when they are in the range of access points of other users that are currently under-loaded but closed for public use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project attempts to address those limitations. Firstly, it studies the viability of regional wholesale spectrum markets, and the role that should be played by regional spectrum providers with secondary licenses and localized operation. Secondly, it investigates the design and pricing of flexible provider-customer spectrum service contracts that would enable both contracting parties to operate at their desired risk-return tradeoff points. Thirdly, this project studies access, security and incentive mechanism design questions that can enable users to serve as micro-providers, or share their spectrum contracts with others in their "community". These explorations are conducted using economic/business theories of investment analysis, financial engineering, risk management, control and optimization, and network game theory, as well as small-scale user surveys and simulation experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader goal of the project is to facilitate a more layered market structure that will increase the number of regional players in the spectrum service contracting business, and also involve the users in providing spectrum services to others. More local competition would allow more competitive prices for spectrum usage, better local expansion and coverage, and therefore better access for users. Sharing of unused spectrum by users with each other would enable better spectrum access and rates, and revenue to users who share their unused spectrum. Spectrum service innovations that this project explores, along with presence of regional providers, would allow users to have individualized spectrum contracts with more flexible terms and conditions than what exist today.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of the project include new ideas on how to structure spectrum markets, optimize spectrum contract portfolios, and price spectrum contracts, so as to allow flexible trading and use of spectrum. More specifically, the project has contributed to new ideas and mechanisms for spectrum markets in the following four aspects.  First, the project has resulted in the design and analysis of a hierarchical market structure and contracting mechanisms that could be used by wireless/mobile service providers to trade spectrum and spectrum-derived services with each other. It has also defined the role and function of present day mobile virtual networks operators (MVNO) and the mobile network operators (MNO) in this context.  Second, it has led to the formulation of the portfolio optimization problem for spectrum providers, through which spectrum service providers can optimally balance their portfolio of primary and secondary service contracts, to trade off between revenue and service outage probability. Computationally efficient methods/approximations for solving the spectrum portfolio optimization problem were also obtained.  Third, mechanisms for pricing spectrum derivative contracts have been obtained through this research project. In particular, given a model for the spot spectrum contract pricing, the project has obtained mechanisms on how complex spectrum contracts should be priced, and how this price varies with spot price volatility and contract parameters.   Fourth, this project has resulted in a formulation of the spectrum asset-liability management framework from the perspective of a mobile service provider. The framework allows evaluating a variety of service portfolios with traditional and novel service mix, for their best matched asset portfolios. It was found that the provider should utilize a mix of primary and secondary contracts, and use the costlier spot contracts to fulfill peak-time demands.  This project has led to several publications in international journals and conferences, and has contributed towards two PhD dissertations. The solutions developed can also help spectrum providers sustain profitable operation, while bringing in new and flexible services to their customers.
