<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is well recognized that Big Data holds immense potential to transform science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Software platforms for Big Data also present the next frontier in addressing the unique challenges, not just to manage the data avalanche but to analyze, sift and synthesize knowledge that can leverage the information mined from such data. Recent advances in accelerated systems infrastructure offer a multiplicative effect on traditional HPC systems through the advent of Cloud and many-core computing, and offer a potential solution for integrating access to and analysis over Big Data. This convergence of Big Data software platforms with accelerated infrastructure has the potential for transformative scientific advancement.  The aim of this project was to investigate the role of international collaborations in enhancing scientific discovery and technological progress by leveraging the research investments made by US and foreign agencies for accelerating research breakthroughs. Access to complementary skills and diverse data on natural and social phenomenon can help find broadly applicable solutions to complex problems of societal importance, such as water management and smarter infrastructure, while also offering access to skilled researchers in a globalized world.  Major activities that were conducted as part of this project led to the following outcomes:  Identification of relevant problems of mutual interest, Successfully fostering mutually beneficial collaborations across geographical boundaries and Identification of need for virtual interactions of a motivated and cohesive team of researchers from the US and India at the intersection of Big Data Platforms and Accelerated Infrastructure, and the Scientific and Engineering applications that can leverage them.
