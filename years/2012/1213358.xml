<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Alexander Li at Washington State University and his group will develop new analytical methods for sensitive detection using photoswitchable probes.  Specifically, the project will first prepare photoswitchable probes, aiming at optimizing those properties associated with photoswitching, such as the bright-to-dark contrast.  Subsequently, samples labeled with such photoswitchable probes will be investigated using fluorescence microscopes.  The fundamental principle to be demonstrated is that photoswitchable probes offer much enhanced sensitivity while compared to conventional fluorescent probes.  One of the advantages of using photoswitchable probes is that photoswitching can effectively provide means to rid of false positives, a very important attribute in real-world detections.  Another anticipated outcome is that photoswitching enables frequency-domain imaging, which amplifies the signal while suppressing other noise.  The key to the success resides in the chemistry because preparation of such photoswitchable probes is at the focal point at solving real-world problems like false positives and signal amplification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students who will be involved in this project will be trained in chemical synthesis, biological sample preparation, optical instrumentation, laser spectroscopy, and photonic measurements. Outreach to middle school and high school students through workshop will help to stimulate scientific interest of the younger generation and broaden impacts to general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 1. Introduction  The major goal of this project is to design, synthesize and analyze new enabling photoswitchable molecules using the strategy of opening and closing a conjugation bridge.  Specifically, we will use light to switch the molecular structure from one state (defined as "open state") to another state (defined as "closed state") (Figure 1).  There are a number of driving forces behind developing such molecular photo-switches.  For example these molecular switches enable signal amplification, thus chemical measurement and molecular imaging will have much improved sensitivity when compared using similar probes that do not have such switching properties.  Another example is that molecular switching allows encoding of the optical signals.  Consequently, digital information can be created using such molecular photo-switches and then launched into optical fiber for telecommunication.  2. Outcomes  Our efforts in this project have generated many molecular switches.  These molecular switches have contributed significant improvements in chemical measurement and molecular imaging because they have unique switching properties.  Mainly, the enhancement was achieved by transforming time-domain data into frequency domain spectra.  Here we will highlight a specific topic to illustrate the outcomes specifically.  Using one ray of light to encode another ray of light is highly desirable because information in optical format can be directly transferred from one beam to another without converting back to the electronic format.  One key medium to accomplish such an amazing task is photoswitchable molecules.  Using such molecular switches in solid thin-film devices, we cycled them between its open state and its closed state quantitatively with excellent fatigue resistance and high thermal stability.  This quantitative photo switching controls another light travelling through the molecular switches at an orthogonal angle.  The net result is that optical information inherent to the first beam is encoded onto the second beam, thus imparting photo-optical modulation on the orthogonal light beam (Figure 2).  To illustrate the principle, we transmitted alphabet letters using binary codes of standard 8-bit ASCII characters in optical fibers.  Random alphabet soups rarely impart meaning. However, when these letters are encoded at a specific sequence, meaningful information is launched into the output fiber.  For example, the word "and" consists of three letters arranged in a specific sequence and each letter is represented by an eight-digit binary code (Figure 3).  Thus the word "and" consists of the data string of 011000010, 01101110, and 01100100 in binary numbers.  The definition of "0" is that the signal (absorbance in this case) is below 1/3 of the 100% response; whereas "1" is defined when the response is greater than 2/3 of the 100% value.   To demonstrate the proof-of-concept, we sent a data stream using 375-nm (binary 1) and 561-nm (binary 0) laser pulses carrying information of "ECUST and WSU collaboration" (Figure 4).  In this data stream taken from absorbance at 568 nm, each letter corresponds to eight binary digits that are grouped together with a grey bar and their corresponding letter above the data.  A space is added between letters so that they can be easy recognized.  Figure 4 depicts the read out of the data stream from the passing light orthogonal to the encoding lasers.  The results prove that information encoded by the lasers is faithfully transferred to the white light beam without a single error.
