<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to formulate a methodology and system for the micro-manipulation of a waterjet serving as a laser beam waveguide leading to the development of a new multi-functional hybrid waterjet-guided laser micro-manufacturing process and machine capable of laser ablation, micro-cutting, surface micro-texturing and modification and micro-incremental forming. The salient characteristic of the envisioned process rests in the possibility of simultaneously using thermal and mechanical actions with different attributes in controlled proportions. The approach will be the use of a controlled electrostatic field generated by a multi-pole actuator to bend the waterjet waveguide and, thereby, control the spatial orientation, the position of impingement, direction of lasing action and the force the waterjet exerts on the workpiece. The principal tasks will be: (1) waterjet waveguide characterization; (2) waterjet bending and control through an electrostatic actuator; (3) waterjet-guided micro-incremental forming process development; and (4) construction of an experimental prototype machine to serve as a vehicle for process model and technology verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will lead to a new ability to manufacture three-dimensional micro-features on metallic and non-metallic parts without relocating the part, which will lead to enhanced precision. The physical interaction of the waterjet and laser beam will open process windows for achieving deformation, cutting, and surface treatment of the workpiece material in a single hybrid integrated manufacturing machine. Process productivity will be considerably enhanced because of the anticipated high process bandwidth. The project will provide training to a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students and practitioners through research opportunities, course projects and short courses.</AbstractNarration>
