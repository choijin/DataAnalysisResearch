<AbstractNarration>Michael L. Klein at Temple University is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in research coupling novel computational algorithms and methods with leadership-class HPC resources to understand membrane fusion, a key process in viral infection and neurotransmitter release at the synapse. In the latter, fusion proteins enhance the intrinsic slow rate of vesicle-membrane fusion when a 30-50 nm vesicle delivers neurotransmitter to the plasma membrane. The long-term aim is to elucidate the mechanistic role played fusion proteins. The size, time-scale, and complexity of the fusion process demands the use of coarse grain simulation methodologies such as those developed by the PI's group for lipid-vesicle self-assembly and related phenomena exhibited by surfactants and macromolecules. Synaptic vesicles are of the size just now accessible with molecular dynamics simulation on state-of-the-art hardware. The immediate challenge is to handle the fusion proteins and then build a complete simulation package - within the massively parallel LAMMPS simulation code - to eventually explore the complete fusion process using models calibrated to realistic simulations of the components. The proposal involves an international collaboration to further elaborate the needed models for charged lipids and their interaction with proteins and counter ions. The closely related process of vesicle-vesicle fusion is broadly relevant to research in surfactant science and nanotechnology. Thus, success will impact fundamental and applied science ranging from chemistry and biology to nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research on using state of the art computer simulation to model key biological processes will be carried out in the Institute for Computational Molecular Science (ICMS). Since its creation in 2009, ICMS has spawned new junior faculty hires with an interest in computation. ICMS already offers informal classes on parallel programming and HPC tools, and classes on molecular modeling, which have impacted education -- faculty, post-docs, grad students and undergraduates in Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics take advantage of the expertise residing in ICMS. The long-term goal is to develop these informal offerings into formal undergraduate courses and masters degree programs. ICMS has already embraced significant outreach to the public and society at large (Philadelphia Science Fair and the Franklin Institute). Going forward, it will integrate its HR development efforts with existing programs such as TU-teach, which benefit undergraduates and local high school science teachers. ICMS will continue to host extended visits of scientists from around the World plus graduate students from other labs who can enjoy the intellectual diversity of ICMS research -- chemistry, physics, materials science, pharmacology, and neuroscience. ICMS graduates have been hired by industry and into tenure track positions in academe, which attests to the important of its societal impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award made possible the development of computational methods to study the dynamics of biological membranes at the molecular level, and then use these methods to shed light on the physical mechanism involved in the fusion between two membranes.  The accurate technique called, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is now routinely used to study the chemical and mechanical properties of individual proteins (comprised of tens of thousands of atoms).  However, the same has not been achieved for aggregates of biological molecules such as those comprising self-assembling lipid membranes, which are the building blocks of cell walls. Here, the number of lipids contained in even a small portion with dimensions one-micron by one-micron can exceeds one million, which in turn implies more than 100 million atoms.  Throughout the duration of this project, we performed MD simulations aimed to understand the mechanism involved in the fusion of two model lipid membranes. In so doing, we have had to develop new methods and implemented computer software, which has been made available to the research community at large.  Our efforts have enabled MD simulations to provide quantitative results for other challenging problems.  Specifically, we have adapted a software module previously developed for the study of small proteins for its use on large model systems (many millions of atoms), and augmented its functionality with new features dedicated to the study of lipid membranes.  We also extended our "coarse-grained" MD simulation method, which alleviates the cost of large simulations by decreasing the model's resolution: previously, the method was limited to the study of synthetic membranes composed by a single lipid type (i.e., phosphocholine-based lipids).  We extended the method to other lipid types and particularly cholesterol, allowing a realistic description of biological membranes as lipid mixtures.  The method performs exceptionally well at retaining the accuracy of atomistic-resolution models for a small fraction of the computational cost, thus making accurate simulations of biological membranes affordable.  These methods have already been used in several studies performed not only by us, but also by other labs.  Importantly, we have carried out tests on the ability of the above-mentioned methods to describe realistic mechanisms of membrane fusion.  In a simulation of two vesicles whose membranes are both composed by a mixture of lipid types, we showed that the mechanism of fusion strives to minimize the energy of the two vesicles' membranes not only by limiting their overall curvature, but also through the selective partitioning of lipids (phosphoetanolamine-based) that favor local curvature at the fusion point.  In addition, we studied an example of membrane fusion where the mechanism favors a quick fusion process, through the action of lipids that favor a spontaneous curvature (ceramide lipids) of the entire membrane.  This process is at the basis of the formation of the lipid matrix of mammalian skin, whereby multiple lipid membranes fuse into a thick multilayer that is able to seal the gap between two adjacent cells of the epidermis.  Our model predicts that the multi-layered, fused structure is also preferred at the slightly acidic conditions characteristic of outer human skin.  Importantly, the methods above described and their applications have already been published or in the process of being published in peer-reviewed journals.  All developed software has been released under open-source licenses.       Last Modified: 09/14/2016       Submitted by: Giacomo Fiorin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
