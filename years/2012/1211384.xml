<AbstractNarration>This award will support a theoretical project to model the interior conditions of several stellar types in which magnetic fields may play an important role.  These are rapidly rotating A-type stars, low-mass M-type stars, and stars formed early in the history of the universe.  Dr. Chaboyer will create a new generation of stellar interior models that perform computations in two spatial dimensions, with the goal of capturing important physics that is missing from common one-dimensional models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new theoretical models will be made widely available to the community, thereby broadening the software infrastructure that modelers can take advantage of.  Graduate students will receive training in astrophysics and computational methods, and the PI will continue ongoing outreach efforts directed at K-8 students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Astronomers routinley consult theoretical models for the structure and evolution of stars to interpret their observations of starlight.  These models allow astronomers to do things like estiamte the age of a star, is size (radius) and its mass.  Models for the evolution of stars were first developed over 50 years ago, and have become increasingly sophisticated over time. However, all current stellar evolution models still rely upon a relatively crude approximation for treating the transfer of heat due to convection within a star.  This approximation includes an adjustable parameter, typically referred to as the mixing length parameter.  The mixing length  parameter is calibrated to the Sun (whose propeties like radius, mass and age we know extremely well from independent observations) and the same value of the parameter is used to model other types of stars.    By analyzing a diverse set of individual stars which have very well determined properties, we have determined that one should not use the solar calibrated value of the mixing length parameter when modeling the evolution of stars other than the Sun.  For example, the old cluster of stars called Messier M92 is best fit with stellar models which mixing length which is about 10% lower than the solar calibrated value of 1.95.   Similarly, a detailed study of the nearby stars  alpha-Centauri A and B revealed that alpha-Centauri A (which is slighty more massive than the Sun) is best fit with models which have a mixing iength which is 10% lower than the solar calibrated value, while alpha-Centgaur B (which is slightly less massivce than the Sun) is best fit with models which have  mixing length which is 10% higher than the solar calibrated value.    Together these above results make it clear that astronomers need to update and refine their treatment of heat transport by convection in stellar models.
