<AbstractNarration>This project explores a new design approach, Design for Deconstruction that has emerged to facilitate future reuse of materials. The objectives of the proposed research are to develop new structural system concepts and establish comprehensive life-cycle assessment for deconstructable steel and composite steel/concrete construction. Design for Deconstruction coupled with the use of recycled materials will facilitate sustainable construction.  Composite steel/concrete floor systems, by far the most ubiquitous type of structural steel framing for commercial and institutional buildings, is a key focus of this work. These floor systems currently require monolithic construction to ensure adequate performance.  While these floor system materials may be recycled, currently they cannot be refabricated and reused in buildings. The proposed system maintains the efficiency benefits offered by composite action of steel and concrete construction, including reduced steel beam sizes and flexible floor framing patterns, while directly addressing the need to reduce waste in the construction industry.  The research includes quantification of deconstructable connection behavior through conducting full-scale component tests of clamping connections, and conducting full-scale tests and corroborating analyses of the proposed deconstructable composite floor system to validate the integrity of the system.  The project includes advancement of the methodologies for conducting environmental life-cycle assessment of deconstructable systems, and developing design strategies for deconstructable steel framing systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is expected to establish fundamental strategies for predicting the behavior and design of sustainable steel structures through combining prefabrication strategies with Design for Deconstruction to achieve direct reusability of composite floor systems. Coupled with advancement in life-cycle assessment strategies for deconstructable steel framing systems, this research is expected to provide fundamental knowledge towards encouraging and codifying a reduction in material use and associated environmental impacts in the steel construction industry. Since building construction accounts for a significant portion of all environmental impacts associated with buildings, reusing composite floors will have significant environmental benefits.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>According to the U.S. Department of Energy, construction and use of commercial and residential buildings accounted for nearly 45% of U.S. energy consumption in recent years. In addition, a recent United Nations Environment Programme report notes that 40-50% of total material flows worldwide are into building materials. A new design approach known as<em> <strong>Design for Deconstruction</strong></em> <strong><em>(DfD)</em></strong> has emerged to facilitate future reuse of materials in construction. Composite floor framing systems, by far the most ubiquitous type of structural steel floor framing for commercial and institutional buildings, are currently not amenable to deconstruction due to the monolithically poured concrete floor slabs. The objectives of this research were to develop new structural system concepts and establish comprehensive life-cycle assessment strategies for deconstructable steel and composite steel/concrete construction to facilitate <strong><em>DfD</em>, </strong>coupled with the use of recycled materials in sustainably optimized construction. The experimental component of the research included developing prototype concepts for deconstructable composite floor systems that may be used within a complete, bolted, deconstructable structural steel framing system. In the proposed system, precast concrete planks are attached to steel beams using deconstructable clamping connectors, enabling straightfoward deconstruction and reuse of the structural components. This research included:&nbsp; 1) the development of prototype structures and preliminary design approaches for the deconstructable composite framing system; 2) advancement of the methodologies for conducting environmental life-cycle assessment of deconstructable steel systems<strong>; </strong>3) quantification of deconstructable composite connection behavior through conducting full-scale component tests of the clamping connections; 4) validation of the integrity of the system details through conducting full-scale experimental tests and corroborating analyses of the proposed deconstructable composite floor system subjected to gravity load to explore the limits of response and the progression of damage of the system; and 5) developing design strategies for deconstructable steel framing systems within the context of the <em>Specification for Structural Steel Buildings </em>from the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC).&nbsp; The prototype deconstructable floor system is illustrated in Figure 1. This staggered plank system is designed to maintain the benefits of steel-concrete composite construction, such as enhanced flexural strength and stiffness, reduced steel beam size and weight, and ease of construction, and to enable component disassembly and reuse of the structural components.&nbsp; A typical plank size within a building floor system would be 20 ft. x 2 ft. x 6 in. This size is believed to be large enough to ensure structural integrity and reduce labor for construction and deconstruction but small enough to facilitate handling, transportation, and reuse in new structures. Ideally, the planks are stocked in different sizes and concrete strengths for ready use, comparable to how structural steel is currently stocked at supply centers. A typical plan layout for a prototype office building using this system with a staggered plank configuration is shown in Figure 2. Eight full-scale pushout tests were conducted under both monotonic and cyclic loading to establish the behavior of the clamping connections for both gravity applications and for use as fasteners to accomplish load transfer between floor diaphragms and lateral load-resisting systems in seismic applications. Configurations with one, two, or three channels per plank were investigated in these experiments. The results consistently showed strengths comparable to those of headed steel stud connectors now used in composite beams in steel buildings. The clamps also consistently exhibited ductile behavior for monotonic loading, retaining over 80% of the peak strength of the clamp. For cyclic loading, as may be exhibited during an earthquake, the clamps showed stable behavior, with gradually decreasing strength as the clamping bolt yielded and the clamping friction reduced. This type of behavior may be accounted for in design through taking a reduction in the clamp strength in seismic regions, as is customary now for headed stud connectors. Four full-scale composite beams, each 32 feet long with different levels of composite action, were tested to failure. Figure 3 shows a schematic of the experimental test setup, with vertical loading applied to simulate heavy gravity loads on the composite beam. Figures 4 and 5 show the response of one of the specimens after significant deformation of the beam.&nbsp; Figure 6 shows the resulting load-deformation response of the four specimens.&nbsp; All of the beams behaved in a ductile manner with minimal slip of the clamps and little or no strength degradation. The tested flexural strengths of the beams were comparable to the predicted strengths from the AISC <em>Specification for Structural Steel Buildings</em>. The specimens were readily deconstructed after the testing was completed.&nbsp; Life-cycle studies of this system confirm savings in energy and CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions after only one reuse, and significant savings after two reuses of the planks.&nbsp; Coupled with reuse of bolted steel framing, this research provides a significant step towards nearly 100% direct reusability of materials for structural steel building systems, one of the most ubiquitous forms of construction in the U.S.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Jerome&nbsp;F&nbsp;Hajjar</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200820/1200820_10163206_1506803715620_170930NSFUnsolicitedFall2011--DfD--ProjectOutcomes-Figures4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200820/1200820_10163206_1506803715620_170930NSFUnsolicitedFall2011--DfD--ProjectOutcomes-Figures4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4.
