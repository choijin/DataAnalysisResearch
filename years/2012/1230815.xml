<AbstractNarration>The proposed research targets improving the computing environment for important scientific problems without requiring large expensive systems. The objective of this new fundamental research is to perform science domain exploration to broaden the applicability of scalable RC systems and GPUs across other domains and industry sectors that have great computational&lt;br/&gt;needs; and research methods and develop an infrastructure to enable domain computational scientists (not expert users of accelerators) to use accelerator technologies (based on FPGAs and GPUs) in a productive manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the proposed work have the potential to greatly expand the use of reconfigurable computing for solution of critical [problems in science and engineering. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the centers portfolio through collaboration of two of its sites as well as extend the scope and horizon of the CHREC center research projects and direction, benefiting current industry members while attracting potential new ones. The PIs research will likely impact diverse undergraduate and graduate students at each institution. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under the auspices of the NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), this fundamental research project was carried out with two major goals.  Firstly, we sought to carry out science domain explorations to broaden the applicability of scalable reconfigurable computing (RC) systems and GPUs across other domains and industry sectors that have great computational needs.  Second, our objective was to investigate a software infrastructure that would enable domain computational scientists to use accelerator technologies (based on FPGAs and GPUs) in a productive manner.  The outcomes of our efforts along these two directions, carried out jointly by the University of Florida (UF) and the George Washington University (GWU) sites of CHREC, are summarized below.  Intellectual Merit:  Science Domain Explorations:  Two computational finance applications on RC (FinRC) were explored; one, an application for derivative pricing based on a Monte Carlo simulation method using the Heston model, through interactions with UBS Investment Bank; and second, interacting with Altera Corporation, IBM, and the Securities Technology Analysis Center (STAC), an implementation of a standard benchmark defined by STAC to study productive hardware design using Altera OpenCL, a high-level synthesis language for FPGAs.  The DSP application domain for RC systems (DspRC) was also explored, which includes applications that were implemented on FPGAs to accelerate unsupervised, real-time image and video processing for autonomous applications.  All of the RC applications were developed at University of Florida, using the Novo-G reconfigurable supercomputer as the research platform.  Excellent performance and scaling results was demonstrated for all these apps, with some of them showing over three orders of magnitude speedup.  To showcase the advantages of GPU technologies, one of the FinRC apps, the Heston model based multi-asset option pricing, was also implemented on NVIDIA GPU. This æFinGPUÆ implementation was developed at the George Washington University, using the Cray XK7m supercomputer æGeorgeÆ as the research platform.  Again, very good performance was observed.  Productive Application Development Framework: The goal was to provide a software framework that allows developers to easily integrate accelerated tasks that are based on either GPUs or FPGAs.  The developed solution, the Heterogeneous Accelerated Adaptive Computing (HAAC) system, allows a developer to add FPGA and GPU accelerated tasks to the library by following a set of documented steps without recompiling the entire library.  HAAC then enables productive use of the accelerator resources by providing efficient and transparent management and scheduling of the underlying GPUs and FPGAs within each compute node, without the domain scientist worrying about which accelerator is being used for each of their tasks. The GWU team lead this part of the effort, supported by active collaborations with the UF team who provided the FinRC and DspRC applications that were used along with the GPU counterparts developed at GWU.  Publications: Some of the work carried out under this project has already been presented and published in conferences and a journal, including the ACM Computing Frontiers conference (Li et al., May 2014), the International Conference on Image Processing (Zicari et al., July 2013) the IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (Craciun et al., June 2013), and the Computers journal (Li et al., Nov 2013).      Broader Impact:  Technology: The developed methods and technologies can also support R&amp;D in other fields of science and engineering that require application acceleration, thereby enabling new and better scientific experiments not practical on conventional computing technologies and thus having a wide impact.  Student Education: Research activities conducted under this project at both sites enhanced the educational ex...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
