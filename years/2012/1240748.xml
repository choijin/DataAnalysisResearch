<AbstractNarration>1240748 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Kunz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considering the vast importance of multiphase flows in energy systems, biomedicine, defense systems, manufacturing, and the environment, and the growing importance of CFD in multiphase flows, the executive co-organizers are hosting a dedicated conference on the topic of numerical methods in multiphase flows, to bring together the international community in a focused technical exchange environment. The executive organizers of ICNMMF believe that the pace of the maturity of the technology of multiphase flow numerics could and should be enhanced. What is needed is focused emphasis on the topic in the context of books, conference sessions, and dedicated conferences on the topic that can bring together the international community in a very focused technical exchange environment. It is this latter need that has motivated ICNMMF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The co-organizers of ICNMMF are a group well-known leaders in the field of multiphase flow modeling. In the context of the emphasis on ?new methods?, each of these individuals has contributed to the assembly of a proposed list of topics from which solicit conference contributions have been solicited. The list of topics for ICNMMF include: 1) Direct Numerical Simulation and Large Eddy Simulation, 2) Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics, 3) Eulerian Homogeneous and Two-fluid Models, 4) Direct Quadrature Methods, 5) Lagrangian Methods,  6) ALE Methods, 7) Interface Capturing Techniques, 8) Multiscale Methods, 9) Compressible Multiphase Flows, 10) High-Order Accuracy Flux Schemes, 11) General Advanced Algorithms, 12) Particle Methods, 13) Uncertainty Quantification, 14) Lattice Boltzmann and Molecular Dynamics Methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of ICNMMF are that: 1) all presentations that authors wish to include in a conference DVD will be distributed to participants electronically immediately after the conference, and to the general public through the conference website, which will remain ?live? until the next ICNMMF, 2) interactions between conference participants, with inputs from government sponsors, industrial practitioners and experimentalists, will focus research endeavors and research funding, and engender collaborations in new/modern sub-disciplines of multiphase flows analysis, 3) the executive organizers of ICNMMF intend this conference to be the first in a series (every two years we believe), and therefore this first meeting will set the stage for a much longer/broader benefit to the multiphase flow community specifically, and more generally, the energy, biomedical, defense, and environmental sciences that have come to depend on this science.</AbstractNarration>
