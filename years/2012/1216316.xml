<AbstractNarration>The University of Florida proposes to provide 51 teachers and over 3600 students with an interesting experience and opportunities for biotechnology learning. This project will create a computer-based game and supporting curriculum for promoting workforce development in the area of biotechnology; prepare teachers to implement the game and supporting curriculum through a summer professional development program; and determine how the game and supporting curriculum affects student disposition towards careers in biotechnology and understanding of biotechnology content. The project team (consisting of science educators, educational technologists, scientists, curriculum writers, and professional development providers) will collaborate with a professional game design company to design the computer game. The project will use a mixed-methods research design that makes use of case studies, pre/post test data, and comparison group to determine the efficacy of the game and supporting curriculum as a platform for improving student dispositions towards careers in biotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This goal was actualized through the pursuit of three aims:  Aim 1: Create a computer-based game and supporting curriculum for promoting workforce development in the area of biotechnology.

Aim 3: Research on career dispositions and science content              Research activities were framed primarily by three primary sets of research questions:  1)    How do teachers implement a game-based biotechnology curriculum unit? What are teachersÆ perceptions of a game-based biotechnology curriculum unit, including the game and the supporting curricular resources? What are teachersÆ perceptions of their classroom implementation of the game-based biotechnology curriculum unit?  2)    Can a game-based, biotechnology curriculum support student learning of biological principles? What are the effects of a game based curriculum on relative to varying academic levels?  3)    Does a game-based biotechnology intervention invoke changes in studentsÆ interest in science and careers in science? How is interest in science and careers in science related to student prior knowledge?  In order to pursue the questions grouped in the first set, we conducted five case studies of classroom implementation of MBt. These case studies involved extensive observations of teachers and students as they used the game and supporting curriculum. They also included document analyses and multiple teacher interviews. The case studies provide unique evidence related to how teachers adapt technology-based curriculum to meet their own goals, teaching styles, and demands of their own contexts. This research yielded five specific implications for design and implementation of game-based curriculum.  The second and third sets of research questions were explored through a quasi-experimentally designed study. For the research, we worked with 42 teachers and collected data from 2,221 students. Data consisted of pre- and post-intervention assessments of science content and interest in science and careers in science. Analyses related to student learning of s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
