<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 12-29566&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Lynch, Kevin M; Argall, Brenna; Colgate, J. Edward; Murphey, Todd D; Wu, Ying&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;Title:  MRI/Dev.: Bimanual Robotic Manipulation and Sensory Workspace &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, developing an instrument consisting of robot arms/arms and vision-related equipment, aims to advance research in dexterous dynamic robot manipulation. The major components of the system are a two-arm manipulation system consisting of two 7-DOF WAM arms and three-finger hands with tactile and force-torque sensors; a sensory workspace consisting of high-speed vision for object tracking and color-depth cameras for lower-speed color imaging and occupancy maps; and a user command and control workstation, all integrated using software running under the Robot Operating System (ROS). The instrument enables research in various areas, such as manipulation, haptics, learning-by-demonstration, gesture recognition, rehabilitation, prosthetics, and novel sensing modalities (e.g., active electrosense).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The area of human-robot interaction should gain much from this instrument. An active area of research, dual-arm manipulation is extremely relevant in the context of manufacturing, which constitutes an important and urgent national concern.  In terms of outreach and the involvement of under-represented groups, the team?s track record is evidenced by institutional programs, like summer research opportunities and partnerships to Girl Scout troops and local science museums. This project aims to place PhD students involved in the project as interns at Barrett Technologies, thus providing opportunities to closely collaborate with the robot arm/hand designer. Such collaboration transcends the traditional vendor-buyer relationship to possibly co-design and co-publish material and software components.</AbstractNarration>

The system integrates a high-speed Barrett Technologies WAM robot arm with seven joints, a wrist force-torque sensor, a four-fingered hand, tactile sensor fingertips, and a 10-camera 3D high-speed vision system to track objects moving in the workspace of the robot.  Because the robot is highly backdrivable (or "soft" to the user), the system is appropriate for use in robotic rehabilitation or exercising of subjects in human motor control studies.  Because the robot is capable of high speeds and is equipped with tactile sensors and high-speed vision, it is capable of advanced dexterity not available on other robot systems.  With this robot system we have already demonstrated dynamic "in-hand manipulation," where the robot hand can move an object within a grasp by accelerating the hand and causing relative slip.  This kind of advanced manipulation capability will be crucial to integrating robots in human workspaces, where humans use tools and manipulate objects using many strategies, not just the "pick and carry" approach that robots currently use.    In addition to its future benefits in robotic rehabilitation and robot manipulation research, the system provided research experience for three PhD students and four MS students and inspired many junior high and high school students visiting our lab to think about a career in robotics.
