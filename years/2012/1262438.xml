<AbstractNarration>The Atlanta Competitive Advantage Conference (ACAC) is focused on developing a better understanding of the sources of sustained competitive advantage in market economies.  The ACAC Research Development Workshop (RDW) improves the capabilities of emerging researchers working on questions in innovation, strategy, processes of new knowledge search, absorption and diffusion, and the measurement of the impact of innovation on firms and society.  Open to late-stage PhD students, the RDW focuses on improving research projects that these students are currently undertaking in their home institutions.  This is done by bringing together twenty-four PhD students with a range of scholarly foci and placing them with scholars from outside of their home institution and with whom they that would not otherwise work.     By including program modules that address building networks among innovation researchers, the RDW helps the PhD students integrate more broadly into a global community of innovation research scholars across institutions.  At the 9th ACAC RDW in 2012 twenty different US PhD programs, two Canadian PhD programs and four European PhD programs sent students to the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Within the US the impact of an improvement in our knowledge base with respect to the management and evaluation of innovation processes is significant.  This impact will be felt across a wide range of organizations.   In 2012 private, for-profit business in the US spent an estimated $280 billion on R&amp;D.  Government, academia and other non-profits combined for about another $130 billion.  These numbers are expected to increase in 2013.  With over $400 billion, being spent annually on innovation and new knowledge search in the US alone, any improvement in innovation outcomes through better managerial decision-making will have a significant, long-term impact on both economic competitiveness and on social welfare.  Managers need to better understand the "how" and "why" aspects of the relationship between the firm's internal innovation and knowledge management activates and the firm's sustained competitive advantage that outputs can give in open markets.   These same perspectives apply to not-for-profit and government organizations seeking innovation and change.  Improvements in understanding will come only from organization-level decisions based on solid science.  Thus, the better the science is behind the prescriptions given to managers for effective and efficient research and innovation processes, the greater the gains will be from those processes.  It is in that light that this RDW focuses on impacting the quality of that science in the emerging researchers in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this grant is to provide support for the 2013 &ndash; 2015 Research Development Workshop (RDW), which were held prior to the annual Atlanta Competitive Advantage Conference (ACAC). ACAC is jointly sponsored by Georgia State University and The Georgia Institute of Technology.  The mission of the main program of ACAC is to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of science-based scholarly research and theory development in the fields of industrial organization economics, organization theory, innovation and learning in organizations, entrepreneurship, and strategic management.  The RDW is held for late-stage PhD students doing research at the intersection of innovation, entrepreneurship, and competitive advantage.       The underlying assumption behind the processes used in the ACAC RDWs is that research in related academic fields would greatly benefit by the incorporation of the alternative theoretical and methodological approaches used across those fields.  In the academic environment, however, processes of research and publication often lead to the opposite outcome.  Researchers focus more tightly within their established perspectives.  This limits both the potential for insights in the research being conducted and the speed and breadth of any new knowledge dissemination when the research is published.     A change in the breach of research insights and the speed of new knowledge dissemination can have significant impact in related fields of study that focus on innovation, which is the focus of these workshops.  In turn, there should be significant and positive impacts on social welfare from these academic outcomes.  For example, in the year this grant request was developed, 2012, US private sector R&amp;D spending was projected by Battelle (2011) to be $279.6 billion. $155.9 billion of that was expected to be spent by governments, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations. In that light increasing our understanding of effective management processes in organizational innovation and entrepreneurial activities has the potential for dramatic impact on R&amp;D effectiveness in paractice.  While competitive advantage is the most-sought goal in private sector R&amp;D spending, comparable mission-oriented goals exist in government, academic and non-profit organizations.  All are served by improvements in process effectiveness.       These workshops sought to address the limited cross-area dialog among the academic disciplines that focus on innovation processes in organizations of all types and the implementation of innovations. Seventy-five late stage PhD students from across the US (67 students) and Europe (8 students) participated in these workshops.  All of these students were doing research in fields directly related to the management of innovation processes and the application of the outcomes of those processes.  All participants were surveyed annually following their participation in the workshops with respect to their research.  The surveys of the participants immediately following the workshops indicated that, for most of them, the theoretical perspectives and assistance they received for their research and the RDW was both highly beneficial and not available at their home institutions.  There was less impact from the exposure of alternative methodological perspectives.  Follow-up surveys of students showed that changes in their research projects based on the presentation of alternative theoretical perspectives at the RDW were sustained as the research proceeded toward publication.  The number of papers that were able to be followed over three years was limited.  The processes that these RDWs developed that enabled students to consider alternative theoretical perspectives in the context of their existing research were perceived as very effective in broadening the the scope of the research.  To the extent that these insights into alternative perspectives increase the richness of the rese...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
