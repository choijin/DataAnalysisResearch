<AbstractNarration>This action funds Matthew David Harmon of the University of Connecticut to conduct a research project, entitled "Developing a novel polymer design for human spine regeneration,", during the summer of 2012 at the University of Otago Chrsitchurch in Christchurch City, Canterbury, New Zealand.  The host scientist's name is Dr. Timothy Woodfield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal addresses the delicate balance of material mechanical performance and biological performance by the design of a polymer scaffold for human spine tissue engineering.  By combining a previously optimized polymer gel with a novel polymer rubber the research attempts to create an original scaffold design which meets both mechanical and biological cellular requirements.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The spinal discs are under constant stress and strain throughout life.  Through trauma, wear and tear, and natural processes of aging the spinal discs gradually lose height and mechanical stability.  Under the reported research project the PI and colleagues developed a novel biphasic scaffold design for intervertebral disc regeneration using the science of tissue engineering.  Tissue engineering uses synthetic biomaterials, chemicals and cells in order to regenerate functional human tissues and organs.  Under the NSF EAPSI program the PI was able to characterize the performance of a novel scaffold design created with a 3D printing technique.  Scaffolds have shown promising cellular compatibility and are being prepared for implantation into an animal model.   Currently, several projects are currently in design and/or completion involving the created scaffolds.  SEM images (not included, will be published) show scaffold cellular growth following placement of cartilage cells onto the scaffold surface.  Cells were seen to readily adhere to the scaffold surface and integrate with the scaffold material well.  These results suggest that the novel material and design may be conducive to successful regeneration of spinal disc tissue.  Future studies will focus on the identification of useful growth factor and small molecule signals to encourage healthy tissue growth following cell seeding onto scaffold materials.  Studies will also explore additional scaffold performance characterization such as histological staining of spinal disc specific proteins to suggest healthy tissue growth.   The current data suggest that the novel polymer biphasic scaffold design may become a promising candidate for soft and hard tissue regeneration, specifically spinal disc replacement.   The research project in collaboration with the University of Otago at Christchurch, and Canterbury University has allowed an invaluable international collaboration for the PI and colleagues filled with opportunity.  The PI has recommended the EAPSI program to a number of colleagues and will continue to support such programs due to a positive experience.  One peer-reviewed paper has been recently submitted and accepted concerning the design of the novel elastomer material that was being characterized during the EAPSI program.  A second paper describing the design and characterization of the biphasic scaffold is in the works.   Overall the current project has yielded promising results, most of which are yet to come as scaffold characterization moves on to more advanced techniques such as in vivo animal studies and genetic analysis of cell performance.
