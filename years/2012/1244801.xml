<AbstractNarration>Researchers at Carolina Coastal University are developing a new course and curricular materials that explicitly target scientific reasoning and metacognition within a conceptual physics context. The main goals of this project are: (1) to improve scientific reasoning, preparing non-STEM students to be effective citizen leaders and developing underprepared physics majors into reasonably competent science students ready for the rigors of an intense program of study; and (2) to change student's views about science and knowledge construction from a positivist-oriented view, where they regard science as an existing body of knowledge, to a more constructivist-oriented view, where acquisition of new knowledge is a creative endeavor requiring a variety of epistemological resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One novel and potentially transformative aspect of this project is the attention paid to issues surrounding student learning for two wildly disparate (at least by surface appearances) groups of students---the non-STEM major and the first-semester physics major. The investigators have shown significant insight in recognizing that these two groups have similar educational needs; lessons learned from both groups, and perhaps from interactions between the groups, will be of great interest to the larger physics and scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
