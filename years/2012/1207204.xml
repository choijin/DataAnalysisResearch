<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The project investigates a new class of ultrathin sheets that are self-assembled from metal nanoparticles, each particle being surrounded by a thin shell of short organic molecules that act as inter-particle spacers. As close-packed monolayers these sheets are the thinnest structures that can be fabricated from nanoparticle building blocks.  The sheets exhibit remarkable mechanical strength and robustness, including Young's moduli of several GigaPascal, and can be draped over openings hundreds to thousands of particles wide.  The resulting freestanding membranes provide special opportunities for investigating nanomechanical properties, making it possible to investigate large assemblies of nanoscale building blocks without interference from a substrate, while at the same time allowing for direct experimental access, via a range of probes such as electron or scanning probe microscopies, to the individual building blocks themselves. Combining systematic experiments with simulations of the elastic response, the project addresses questions that are of fundamental relevance also for systems with atoms as building blocks, such as how the overall mechanical response is affected by defects in the particle arrangement. Additional directions to be pursued include assessing the feasibility of using the sheets as mechanical resonators and sensors in the MHz range, and the possibility of folding the nanoparticle sheets into three-dimensional structures. The project will train one postdoc and one graduate student in vital nanoscience know-how.  A set of outreach activities includes the development and prototyping of hands-on activities with a major science museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Nanoparticle self-assembly offers special opportunities for the design of next-generation materials. This project investigates a new class of ultrathin sheets, assembled from metal nanoparticles.  As one-particle-thin layers, these sheets are the thinnest structures that can be fabricated with nanoparticles.  A special feature is that they combine extreme flexibility with unusual mechanical strength.  This combination makes it possible to design novel coatings as well as new types of self-assembled, nanomechanical resonators and sensors. The project provides a natural platform for integrating research with education and outreach. It will train one postdoc and one graduate student in vital nanoscience know-how, and introduce undergraduates to forefront science.  A special component is a set of outreach activities that include the development and prototyping of hands-on activities with a nearby major science museum.</AbstractNarration>

This project investigated the ultrathin limit of such materials, where the thickness is reduced to a single layer of nanoparticles. Such layers constitute a new class of extremely flexible membranes, for this project consisting specifically of metallic nanoparticle cores connected to their neighbors by short linker molecules. Since both the cores and the linkers can be tuned independently, this architecture offers unprecedented possibilities for tailoring the overall materials properties. The ultrathin membranes were found to exhibit a number of remarkable features, including the ability to stretch across holes or trenches hundreds to thousands of particle diameters wide. Understanding the mechanical properties of ultrathin nanoparticle-based films and membranes is critical for using these materials in applications such as deformable electronics or mechanical actuators. Through systematic experiments, the project addressed a fundamental scientific issue, namely to what extent the predictions of standard theory break down in the regime where the material thickness shrinks to a few nanometers.   The projectÆs findings provide important new insights concerning the stiffness and the ultimate strength of such membranes and the extent to which the membranes can be folded or bent into three-dimensional structures.  Outcomes from this project include new methods for fabricating nanoparticle membranes, as well as new methods for controllably bending and curling such membranes into cylindrical "nanoscrolls." A further outcome was the first statistical analysis of the fracture patterns that emerge when nanoparticle membranes are stretched. This analysis indicated a high tolerance to tensile deformation, an important aspect for potential applications. A key discovery was that the membranes, while obviously highly flexible due to their extreme thinness, nevertheless resist bending significantly more than expected based on standard theory.  This opens up new possibilities for creating lightweight structures with unusually high stiffness.  In addition, the project demonstrated how nanoparticle membranes can be used for controlling ion transport, a finding of potential significance in areas of wider societal impact, such as nanofiltration.   In terms of human resource development, the project trained graduate students and postdoctoral associates in cutting edge nano-science and -technology, preparing them for future roles as leaders in their scientific communities.
