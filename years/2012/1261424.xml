<AbstractNarration>The influx of reducing (i.e., anoxic) fluids through deep-sea and shallow-sea hydrothermal systems into the ocean plays a major role in determining ocean chemistry and its evolution over geologic history.  The interface between hydrothermal fluids and the overlying cool and well-oxygenated seawater is characterized by intense thermodynamic disequilibrium, driving a suite of biogeochemical reactions, which in turn further shape ocean chemistry. These reactions generate strong geochemical redox gradients transitioning from the marine water column into the sediments beneath along the interface with reducing hydrothermal fluids. These gradients provide a framework where microbial communities live, evolve, shape, and are shaped by their local geochemical environment.  However, the link between the metabolic activity of these micron-sized microorganisms and the resulting geochemical signatures (typically sampled at approximately cm-scale resolution) remains elusive, in large part because of the difficulty of extracting sufficient material for geochemical analyses at small scales (~1-100 microns). Yet, it is precisely this fine-scale geochemical variability that directly impacts biogeochemical activity.  This research takes advantage of recent advances in analytical techniques that allow for geochemical and stable isotopic measurements at a spatial resolution as small as ~1-10 microns.  Samples come from accessible shallow-sea hydrothermal systems in the Mediterranean Sea, where diverse sulfur cycling has been previously identified and steep redox gradients make it possible for micron-scale measurements to sample across a wide range of geochemical environments.  In addition, a 20+-year record of observations allows the results to be put into a rich geochemical context.  Goals are to generate an unparalleled high-resolution geochemical and isotopic characterization of sulfur cycling in shallow-sea hydrothermal systems and use the resulting data to calculate the thermodynamic drivers for diverse biogeochemical reactions.  The data will also allow the evaluation of the role of ambient geochemistry on isotopic fractionation during sulfur biogeochemical cycling and application of results to understanding variations in the isotopic composition of sulfur species in marine sediments through time because sulfur isotopes are one of the principle means to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions over Earth history.  Broader impacts of the work include undergraduate and graduate student training in the field and laboratory.  Cross training in different laboratories will also deepen the integration of research and education.  This project also involves international collaboration with Sicilian and German scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has been a journey of discovery regarding how microbial life and chemistry of minerals and surrounding seawater interact.  On a very basic level, we are seeking to understand how life processes affect, and are in turn affected by, their surroundings.   This is especially pertinent for how sulfur is transported and used by microbial life.  Microbes can utilize different forms of sulfur for a wide range of metabolisms, and couple sulfur reactions to many other element cycles including oxygen, carbon, iron, arsenic, and manganese.  The transformations of sulfur (biologically catalyzed by microbes and abiotically) are critical to understand at very small scales (down to changes across microns) because of the complexity of these possible interactions and the size of microbes themselves. The cycling of sulfur is critical element cycle in the world's oceans, potentially impacting all life and may be an key link as well to the atmosphere.  This fundamental scientific endeavor is also important for understanding exactly how microbial processes can control sulfur chemistry, applicable to the use and remediation of metal resources, the search for and clean use of coal, oil, and natural gas reserves, applications of bioengineered systems to produce sulfur compounds in industry and pharmaceutical applications, the search for life on other planets, and the development of greater understanding for how life on our planet has evolved.    Our work in shallow marine hydrothermal systems was a specific setting designed to look at how a very dynamic natural setting affects the ways life and chemistry come together.  The results from this have been astounding, and we have learned much about how changes in the flow of water and gases in the subsurface affect the fundamental reactions that can be linked to microbial life.  Specifically, more advectively-controlled systems, where the flux of material is very high, has seen less evidence of microbial life affecting chemical signatures. However, the other end of the spectrum also does not support significant chemical signatures of life.  We have learned that there is a balance between the transport of chemicals used by microbes and their ability to affect that chemistry.  This is allowing us to rewrite the ways we have previously considered the energetics of microbial systems to operate, and develop new thinking on how natural systems may maximize the efficiency of microbial communities to affect their chemical surroundings.  As a broader impact this is beyond our expectation at the start of this grant, and represents a potentially highly impactful framework to consider microbial cmmunities and their chemical surroundings affecting a wide range of disciplinary thinking and possibe application.  Several graduate students have been key towards these discoveries and new ideas, and are currently involved in writing the papers to get his idea further disseminated to the public.
