<AbstractNarration>Students in STEM fields need exposure to research and project experience tying together the elements of STEM - fundamentally based in science and math, using technology tools to achieve engineering solutions - in a context demonstrating societal impact.  The growing area of biomedical engineering provides an appropriate and effective framework in which to implement a high-impact undergraduate research program addressing this need.  Leveraging an existing research strength in the area of biomedical device technologies, a three-year REU program (summer site) supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers will focus on providing an intensive research experience in biomedical devices for undergraduate students.  With a focus on biomedical devices, the project topics include robotics, medical tool design, implanted devices, imaging, tissue engineering, and so forth.  This proposed research is classified as an institutional priority area and is seen as a growth area for scientific and technological discovery.  The objectives are to: 1) provide interdisciplinary research experiences to undergraduate students in the area of biomedical devices, with 50% of the program participants being underrepresented minorities and/or students from institutions with limited research programs; 2) foster participants' skills in becoming independent researchers; 3) provide participants with a broader view of research and development activities in academia and industry; and 4) expand participants' skills and knowledge in entrepreneurship and other areas of professional development.  Some of the anticipated outcomes are: 1) stimulate career interest in biomedical engineering and related STEM fields; 2) improve participants' understanding of the role of research and development in the commercial sector and its relation to national interests; and 3) stimulate interest in commercialization of ideas and technology.  Research results and educational outcomes will be published with students as lead or co-authors.  This balanced and diverse summer experience will influence the upcoming generation of scientists and engineers to make substantial contributions in their future careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to provide undergraduate students with impactful summer research experiences focused on medical devices.  In addition to this primary goal, the project targeted recruitment of underrepresented participants; sought to provide experience and insights in academic/industry research and development, entrepreneurship and other aspects of professional development; and sought to help students become independent researchers.  Over a period of four summers, a total of 31 students were hosted in faculty research laboratories at the University of Nebraska.  Of these, 19 were women, 6 were from underrepresented groups, and 9 were from colleges/universities with limited research opportunities.  They received mentoring from faculty and graduate students and presented their research at an annual end-of-summer research symposium.  Their research also resulted in 16 published articles in journals and conferences.  Various professional development opportunities were provided to the student participants, including ethics training, graduate school preparation, industry tours, entrepreneurship seminars, and coaching on technical communication.  Surveys and focus groups allowed tracking of the project goals over the course of the project in order to help make appropriate course adjustments to improve the students' experiences.  These assessments indicated that the vast majority of student participants increased in their technical knowledge and communication skills, preparation for graduate school, and ability to function as an independent researcher, in addition to increasing in confidence, interest in entrepreneurship and commercialization, interest in interdisciplinary topics, and other general professional skills.  From this it is surmised that all the major goals of the project have been achieved.       Last Modified: 07/27/2017       Submitted by: Carl A Nelson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
