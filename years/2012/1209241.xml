<AbstractNarration>This action funds Alan Michael Twomey of the University of Minnesota to conduct a research project, entitled "Quantifying small-scale distribution of proteins in frozen solutions using chemical imaging techniques," during the summer of 2012 at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan.  The host scientists are Dr. Hiroshi Takamastu and Dr. Kosaku Kurata&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to quantify the effect of cooling rate and thermal history on the distribution of proteins in the ice interface in solutions composed of cryoprotective agents and buffers.  Using confocal Raman spectroscopy scans of solutions frozen along a temperature gradient, the distribution of the proteins are being measured, as well as changes in their conformation.  The specific goal of the research project is to develop a methodology to control the interactions of a protein in a solution with a propagating ice interface in a manner that minimizes damage to the protein structure. Minimizing structural damage to proteins has significant implications for many applications, including the pharmaceutical industry where therapeutic proteins are frequently stabilized and stored at length in the frozen state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

During freezing in water-based solutions, complex interactions occur between the growing ice phase and the remaining liquid solution, which becomes increasingly concentrated as the solutes (proteins, buffers, and chemicals called cryoprotectants that are meant to protect the proteins during freezing) are rejected from the ice phase.  The research this summer at Kyushu University focused on the freezing of model macromolecule and cryoprotectant solutions under both equilibrium (slow) and non-equilibrium (fast) freezing conditions. Existing data in the literature suggest that protein accumulates at the ice interface during freezing. This is of interest, because interactions with ice during freezing can cause structural damage to proteins, diminishing product yield and efficacy in the pharmaceutical industry.  The initial aim was to study interactions between proteins and ice during slow freezing using the chemical imaging technique confocal Raman microscopy (CRM).
