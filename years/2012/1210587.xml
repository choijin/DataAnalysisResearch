<AbstractNarration>This project integrates paleontology and evolutionary biology to investigate the evolution of sexual systems. The existence of so many methods of reproduction in the natural world remains difficult to explain. Contemporary theories assume that sexual reproduction should allow long term survival as the dispersal and recombination of genetic material provides a population of organisms with the ability to adapt to environmental change. Small freshwater crustaceans, or ?clam shrimp,? are ideal for the study of sexual system evolution as the group contains species that comprise males and females, species where females no longer exist and have been completely replaced by self-fertilizing hermaphrodites (with the ability to fertilize their own eggs) coexisting with males, and species with only self-fertilizing hermaphrodites. Using the otherwise inconspicuous ?clam shrimp? as a study group, it is possible to identify sex via carapace (shell) shape analysis techniques in both living and fossil populations. Once sexes are identified, we can deduce sexual system via sex ratio of the population.  &lt;br/&gt;This study aims to collect fossil data from worldwide repositories in order to provide, for the first time, empirical evidence to test established theories about the origination, duration and extinction of sexual systems over geologic timescales. We can then address the commonly held belief that unisexual systems represent an evolutionary ?dead end.? The results of this study will also provide a foundation for future research utilizing the fossil record to perform transformative studies into the evolution of mating systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Intellectual Merit  One of the most frustrating aspects of studying the evolution of reproductive systems is that we have, to date, been unable to utilize information locked within the fossil record to assess reproductive system evolution in deep time. The focus of this research was to empirically test the following assumptions that have been an integral part of biological cannon for the past century: 1) lineages that primarily reproduce unisexually (i.e., with only one parent) will tend to go extinct more often and speciate less often than lineages that reproduce sexually, and (2) that transitional sexual systems (in this case androdioecy: males + self-fertilizing hermaphrodites) between complete hermaphroditism and obligate sexual outcrossing should be highly unstable and should not persist over long periods of time.  In this funded study we used the Spinicaudatan æclam shrimpÆ as a model group to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of sexual systems over geologic time. This group of primitive branchiopod crustaceans is geographically widespread with a particularly good freshwater fossil record extending back 400Ma, to the Devonian period. Modern day clam shrimp are reproductively diverse, exhibiting dioecious (males + females),  hermaphroditic and androdioecious populations. The diversity and distribution of these reproductive systems raise interesting questions about the validity of long standing theories of reproductive system evolution.  In this project, we developed a mathematical methodology that allows us to detect subtle shape differences exhibited between the sexes in the shells of these clam shrimp.

As we finalize our data analyses, we can more clearly address both of these predictions, and are developing research papers that will present our findings.  Broader Impacts  Severalof the broader impacts outlined in the proposal for this project have been realized, the first being that we have now accumulated over 10,000 images representing 100+ species of fossil Spinicaudata from major repositories in Russia, China, UK, USA, Australia  and Argentina. We will make these data freely accessible as part of a global database on ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
