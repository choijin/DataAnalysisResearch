<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a program called the Multicultural Initiative in Marine Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP) for academic years 2013-2014. The program has operated at Western Washington University's Shannon Point Marine Center (SPMC) since 1991. MIMSUP PI's will recruit eight students annually from around the nation and will seek to identify students who would benefit most from the high level of mentoring provided. The intellectual merit of the proposal lies in the design of an effort that encourages students to pursue higher degrees in ocean sciences. Students will spend two quarters in residence taking a total of 31 quarter-credits that may be transferred back to their home institutions. During the first quarter, students take a laboratory/field course in Oceanography, a Current Trends in Marine Science course that introduces them to modern investigative techniques and the potential professional opportunities that will be available to them, and a research course in which they plan and execute an independent project under the supervision of a faculty member. They all participate in a program that involves training in and application of outreach education in marine science to K-12 school children. During the second quarter, students will take a Scientific Communication course and two additional courses covering various marine science topics. Broader Impacts: Results from prior funding indicate that this program is highly successful in efforts to encourage students to pursue advanced degrees in science. Of the 155 participants who have completed their undergraduate degrees, 15% have pursued the doctorate; 44%, the Master's degree. Overall, 68% have pursued advanced education. Alumni contributions to the sciences include over 381 presentations at science conferences (49 best student paper awards) and co-authorship on over 112 publications in the refereed scientific literature. The impact of these alumni as role models for their peers will multiply the effects of the program. Training and mentoring approaches will continue to be shared nationally, and alumni will continue to participate in other ocean science programs. MIMSUP students are trained in and participate in K-12 marine science lessons in the local school system and in providing ocean science outreach activities at local festivals serving a general audience.</AbstractNarration>

The program recruited 8 students annually from 1990 to 2015 (seven in 1991) from undergraduate institutions around the nation. The recruitment effort resulted in a good diversity of under?represented minority students. 51% of the participants were Latino/Hispanic, 24% were African American, 14% were Pacific Islanders, and 11% were Native Americans or Native Alaskans. The average university GPA of entering program participants was 3.1, and 43% of MIMSUP participants were 1st&nbsp;generation college students. Each group of students spent the Winter and Spring Quarters at Shannon Point Marine Center (SPMC) taking marine science courses (offered primarily through the Department of Environmental Sciences); receiving training in laboratory and field investigative techniques, oral and written scientific communication; carrying out independent research and presenting poster and oral reports at national/international science conferences; and exploring career opportunities via site visits.

A total of 199 students participated in MIMSUP, with 198 of those subsequently completing or currently pursuing baccalaureate degrees. Of the 174 participants who had completed undergraduate degrees to date, thirty (17%) have pursued the doctorate. Seventeen have completed the doctorate and are now working in academia, government agencies, consulting companies, and post-doctoral research positions. Eighteen alumni (10%) have completed or are pursuing professional degrees. Sixty have completed the Master&rsquo;s degree (including the 18 who continued to PhD or professional degrees), with an additional 11 currently in Master&rsquo;s programs (30%). Thus, 57% of MIMSUP alumni have gone on to advanced degree programs.</p> <p class="CM3">MIMSUP participants have earned a remarkable number of awards during and subsequent to their MIMSUP experience. For example, our 199 program alumni have been awarded at least 234 positions in internship programs (including 73 NSF REU positions). They have earned 49 scholarships, 102 fellowships (including 5 NSF GRF awards), 27 research grants, and 39 academic awards. Our alumni have been elected to positions on the governing boards of 4 major societies: Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO), The Oceanography Society (TOS), the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and the Society for Advancement of Hispanics/Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).</p> <p class="CM3">Our alumni are also making significant contributions to the sciences.
