<AbstractNarration>The proposed research seeks to provide a comprehensive framework for how to collect and assess degradation data over the product lifecycle from design to usage phases. The proposed framework will enhance both data-driven modeling and physics-based modeling techniques outlined in previous prognostic research. By using the coupled model scheme, the requirements for data quality and complete product design information can be reduced. The scheme can be validated on a critical rotary machinery component, such as a bearing, as well as for more complex components and structures, such an electrical vehicle battery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work on developing a combined data driven and physics driven model for fault prognostication has the potential to yield significant cost reduction in manufacturing systems and processes. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the centers portfolio. The center has actively involved minority and female students in its research through Research Experiences for Teachers and Undergraduates (RET and REU) projects and will continue to do so through the proposed effort.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The research efforts have focused on developing new modeling methodology and algorithms to discover new knowledge that includes the physics-based, systematic sensor selection process and virtual sensors that ensure the correct and accurate prognostics of the systemÃ†s health.
