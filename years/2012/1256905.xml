<AbstractNarration>The bacterium Wolbachia is known to infect a large number of the world's insect species (among other terrestrial invertebrates), with important effects on the biology of its animal hosts. In many insects, Wolbachia causes a kind of bacteria-induced reproductive failure called "cytoplasmic incompatibility" (CI), a phenomenon that favors the survival of Wolbachia-infected insects by a mechanism that, despite intense study, is still poorly understood. Having made a recent, surprising discovery of CI in a second bacterium, Cardinium, that is  unrelated to Wolbachia, the investigators in this study will probe the CI mechanisms of Cardinium in parasitic wasps. This project represents the first study of CI mechanisms in a bacterium other than Wolbachia; through the tractability of this experimental system and the comparative insights it can provide, this investigation will ultimately enhance understanding of  CI in Wolbachia as well as Cardinium.  To address these questions, the investigators will analyze the expression of genes in male and female Cardinium-infected wasps. They will also conduct a microscopic analysis of the mortality of embryos due to CI-causing Cardinium. The insights into CI will contribute to the effective manipulation of CI-causing bacterial symbionts for management of important insect pests and disease vectors. The project will also contribute to middle school science education and training with a curriculum supplement on insects and microbe interactions. Lastly, the project will result in research training (including international training) of a graduate student, two undergraduates, as well as training of two graduate students in K-12 science outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In the project entitled &ldquo;Genetic and cytogenetic bases of <em>Cardinium-</em>caused cytoplasmic incompatibility in arthropods,&rdquo; we studied a bacterium that lives inside minute parasitic wasps (1 mm long) (Fig. 1) and changes their biology. The bacterium, <em>Cardinium hertigii</em> (Fig.1), lives throughout the body of the wasps but is faithfully inherited by the wasp offspring via the cell contents of the egg. The bacterium is capable of manipulating the reproduction of the wasp in a way that increases its transmission to future generations.&nbsp; When males that have the bacterium (or bacterial symbiont) mate with females that do not, few or no offspring are produced.&nbsp; This phenomenon is called &ldquo;cytoplasmic incompatibility&rdquo; or &ldquo;CI&rdquo; and one can think of it as a sort of sabotage, by which sperm from symbiont-infected males can only fertilize eggs from symbiont-infected females. By reducing the number of offspring that wasps without the symbiont can produce, more and more of the wasps of the next generation are individuals that have the symbiont. This kind of manipulation of the biology of an animal by a bacterium is interesting for a few reasons &ndash; one is that by looking at what the bacterium is doing to sabotage reproduction, we can better understand how some basic cell processes work in animals. Another is that these &ldquo;CI&rdquo; bacteria drive themselves to high frequency in host populations because of the relatively higher fitness of host females that have the symbiont.&nbsp; This is interesting because of a serendipitous discovery (by other researchers) that another CI bacterium, Wolbachia, can cause human virus resistance in mosquitoes that carry it.&nbsp; For this reason there is a lot of recent interest in using CI Wolbachia to make mosquitoes resistant to human viruses vectored by mosquitoes.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t yet know whether Cardinium could be inserted into mosquitoes or if it would also cause resistance to human viruses once there, but what we learn about how Cardinium-caused CI works will help us understand this phenomenon more generally as well as understand its potential applications.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Intellectual merit</p> <p>Our work investigated the mechanism of Cardinium caused CI.&nbsp; We used microscopy to investigate what happened in the early embryo development in a CI cross, that is when a Cardinium infected male mates with an uninfected female.&nbsp; We found that the first mitotic division of the egg was defective, and that instead of a clean division of the two nuclei, a &ldquo;chromatin bridge&rdquo; (that is a tie of DNA and its associated proteins) bound the two nuclei together (Fig. 2).&nbsp; This is interesting and curious because it is exactly what has been seen by CI caused by the other bacterial lineage Wolbachia, yet we knew that the genes in Cardinium and the genes in Wolbachia are almost entirely different.&nbsp; In other work, we looked at the gene transcripts of Cardinium.&nbsp; This showed us that most of the genes we found in the Cardinium genome are transcribed, and are likely to be available to make proteins.&nbsp; We also sequenced and analyzed more Cardinium genomes (Fig. 3), including a second Cardinium genome that causes CI, and this showed us what genes are likely candidates to cause CI.&nbsp; In future work we will focus on a handful of likely candidates, about 10 genes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Broader impacts</p> <p>The project provided training at undergraduate and graduate levels.&nbsp; Over the course of the project, we employed 14 undergraduates, including eight women and eight individuals from underrepresented groups or who were first generation college students.&nbsp; These undergraduates maintained insect cultures, assisted with experiments and many completed independent research projects.&nbsp; After graduation, several went on to higher degree programs or positions using their science training.&nbsp; &nbsp;The project also supported several outreach activities.&nbsp; For each of the five years of the project, all laboratory personnel were involved in a booth &ldquo;Life in Miniature&rdquo; for the Arizona Insect Festival, a day of hands on activities for the community in Tucson, Arizona (Fig 4).&nbsp; Lastly, the project personnel also participated in and project funds supported an inquiry-based science education program for local elementary schools, Insect Discovery, a program that reaches thousands of children annually.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Martha&nbsp;S&nbsp;Hunter</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1256905/1256905_10258461_1538520005430_Cardinium_wasp_forNSFoutcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1256905/1256905_10258461_1538520005430_Cardinium_wasp_forNSFoutcomes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Minute Encarsia wasp and Cardinium"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1256905/1256905_10258461_1538520005430_Cardinium_wasp_forNSFoutcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Minute Encarsia wasp and Cardinium"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fig. 1 Some Encarsia parasitic wasps carry a bacterium Cardinium that changes their reproduction.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mike Rose and Jean Wilson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Martha&nbsp;S&nbsp;Hunter</div> <div class="imageTitle">Minute Encarsia wasp and Cardinium</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1256905/1256905_10258461_1538520286139_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1256905/1256905_10258461_1538520286139_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="An embryo influenced by Cardinium-caused cytoplasmic incompatibility"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1256905/1256905_10258461_1538520286139_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="An embryo influenced by Cardinium-caused cytoplasmic incompatibility"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fig. 2.
