<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The reorientation of defects can affect technologically important macroscopic properties of solids like hysteresis losses in electric steels. This project will investigate the magnetostriction caused by the reorientation of the magnetization of coherent nano-precipitates of lower symmetry than the host. Iron-cobalt alloys will serve as the model system for the investigation as preliminary microscopic and macroscopic evidence exists in Fe40Co60, which demonstrates that its large magnetostriction, lambda100=200ppm, is due to this mechanism. The insight gained will be used to develop new alloys with enhanced magnetostriction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes to investigate the magnetostriction of two phase functional materials, predominantly metallic alloys. Materials displaying low anisotropy and large magnetostriction will be emphasized as they are very suitable for technological applications such as sensors or transducers. Additionally, through this collaborative research, graduate and undergraduate minorities will be trained in materials synthesis and state-of-the-art characterization techniques. The proposed research will increase the competitiveness of minority students in the Science and Engineering disciplines and expand the pool of talented African-American scientists and engineers, who will enlarge the high-technology minority workforce. The planned outreach to Maryland high schools will ensure that the proposed research connects to the potentially interested segment of the high school population.</AbstractNarration>

We discovered that the magnetostriction in iron-palladium alloys is intimately related to a phase transformation; the changes, which develop in the alloy occurring as it 'prepares itself' for the transition into another phase (crystal structure), cause the large magnetostriction.  We also discovered a ultra-low fatigue shape memory alloy - a certain nickel-titanium alloy (these alloys play an important role in medical devices like stents) which retains its memory more than 10 million times. This is important as the human heart beats about this number of times during a lifetime and hence one can now think of preparing artificial heart valves from this biologically compatible material.  Throughout the project we collaborated closely with Morgan State University. The exchange of students between our laboratories provided mutual insights and opportunities and we plan on expanding those in the future.
