<AbstractNarration>Researchers at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) mentor eight undergraduate Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) students each year in the Fall semester while they conduct independent research projects. Students conduct independent research projects based on a wide variety of marine and open-ocean science topics ranging from the molecular to macro scale processes. Many of the student research projects fall within the framework of the numerous long-term, climate-related programs conducted at BIOS, including Hydrostation "S", the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS), the Marine Microbial Observatory, and the Ocean Carbon and Climate Change Program. Students often have the opportunity to join BIOS scientists aboard the R/V Atlantic Explorer. Other student research opportunities focus on near-shore processes such as water and air pollution, coral reef ecology, marine biodiversity, molecular biology, and climate and catastrophe models, such as those used to predict hurricanes and/or intense rainfall events and flooding. Many projects provide the chance for students to engage in SCUBA and small boat activities as part of their training. BIOS has an active teaching program that insures a diverse student population, and REU students thus have opportunities to interact with marine science students from developing countries as part of the BIOS Centre of Excellence in Observational Oceanography and also with many visiting students from the USA and UK. REU students present a final seminar of their work to BIOS staff and visitors, and write manuscripts in the format of a journal appropriate for publication of the specific research project conducted. Funding provides for student travel to the site, dormatory housing and meals, a student stipend, and some student research support.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Sixteen students participated in the BIOS REU Program funded by NSF REU-OCE Award 1262880. All sixteen REU students successfully completed twelve weeks of intensive research and participated in workshops, seminars, and group field trips. All students submitted a research report and gave a final oral presentation on their REU research at BIOS. During the award period, the BIOS REU Program was successful in attracting applicants from underrepresented groups with minorities making up from 33% to 40% of the complete applications annually and from 25% to 50% of the partipants in the programs each year. The BIOS REU Program was also successful in encouraging students to publish their REU research through peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, websites and theses. Students supported by this award produced two peer-reviewed publications in PloS ONE, seven poster presentations and four oral presentations at conferences, one scientific website, two research blogs and two senior theses. In addition, the BIOS REU Program was successful in influencing students to continue their careers in oceanography and marine science. Of the sixteen students supported by this award, five have continued onto graduate school, one is still in undergraduate education, one has just graduated while nine are working in the scientific and technology fields.</p> <p>BIOS is a multi-disciplinary institution and as a result students were exposed to a diverse range of research activities. As a result, REU students experience the collaborative nature of research and were able to gain experience in multiple areas of science.&nbsp; This valuable experience will assist the students in &nbsp;their subsequent career decisions.&nbsp; REU students at BIOS were encouraged to take full responsibilty for their projects and, largely, were in charge of the day-to-day management of their projects, allowing them to learn valuable skills in maintaining a project, meeting deadlines, trouble shooting, and planning. Projects within this award covered the disciplines of oceanography and marine science. The 2013 and 2014 REU student projects encompassed a variety of fields within the disciplines of oceanography and marine science. There were six marine science projects that were ecologically based, including fish population demographics, coral reef ecology and coral reef microbiology. Two marine science projects focused on molecular and cell biology; the students examined tissue regeneration in echinoderms, and specifically sea urchins, using quantitative PCR to determine the regulation of specific genes involved in regeneration. There were five oceanography projects that included physical, microbial and chemical oceanography, as well as atmospheric chemistry. There were three environmental impact projects including chemistry, toxicology and microbiology. The BIOS REU Program also included workshops that focused on both training (experimental design, scientific record keeping, data analysis, preparation of poster and oral presentations, and writing a scientific paper) and professional development (academic conduct, CV improvement, graduate school applications, careers in science and social/ professional media). REU students were able to participate in a research cruise aboard BIOS&rsquo;s research vessel <em>Atlantic Explorer</em> and were encouraged to attend lectures by visiting students and scientists as part of the BIOS seminar series and TEDx Bermuda.</p> <p>Exit evaluations and interviews were used to assess the BIOS REU Program. All students felt they were a good fit for the project they had selected, given their prior experience and knowledge. All students felt that their mentors gave them the help required for a successful research project and indicated that they would encourage friends to participate in the BIOS REU Program. The field trips and activities were well received. Students felt that the BIOS REU Program allowed them to gain hands-on experience in conducting real-world science. On completing their REU experience, students were more enthusiastic about continuing on to graduate school and felt that the REU internship gave them a more realistic view of the requirements of graduate school.</p> <p>In 2014, BIOS received a supplemental award in accordance with the NSF program solicitation NSF 13-542. This award was funded a second internship for one of the 2014 REU students. In January 2015, a panel of judges chose Chloe Emerson as the REU supplemental award recipient. Ms. Emerson continued her work on regeneration in sea urchins, withe a specific focus on environmental stressors, including ocean acidification, and their impact on biomineralisation and soft tissue regeneration. &nbsp;Ms. Emerson has been very productive and her 2014 REU project included in a publication to PLoS One and in a poster at the Comparative Biology of Tissue Repair, Regeneration, and Aging Meeting in June 2015. In addition, she presented her summer 2015 REU project as both oral and poster presentations at the Molecular and Cellular Basis of Growth and Regeneration Keystone Symposium. Ms. Emerson and her mentors are currently preparing &nbsp;their findings for publication.</p> <p>NSF REU-OCE Award 1262880 has been sucessful in increasing minority applications and minority student participation.
