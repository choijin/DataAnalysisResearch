<AbstractNarration>Epulopiscium spp. are among the largest known bacteria with some cigar-shaped cells reaching lengths in excess of 0.6 mm.  Epulopiscium spp. and their relatives are intestinal symbionts associated specifically with certain species of tropical reef fish in the surgeonfish family. They are a conspicuous and usual component of the community of microorganisms that inhabit the fish and they contribute to the digestion of polysaccharides consumed by their fish host.  The Angert Lab has been using Epulopiscium sp. type B as a model for studies of cell, developmental and evolutionary biology.  This organism has been key in providing a better understanding of how a simple bacterial cell can make small changes in its cellular structure and organization to allow it to reach its tremendous size.  The current project seeks to improve this experimental system further by completing the genome sequence of Epulopiscium sp. type B.  These efforts will yield an important resource for studying the genetic potential of these exceptional bacteria in the context of cell and developmental biology.  Gene expression in actively growing populations of Epulopiscium sp. type B will be characterized to identify genes that are essential for supporting cell growth and metabolism. This profile will provide the basis for improving methods to grow these bacteria in laboratory culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  This project provides significant educational and training opportunities for postdoctoral and undergraduate research assistants.  All trainees will gain experience in molecular biology, microbiology, DNA sequence analysis, and the application of basic bioinformatics tools.  Through research presentations, manuscript and proposal preparation, trainees will develop their communication skills.  Depending on the project, an individual will gain more extensive experience in bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, and genomics.  Such research experiences are essential for the development of a young scientist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Epulopiscium spp. are giants in the microbial world.  In terms of cell volume, an individual Epulopiscium cell can be a million times larger than the bacterium Escherichia coli.  Epulopiscium sp. type B inhabit the intestinal tract of the tropical marine surgeonfish Naso tonganus.  Despite their exceptional size, Epulopiscium sp. type B cells are not pathogens and probably help the fish digest the algae that they eat.  Unlike most other bacteria, Epulopiscium cells reproduce by forming multiple offspring internally.  Through this project, the Angert lab has generated a high quality draft of the genome of Epulopiscium sp. type B which has revealed the complete genetic potential of these organisms.  The analysis of the genome confirms the role of Epulopiscium as an intestinal symbiont.  Epulopiscium cells carry a diverse array of genes that code for polysaccharide degrading enzymes consistent with the types of structural and storage polysaccharides found in the brown algae Naso tonganus consumes.  The genome also contains genes for the transport and metabolism of sugars and sugar alcohols that are abundant in brown algae.  The metabolism of Epulopiscium sp. type B is based on sugar fermentation and the products formed by these and other predicted reactions (such as the synthesis of a number of B vitamins) could also benefit the host fish.  The genome sequence confirms the phylogenetic position of Epulopiscium within the Lachnospiraceae, a family of bacteria in the Firmicutes phylum that are intestinal symbionts of diverse animals including humans.  The content of the genome supports the hypothesis that internal offspring formation is a modified form of endospore formation.  The genome is a valuable resource that will support future studies.  With metabolic reconstructions, better media will be developed to support the growth of these bacteria outside their host.  The genome will serve as a base for comparative studies with other Lachnospiraceae to identify traits common to these symbiotic bacteria and also unique traits that may be important for the diverse forms of reproduction observed in these bacteria.   The project provided significant training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral trainees.  All gained experience in molecular biology, DNA sequencing methods, microbiology and bioinformatics tools.  Through research presentations, trainees developed their communication skills.  Depending on the project, individuals developed more extensive expertise in bioinformatics and evolutionary biology.  Such research experiences are essential for the development of a young scientist.            Last Modified: 06/22/2016       Submitted by: Esther R Angert]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
