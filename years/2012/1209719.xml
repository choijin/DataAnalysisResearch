<AbstractNarration>This action funds Meredith Claire Edwards of the University of Georgia to conduct a research project, entitled "Understanding biofuel production by heat-loving bacteria from pectin-rich food wastes," during the summer of 2012 at Nanjing Normal University in Nanjing in Jangsu province of China.  The host scientist is Dr. Weilan Shao.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to investigate the possibility of using thermophilic bacteria that can produce fuel ethanol from biomass to produce ethanol from pectin-rich food wastes, e.g., sugar beet pulp from sugar production and citrus waste from citrus juice production.  The longterm goal is to increase the options for production of ethanol biofuels while disposing of large volumes of waste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated how anaerobic thermophilic (heat-loving) bacteria use pectin-rich materials to produce ethanol for transportation fuel.  Thermophilic bacteria are promising biofuel producers because they grow well at the high temperatures that often occur during industrial scale fermentations.  Pectin-rich materials are good feed stocks for ethanol production because they are an abundantly underused biomass.  Pectin-rich materials include food processing wastes like sugar beet pulp and citrus waste, which are left over from the production of sugar and juice, respectively.  These wastes are primarily used to supplement animal feed or put into landfills.  The goal was to understand how thermophilic bacteria can degrade pectin and ferment the degradation products into ethanol.  Four strains of thermophilic bacteria were studied: Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus JW200, Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, Thermoanaerobacterium thermosulfurigenes, and Thermotoga maritima.  The ability of T. ethanolicus JW200, T. tengcongensis, and T. thermosulfurigenes to grow on pectin was assessed by culturing the organisms in hungate tubes with galacturonic acid, polygalacturonic acid, glucose or no additional carbon source.  Galacturonic acid is an acidic 6-carbon sugar and the primary component of pectin.  Polygalacturonic acid is a simplified form of pectin i.e. a chain of galacturonic acids.  The growth of these organisms on these pectin representatives was compared to their growth on glucose.   T. ethanolicus JW200 grew over six times better when glucose was provided as the carbon source than when either galacturonic acid or polygalacturonic acid were provided.  Furthermore, growth on galacturonic acid or polygalacturonic acid was only slightly higher than T. ethanolicus JW200Æs growth when no additional carbon source was present.  This suggests that most of the growth of T. ethanolicus JW200 on galacturonic acid or polygalacturonic acid was due to the use of carbons found in the yeast extract in the growth media.  A dinitrosalicylic acid assay was performed to measure the concentration of glucose or galacturonic acid present throughout the fermentation.  The assay showed that glucose levels decreased as the organism grew, but galacturonic acid levels did not.  This further supports that T. ethanolicus JW200 was not using these pectin representatives as a carbon source.  T. tengcongensis would not grow on any of the carbon sources, including glucose.  This strain had not been used in the lab for a few years; it is possible that the strain was no longer viable.  T. thermosulfurigenes was able to grown on glucose, galacturonic acid and polygalacturonic acid.  T. thermosulfurigenes was originally isolated by culturing it on pectin and is known to have a polygalacturonate hydrolase and a pectin methylesterase, both enzymes involved in the degradation of pectin.   Ethanol is not the only product that T. thermosulfurigenes makes from sugars; it also makes acetate, lactate, H2, and CO2.   To increase the ethanol production of T. thermosulfurigenes the organism was transformed with a plasmid carrying the gene for alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE).  AdhE is the protein that produces ethanol from acetaldehyde.  Adding an extra adhE gene has been shown to increase ethanol production in other thermophilic bacteria.  However, when ethanol production was compared between strains with and without adhE added on a plasmid no increase in ethanol production was observed.  Why this occurred is unclear at this time.  More research needs to be conducted to confirm these results.  T. thermosulfurigenes will only be a useful option for ethanol production if it can be engineered to produce large quantities of ethanol and fewer competing products.
