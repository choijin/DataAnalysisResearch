<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to advance significantly Artificial Intelligence by developing the first ever, brain-like Super-Turing system. &lt;br/&gt;The approach is to build a computational system that is much more powerful (Super) than digital computation.  Alan Turing, a WWII code breaker, developed a conceptual (Turing) machine that has been basic to the digital computation revolution of the last 70 years.  This project will develop a Super-Turing mathematical model and implement it on an Optical Analog Neural Network Computer.  The project will focus on understanding system abilities and differences between Super-Turing and Turing systems.  Natural and artificial time-series will be compared to those of Super-Turing models and modeled Super-Turing processes will be compared with those of the brain. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;Super-Turing Computation is a novel, transformative technology that will rewrite computational limits and lay a new foundation for Artificial Intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Increasing the capabilities of machine intelligence will profoundly influence society; Intelligent Super-Turing systems are expected to be capable of improving quality of life, e.g. providing intelligent robotic assistants, improving individualized education, creating new industries and medical technologies producing great economic benefit.  Further, a deepened understanding of Super-Turing computation as it relates to living systems is likely to bring new insights into brain function - fundamentally impacting neuroscience and brain-related medical technologies. Graduate and undergraduates will be trained in the interdisciplinary areas of advanced mathematics, physics, and computer science.</AbstractNarration>

It is the mathematical basis of Digital Computers, and was a major enabling factor for the Digital Economy that we have today.  It has been shown that many types of computing are equivalent to the Turing Model. The TM is so successful, it led many in the field to adopt the so-called Physical Church&ndash;Turing thesis as a fact: "All physically computable functions are Turing-computable."

They proved that ARNNs are able to solve classes of problems that are beyond the Turing Limit. Turing Machines can solve problems of complexity class P. While ARNNs with deterministic, real-valued signals can solve problems of class P/poly, which is a strict superset of class P. Moreover, they showed that ARNNs with signals with certain kinds of stochastic signals can solve problems of complexity class BPP/log*.  Where:                                 P   subset:of   BPP/log*  subset:of P/poly  That is, the BPP/log* is also Super-Turing, but perhaps lower computational complexity than P/poly. One condition is that the stochastic signal must have the possibility of having an irrational value.  The significance of this is: while a machine that computes with deterministic real-valued signals cannot be constructed, a ARNN with stochastic signals can be. There is no reason that the stochasticity cannot be irrational.  While any given measurement is rational (there are a finite number of significant bits or digits) a long sequence of measurements allows indirect access to the probability.  More accurately, it facilitates its approximation to high probability.   We designed, constructed, and tested a ARNN based on an electro-optic design, with theoretical guidance from the work by Siegelmann and others [6]. Figure 1 shows a schematic of our Optical Analog Recurrent Neural Network (OpticARNN).  Compatibility with Chaos.  Because chaotic systems are based on continous domain, Turning Machines cannot full characterize their behavior.    In their foundational book, Kaplan and Glass presented methods of testing whether or not a given time-series is compatible with chaos.  It cannot be proven that a candidate time series is chaotic. The series can fail a test and prove that it is incompatible with chaos.  Alternatively, the series can pass a several tests and confidence accumulated (but not proven) that is indeed chaotic.  We compared five neural neural networks (four digital and one analog) on the Logistics Chaos Time-Series to verify that the analog neural network results are compatible with chaos, while some digital results are not compatible with chaos.
