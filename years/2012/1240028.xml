<AbstractNarration>The 27th Annual Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications will be hosted by the Department of Mathematics &amp; Statistics of Minnesota State University, Mankato, on July 25-28, 2012.  Special sessions are to be offered in Asymmetric Topology, Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Topology, and Set-Theoretic Topology.  Each session has one to two associated plenary speakers.  The conference will also feature workshops in Dynamical Systems and Geometric Topology.  More details and information can be found at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://cset.mnsu.edu/mathstat/sumtopo/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of Topology, developed as a distinct discipline beginning in the late 19th century in an attempt to provide a flexible framework to answer questions of a geometric and analytic nature, has broadened in the last one hundred years to become ubiquitous throughout mathematics and related disciplines.  The field has had great success in connecting with the areas of Algebra, Dynamical Systems, and Computer Logic, as well as Physics, Economics and Biology.  Recent advances in Asymmetric Topology have found uses in screen pixelization applications.  This series of conferences, which draws a large national and international audience, has likewise broadened over its history and has established itself as a successful venue for the dissemination of results and sharing of ideas among these related disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The 27th Annual Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications (SUMTOPO), with gnerrous support from the National Science Foundation, was held July 25-28, 2012.  Meeting at Minnesota State University, Mankato, SUMTOPO brought together around 100 participants in the fields of geometry and dynamical systems for a week of talks by students, young faculty, and distinguished researchers.  The conference was organized in honor of Ralph Kopperman, both for his mathematical work and for his various contributions to this conference series over the years.  Special sessions were offered in Asymmetric Topology, Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Topology, and Set-Theoretic Topology. In addition to the 67 research presentations in these sessions, there were 10 plenary talks by established and emerging researchers that spoke to the conference as a whole.  The conference also featured workshops in Dynamical Systems and Geometric Topology, each given by an expert who had recently developed new techniques promising to advance their respective fields.  The field of Topology, developed as a distinct discipline beginning in the late 19th century in an attempt to provide a flexible framework to answer questions of a geometric and analytic nature, has broadened in the last one hundred years to become ubiquitous throughout mathematics and related disciplines. The field has had great success in connecting with the areas of Algebra, Dynamical Systems, and Computer Logic, as well as Physics, Economics and Biology. Recent advances in Asymmetric Topology have found uses in screen pixelization applications. This series of conferences, which draws a large national and international audience, has likewise broadened over its history and has established itself as a successful venue for the dissemination of results and sharing of ideas among these related disciplines.   For information on the talks and workshops, plesae see http://cset.mnsu.edu/mathstat/sumtopo/  Conference participants were encouraged to submit papers resulting from their research to the journal Topology Proceedings, which will publish an issue dedicated to the conference.  The 28th annual SUMTOPO Conference will be held at Nipissing University in North Bay, Ontario, Canada.             Last Modified: 08/29/2013       Submitted by: Brian Martensen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
