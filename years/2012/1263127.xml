<AbstractNarration>The WPI REU program in Industrial Mathematics and Statistics provides a unique educational experience for students of the mathematical sciences by introducing them to research in an industrial environment.  It provides a glimpse of the many career possibilities which are open to students with a strong mathematical background. The students work in teams on problems that come directly from local business and industry. Students work closely with a company representative to define the problem and develop solutions of immediate value to the company. They work closely with a faculty advisor to formulate the problem mathematically and maintain a clear focus on the mathematics at the core of the project. Industrial problems rarely fit into one area of mathematics and this fact is an important part of the research experience. Many projects require some combination of classical analysis, modelling, statistics, optimization, and computer programming.  The results from the projects completed in the REU program are of direct importance to the industrial partners and impact research and development at these companies. Further, projects developed for the REU program are modified for use in K-12 mathematics curricula in order to improve student motivation and generate interest in careers in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many mathematics graduates now follow nonacademic career paths. Of the roughly 1200 2010-2011 doctoral recipients in the Mathematical Sciences who have known employment in the U.S., 31.5% of them have taken up employment in business, government, industry, research institutes and other not-for-profits. When one takes out those writing statistics or biostatistics dissertations, one finds that 22% of the new mathematicians are working outside academia. The WPI REU Program in Industrial Mathematics and Statistics aims to expose students to mathematics research that occurs outside of the university setting.  It aims to provide challenges to students not faced in standard undergraduate programs and to develop skills not always developed in traditional educational programs, such as (a) communication at several levels, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening; (b) problem formulation as an interactive, evolutionary process; and (c) the ability to work with a diverse team. The WPI REU Program in Industrial Mathematics and Statistics has existed since 1998 and, since that time, we have worked with 167 students who have come from 119 different U.S. colleges in 37 states and Puerto Rico; 45% of the students were female. Only 7 of these 167 students were WPI students. Of the 119 universities that have been represented at the REU program over the last 15 years, 50% of them do not offer graduate degrees in mathematics. We have worked on 47 different industrial projects sponsored by 23 different companies.  Students from the REU program often go on to pursue graduate degrees in mathematics and in other fields, and they also pursue careers in finance and industry.</AbstractNarration>

Analyzing Exome Sequencing Data to Detect Familial ALS Genes with University of Massachusetts Medical School   Explored statistical methodologies to analyze genetic data from exome sequencing and genome-wide association studies of familial ALS. Presented work at the 2013 MPI.     Predictive Power of a Generalized Preventive Care Segmentation Model with Silverlink Communications, Inc.   Explored a dataset consisting of insurance claims and pinpointed patterns that will enable insurance providers to identify and contact their customers who are most likely to respond to some form of preventive health care intervention.  Presented work at the 2014 Applied and Industrial Mathematics Institute for Secondary Teachers (MIST) at WPI. Presented work at the 2015 JMM in San Antonio, TX.     Performance sensitivity to installation methods in vertical U-Tube geothermal energy harvesting systems with  Haley &amp; Aldrich and New England Geothermal Professional Association   Performed an analytical and numerical study of a model of a residential geothermal energy harvesting system to consider the temperature evolution in the exchanger and the surrounding soil and to investigate the temperature dependence on the piping geometry and spacing.  Presented work at the 2014 MIST. Presented work at the 2015 JMM in San Antonio, TX and won award.   Estimating Liquidity Risk Using Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) with State Street Global Advisors   o   Worked with the ETF called JNK and assess and implement a model by analyzing empirical data of the JNK and the underlying securities to model liquidity for better portfolio valuation.  Developed a metric called the ETF-NAV Liquidity Metric (ELM). Presented work at the 2014 MIST at WPI. Presented work at the 2015 JMM in San Antonio, TX.      Predictive Features of Carbon Nanotubes from Factors of Production with Nanocomp Technologies, Inc.   Created an automated classification method for carbon nanotubes based on variables derived from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images.  Presented work at the 2015 MIST at WPI. Presented work at the 2016 JMM in Seattle, WA.     Integrating Fish Movement in Multispecies Population Models with NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center    Formulated a discrete compartmental model that incorporates population growth, predation, and movement between two spatial regions based on the relative proportions of a species population.  A variety of different PDE formulations for the biomass density dynamics is considered. Presented work at the 2015 MIST. Presented work at the 2016 JMM in Seattle, WA. Presented work at the 2016 SIAM Annual Meeting in Boston, MA     ETF-Based Models for Liquidity Risk with State Street Global Advisors    Expanded ETF-NAV Liquidity Metric (ELM) that was developed in the previous year?s project to include the effects of market depth and time-to-liquidation. Focus placed on high risk, high yield bond ETFs. Presented work at the 2015 MIST. Presented work at the 2016 JMM in Seattle, WA.     The program developed the students' oral and written communication skills so that they can communicate their results effectively in industrial and academic settings.  The students visited their industrial partners and other companies and were exposed to the sort of work that non-academic mathematicians and statisticians do.  The program also provided opportunities for the students to get non-technical professional development from experts.
