<AbstractNarration>This study harnesses the predictive power of numerical relativity simulations to investigate extreme astrophysical systems. The work is organized in three activities areas: 1) compact object binaries and a sandbox of simulation data, 2) massive black holes in astrophysical environments, and 3) compact object mergers in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. The effort involves postdocs and students working in an interdisciplinary environment fostering interactions and collaborations with researchers in computing science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerical relativity has truly become a tool of discovery, enabling conversations between astrophysics and scientists from many areas focussed on the intricacies of analyzing interferometric detector data. This study is aimed at enhancing the impact numerical relativity is having on gravitational wave physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The work focuses on multi-scale/multi-physics problems where gravity displays its strongest grip, situations such as the collision of black holes in astrophysical environments for which the tools of numerical relativity provide the only avenue to gain new insights and to make observational predictions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Numerical relativity is one of the most impactful tools of astronomical discovery. For gravitational wave astrophysics, numerical relativity has enabled the conversation between theoretical studies of sources of gravitational radiation and observational efforts connected to LIGO. The award supported research focused on problems where gravity displays its strongest grip, situations for which the tools of numerical relativity provide the only avenue to gain new insights and to make observational predictions.  Intellectual Merit:  The effort harnessed the predictive power of numerical relativity simulations in the following three projects:   Binary Black Holes Simulations: Numerical relativity simulations of the inspiral and merger of binary black holes were produced to enhance a bank of gravitational waveform templates. At the end of the project, the bank consisted of more than 600 waveform templates, including information about the mass and spin of the final black hole. With the back of simulations, students and postdocs in the project were able to investigate the effect of precession on the detection and characterization of sources connected to data analysis efforts.  New Initial Data Approach to Binaries with Neutron Stars: A new approach to construct initial data for compact object binaries with neutron star companions was developed. The approach was based on the methodologies used for black holes. The main advantage of the method is its ability to incorporate in a natural way information from post-Newtonian approximations.   Massive BH in astrophysical environments: The disruption of a solar type star by an intermediate mass black hole was studied for ultra-close encounters. These are cases where a general relativistic description for gravity is needed. The star in these encounters was subject to extreme tidal forces. The star was destroyed as it approached the black hole. As a consequence, the stellar debris was promptly accreted by the black hole, thus producing unique observational signatures. The study will help in identifying intermediate black holes from transient observations.   Broader impact: The funding enabled research that strengthened the presence of numerical relativity in computer science and engineering.

The effort produced results with direct impact on our understanding of the central engines of active galactic nuclei, gamma ray bursts, galaxy mergers, and sources of gravitational radiation.
