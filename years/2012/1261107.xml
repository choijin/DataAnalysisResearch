<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to advance understanding of the spectrum of large-scale ionospheric electron density irregularities commonly observed in the nighttime equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere, known as Equatorial Spread F (ESF), as a function of varying geophysical conditions.  The result will be an improved understanding of the processes responsible for ESF development, variability and morphology.  The approach is to use in-situ ion density measurements made by the Planar Langmuir Probe (PLP) onboard the C/NOFS (Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System) satellite. The observations made by the C/NOFS-PLP can provide a characterization of the spatial (in the zonal direction) spectrum of large-scale ESF structures under different geophysical conditions.  Analysis of the PLP measurements will also make it possible to identify the occurrence of periodic structures, and the occurrence of a dominant wavelength (or a dominant range of wavelengths).  PLP measurements will allow the estimation of the occurrence rate of large-scale ESF structures as a function of season and longitude sector.  The project will investigate possible explanations for the variability in ESF periodicities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ionosphere is a region of the Earth?s upper atmosphere characterized by a large density of free ions and electrons. This gas of ions and electrons (plasma) is created, mainly, by solar photo-ionization.  The main goal of this project was to advance our understanding of large-scale plasma density perturbations commonly observed in the nighttime equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere. These perturbations are associated with events known as Equatorial Spread F (ESF). Study of ESF is motivated by a basic understanding of ionospheric plasma and by its impact on radio signals used for communication, navigation (e.g. GPS) and remote sensing.  The project used in-situ measurements of the ionospheric plasma density made by two sensors onboard the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS): the Ion Velocity Meter and the Planar Langmuir Probe. In addition to satellite data, we also analyzed observations of ESF and ionospheric drifts made by ground-based radar systems.  The project provided training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Texas at Dallas. Students learn about space sciences, plasma physics, sensors, radio propagation, and scientific programming. One of the students that contributed to this project received her PhD in Physics as a result of her work.  This project allowed us to carry out a number of scientific tasks need to advance our understanding of ionospheric plasma structuring. Some of these tasks lead to interesting findings that have been submiited for publication in scientific journals. Main points are summarized below:  - Analyses of the in-situ satellite measurements of ionospheric densities allowed us to determine the occurrence distribution of spacings between ESF depletions. We found a peak in the occurrence rate for scale sizes around 250-300 km in the zonal direction.  - Analyses of in-situ satellite measurements also allowed us to investigate the occurrence of unusual plasma depletions occurring around dawn. Simultaneous drift measurements allowed us to better understand and propose a mechanism for the generation of these events.  - Analyses of ionospheric radar data and weather measurements allowed us to obtain experimental evidence that indicates the modulation of electrojet irregularities by atmospheric gravity waves.  - Simultaneous, nearly collocated satellite and ground-based radar measurements allowed us to better understand the role of the vertical drifts in the generation of the post-sunset ESF events in the Brazilian longitude sector.  - Finally, we were able to implement an algorithm for creating of two-dimensional images of ESF structures from interferometric radar measurements.

The analyses and results reported here contribute to our understanding of ESF. The results can also be used to guide future efforts to model and validate the modeling of ESF events.
