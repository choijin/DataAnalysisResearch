<AbstractNarration>Very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astrophysics has been transformed by a number of stunning discoveries made by the current-generation, ground-based gamma-ray observatories operating in the 100 GeV - 10 TeV energy range. These observatories are arrays of 2-4 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) that detect VHE gamma-rays via Cherenkov light from secondary electrons in electromagnetic cascades initiated by gamma-rays in the atmosphere. Developing new instruments with significantly better sensitivity is not possible by a simple replication or upgrade of existing devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the proponents will build a novel gamma-ray telescope that has the potential to transform the field, based on work by Schwarzschild and Couder. It incorporates original ideas for the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve substantial gains in angular resolution and field of view at costs comparable to existing instruments. The international Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium is preparing for a future IACT array with ten times better sensitivity and broader energy coverage to exploit the evident scientific potential of VHE gamma-ray observations. Some examples of new types of gamma-ray discoveries are searching extremely deeply for dark matter in the Galactic center and halo, testing cosmology with extragalactic background light measurements, resolving the details of shock acceleration in supernova remnants and pulsar winds, and advancing the physics of extragalactic jets by population studies and observations of short-term variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new telescope overcomes the fundamental limitations in angular resolution and field of view of current prime-focus IACTs. At the same time, it allows the application of new, lower-cost technologies for the camera focal plane sensors. This work will demonstrate the enhanced performance and improved reliability of the SCT design, and the location adjacent to VERITAS will allow the performance to be evaluated against an instrument of known sensitivity. The results from this effort will enable informed choices to be made for the construction of CTA or other future instruments. It will also enhance the capabilities of the VERITAS Observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Working with industry, this work will foster emerging technologies for the mass production of relatively inexpensive, light, aspheric mirror segments that will both enable future instruments to deliver unique science capabilities and encourage use of the design in the other fields of astronomy. This project will provide a unique opportunity for integrated research and education for a substantial number of young scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this proposal was to develop new instrumentation to prepare for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), the next generation imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope. We worked on building a "Schwarzschild-Couder" design telescope (SCT) to serve as the medium-size telescope of the array of telescopes that will comprise CTA. The SCT design is more compact then the traditional design and also reduces the size of the camera, making the use of small solid state sensors for the camera more practical.    The SCT design achieves its compactness by using two mirrors, a primary and a highly-curved aspheric secondary.  The purpose of this work was to construct a single SCT, which is now sited adjacent to the existing VERITAS telescope array at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona, and to use the SCT both as a stand-alone instrument to monitor bright, variable sources, as well as to test it as an potential CTA array telescope using the existing VERITAS telescope array. The work was done in collaboration with other members of this MRI project.  The main effort of the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) was developing a method of producing the large, highly curved panels of the secondary mirror.   UAH worked on a technique of replicating mirrors from mandrels using electroforming.   Before that method could be fully validated, it was determined that a technique developed in Europe, cold/hot glass slumping, would be more cost effective.  Therefore the UAH R&amp;D effort ceased and the remaining funds were spent on procuring glass mirror panels.
