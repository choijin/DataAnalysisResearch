<AbstractNarration>The project is creating an innovative educational pathway in mechanical engineering technology that addresses a developing industry need and gives students the competencies needed to succeed in a rapidly developing STEM field. The Mechanical Engineering Technology Advancement (META) project is developing and piloting flexible and adaptive module-based courses that utilize problem-based learning. These courses focus on manufacturing and assembly processes and planning that will ensure that the region's workforce is being equipped with the latest knowledge and skills, particularly in the automotive and aviation fields. The META project advances student learning and workforce preparedness by focusing on the needs of employers in manufacturing and assembly, including the skill sets of project management, production process planning, logistics, and quality. The project engages employer partners and the national SCATE Center, making the project sustainable; its modular nature is ensuring its replicability; and an industry advisory board is also ensuring that problem-based learning scenarios are relevant to today's MET field. The META project is piloting a curriculum delivery innovation with an eye toward a future expansion across disciplines, sharing its flexible curriculum modules and implementation strategies with the SCATE Center, ATE Central and offering a training workshop for other colleges that seek to better meet the demands of employers in engineering technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Trident Technical College has completed work on the National Science Foundation grant entitled "Mechanical Engineering Technology Advancement".  Trident Technical College is a two-year, associate degree institution offering, among other associate degrees, an associate in applied science in Mechanical Engineering Technology, often abbreviated as "MET".  The 2 main objectives of the grant were:  Objective 1: Develop, pilot and implement a new MET pathway that is focused on manufacturing and assembly processes and planning.  This objective is to be facilitated via a series of 6 new problem-based, modular curricula offerings.  Objective 2: Increase enrollment in MET program by 15%, maintain participation rate of minorities at or above TTC's college-wide rate, and increase the participation rate of females.  Results for objective 1:  Problem-based, modular curricula were developed for the following six courses pertaining to mechanical engineering technology: Lean Manufacturing, Production Layout and Process Planning, Applied Thermal Principles, Applied Mechanics, Project Management and Quality Techniques for Manufacturing. Problem-based activities and challenges were created along with assessment criteria for each of the six courses.  Problem-based modular curricula offer distinct advantages to the students, the college and local industry.  1. The learning modules and problem challenges are flexible and can be changed to adapt to local industry or changes in technology. Instructors can easily modify/replace individual modules as the need arises. This is in contrast to textbook-based curricula which often require a total revision of a course in order to adopt a new textbook.  2. The modules offer extensive opportunity to embed websites, applets and other visual aids to enhance learning and engage students.  3. The cost and environmental impact of a printed textbook is avoided. The modules are free and accessible to enrolled students by secure log-in via the internet.  The new manufacturing and assembly pathway is now available and listed in the college catalog for Mechanical Engineering Technology students who desire a concentration in manufacturing and assembly.  Student feedback to the problem-based, modular approach was very positive and included comments such as:  I wasnÆt sure how I was going to like the course in this format, but it ended up working much better for me than straight lecture for this material. As the student solved problems in different ways, there were alternatives and I was able to get a better understanding of several concepts that I previously struggled with.  Results for objective 2:  Overall enrollment in the MET program increased by 33% during the funding period.  Minority participation rates in the MET program remained above the overall minority participation rate of the college as a whole.  The participation rate of females in the MET program increased by 114% during the funding period.  Grant funding was provided for instructional resources that enabled the MET lab to operate in a way that encourages student participation and group problem solving. New tablets and mobile benches greatly facilitate student-centered learning. Previously, the classroom was laid out in a traditional lecture-based arrangement with benches facing the instructor's desk at the front of the classroom. New light-weight benches on casters allow quick and easy rearrangement of the classroom. Mobile monitors and whiteboards bring the learning environment closer to the students.  The modular curricula approach, with modules accessible via the internet, will also lead to more on-line possibilities for classes.  Faculty members learned a great deal by developing the modules. The ability to easily add website links and applets made the classroom more engaging, avoiding the boredom of lecture-based curricula. They also had to learn a more hands-off approach, which at times was difficult for both students and instructors accustomed to l...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
