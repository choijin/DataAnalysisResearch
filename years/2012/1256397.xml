<AbstractNarration>THhis RAPID requestaims to collect a new and exciting data set that will support geyser eruption&lt;br/&gt;research currently funded by the National Science Foundation. The goal of this proposal&lt;br/&gt;is to create a short-term seismic array that will monitor and characterize the seismic&lt;br/&gt;behavior of the shall subsurface at El Tatio Geyser Fields. This is the third largest&lt;br/&gt;geyser field in the world. Due to the more relaxed stance on marginally invasive&lt;br/&gt;scientific investigations, El Tatio is an ideal location to deploy such a network. The data&lt;br/&gt;will be unique in sensor density and duration. Consequently, results will likely surpass&lt;br/&gt;those for any other geyser field. The goal is to characterize subsurface processes resulting in seismic vibrations and&lt;br/&gt;correlate these sources with surface eruption characteristics measured by Michael&lt;br/&gt;Manga?s group (at UC Berkeley). The concurrent measurements of temperature,&lt;br/&gt;discharge rate, eruption height, eruption duration and recurrence time, will make this data&lt;br/&gt;set completely unique. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the world?s third largest geyser field, El Tatio is a key geotourism location. Better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the subsurface processes for such locations will eventually help&lt;br/&gt;education the broader public. Geyser eruptions are also key for understanding volcanic&lt;br/&gt;eruption processes as well as constraining important properties for geothermal energy&lt;br/&gt;generation. Because this is a unique data set, and the data will be archived at the IRIS&lt;br/&gt;DMC for posterity, we anticipate that the data will contribute to further investigations&lt;br/&gt;into geothermal and geyser processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "RAPID: Seismic Investigation of Geysers at El Tatio" was a unique investigation of Earth's 3rd largest geyser field.  We accompanied a team of geoscientists who measured heat flow, periodicity, temperature, and spatial patterns within the geysers.  This project aimed at measuring the subsurface processes by observing seismic observations.  We focused on two geysers: "El Jefe", in the upper geyser basin and another in the lower geyser basin.  We installed &gt;50 short-period sensors and 6 broad-band sensors around El Jefe for 3 days, measuring one eruption every 120 seconds.  We installed another 21 short-period sensors and 3 broadband sensors around the second geyser for 2 days.  From the data we are able to measure 1) sensor tilt (likely due to inflation and deflation of the geyser), 2) onset and duration of the of the cycle,  3) and energy decay with distance.  While we are still processing the data (and may be for years), we are able to create a tomographic images of the shallow subsurface.  They geyser is clearly visible as a low seismic velocity anomaly within a higher seismic velocity anomaly.  This likely suggests a narrow porous medium imediately around the geyser within a larger, stiffer hydrothermally altered rock.  The entire funds were expeded on travel and shipping of equipment to and from El Tatio Chile.       Last Modified: 01/14/2014       Submitted by: Jesse F Lawrence]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
