<AbstractNarration>For the last 20 years, Parque Nacional Nahuel Huapi in Argentina has been the site of a comparative study of ecology and genetics of two species of tuco-tuco, a type of burrowing rodent.  The June 2011 ongoing eruption of the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic chain in southern Chile has created a time-sensitive opportunity to assess the impacts of a major geological event on patterns and processes of genetic diversification in natural populations of vertebrates.  With extensive pre-eruption data, the proposed post-eruption monitoring will capitalize upon an unprecedented opportunity to explore the effects of a catastrophic environmental event on the population genetics of free-living organisms.  Therefore, this study should lead to important new insights into the impacts, including long-term impacts, of volcanic activity, or other catastrophic events, on genetic diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research supports student training, conservation, and local outreach and education efforts.  It will involve undergraduate volunteers from Berkeley, Stanford, and the Universidad Nacional del Comahue in Bariloche, Argentina, thereby providing significant student training. With regard to public outreach, the PIs will maintain web and blog sites on the project, providing quick public access to research methods and results. For the past 20 years, the PIs have worked closely with Administracion de Parques Nacionales Argentinas and other conservation organizations in Patagonia to develop sound, data-based strategies for protecting one of the species of tuco-tuco, including development of the current monitoring and management program. Data generated by the proposed research will contribute to these ongoing efforts.</AbstractNarration>

An Icelandic eruption in 1783 lead to the subsequent demise of most of the islandÃ†s livestock and 20% of the human population due to fluorine poisoning (Stone 2004). Volcanic ash from a 1988 eruption in the Chilean Andes caused a 91.3% reduction in population size of C. maulinus brunneus, with a profound influence on heterozogosity (Gallardo et al. 1995).

These results and analyses are currently underway in the Hadly lab.     We observed a decrease in wildlife and fauna in northern Patagonia following the June 2011 eruption of Volcan Puyehue, including mortality in the tuco-tuco populations.  We observerd signs of physiological stress in tuco-tucos (loss of fur; changes in coloration to fur pattern).  We found evidence for possible demographic shifts in tuco-tuco population, and surprisingly we noted an increase in the observed variation in quickly evolving markers after the eruption.  We are presently investigating the putative genes we identified that appear to be under selection over the past 10,000 in this species.
