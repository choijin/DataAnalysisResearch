<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Ross A. Widenhoefer of the Department of Chemistry at Duke University will explore the synthesis and study of potential intermediates in gold(I) pi-activation catalysis, including pi-alkene, pi-allene, and sigma-vinyl complexes.  An understanding of the mechanisms of gold pi-activation catalysis has lagged significantly behind the synthetic development of this chemistry, and available information is largely derived from computational analyses.  As such, little experimental information is available regarding the behavior of gold pi- and sigma-complexes generated as intermediates in gold(I)-catalyzed hydrofunctionalization and likewise, experimental information regarding the structure and reactivity of cationic gold carbene complexes germane to gold-catalyzed alkene cyclopropanation and enyne cycloaddition is lacking.  The proposed research activities aim to fill these gaps and to develop an experimentally-grounded understanding of the mechanisms of gold pi-activation catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emergence of cationic gold(I) complexes as catalysts for the functionalization of carbon carbon multiple bonds (pi-activation catalysis) represents one of the most important developments in homogenous catalysis over the past decade.  These transformations often display high efficiency, excellent atom economy, and high regio- and stereoselectivity, making them particularly attractive for application in both target-oriented synthesis and pharmaceutical development.  The research activities undertaken in this project will provide mechanistic information that will facilitate the continued development of this important family of synthetic transformations.  In addition, the research activities related to this project are fully integrated with the scientific education and training of the graduate and undergraduate research participants including students from ethnic groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  One of the most important developments in homogenous catalysis over the past decade has been the significant growth in the application of cationic gold(I) complexes as catalysts for the activation of carbon-carbon multiple bonds with potential applications in pharmaceutical development and target-oriented synthesis.  As is often the case in homogeneous catalysis, an understanding of the mechanisms of gold catalysis has lagged significantly behind the synthetic development of this chemistry and this lack of understanding represents a significant impediment to the continued development of these methods.  For this reason, our research activities during the tenure of this grant were directed toward the elucidation of the mechanisms of gold-catalyzed transformations and toward the independent synthesis and interrogation of potential intermediates in gold-catalyzed functionalization of C&ndash;C multiple bonds.  Specifically we have synthesized cationic, two-coordinate gold p-complexes, elucidated the mechanisms of the gold-catalyzed hydroalkoxylation and racemization of allenes, synthesized and studied cationic gold carbene complexes, and identified key intermediates in the gold-catalyzed cycloaddition of 1,6-enynes.              The intellectual merit of the research activities conducted during the tenure of this grant is two-fold. Firstly, our results have contributed in a meaningful way to the broader understanding of the structure and reactivity of cationic gold carbene complexes. This information will be particularly valuable toward understanding the behavior of cationic gold carbene complexes generated as intermediates in a range of gold-catalyzed transformations.  Secondly, our work in enyne cycloaddition has, for the first time allowed detailed spectroscopic interrogation of the intermediate in an enyne cycloaddition process, which provides crucial insight into the mechanisms of these transformations.  Thirdly, our work in the area of gold-catalyzed allene functionalization provide mechanistic insight that will serve the ever growing community of researchers working toward the development of new and more efficient gold(I) catalyzed transformations.               The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activities stem from (1) the integration of scientific discovery with the training and education of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers, (2) broadening participation of women and underrepresented minorities in research, (3) improving the graduate school educational experience, and (4) community outreach.  The PI has sought to provide meaningful research experiences for undergraduate students, both from Duke and elsewhere, and to encourage both undergraduate students and students from traditionally underrepresented minority groups to participate in the PIÆs research program. With the objective of providing a more balanced graduate educational experience for students who are interested in pursuing careers as faculty members at teaching-intensive and/or predominantly undergraduate institutions, graduate student participants have participated in the educational programs offered through the Duke Graduate School.  Graduate students have participated in community outreach activities organized through the Duke University Department of Chemistry.
