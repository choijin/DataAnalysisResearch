<AbstractNarration>The purpose of the project is to provide rapid response to natural disasters by developing a situation aware virtual information observatory to extreme events occurring anywhere in the world. The project focuses on methods by which the multiuser virtual world can have a coherent representation of assets, which differ by type and scale, by assimilating the physical and observational data into operational predictive models. It will utilize cloud computing services to integrate these divergent assets for effective real time data assimilation of multimedia data information streaming and meta-tagging into real world socio-physical models, employing unstructured databases that can be queried in this specific virtual world for distributed viewers and decision makers to experience their impact. These activities will interact with the virtual observatory to make more effective decisions in planning event response by providing a scenario querying and testing platform.</AbstractNarration>
