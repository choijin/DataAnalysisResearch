<AbstractNarration>This award will fund the continuation of a successful survey of white-dwarf supernova explosions (called "Type I") at telescopes in Arizona and Chile.  The main goal of the work will be to compare low redshift (nearby) supernovae with their high-redshift (distant) counterparts, especially through observations in the infrared which can reduce the effects of dust.  Under earlier funding from NSF, this group has assembled a large and homogeneous set of Type I supernovae light curves and spectra, developed original methods for using them using advanced statistical techniques, and addressed problems of cosmic expansion such as local flows, the Hubble constant, cosmic acceleration and the nature of the dark energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to advance the study of dark energy, which makes up most of the universe.  Results from this survey will be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum at Harvard, and students will be involved in the research.  The award will also support ongoing efforts outreach and public education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied exploding stars and their use to measure the history of the universe.    Supernova explosions end a star's long life that extends over millions or even billions of years, but in the explosion, a single star can shine billion times brighter than the Sun.  During the star's long lifetime, nuclear fusion changes light elements, like hydrogen, into heavier ones like the oxygen you are breathing and the calcium in your bones.  In this very concrete way, studying supernova explosions is part of finding out where we (and our planet Earth) came from.    Because of their extreme energy output, we can see supernova explosions out to great distances in the universe, halfway back to the Big Bang.  This means that supernovae can be used to trace the history of cosmic expansion.  While astronomers expected to see that expansion gradually slowing due to gravity, that is not what we found just 20 years ago.  Instead, the early evidence let us to conclude something extraordinary-- that the expansion of the universe was actually speeding up.  We attributed this to the effect of a mysterious "dark energy" that acts to make the space between galaxies stretch out faster over time.    During the period of this grant, we have pursued these two ideas studying supernova for themselves and for studying the history of the universe.  Our approach has been mostly observational, using the telescopes of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and also NSF-sponsored facilities like Gemini, ALMA, and the VLA to learn more about how stars explode to produce the heavy elements, stir the gas between the stars, and provoke the formation of new solar systems.  For a special type of supernova that has a nearly uniform light output, we have worked hard to understand what they are and what they do, but also to use them to trace cosmic acceleration with higher precision than has been done in the past.  Our aim is to place tighter constraints on the nature of dark energy.  We want to know if it the same as Einstein's "cosmological constant" (which is mysterious enough) or if there are clues in the data that will show us even stranger properties of gravitation on the cosmic scale.  We have published our results in a long series of refereed journal articles and placed the observations in public archives for others to use.  We have developed new mathematical methods for analyzing the way the supernovae change in brightness and color that help us make more reliable measurements of supernova distances.  We have made these methods publically available and have helped others to exploit them for a range of different problems in astronomy. The students and postdocs who have worked on this project have gone on to be part of the scientific strength of the world.  Some are leaders in astronomy, but others are working in fields like energy or the application of mathematics to problems in the real world.  Inspired by their research on this project, they have found ways to apply their skills for a range of problems.  These profound questions about the nature of the universe have also found a wide resonance in the broader public.  In a book, public talks, popular-level articles, and web blogs, we have told the story of using the astronomical evidence to infer the presence of cosmic acceleration, even when we thought it was a very unlikely result.  The subsequent decades of improved data and better analysis have strengthened the evidence for this strange new picture of the universe.  The enthusiasm for science that this story generates helps people see how scientific thinking can be applied more boradly to decisions in society.  The world is full of problems, many of which are going to get worse if we don't take action.  But figuring out the best course of action is not the exclusive province of experts.  An informed public that can understand the issues, weigh the consequences, and make wise choices is our best hope for a better future.
