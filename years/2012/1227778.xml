<AbstractNarration>University of Miami proposes to support technical services on one research vessel R/V Walton Smith, operated by the University?s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS). R/V Walton Smith is operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet and as part of their basic operations they will provide one technician on each seagoing research project, and will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Shipboard Technical Support Program granted by this NSF award was primarily in support of multi-disciplinary research projects and programs aboard the University of Miami's R/V WALTON SMITH but the support also spanned other UNOLS (University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System) vessels and support of scientific instrumentation aboard cruise ships.  For the duration of this project, three (3) of the University of Miami (UM) marine technicians provided technical services aboard five (5) different UNOLS vessels and three Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines (RCCL) cruise ships.  Their efforts were in support of the UM RSMAS (Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science) Oceanscope project.  From time to time other UNOLS institutions request technical services support when their internal personnel were not available.  In an effort to support those sister institutions, our technicians when available, availed themselves to augment that gap in service.  This was accomplished by sailing onboard their vessels on research missions assisting the scientists with their oceanographic data collection.  Efforts included work on instrumentation from configuration to  deployment, maintenance, shipboard communications, shipboard network and internet connectivity among other activities.  In CY2017 and the first five (5) months of 2018, UM marine techs served over 343 days at sea on UM, UNOLS and RCCL cruise ships.  Additionally thirty-five (35) days were spent installing, configuring and supporting the scientific equipment aboard the RCCL cruise ship Adventure of the Seas while it was in wet-dock in Freeport, The Bahamas.  The effort to update and modify the scientific acoustic equipment greatly improved the data signal and resulted in a higher quality data set.  The science community was satisfied with the now improved results.          Last Modified: 11/14/2018       Submitted by: Richard Behn]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
