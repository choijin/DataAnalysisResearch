<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to find new algorithms for partitioning a geographic region into smaller sub-regions for distributing a workload among multiple agents, such as mobile robots or other autonomous vehicles. Dividing a territory into sub-regions is a fundamental problem in many different domains, such as vehicle routing, congressional zoning, air traffic control, facility location, and supply chain management. Often, some ways of partitioning a territory are better than others along one or more criteria; we refer to the problem of optimally partitioning a region as a "map segmentation" problem.  A map segmentation problem is usually formulated as an infinite-dimensional optimization problem because the objective is to design continuous boundaries between sub-regions; for this reason, optimally constructing such a partition remains a difficult and (often) intractable problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research problems can be applied to a variety of problems across many disciplines, including geographic analysis, transportation theory, and location science. This project includes an extensive education and outreach program to complement the research agenda.  Students will study various map segmentation problems and consider the impacts and implications of solutions to these problems by means of simulation-based experiments. Finally, collaborators in industry and state-level government will provide an added value to the project by balancing the theoretical work of the researchers with the concerns of practitioners, ensuring that the work will have both an intellectual and social benefit.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has successfully combined theory from computational geometry together with algorithms from mathematical optimization to solve a wide variety of problems in the field of vehicle routing.  The main impacts from the publications that have resulted from this grant are:      *We have developed algorithms for dividing a geographic territory into smaller pieces so as to optimally allocate the workloads of vehicles, robots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or other agents.  A particular specialty of our approach is that, in many cases, we are able to make near-optimal decisions even when one does not have a full set of information; for example, one might not know the exact locations of all of one's customers, and one make seek a decision that makes as much use of whatever information happens to be available.     *We have analyzed many modern problems in logistics and used the "lens" of geometry to characterize them in terms of simple and concise mathematical expressions.  For example, our paper "Household-level economies of scale in transportation" shows how to predict the benefits of the introduction of grocery delivery services in an urban region.     *Our theoretical results have also been applied by several industrial collaborators, including Oracle Labs and the San Francisco 49ers, which are applying our results to deliver concessions efficiencly in their "Smart Stadium" project at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, CA.  The outcomes of this project have also been disseminated widely in the media; they have been featured in Popular Science magazine, Investor's Business Daily, and SIAM News.
