<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor John Ellis from University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and colleagues Lawrence Que, William Tolman, Calvin Sun and Connie Lu will acquire a single crystal diffractometer with a compact copper radiation source, photon detector and a top-of-the-line cryostat capable of collecting high-resolution diffraction data on very small specimens. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) hydrocarbon-stabilized metal-atom reagents; (b) electron-transfer molecular catalysts; (c) bioinorganic studies of metallo-copper enzymes and synthesis of sustainable polymeric materials; (d) study and optimization of the physico-mechanical properties of drugs; (e) model complexes of non-heme iron metalloenzymes; (f) design of biologically active agents; (g) synthetic routes to biologically active compounds; (h) Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 and dopamine receptor modulation study and anthrax toxin lethal factor inhibition; and (i) study of parthenolide and helenalin analogues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research not only at the University of Minnesota but also at neighboring colleges and universities in the Twin Cities area.</AbstractNarration>
