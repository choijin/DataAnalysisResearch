<AbstractNarration>This award funds the travel of 15 US student to travel to the 21st ACM International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC 2012). HPDC 2012 is to be held, along with nine workshops, at the campus of the Delft University of Technology in Delft, The Netherlands on June 18 through June 22, 2012. HPDC is the premier forum for presenting the latest research findings on the design and use of parallel and distributed systems for high end computing, collaboration, data analysis, and other innovative applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HPDC 2012 will build on the success of its predecessors, which date back to 1992, and which have typically drawn 150-250 participants from among the academic research, national lab, standards, vendor, and user communities in the field of high performance distributed computing. HPDC seeks to increase student participation in the symposium as well as the field in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will facilitate participation of unfunded student authors, and encourage participation of students from traditionally underrepresented groups, underfunded institutions, and undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
