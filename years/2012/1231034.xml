<AbstractNarration>The proposed research targets fundamental work in sensor networks.  Specifically the work addresses the central problem that distributed inference systems need to be robust to a wide variety of sensing, and channel impairments.  The effort seeks to design a suite of robust, distributed detection and estimation algorithms for sensor networks and Net-Centric applications. A comprehensive approach to robust distributed inference for a wide range of communication channels and topologies, with minimal assumptions about the sensing noise, is proposed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the proposed work have the potential to greatly impact many Net-Centric applications including environmental, military and health care that require aggregation of data from sensors which are linked only through wireless means. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio while potentially attracting new members. The PI has collaborative TUES Phase 3 software project with HBCU colleges that will be tapped on for recruitment of minority students for training in the Ph.D. program associated with this I/UCRC FRP.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit of the proposed project is the consideration of the transformative idea that inference-based Wireless sensor networks have to be designed to be robust to a wide variety of impairments such as sensing noise, fading and interference in the communication of the samples. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to robust distributed inference for a wide range of communication channels and topologies, with minimal assumptions about the sensing noise, is proposed.  Broader Impact: Many net-centric applications including environmental, military and health care require aggregation of data from sensors which are linked only through wireless means.

The following are accomplishments over the life of the project:  We developed  a comprehensive approach to designing robust distributed inference algorithms for a wide range of communication channels, with minimal assumptions about the sensing noise over several different Wireless Senros network (WSN) topologies. We designed distributed inference algorithms that are robust to a wide range of sensing noise distributions such as those caused by network interference from nodes that are randomly scattered over space which result in impulsive noise.

We implemented select algorithms on a simulation test bed comprised of sensors with transceiver capability.  The algorithms developed can be used with appropriate hardware and software  in net-centric applications such as border control.   Significant Results   In distributed inference problems, non-linear transformations applied at the sensor transmitters can be used to limit instantaneous transmit power. In such scenarios, function computation and data diffusion are possible.   The computation of the maximum of measured data is accomplished using a soft-max function as a proxy.   Distributed localization problems can be solved as a detection problem, allowing us to delect nodes in areas, with possibly interfering nodes.   Complex Multipath issues in GPS sensors and systems can be addressed by using assymetric correlation kernels.    Select Products  The project produced IP that can be used for technology transfer.  In all, we  submitted one full patent, presented several research papers on this FRP, and also published journal papers.  Listed below are the patent and associated papers:  - R. Santucci, M.K.
