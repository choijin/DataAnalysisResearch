<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Gains from Economic Integration: Theory and Evidence from Agricultural Markets&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: SES - 1227635 &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Dave Donaldson  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How large are the gains from economic integration? Since researchers never observe markets that are both closed and open at the same time, the fundamental challenge in answering this question lies in predicting how local markets, either countries or regions, would behave under counterfactual scenarios in which they suddenly become more or less integrated with the rest of the world. This project will develop a new approach in order to obtain knowledge of such counterfactual scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;The central idea is to focus on agriculture, a sector of the economy in which scientific knowledge of how essential inputs map into outputs is uniquely well understood. As a consequence of this knowledge, agronomists are able to predict how productive a given parcel of land would be were it to be used to grow any one of a set of crops. The approach of this project combines these agronomic predictions about both factual and counterfactual technologies with a general equilibrium model in which heterogeneous parcels of land are allocated to multiple crops in multiple local markets under perfect competition.&lt;br/&gt;To date this research has focused on applying this new approach to the context of U.S. agricultural markets from 1880 to 2002. A combination of agronomic data from the Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) project and historical data from the U.S. Census identifies the spatial distribution of crop prices across U.S. counties over time, while still allowing for unobserved crop-county-year specific productivity shocks. These estimates of local prices further identify changes in trade costs over time and, in turn, the gains from market integration over the period from 1880 to 2002. &lt;br/&gt;Ongoing work in this project applies a similar approach to study global agricultural trade reform.  Despite its vital importance for many developing countries, there is relatively little work on trade in agricultural goods. The new approach developed here is potentially well suited to fill this gap by offering a flexible, tractable, and scientifically-informed framework for quantitative work on this topic.  The goal will be to improve forecasts of how the removal of agricultural trade policies may affect the prices and trade flows of agricultural goods, as well as the welfare of those who produce and consume these goods. Such considerations are at the heart of the World Trade Organization's Doha Round.&lt;br/&gt;A second area of ongoing work focuses on the economic consequences of climate change.  Since agronomic models (such as the GAEZ model) can be re-computed under a wide range of climate change scenarios, the new methodology developed here also has the potential to shed new light on how countries will adapt to climate change in the agricultural sector through changes in their output mix and through the ability to trade with other countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved three major goals, each leveraging a novel method for bringing agronomic data into standard models of international and intra-national trade.  The first was to understand the importance of improved economic integration in the growth of aggregate US agricultural output over the past 120 years.  By comparing county-level patterns of agricultural specialization to the agronomic possibilities available to each of these counties, we have been able to estimate the sets of relative producer prices that farmers have faced in each county over time. These estimates imply that spatial price convergence &ndash; economic integration &ndash; over time has led to substantial improvements in aggregate agricultural output. These benefits appear to have been similar in magnitude to those due to pure (within-county, within-crop) productivity improvements throughout the same period.     The second goal of this project was to characterize features of a nation?s unilaterally optimal trade policy in the agricultural sector.  We did this for a country with an arbitrary set of one-factor production technologies &ndash; the so-called Ricardian model of comparative advantage &ndash; and with no domestic distortions such that the only motive for trade taxes is to alter the country?s terms-of-trade. Our main theoretical result shows that the trade taxes that maximize domestic welfare (holding foreign taxes constant) in the models we consider, which we label optimal trade taxes, should be uniform across imported goods and weakly monotone with respect to comparative advantage across exported goods.  In the context of agricultural markets, we find that U.S. gains from trade under optimal trade taxes are 20% larger than those obtained under laissez-faire.
