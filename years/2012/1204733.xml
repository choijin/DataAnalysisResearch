<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometry of the solution sets to systems of polynomial equations in several variables.  One can ask many question about such solution sets.  For example, if p(x,y,z) is a cubic polynomial, does the set of points where p(x,y,z) = 0 contain any lines?  If so, how many?  This classical problem has been solved for a long time.  However, the field of algebraic geometry is very much alive and people are discovering beautiful new results all the time.  The solution set to a system of polynomial equations is called an algebraic variety.  The circle defined by x^2 + y^2 = 1 is a good example to keep in mind. At each point on the circle, there is a tangent line.  There is a new object  which consists of pairs of a point p on the circle, and a point on the tangent  line at p.  This is an example of a structure called a vector bundle.  The study of vector bundles on an algebraic variety can give deep insight into its  geometry.   One line of inquiry I pursued with M. Brown has to do with special vector       bundles called tilting bundles.  It is not so important to know exactly what a tilting bundle is, but rather that it may be connected with a fundamental  property of algebraic varieties called rationality.  Sometimes it is possible to describe the vicinity of a point on an algebraic variety using a coordinate  system which is also algebraic.  For example, if you were to take the point  (1,0) on the circle and join it to any point on the x-axis by a line, the line  would meet the circle in exactly one other point.  If you were to solve for the  coordinates of this point in terms of the x-coordinate of the point on the x-axis, you would get ratios of polynomials.  This means that the circle is rational.  (However, y^2 = x(x+1)(x+2) is not rational!)  Dr. Brown and I investigated whether or not the existence of a tilting bundle on an algebraic variety implies the variety is rational and found that the answer is yes in some cases.  Our work clarifies this exciting connection, but there is still much work to be done.  Another line of inquiry, followed with R. Kulkarni and Y. Mustopa, also has to do with vector bundles.  We studied a special class of vector bundles called Ulrich bundles.  Again, it is not so crucial to understand what an Ulrich bundle is to  get the point of the project.  Any variety which has an Ulrich bundle also has a handful of other exciting properties that tend to be difficult to understand on their own.  Our contribution was to expand the tools available to researchers  studying Ulrich bundles and to stress-test some new techniques.  In particular, we show that it is possible to reduce a problem about Ulrich bundles on a  high-dimensional variety to a problem about one-dimensional varieties.  Finally, in joint work with D. Halpern-Leistner we studied an exotic form of symmetry of algebraic varieties that is related to string theory.  We were able to understand the structure of those symmetries that arise from a construction first detailed by string theorists.
