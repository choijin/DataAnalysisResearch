<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research project is to advance the understanding of physical properties of new nano-materials by applying modern mathematical techniques. The PI has new research projects, which will be attacked by using a) analytical and b) noncommutative geometric methods. This will lead to the development of new general techniques that can be applied to other fields as well. The materials stem from triply periodic constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces and their complements which form wire networks. This gives an effective theory for the Dirac equation on the CMC surface, the computation of the eigenvalue spectrum of the Laplace operator on the graph of the wire network, the probing of a previously found noncommutative/commutative duality and the study of noncommutative topological invariants and the analogue of the quantum Hall effect for the wire networks. The methods and tools that the PI will employ range from methods in noncommutative geometry, algebra and representation theory, singularity theory and differential geometry to condensed matter physics. The above projects will provide important insights from different perspectives into the mathematical and physical properties of new nanomaterials. This interdisciplinary effort brings together tools from mathematics and physics and fosters the dialogue between the two disciplines. The outcome may be useful in photovoltaics, leading to increased effectiveness of solar cells. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact aspects of this project are inherent in its educational aspects and the subject matter of the proposed research which involves several fields of physics, as well as the interdisciplinary nature between the physical and mathematical sciences. Kaufmann, holding a joint appointment in mathematics and physics, is fostering the dialogue between these two departments by discussing research projects with colleagues in both departments. She is undertaking the development of a combined math-physics course for undergraduates, a joint seminar series in math and physics, undergraduate research projects with an interdisciplinary subject and a new website as an interactive blog about questions from math and physics. This evolves from her experience in developing an interdisciplinary course as a distance learning class. The proposal has a strong outreach component. The PI plans a field day for elementary school children, a symposium for Indiana teachers as well as a semiannual lecture series for the general public. Kaufmann plans to join the Science K-12 Outreach Program at Purdue University. Kaufmann actively serves as a role model for women in mathematics and physics, and by her involvement in Women in Science and Women in Physics initiatives and outreach for women in physics. She is also supervising a minority graduate student working on a joint research project with the chemistry department at Purdue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        Understanding physical properties of new materials are at the forefront of current research. To this end, we established a complete theory for discussing the spectrum of Hamiltonians of quantum wire networks. We elucidated the behavior at singular points from the different viewpoints of singularity theory, representation theory and topology, establishing new and important results that can be used in a wider context.       One concrete goal was to understand and exploit physical properties of new materials which take the form of wire network systems forming the complements of certain triply periodic constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces. These are fascinating systems possessing a high degree of symmetry. Our prime example is the gyroid; other examples include in three dimensions the Schwarz P and D surfaces and in two dimensions the honeycomb lattice underlying graphene.        Our theoretical approach consists of reducing the wire network system to a finite graph (quotient graph) using its symmetries and defining a Harper Hamiltonian on this graph (which is a tight-binding Hamiltonian). This Hamiltonian can be studied in a commutative setting, or, when introducing a constant magnetic field, in a noncommutative setting. This analysis can be applied to a wide variety of other examples described by similar families of Hamiltonians.      Our analysis spans a variety of fields and techniques and leads to surprising results that open the way to new experimental verifications.    In a first step, we defined an abstract algebra, which consists of the Harper Hamiltonian and the symmetries of the graph in the non-commutative case.  By studying this abstract algebra mathematically, we identified a number of special points in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. In the commutative case, in turns out that some of these points are Dirac/Weyl points for the 3-d material- analogous to the Dirac/Weyl points in graphene that we rediscovered by the same method. All special points correspond to double and triple points, resp., in the spectrum of the Harper Hamiltonian.      Comparing to our other examples mentioned above, the Gyroid plays a very special role since it is the only 3-d system where these level crossing occur at isolated points.       We were able to explain the existence of all special points through the symmetries of the underlying Hamiltonian on the particular graph. These symmetries are given in terms of a regauging groupoid on the quotient graph of the underlying lattice. Using singularity theory, it is possible to explain which kind of level crossing can occur due to a theorem of Grothendieck. As already mentioned above, two of these degenerate points turn out to be analogues of the Dirac/Weyl points observed in graphene in two dimensions. Thus, our work generalizes the notion of Dirac/Weyl points in three dimensions and gives explicit criteria which can be used to determine Dirac/Weyl points.      Furthermore, still in the commutative case, we calculated Chern classes from the Berry connection in momentum space. These can be seen as topological invariants that predict the kind of level crossing that can occur. We used and expanded a new method called slicing that detects these topological charges.       We developed a new theory of local models and global constraints, characterizing all possible level crossings and deriving general constraints that restrict the possible scenarios occurring for  level crossings. This theory even allows to predict the behavior of the system under perturbations which we discussed in a specific example.        Our results were disseminated in the widest possible way, by publishing them in journal articles and presenting them at numerous conferences and workshops, both nationally and internationally.    The project funded the training and development of two graduate students- Jared Bland and Kevin Ralphs -and supported several undergraduate research projects (Brent Coburn, Justin Copenhaver and Raunaq Kumaran). One resulted in a poster in the Undergraduate Research Symposium at Purdue, another one led to a published paper.    Kaufmann also planned and organized a teacher workshop (together with the Physics outreach coordinator D. Sederberg) for teachers from economically underprivileged regions in Indiana. Kaufmann was the organizer of a joint Math-Physics seminar at Purdue, fostering the dialogue between the two departments. She spoke at several occasions for the Purdue Math Club, the Honors College at Purdue and in various career seminars in Mathematics and Physics.
