<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Janis Louie of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah.  This project focuses on the preparation of a variety of cyclic and acyclic compounds from environmentally friendly and readily available starting materials. Previously, transition metal catalysts that mediate the cycloaddition of unsaturated hydrocarbons and heterocumulenes had been developed in Professor Louie's laboratory.  This project focuses on the elucidation of the mechanism of these cycloaddition reactions  in order to develop more efficient metal-mediated reactions.  Expanding the scope of these metal catalyzed cycloaddition reactions will also be a focus.  In addition, further studies of a recently discovered important intermediate in Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions will be pursued.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Louie's research efforts revolve around the development of facile transition metal-mediated methods for the formation of cyclic and acyclic compounds.  In addition, new methods for utilizing benign starting materials will be evaluated.  Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on any area of activity in which the synthesis of molecules is needed, such as the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industry, and biological and chemical research.  In addition, this project will provide training opportunities for students from the pre-undergraduates to post-doctoral level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ High impact protocols turn readily available starting materials into value-added products in high yield by employing practical reaction conditions.  Not surprisingly, the development of these protocols begins at a fundamental level &ndash; how does one substrate react with another and what factors affect this reactivity? In our research program, we let this basic question guide our efforts to invent new scientific tools.  Specifically, the tools we design are catalysts that orchestrate the formation of new carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds, the brick-and-mortar of virtually all everyday materials.  Furthermore, the catalysts we develop rely on affordable base metals rather than expensive precious metals.  During the last granting period, we continued our efforts to develop nickel- and iron-catalyzed cycloaddition chemistry that afforded carbocycles and heterocycles effectively and efficiently.  Key to our success has been the investigation of the mechanisms of these catalytic reactions.  Understanding the reactivity of key intermediates has led to catalytic systems with increased efficiency as well as the discovery of new catalytic reactions.  In addition, our research has provided fundamental training to undergraduate and graduate students in synthetic organometallic techniques and physical organic chemistry. Our department has initiated an NSF funded Research for Undergraduates (NSF-REU) program, of which I am the chair, that centers on catalytic chemistry and collaborative science.
