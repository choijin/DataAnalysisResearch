<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER)award is to explore, characterize, and map the use of user-centric design methods and tools.  TheDesignExchange will provide a mechanism for investigators to answer questions pertaining to the motivation for the choice of and use of a particular design method for a design problem.  TheDesignExchange will offer a centralized venue where human-centered design methods will be shared, discussed and disseminated, so that the research community can then engage in research to provide explanations as to how the various methods within the design process relate to each other.  TheDesignExchange will increase researchers' understanding of structured design processes, and will also be an invaluable resource to train novice and professional engineers and designers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the outcomes of this award will result in an interactive web portal to facilitate the capture, analysis and widespread use of human-centered design methods, together with the insights as to how these methods will be best used for maximum success of the design venture.  TheDesignExchange will be powered by a multidisciplinary community contributed database, which will allow practitioners and researchers to more deeply understand the use of design methods in practice and will facilitate the exchange of information between industry and academia.  A workshop will be held in conjunction with this work at the 2012 NSF CMMI Grantees Conference. The outcomes of this workshop will form the basis of the research agenda for TheDesignExchange platform, including hypotheses for an ontology that maps human-centered design methods to real-world design problems, which will be made available to both industry and the research community.</AbstractNarration>

This seed funding EAGER grant was used to conduct workshops to develop guidelines for a larger proposal to NSF and to develop a "proof of concept" database and website.  Workshops  Two workshops were held in 2012 with a total of 50 attendees at the NSF CMMI Grantees Conference in Boston and ASMEÆs IDETC/CIE Conference in Chicago). At these workshops, the PIs and IDEO.orgÆs HCD Connect worked together to explore communication between researchers and practitioners; to identify features and functionality theyÆd find useful; and to develop a research agenda for theDesignExchange.1) Attendees were interested in how to port human-centered design methods to new disciplines, such as civil engineering. 2) Attendees were interested in the gap between theory (classroom) and practice (industry), and the lack of formalism in practice. 3) Attendees were interested in when methods/processes failed, as well as when they succeeded.  Computational Research  To develop potential method recommendation algorithms for TheDesignExchange, we began initial development using a series of 432 case studies provided by the users of HCD Connect (IDEO.org). In each of these case studies, users described a particular design problem they faced, and then listed a set of methods that they used to solve the problem. An overview of the frequency of methods used in the corpus can be seen in Fig. 1.

We expect that future research will uncover differ different content features that positively affect performance when combined with a collaborative filtering algorithm.
