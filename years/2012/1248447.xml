<AbstractNarration>The innovation proposes and develops the novel technology of micro-cloud managed Web-based peer-to-peer video streaming.  The technology promises to enable highly scalable, robust and secure Internet video streaming (including both live video and video-on-demand) at only one tenth of the cost of traditional content delivery networks (CDNs).  Video traffic is growing explosively at an annual rate of 52%.  Meanwhile, viewers place increasingly stringent requirements on their quality of experience (QoE), demanding seamless access in real time with high definition.  To handle the coming wave of Internet video traffic, the innovation offers five distinctive advantages: (1) The micro-cloud managed peer-to-peer streaming uses a set of novel algorithms to continuously optimize the per-viewer QoE in real time and can significantly outperform traditional unmanaged peer-to-peer streaming solutions (especially under stress).  (2) The technology achieves a 10x reduction in bandwidth and server resource consumption over traditional CDNs.  (3) The solution provides real-time viewer analytics and can quickly pinpoint and recover from performance bottlenecks.  (4) Unlike conventional peer-to-peer software, the solutions client library is completely Web-based. Hence it requires no software/plugin installation and works seamlessly across multiple platforms.  (5) The technology provides strong support for content protection and digital right management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact consists of the following two main aspects.  (1) Commercial impacts. The solution aims to introduce a disruptive technology in the Internet video distribution market, which is growing rapidly at an annual rate of 40.6% on revenue. The technology can benefit a broad customer base, including content distributors, social media sites, enterprises and Internet service providers. (2) Societal impacts. The availability of high-quality videos on the Internet at low cost can potentially generate significant societal impacts. Consumers who otherwise cannot afford the traditional CDN-based video delivery systems can now utilize the innovation in a wide range of societal activities including education and collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project designs and implements SplendorStream, a system based on the novel technology of ``micro-cloud managed Web P2P streaming''. SplendorStream promises to enable highly scalable, robust and secure Internet video streaming (including both live video and video-on-demand) with cost significantly lower than traditional content delivery networks (CDNs).    Intellectual merit: The core technology in SplendorStream is MicroCloud Managed Web P2P streaming to simultaneously leverage both client-side and server-side resources. On the client side, it uses Flash based Web P2P streaming to fully take advantage of client-side resources and significantly reduce cost. Different from traditional P2P, it doesn't require installation of custom software or plugin and supports cross-platform, including a variety of mobile devices. On the server side, it uses MicroCloud to manage Web P2P streaming. The MicroCloud performs smart "seeding" of initial streams and intelligentlly orchestrate the formation of P2P topology to optimize viewer experience, conducts self-diagnosis, self-healing and reduce cost. Furthermore, it performs real-time analystics and offers strong DRM support.   Broader impact: SplendorStream is now serving over 100 million video views per day, exhibiting remarkable performance and stability.  For video-on-demand services, SplendorStream saves up to 75% bandwidth cost under real-world traffic conditions, and is able to improve the smoothness of video play by 10%.  For live broadcasting, it can improve video smoothness by a factor of 3 while saving over 50% bandwidth cost.          Last Modified: 11/12/2013       Submitted by: Yin Zhang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
