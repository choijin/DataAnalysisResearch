<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to support a workshop focused on Materials by Design.  The workshop seeks to share the state-of-the-art in this area as well as identify opportunities for research advancement.  It will bring together leaders from academe and industry to identify: critical challenges in materials development, existing and emerging computational and experimental techniques that have the potential to facilitate rational materials design in new ways, and best working practices for collaborative research between industry and universities and understand how they may be exploited to facilitate materials design and the accelerated development of new materials.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will also involve identifying approaches to storing, sharing, interrogating, and using the increasingly voluminous quantities of data generated by computational and experimental materials research.  The organizers will seek the participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering by leveraging activities with their existing support programs at Brown.</AbstractNarration>

How to accelerate the pace of discovery and deployment of advanced materials was the central question addressed at thisMaterials Genome Initiative (MGI) Town Hall Meeting.  Featured speakers and panelists from industry, academia, and federal agencies explored:   New materials for automobiles, aerospace, energy conversion/storage, microelectronics, and medical devices Emergent computational and experimental approaches Strategies for sharing, storing, and searching materials data Best practices for industry/university/government collaborations   Further details of the meeting can be found at http://www.brown.edu/conference/mgi-town-meeting/   The 50th Annual Technical Meeting of the Society of Engineering Science and the Summer Technical Meeting of the Applied Mechanics Division of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers was held at Brown University July28-31, 2013.  The Society of Engineering Science (SES) Technical Meeting is held annually to foster and promote the exchange of ideas and information among the various disciplines of engineering and the fields of physics, chemistry, mathematics, bioengineering, and related scientific and engineering fields.
