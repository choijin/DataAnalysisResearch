<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the tenure of this award, the PI has given thirty-five research presentations at academic seminars, conferences, and workshops. The PI also taught two undergraduate classes, mentored two undergraduate and one graduate research projects, and taught a week-long course on tropical geometry for mathematically gifted high school students.    This project concerned the study of systems of polynomials appearing in other fields, particularly optimization and spaces of matrices.  The main mathematical impact has been the adaptation of tools from classical algebraic geometry to the study of definite determinantal representations and hyperbolic polynomials, which are important objects in the field of convex optimization. These tools help the theory be more concrete, algorithmic, and accessible to people from other fields.  Another impact of this has been the use of tools from algebra to the study of phase retrieval in finite frame theory.  This brings together two different fields of mathematics and has led to the resolution of two open questions in frame theory.   In the duration of this award, the PI has also worked to train younger mathematicians by mentoring undergraduate and graduate research projects and to disseminate mathematics more generally by giving expository talks at undergraduate math clubs as well as at a high school math summer program.
