<AbstractNarration>This award will fund experimental efforts to probe the quark transversity distributions via measurements of Collins asymmetries in mid-rapdity jets reconstructed in the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.  It will support efforts to further constrain  the gluon contribution to the spin puzzle via measurements of dijet asymmetries in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 500 GeV.  These funds will also support manpower for the installation and commissioning of the Forward Gem Tracker, the STAR detector upgrade designed to measure the parity violating asymmetries of W production that are sensitive to the flavor separated anti-up and anti-down quark spin distributions in the proton. This award provides the unique opportunity for the University of Kentucky graduate and undergraduate students to learn and develop the software tools and analysis techniques necessary for jet reconstruction, while simultaneously contributing to the installation and commissioning of a state-of-the-art detector at the world's only high-energy polarized proton collider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The protons and neutrons that serve as building blocks for our visible universe are constructed from smaller, more fundamental particles called quarks and gluons.  These point-like particles,  or partons,  are confined inside nucleons due to the nature of the strong force which governs their interactions.  Consequently, the abundant, stable and easily manipulated proton has served as an experimental  "partonic laboratory" for over half a century.  The underlying mechanisms of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the formal theory of strong interactions, are illuminated via investigations into how the proton mass, charge and spin manifest from partonic degrees of freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spin, a type of angular momentum inherent to all fundamental particles, is a purely quantum mechanical observable and therefore serves as a particularly sharp probe into the nature of QCD.  The "spin puzzle" is an outstanding question in QCD physics and can be stated simply:   How does the spin and orbital angular momentum of the quarks and gluons combine to form the total proton spin of 1/2?  Two decades of experiments have constrained the total quark spin contribution to be ~1/3 of the sum.  However, the surprisingly small value motivates experiments designed to measure the quark and gluon spin distributions and partonic orbital angular momentum pieces of the spin puzzle.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spin is a fundamental characteristic  that defines how particles interact with each other and is often exploited in everyday technology such as spintronics based memory disks and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging machines. The spin of a particle manifests as a type of angular momentum and because the total angular momentum of a system must be conserved these spin effects provide a unique view into the underlying structure of the universe.  For example, physicists have known for nearly fifty years that the protons and neutrons that serve as building blocks for our visible universe are constructed from smaller, more fundamental particles called quarks and gluons.  Yet we still don't fully understand how the spin of the quarks and gluons combine to produce the spin of the proton.  This award provided support for the Kentucky RHIC Spin group, consisting of the principal investigator, three graduate and two undergraduate students, to pursue proton spin structure measurements at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  RHIC is the only facility in the world capable of accelerating and colliding the high energy polarized proton beams necessary to perform these experiments. The Kentucky group used clusters of particles, called jets, to measure asymmetries sensitive to the gluon and quark spin distributions inside the proton.  The spin program at RHIC was the first to measure a significant gluon contribution to the spin of the proton. The Kentucky group continued this effort by pushing these measurements into a regime where the density of gluons inside the proton is rapidly increasing. The new findings tell a very similar story, that  as much as a third of the proton spin appears to come from the gluon polarization.   In addition to gluon studies the Kentucky group pioneered measurements that are sensitive to the way transversely polarized quarks fragment into the particles we observe in our detectors. These signals clearly show that the spatial pattern of the final state particles is correlated with the initial direction of the quark spin!  This type of correlation was first discovered in electron-proton and electron-positron collisions,  but  has never been isolated and extracted in proton-proton collisions. These measurements provide critical information about how this spin dependent fragmentation process changes with the nature and energy of the colliding beams.  The broader impacts resulting from this funding are the exposure and education of students from the middle-school through the post-graduate level to fundamental nuclear physics.
