<AbstractNarration>The development of a cell occurs in a complicated context of multiple interacting factors from the molecular and subcellular levels to the external environment of the cell. In addition to their well-established role in neuronal communication, classical neurotransmitters are also involved in aspects of the development of neuronal cells (neurons). Experiments in this project address how the development and neuronal geometry of complex amine neurons depend on the localization and distribution of the neurotransmitter octopamine, in combination with surrounding extracellular matrix components and how these altered neurons affect aggressive behavior. This project utilizes cutting-edge genetic tools with classical mutational analysis available in the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to determine how the morphology of neurons is affected by altered octopamine levels and extracellular matrix components. The outcomes of these experiments will significantly contribute to understanding how the individual microenvironment modulates the development, circuit connectivity and function of neuronal cells that form during embryogenesis and affect the behavior of an animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will increase the exposure of Montana K-6 students' to science and scientific research through the creation of an engaging science podcast designed for second-sixth grade classrooms which will be shared with public schools across the state. The podcast integrates this research on Drosophila neuronal development and aggression into a visually stimulating presentation to promote learning and spark students' interest in science. In addition to the podcast, live specimens of different Drosophila life cycle and developmental stages will be sent to the classrooms, as the inclusion of living examples provides a significant hands-on learning component solidifying the video information into a fun and memorable experience. In addition to receiving research training and mentoring, graduate students involved in this research will participate in local elementary school presentations to demonstrate aspects of their research. These interactions provide a meaningful experience to build the student?s own scientific presentation skills and engage the public at an elementary school level.</AbstractNarration>

Therefore, cell-cell communication is a critical aspect of neuron development and the generation of synaptic connections in any system. Using <em>Drosophila </em>as a model system, we tested the impact of cell communication surrounding the microenvironment of a specific set of neurons, the octopamine-expressing neurons. Octopamine (OA) neurons are complex in their morphology, they extend projections over virtually the entire brain, and in their function as they modulate many key behaviors including sleep, aggression, and reproductive behaviors. We focused on two key players, first the octopamine neurotransmitter itself and second, a matricellular gene named dCCN. As a neurotransmitter, octopamine is released from one neuron and signals to a downstream neuron via diffusion or at the synaptic cleft.

Specifically, a subset of incoming neurons extended past their octopamine-neuron target and terminated elsewhere in the insect brain. This result is compelling as it demonstrates a cell-cell communication role for this neurotransmitter not just in sending signals but in neuron differentiation and in receiving signals.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we are one of the first groups to examine the role of the matricellular protein, dCCN, and test if the architecture of complex OA neurons is also regulated by amine-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions.

We first examined the expression pattern of dCCN and found it is co-expressed in a subset of octopamine and dopamine-expressing neurons. Interestingly we also determined that dCCN is expressed in sex-specific neurons, i.e. neurons that express male-specific proteins. As matricellular proteins are not known to have sex-specific expression patterns, this is a key finding. To follow up on this result and our hypothesis, we generated mutations in <em>dCCN</em>. Importantly, a loss of dCCN does not result in neuron death, however a loss of dCCN does result in sex-specific phenotypes namely female sterility and a significant reduction in male aggression. The results of these experiments are significant because they examined amine neuron development and communication from the internal aspect of a neuron &ndash; release of a neurotransmitter- and from the external &ndash;the surrounding extracellular matrix.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/23/2018<br>      Modified by: Sarah&nbsp;Certel</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257730/1257730_10249357_1527110107177_NSFgrantReportFigure2dCCNexpressioncopy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257730/1257730_10249357_1527110107177_NSFgrantReportFigure2dCCNexpressioncopy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Drosophila CCN expression in the CNS and sex-specific neurons"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257730/1257730_10249357_1527110107177_NSFgrantReportFigure2dCCNexpressioncopy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Drosophila CCN expression in the CNS and sex-specific neurons"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Drosophila dCCN-Gal4 expression in the adult brain (top) and in the adult male brain showing sex-specific expression in fruitless neurons.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jessica Bailey, Sarah Certel</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarah&nbsp;Certel</div> <div class="imageTitle">Drosophila CCN expression in the CNS and sex-specific neurons</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
