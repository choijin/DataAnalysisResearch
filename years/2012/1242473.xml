<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for conference support for approximately 29 undergraduate students (out of a total of 135) attending the fall meeting of the Divisions of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society, in East Lansing, MI (October 26-29, 2011).  It is the 14th annual Conference Experience for Undergraduates (CEU).  The CEU is a natural venue for students who have had an undergraduate research experience to present the results of their work and interact with other students as well as faculty and senior researchers.  CEU has been immensely successful in fostering this interaction, which helps students to have a broad introduction and exposure to research across nuclear physics, and to enable senior researchers to get to know some of the junior future leaders.</AbstractNarration>

The CEU12  was held in October 2012 in conjunction with the fall meeting of the  Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society in Newport  Beach, CA.  A total of 130 undergraduate students participated in CEU12, and events  specifically arranged for them included a research poster session, two  nuclear physics seminars, a graduate school fair, and a social  gathering.  Travel award decisions were made on the basis of project merit, and students submitted a research abstract and a personal contribution statement in order to be considered.  A team of 5 DNP members served on the review committee, and their recommendations were used to determine the awards distribution.  A survey  was  A survey is administered to participants after the conference is over.  Students benefit from interacting with professionals in the  field of nuclear physics, and several report on being favorably motivated to consider pursuing an advanced degree in nuclear physics more so than before they attended the conference.   Members of the DNP are very supportive of the undergraduates' presence at the meeting, and several spend time recruiting students for their graduate programs.
