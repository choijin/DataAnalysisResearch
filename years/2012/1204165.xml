<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2012 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. These fellowships support a research and training plan at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to KeerthiShyam MadapusiSampath is "Integral models for Shimura varieties of abelian type (especially ones attached to Spin groups); their compactifications; applications of these models to arithmetic problems." The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Benedict Gross.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding for this project was very helpful to me as an early career researcher. I obtained this fellowhip in the second year of my post-doctoral work. It helped me take a year off from my teaching responsibilities, and as a result I could travel and disseminate my work, helping to establish my credentials in the field early on.     The main focus of the project---and one which was unexpected when I had applied for it---was a class of certain objects called K3 surfaces: These are special kinds of spaces defined by polynomial equations, which have many miraculous properties. One of the more important results of the project was the verification of a conjecture of John Tate for such spaces.  Here is a short explanation of this conjecture: As in much of mathematics, one finds that simple definitions can lead very quickly to very complicated objects, and then one is led to a natural question: How do you tell if two such objects are secretly the same? One way to answer this question is to derive certain qualities of such objects (known as 'invariants') that can help distinguish one from another, much as one might be able to tell two people apart by the shape of their silhouettes.  The Tate conjecture predicts that objects defined by polynomial equations (known as algebraic varieties) can be distinguished by a relatively simpler invariant attached to them, called 'l-adic cohomology'. This is a vast generalization of the familiar idea from topology that one can tell a donut from a ball by the number of holes they have.   Although the conjecture dates back to the 60s, there has been very little progress towards it in any reasonable generality. My results on K3 surfaces (and several partial results that preceded them) essentially represent the state of the art on this front. It will certainly be intriguing to see if there are new directions that might illuminate the question further.
