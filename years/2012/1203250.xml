<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to ensure continuation of UV observations at Barrow and Summit over the period 1-August 2012 ? 31-July 2015. These data include spectra of solar spectral irradiance between 280 and 600 nm, biologically effective dose-rates, total ozone, surface albedo, cloud optical depth, actinic flux, and photolysis rates for common reactions such as the photolysis of O3 and NO2.  All data are made available via ACADIS, WOUDC, and NDACC.  At Barrow, several key parameters affecting UV radiation such as snow cover and sea ice extent are changing rapidly. Extension of the climate data record (CDR) will provide a unique opportunity to study the effect of a changing environment on UV radiation. Measurements at Summit are ideally suited to probe the free troposphere and study the effects of long-range transport of pollutants and aerosols on UV radiation.  The key intellectual merit of the proposed project centers on acquiring data that can be used to advance knowledge (1) of the present and future solar radiation climate of the Arctic and (2) of the factors that drive changes in the UV radiation. For example, by combining UV data with other measurements and modeling, parameterizations can be developed to predict future UV intensities and improve climate models (e.g., CCMs). Analysis of the long UV data record from Barrow will also help answering the ?SEARCH Question? whether the Arctic is moving to a new state. UV data are of importance for other AON projects and augment their intellectual merit. The broader impacts of this activity are to provide data to researchers in various disciplines, including satellite ground truthing, and to educators for use in science courses and curricula.  The PIs intend to continue contributing to the NOAA Arctic Report Card and integrating the data into non-major courses at the university.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun that penetrates the atmosphere and reaches the EarthÃ†s surface has wide-reaching consequences for humans as well as terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  Human exposure to UV radiation can cause sunburn, cataracts, and skin cancer, but has also beneficial effects such as the synthesis of Vitamin D in the skin.  The objective of this project was to continue accurate long-term measurements of UV radiation at two Arctic locations, Summit Station (Image 1) and Barrow (Image 2).  Measurements at Summit, in the center of the Greenland ice sheet, started in 2004.  Barrow is located close to the northern-most point of Alaska with measurements starting in 1991. During the period of this project, a large spike in UV radiation was documented in the spring of 2011 when an "ozone hole" was observed over the Arctic for the first time.  At Summit, the UV Index (a measure of the ability of UV radiation to cause sunburn) was increased by up to 50% in March of 2011 compared to the long-term average.  Measurements from the two sites were also used to validate surface UV radiation estimates from satellite measurements.   This research revealed large systematic errors (up to 50%) in the satellite-derived UV data record because of the difficulty to distinguish between snow and clouds from space.  Measurements at Summit were found to be ideally suited to detect temporal drifts and systematic errors in satellite data because of the small effect of clouds at this site.  Analysis of the 20+ year data record at Barrow uncovered a large negative trend for October, which was attributed to changes in the onset of snow cover during fall, highlighting the importance of climatic factors on the Arctic UV radiation environment.  The project also supported training of undergraduate physical science majors and the general education of non-science students at the University of Chicago.
