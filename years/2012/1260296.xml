<AbstractNarration>The marine biological pump is one of the primary pathways via which anthropogenic carbon dioxide may be sequestered from the atmosphere and exported to the deep ocean as organic carbon.  While the link between nutrient supply and high primary productivity in upwelling regions is well established, factors controlling the organic carbon export efficiency of upwelling ecosystems are not well known.  Scientists from the University of Southern California and Pomona College plan to determine the factors that control the rates and magnitudes of two components of biological production, Net Community Production (NCP) and Gross Primary Production (GPP), as well as particulate organic carbon export efficiency, at the San Pedro Ocean Time Series, a coastal site in the California Borderland during periods of minimal and high upwelling velocity over a 2-year span.  At this site, past and ongoing observations of hydrography and carbon rain will provide an historical context for interpreting results and mechanisms at work.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rates of NCP and GPP will be quantified at different upwelling intensity, using dissolved oxygen to argon (O2/Ar) ratios and the oxygen triple isotope composition of dissolved oxygen (O2).  The export of organic carbon will be established using 234Th (thorium) profiles in the water column, coupled with floating sediment trap deployments, and the development of a carbon isotope balance for the water column.  Upwelling will be characterized using non-steady state budgets for atmospheric 7Be (beryllium) input and its depth-integrated decay, as well as estimating rates based on remote measurements of wind stress curl and budgets for dissolved inorganic carbon and silicon. Application of the O2/Ar ratio and the oxygen triple isotope approach will require depth-integrated profiles of these tracers to evaluate the impact of upwelling on mixed layer inputs and use of non-steady state models during seasonal transitions in upwelling.  The comprehensive data set to be obtained should provide insights into the organic carbon export efficiency under variable upwelling regimes and help to relate the satellite-based measurements of chlorophyll to the organic carbon export of these highly productive ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  One graduate and one undergraduate student from the University of Southern California and two undergraduate students from Pomona College would be supported and trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding the details of these dynamics is important in predicting the response of global ocean to perturbations in atmospheric CO2 that are being caused by human activities: close to a third of anthropogenic CO2 has been sequestered by the oceans yet the capacity of the oceans to further sequestration is unknown.  Only a fraction of the carbon fixed through photosynthesis is exported, as most is rapidly recycled in the surface ocean. The exported fraction escaping in situ recycling determines the efficiency of the biological pump. This efficiency is often quantified as Net to Gross production ratio, N/G (= net carbon fixed and exported)/gross rate of photosynthesis).

Data was collected during the upwelling seasons (Jan-June) of 2013 and 2014.  Tracers used include the following isotopes: 7Be balance to determine upwelling; 18O/16O and 17O/16O ratios to determine gross production; 234Th balances and short-term floating sediment traps to determine export of particulate carbon (net production), as well as O2/Ar ratios that reflect net biological O2 production. These tracers integrate over the timescale of weeks, the same timescale as biological bloom evolution. A model that incorporated the time-varying dynamics of upwelling was developed for interpreting the data to account for the transport terms critical in the oxygen budgets of the upwelling regimes.
