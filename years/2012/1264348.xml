<AbstractNarration>1264348 &lt;br/&gt;Senger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to produce new technologies that will enable the synthesis of valuable commodity chemicals and pharmaceuticals from microbes.  These engineered microbes are commonly called ?microbial chemical factories,? and they are now enabling the biological production of valuable chemicals that have traditionally been obtained through oil refining.  The emerging field of synthetic biology is enabling the construction of new metabolic pathways, and this is rapidly broadening the scope of chemicals that can be produced by microbial cell factories.  In this research, a novel de novo pathway to 2-pyrrolidone will be produced and optimized.  This valuable target chemical is used to produce over 700 differently substituted pyrrolidones that have uses ranging from ?green? solvents to pharmaceuticals.  The new de novo pathway to 2-pyrrolidone will be constructed using a model-guided platform involving molecular docking and dynamics simulations in order to engineer existing enzymes to work with non-native substrates to ultimately produce 2-pyrrolidone.  This research will also develop a model-guided platform for installing this de novo pathway in a microbial host and ensure the pathway is highly utilized.  In this case, the bacterium Clostridium cellulolyticum H10 will be used as the host.  This organism is of interest due to its ability to consume cellulosic plant material as a substrate, ensuring the resulting production of 2-pyrrolidone will be renewable and ultimately cost-efficient.  To ensure high usage of the 2-pyrrolidone de novo pathway, metabolic engineering strategies will be developed through a new technique involving an established method of ?genome-scale metabolic flux modeling.?  While this project will engineer a strain of C. cellulolyticum H10 to produce 2-pyrrolidone from cellulose, the tools developed in this project will apply broadly.  Ultimately, this toolset will help enable the production of any targeted chemical from any host cell.  These developments will have profound impacts by (i) transitioning the origin of many vital commodity chemicals and pharmaceuticals from non-renewable oil refining to renewable production from sources such as plant material and sunlight, (ii) dramatically increasing the role of the biotechnology industry in the commodity chemicals market, and (iii) stimulating new startup ventures related to commodity chemicals and pharmaceutical production through synthetic biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ New discoveries in the emerging field of metabolic engineering were made in this project as bacteria cells were genetically engineered to produce advanced pyrrolidones from sustainable resources.  Pyrrolidones are critical chemicals to several industries (including the electronic and pharmaceutical industries), but they do not have a sustainable route of production.  In addition, several key pyrrolidone molecules are not made naturally by living organisms (including microbes and plants).  Thus, the overall goal of this research project was to engineer the production of pyrrolidones by bacteria cells by altering the function of several cellular enzymes.  While key breakthroughs in achieving this goal were reported, several new enabling technologies were developed that are expected to have wide-reaching applications.  First, a new screen for beneficial genetic mutations in bacteria was developed.  The technique involves the use of laser-assisted Raman spectroscopy and can be automated with robotics to analyze millions of bacteria cells in search for one with desired genetic mutations that enable pyrrolidone production.  It is possible that this technique can not only help with pyrrolidone production but that it can be applied to screen for cells producing any desired product.  This has broad implications in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.  Second, a new technique for DNA assembly (called lambda-PCR) was developed in this research.  It allows for custom assembly of DNA plasmids and long sequences without the traditional tools used to cut/paste DNA.  Lambda-PCR is fast, inexpensive, precise, and out-performs many commercial products for DNA assembly.  This new tool will reduce the time and laboratory resources associated with genetic engineering, and it can be used by every lab involved in this area.  When factoring in laboratory technician time, the potential cost savings are very high.  Finally, the use of small RNA (sRNA) molecules in metabolic engineering was developed further in this research.  It has been shown that sRNA molecules can be used to redirect metabolism in a cell, ideally toward target product formation.  It was believed these sRNA molecules could only work by inhibiting the formation of certain enzymes.  sRNA molecules were engineered in this project to enhance the formation of target enzymes, giving metabolic engineers ways to further increase the cellular use of product forming pathways, while minimizing the use of competing pathways.  As with the other technologies described here, this new use of sRNA molecules has broad applicability to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.    In addition to the technical achievements of this project, several future biological engineers were trained by this project.  In particular, four PhD students and eight undergraduate students received comprehensive laboratory training under this project.  This project also enabled outreach to high school students at the Virginia Governor's School for Science and Technology.  One module was taught on their campus, and students were invited to Virginia Tech to learn about the field of metabolic engineering.  This project also enabled the creation of two software applications that are shared freely under an MIT licensing agreement.  The first is related to using Raman spectroscopy to analyze living cells and the second is related to using computations to design genetic engineering strategies for bacteria used in biotechnology.
