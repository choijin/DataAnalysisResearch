<AbstractNarration>Funds are requested to help support the Material Measurement Symposium to be held at the Materials Research Society Spring Meeting in San Francisco, California, April 9-13, 2012.  The funds requested will be used to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending the meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Material Measurement Symposium will consist more than 100 conference papers, including 15 invited talks, 58 contributed talks, and more than 30 contributed posters over 15 technical sessions (13 oral and 2 poster). The focus of the symposium is on emerging characterization techniques that hold the promise the help reveal the microscopic mechanisms underpinning the performance and life time of energy storage and conversion systems. This symposium will bring together scientists and engineers across various disciplines to address the most challenging issues in characterizing materials and energy systems in transient and nonequilibrium states.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The project supports the Material Measurement Symposium Materials Research Society Spring Meeting 2012; San Francisco, California; 9-13 April 2012, which is one of the biggest annual conferences in the research community.  The Material Measurement Symposium was consisted of 123 conference papers, including 15 invited talks, 58 contributed talks, and more than 50 contributed posters over 15 technical sessions (13 oral and 2 poster).

Selected technical papers in the symposium will be published as MRS conference proceedings, which will be electronically archived in MRS publication sites and indexed in the Scientific Citation Index and searchable by Web of Science.  The symposium has showcased the research frontiers in local probing techniques and in situ measurements in materials sciences and significant advances in understanding material behaviors in energy harvesting and storage systems as well as their performance optimization, safety analysis, failure diagnosis, and lifetime prediction.  The symposium has included reports on the development and implementation of in situ techniques such as scanning probe, microscopy, spectroscopy, tomography, scattering, activation, and radiation measurements, which are capable of addressing fundamental mechanisms in materials synthesis, process and applications.
