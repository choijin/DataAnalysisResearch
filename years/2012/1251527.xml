<AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Almeida Jacqueline Toribio at the University of Texas, Robyn Wright will study a stigmatized variant in Madrid Spanish, nonstandard syllable-final /s/, examining its use in social interaction in the creation of meaning. A transmedial approach will be taken, incorporating various types of language data, including oral production, written production in computer-mediated communication (CMC) and perception, or language attitudes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oral data is gathered through interviews with 50 native Madrid residents, aiming to discover the discourse contexts in which the nonstandard variant arises, whether certain topics trigger its use, and finally whether the contexts of variant use change according to social categories. The CMC data complements the oral data, providing insight into how Madrileños perform nonstandard /s/ through orthographic representations of the nonstandard variant (&lt;g&gt; or &lt;j&gt;, e.g., &lt;Ejpaña&gt;). The content and context in which nonstandard representations appear online will be examined, as well as the correlations in date with important events in Spanish/Madrileño society. Finally, the language attitudes data complete the study, providing an analysis, based on matched-guise survey data from over 300 Spanish participants, of the perception of nonstandard /s/ and the identities assigned to speakers that use it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation provides an example of how a transmedial approach to research and analysis can provide a fuller understanding of the social significance behind particular variants. It contributes an analysis of how nonstandard /s/ is used to create social meaning in the Madrid dialect and furthermore will present a phonetic analysis of nonstandard /s/, which has not been clearly established in antecedent work. The written CMC data and language attitudes data are new contributions to the study of nonstandard /s/ in Madrid and will provide a more complete picture of the social meaning and identities associated with the variable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This dissertation investigates phonetic variation in syllable-final /s/ within the Spanish of Madrid. The project aims to discover how speakers use this variable in the construction of social meaning and identify the socio-indexical attributes associated with nonstandard /s/, particularly the velarized variant (e.g., es que pronounced as [ex.ke]). The three bodies of data gathered for this project include computer-mediated communication samples, oral speech through sociolinguistic interviews and perception through language attitudes surveys.  The first body of data comprised a qualitative study of the orthographic representations of nonstandard /s/ in which Madrile&ntilde;os were found to purposefully write "s" as "g" or "j", such as "Egpa&ntilde;a" or "ej que", in various internet sources. The patterns found suggest that the nonstandard orthographic representation carried conflicting levels of prestige, both negatively as a satirical criticism of non-progressive "backwards" politics and ideas as well as positively as a marker of local authenticity and pride.  In order to corroborate these findings with oral production data, over 24 hours of speech were recorded by means of group sociolinguistic interviews with 50 Madrile&ntilde;o participants.

The broader impacts of this study include an example of how linguistic prejudice is certainly present, although perhaps not always consciously, in our everyday lives, significantly affecting our perception of others.
