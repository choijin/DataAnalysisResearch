<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;SRI International and the California School-Age Consortium seek to explore whether computer science afterschool activities in single-sex settings are more effective than computer science afterschool activities in co-ed settings. The research involves 25 after school sites, each with approximately 30 minority girls and boys randomly assigned to a single-sex male environment, single-sex female environment, or coeducational environment. The PI uses the Build IT curriculum developed with prior NSF funding in all three research conditions based on the high impact and appeal of the Build IT units to engage girls and boys in scientific discovery. The PI approaches this work by paying close attention to and use of culturally relevant instructional materials, providing role models, addressing stereotype threats, encouraging effort-focused mindsets, and training in equity for staff. The research questions are (1) Does a computing curriculum that was effective for African American and Latina girls in an afterschool organization focused on serving girls have equal benefits for girls when grouped in a single-sex or coed environment? (2) Do boys benefit from the curriculum and, if so, do they benefit more from single-sex or coed environments? (3) What individual differences  the backgrounds (e.g. parental support, cultural stereotypes) of boys and girls; characteristics (e.g. gender, race, culture), and technology experiences prior to program, regardless of setting impact attitudes towards and understanding of computer science? (4) To what extent do facilitators implement gender-equitable practices and which of these practices inhibit or promote the interest of girls and boys in and understanding of computer science?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI employs a rigorous experimental design that uses Eccles' expectancy-value model as the theoretical framework. Eccles' expectancy-value model assesses attitudinal changes and conceptual understandings as well as encourages African American and Latina students to pursue STEM learning and careers.  It describes how key socializers such as parents, teachers, peers, role models, and afterschool facilitators can shape the attitudes of girls and boys toward their future success.  It also highlights the support youth need to see STEM as part of their identity to pursue STEM goals. A train-the-trainer approach to professional development supports 25 facilitators and their managers on the use of the Build IT curriculum. All trainers, facilitators, and managers participate in Build IT professional development offerings that include strategies for working with boys and girls in the various environments. The intervention allows low SES students to build information technology fluency through design and exploration of IT careers, become more innovative with technology as entrepreneurial environmental engineers, and delve in computational thinking. The expected outcome is that this research will shed light on when single-sex and coeducation works and for whom.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Single-sex settings are increasingly used in afterschool to address the needs of boys and girls, particularly those of African American and Latino/a backgrounds. This is particularly true in computer science and information technology (IT) fields, where women and certain minority groups are still underrepresented and STEM afterschool programs are being used to reach these groups in innovative ways.  The purpose of the Gender Equity in Afterschool Computer Science: An Impact Study of Single-Sex and Coeducational Settings (GEACS) study was to investigate the impacts of using a computing curriculum in afterschool single-sex and coeducational settings to encourage African American and Latino/a youth to pursue computer science and information technology learning and careers.  A randomized experimental design was used to compare all-boys, all-girls, and coeducational environments at 25 afterschool organizations using Build IT, a curriculum shown to increase African American and Latina girlsÆ IT fluency, interest in mathematics and computer science, and knowledge of IT careers.  We hypothesized that if educators used the equity practices that we provided in the curriculum, professional development, and Equity Guide, the settings of single sex and co-ed would show similar results.  While our findings with regard to these hypotheses were inconclusive, girls in all girls and girls in co-ed both showed benefits from the curriculum. For boys, we were unable to detect a statistically significant difference between all boy and co-ed conditions for Unit 1. However, for Unit 5, our findings showed a statistically significant difference wherein boys in a co-ed condition did much better than in an all-boys condition.
