<AbstractNarration>The Brockport Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science (BPMACS) Scholars Program - Completing Their Degrees provides 28 to 32 scholarships of up to $5400 each year to juniors, seniors and Master's degree students in the fields of physics, mathematics and computer science.  An important emphasis of the program is to ensure that BPMACS scholars complete their degrees in a timely fashion. Scholars in the current BPMACS program have achieved 98% college-wide retention and on-time graduation rates, and it is the goal of the new program to match this success rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cadre of STEM professionals from the three participating departments of Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics administers the program, supported with the full backing of an involved administration.  The seven academic members of the Program Board are committed to recruit a diverse applicant pool for the program. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the program is strengthened by strong academic programs of the three STEM departments involved and by the requirement that student awardees are maintain a 3.0 GPA out of 4.0 in their major and overall each semester.  The team administering the program consists of two mathematicians, three computer scientists, and two physicists and includes the chairs of all three participating departments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program achieves broader impacts through the large number (85 - 90) of STEM scholars it anticipates to graduate, its collaborative relationship with the Empire State STEM Hub, its focus on minority and female recruitment and awardees, its financial support for student research presentations at regional and national professional meetings and its interface to college/industry forums through its series of invited STEM lectures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Brockport Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science Scholars Program "Completing their Degrees on Time"(BPMACS) was set up to provide about 20 - 25 $5400 scholarships per year to juniors, seniors and MA students majoring in the fields of physics, mathematics and computer science at The College at Brockport, State University of New York.  The primary objective of the program was to recruit, select and award scholarships to up to 25 talented but economically disadvantaged juniors, seniors and graduate students per year in the designated fields.  The second objective, as indicated in the title of our program, was to strongly encourage and financially support the students in ?completing their degrees? on time. Before the original BPMACS program, many of our students were forced to temporarily leave school for financial reasons; some never returned.  A final diversity objective was to achieve 10% minority awards and 50% female awards across the three fields.  The grant partially achieved these diversity objectives with 15% minority awards and 35% female awards.  Concerning the primary objective of the grant: of the 98 students that have been supported by the program, 84 have already completed their degrees, and 10 are continuing their studies in a STEM field and are expected to graduate within a semester.  We lost only 4 students who transferred to another university, but presumably in a STEM field.  Even the expected 94 (84 +10) out of our remaining 98 students yields a 96% anticipated graduation rate of students supported by our program, matching the goal of 95% graduation indicated in our proposal.  The "Completing their Degrees on Time" part of the title of the grant has been achieved.                Last Modified: 03/10/2019       Submitted by: Sanford S Miller]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
