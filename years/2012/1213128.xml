<AbstractNarration>Future scientific and technological efforts to achieve better understanding of oceans and water-related applications will rely heavily on our ability to jointly consider communications, actuation and sensing in a unified system that includes instruments, vehicles, human operators and sensors of all types. The goals of this project are to design networking tools for mobile underwater networks, develop novel navigation mechanisms for communication-constrained autonomous underwater vehicles and to ultimately integrate sensing and classification to provide solutions for the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to development of underwater communication methods with applications to science, security, and industry in the areas of environmental monitoring, aquatic eco-system analysis, ocean accident remediation, surveillance for defense applications, homeland security, oil and gas, aquaculture, geological and oceanographic science, and marine biology. It will also contribute to the training of new information technology professionals and scientists with expertise in interdisciplinary research spanning underwater networks, oceanography and computer science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the Exploration and Exploitation in Actuated Communication Networks project was to design networking tools for mobile underwater networks, develop novel navigation mechanisms for communication constrained autonomous underwater vehicles and to ultimately couple in sensing and classification to provide solutions for the exploration&shy;/exploitation tradeoff.   We have successfully investigated a number of solutions to tracking vehicles and objects, integrating in the limitations of underwater acoustic communications for underwater robotic nodes and using novel methods from speech analysis to sonar signal interpretation.    We highlight some of the latter contributions to show how they will have an impact in electrical engineering and other disciplines.   Function maximization arises ubiquitously in many applications such as source localization, target detection, and classification in a broader discipline, for example, monitory of drug concentration after injection in biology, and climate tracking in meteorology. The fundamental problem is to localize the peak from an array of data in the absence of parametric information of the underlying signal. Our greedy type approach exploits a unimodal property of the underlying signal for peak localization, and thus can be applied to those disciplines where the unimodal property commonly holds.  Source localization has many applications in other fields, such as medical imaging and epidemiology. There are usually no parametric models for tumor tissue distribution or disease propagation. In addition, data collected for localization of tumor tissue or disease source may be scarce. Our source localization methods, which exploit sparse signal processing techniques and generic characteristics, such as unimodality, of the source, may have impact here.  Target detection is an equally ubiquitous high&shy;level approximation to many problems in imaging protocol design and low-rank structures arise naturally from separable fields and bilinear constraints for partially known representation dictionaries. For example, Magnetic Resonance Imaging systems try to achieve small sample complexity while maintaining path continuity over k&shy;space, akin to navigational constraints for active target detection with sample complexity constraints. Our hierarchical sampling and partial reconstruction strategies may be applicable to such problems.  Our results have much wider impact beyond the underwater vehicle based systems that we study.
