<AbstractNarration>For approximately nine months of each year, the waters of arctic lakes are under ice. The PI proposes to carry out time series studies: &lt;br/&gt;1) to quantify physical controls on under ice thermal structure and circulation, mixing of snow melt waters, mixing during spring and fall, &lt;br/&gt;2) to quantify respiration rates in arctic lakes of differing morphology and on different geological substrates, and &lt;br/&gt;3) to illustrate the linkages and feedbacks between these physical and biogeochemical processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measurements will include temperature and conductivity, meteorology, sediment temperatures, ice thickness, snow cover, and respiration with newly developed oxygen and pCO2 sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lakes cover nearly half the land surface area in some parts of the Arctic.  As such, they are expected to have a significant impact on the atmospheric bottom boundary layer and air-land gas exchange regionally.  This project will begin to provide the process understanding necessary to parameterize Arctic system models on regional scales.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Arctic lakes are ice-covered at least nine months of the year. Due to the difficulties of working in the Arctic in winter, little is known about the conditions in the lakes under the ice. With this project, we took advantage of new high resolution sensors to characterize the temperatures, solute concentrations, and distributions of oxygen so critical for persistence of organisms such as fish and zooplankton.  Not surprisingly, temperatures are cold, generally between 0oC and 4oC, with the warmest temperatures near the bottom since 4oC is the temperature of maximum density of freshwater. In contrast to ice free conditions when sun and wind energize lakes from the surface, in winter flows are initiated by the sediments.  They warm the overlying water and via the density increases, generate downslope flows. Similarly, the bacteria in the sediments respire organic matter, that is, material such as decaying phytoplankton or sedimented leaves that flowed in from the streams in spring and summer.  Respiration generates salts which also increase density causing downslope flow. These downward flowing currents are depleted in oxygen and enriched in CO2 such that the warmest water, highest concentrations of CO2, and water with lowest concentration of oxygen pools at depth in the lakes.     Whether the lower water column becomes depleted in oxygen, that is, anoxic, and unsuitable for fish, depends on whether any processes cause upward flows under the ice. If anoxia forms under the ice, we found that methane, a climate forcing trace gas eight times more potent than CO2, accumulates and can be mixed to the surface in the ice free period and evade to the atmosphere.  On a worldwide basis, lakes contribute significant quantities of climate forcing trace gases to the atmosphere. The quantity produced under the ice in arctic lakes had been unknown, but the quantity emitted in summer was computed to be a significant fraction of the terrestrial carbon budget. Our calculations indicate the quantity of CO2 produced is two or more times greater than that which evades in summer, indicating respiration under the ice contributes appreciably to the carbon budget of arctic lakes.  The value of research from one or a few lakes is increased when the results are generalized to other lakes.  To determine the extent of fish habitat, the presence of thermals under the ice which can keep phytoplankton in suspension such that they become productive with increased light and food for recently hatched zooplankton or larval fish, and the contributions of lakes to regional carbon cycles requires deciphering the mechanisms that enable upwards flow in winter, assessing how basin morphometry and wind moderate mixing in spring and fall, and quantifying controls on retention of incoming snowmelt enriched in dissolved organic carbon. It also requires quantifying turbulence, which allows oxygen to flow into lakes and climate forcing trace gases to evade.  Our project has focused on these goals with analysis of existing data and by modeling using three dimensional hydrodynamic models.  For example, we have shown that cooling of lakes in fall involves four interacting hydrodynamic processes. These are not included accurately in today?s three dimensional hydrodynamic models. We are working with modelers for improvement. We have shown that the primary mechanism thought to cause mixing in spring is blocked in arctic lakes by the increased solutes which build up under the ice from respiration and incoming snowmelt.  Thus, mixing at ice off is mediated by internal waves, an inefficient process. In small lakes, the mixing is made more difficult by the density contrasts from melting ice.  Consequently, anoxia persists along with some of the climate forcing trace gases.   Scaling using dimensionless indices, which incorporate mixing mechanisms with a few easily measured variables, enables extension of our findings to other lakes. We have developed algorithms using basic meteorological measurements to quantify turbulence near the surface and in the water column.  Our testing in arctic and boreal lakes and ponds has found the equations to be robust.  As these new equations are used in our studies and in those from other regions, estimates of the contribution of lakes to the climate system will be improved. Further improvement will be made as our descriptions of the dominant hydrodynamic processes operative in fall, winter and spring are added to hydrodynamic models including the processes operative in the sediments.  The approaches we have used in lakes in the Alaskan Arctic are being extended via collaborations to lakes in arctic and subarctic Canada, Sweden, Finland and Russia.  Our project has contributed and is continuing to contribute to training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars at those sites.  Via this extensive network, we are posed for a deeper understanding of how hydrodynamics moderates the environment in which organisms live and grow under the ice, the metabolism of arctic lakes, and regional carbon cycles.
