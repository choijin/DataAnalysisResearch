<AbstractNarration>Although much of the world's biodiversity exists in the rainforest canopy, little is known about the factors that maintain that diversity or cause it to vary across the landscape.  Quantifying such factors is important because the structure of tropical forests is rapidly changing.  In particular, the abundance of one major canopy component " lianas (woody vines) " is increasing due to disturbance and climate change.  Because lianas physically connect neighboring trees, changes in their abundance should affect the distribution, behavior, and diversity of non-flying animals that live in the canopy. This project tests that hypothesis in Panama by creating a large-scale experiment in which lianas are added or removed from some forest plots and not from others. The project focuses on the response of ants because they are conspicuous, abundant, and play important ecological roles in forests.  The research specifically addresses three interrelated questions.  First, how does the physical connectivity provided by lianas affect ant diversity in tree crowns?  Second, do lianas help restore canopy ant communities in forests that have been cut or otherwise disturbed? Finally, do different ant species prefer to use different types of lianas, and why?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tropical rainforests are the world's best classroom for studying biodiversity, and this project provides outstanding opportunities for students at the University of Louisville to gain valuable first-hand research experience in an international setting.  Likewise, local K-12 teachers will collect data in Panama while developing curricula on rainforest conservation for use during the school year.  Because the field site is a popular tourist destination, the project provides a unique opportunity for participants to interact regularly with the general public.  Prior research on rainforest canopies has attracted international media attention, and this project is expected to generate similar public interest.  Finally, the work will reveal how changes in tropical forest structure may shape canopy biodiversity over the next several decades.</AbstractNarration>

We also added various types of artificial ant nests (e.g., wood blocks; Figure 2) to determine how ant colonization of trees differs when lianas are absent or present.&nbsp; We found that the physical connections between tree crowns provided by lianas affect the species composition and local diversity of ants.&nbsp; However, the effects of lianas on ant diversity was minimal in very young forests. &nbsp;Ant colonization of artificial nests was higher (73% occupied) in trees without lianas vs. trees with lianas (28% occupied).&nbsp;

We also found that the high temperatures of canopy surfaces can influence adhesive performance and foraging decisions in ants.&nbsp; Temperatures on the upper surfaces of tropical tree branches commonly exceed 50C (Figure 3), which is a major obstacle to foraging. &nbsp;Ongoing studies indicate that ants will evacuate twig nests (which are commonly associated with lianas) at fairly predictable temperatures, and that such "absconding" temperatures differ among ant species.&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, we explored how the presence of lianas affects the abundance of nests of Azteca trigona, a common and ecologically important canopy ant species (Figure 4).&nbsp;
