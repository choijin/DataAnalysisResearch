<AbstractNarration>Maintaining the security of one's systems and devices in a way that ensures the right balance between functionality, security, and convenience remains complicated for most people. For example, people are routinely asked by their systems whether to accept a security certificate, install an application, heed security warnings, or reconfigure operating-system security settings. While these examples represent situations in which people regularly find themselves, people rarely have any basis to make an informed decision or to establish one conveniently. This research examines the concept of 'crowdsourced security' where the solution lies in people leveraging members of their community to secure their systems and devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this research is to determine the potential of crowdsourcing as a complementary strategy for enhancing security.  An example challenge addressed in this research pertains to the security of one's personal data. Specifically the research seeks to develop security mechanisms that can exploit naturally occurring social relationships and utilize 'human computation' to shift the burden of security via authentication from machines to humans. Within this framework, the research investigates both questions about the technical effectiveness of crowdsourced security solutions, as well as socio-behavioral questions about users' preferences, motivations, and privacy concerns about such systems. This research will benefit society by producing a deeper understanding of how systems can be better secured through human participation and collaboration, moving beyond the status quo of current security mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  There are almost two billion people with smartphones today. These devices are vulnerable to loss and theft and owners of these phones who download and install various types of apps on their smartphones also put their privacy at risk. This research explored the effectiveness of applying the concept of crowdsourcing for enhancing the security of mobile devices and the privacy of the owners of these devices. In particular, the research focused on two techniques for crowdsourcing security tasks, which we called æmediation based crowdsecÆ and æadvisory based crowdsecÆ.    For our work on mediation based crowdsec, we explored how ænotariesÆ from a crowd could be enlisted to approve (i.e., mediate) access to sensitive information on a smartphone by ensuring that the owner of the phone was in physical possession of the phone. We built a prototype of a videochat based notarization application and performed a lab study to demonstrate the effectiveness of notarization. We also studied psychological factors that affect the likelihood of notaries to accept notarization requests and found mood was an important factor. Finally we ran a pilot with our prototype in a realistic environment, which points towards the feasibility of using videochat based notarization in general.    For our work on advisory based crowdsec, we explored how a crowd of users could collectively explore various configurations of an app (i.e., with different combinations of permissions requested by the app disabled) to determine configurations that improved privacy of users without sacrificing usability. We conducted a user experiment with a popular app to show that it is feasible for a crowd to explore a large number of configurations by strategically ignoring configurations that are expected to be unusable.
