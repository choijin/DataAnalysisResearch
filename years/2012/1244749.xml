<AbstractNarration>Global urbanization raises challenges and opportunities related to density and scale in areas including transportation, food production and distribution, human health and wellbeing, education, social policy and services, and management of water and energy. The accelerated creation of city-scale developments and regional megalopolises brings urgency to understanding their impact on the local and regional environment and inhabitants. New computational and information capabilities, along with unprecedented and growing volumes of relevant data, suggest new opportunities to understand the state of urban social and economic systems and to develop calibrated, validated computational models to explore the potential impact of new policies, investments, and accelerating expansion of urban built infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers recognize the potential for new insights and more effective policy and planning if research teams had the ability to explore these data as an integrated corpus, yet the equilibrium state is one of daunting fragmentation and access restrictions that can only be overcome by a critical mass of researchers and a compelling, broad research agenda that resonates with the near- and long-term challenges of policymakers and citizens. Moreover, new data organization and analysis approaches will require partnerships between social, behavioral, education, and economics scientists and computational scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will create a research coordination network that brings these communities together to develop an integrated research agenda for an interdisciplinary, data-driven approach to urban research, analysis, and planning, exploring and prototyping methods, processes, tools, and infrastructure necessary to support such science. The RCN will leverage a unique and growing collection of data sets and research teams spanning The University of Chicago, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the City of Chicago, and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, a global architecture firm designing city-scale urban infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Urban Sciences RCN (US-RCN) plan comprised three phases unfolding over three years:  1) Building community research vision around unique urban-related data sources,   2) Expanding participation in urban data-driven science and access to urban data, while developing data analysis methodologies, and   3) Prototyping methodologies and developing sustainable process and infrastructure requirements to support the study of cities and urban processes using emerging and rapidly growing (in sources and volume) urban-related data.  US-RCN has grown to include over 120 scientists and policy makers from around the world, as illustrated by the 2016 Chicago Convening, which was in collaboration with UChicago Urban Labs, the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, and the OECD Experts Group that created the report "Research Ethics and New Forms of Data for Social and Economic Research," published by OECD in November 2016.  To illustrate the diversity of US-RCN participants, the 2016 convening included scientific presentations by researchers from UChicago, NYU, University of Liverpool, Arizona State University, Santa Fe Institute, Ohio State University, University of California-Berkeley, University of Aberdeen, University of Virginia, University of Warwick, University of Washington, MIT, University of Illinois-Chicago, Boston University, Argonne National Laboratory, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Northeastern University, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, National Opinion Research Center, Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago, Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Harvard University.  Cities and industry speakers also presented, with speakers from Gallup, Atlanta Regional Commission, City of Chicago, and the City of Boston.  This growing community has already catalyzed new interdisciplinary collaborations.  For example, computational scientists studying the transmission of diseases in populations found collaborators at US-RCN events resulting in the use of their tools to support medical and social sciences who were independently studying the spread of information in populations (related to health and social services, respectively).  Similarly, computational scientists using transportation routing tools met social scientists at US-RCN events, resulting in application of these tools toward understanding neighborhoods and resource proximity.  Previously these scientists looked at physical proximity (e.g. "as the crow flies") but such transportation tools enabled consideration of proximity in more human terms&mdash;how long does it take to move from point A to point B.  To illustrate the type of collaborative projects that US-RCN has catalyzed, US-RCN networking brought together the Lindau Lab at the University of Chicago with designers from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) to create the "FeedFirst" project. FeedFirst is examining how free food pantries in Comer Childrens? Hospital can sustainably alleviate unnecessary suffering due to hunger among caregivers with a hospitalized child.  The US-RCN also supported collaborative work between SAIC and the MIT Center for Civic Media on the "Safety in Numbers" project. In this work SAIC and MIT are working with community participants from the Homan Square / North Lawndale area of Chicago to develop tools of inquiry and instructional modules for exploring space and place. Focusing on data collection technology and environmental media as a process for iterative inquiry on the complex issue of "safety" and its formation.  The NSF-funded "Array of Things" Major Research Instrumentation project drew on the US-RCN community to identify social science questions requiring urban sensing, with Co-PI Kathleen Cagney leading these discussions.  The US-RCN also supported the application of new data discovery, exploration, and analysis tools and approaches.  US-RCN students participated in support of the annual Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) summer internship program at UChicago as well as in the development of the Plenario (http://plenar.io) open data discovery and exploration portal.  The success of the April 2016 Chicago convening resulted in institutional commitment at UChicago to continue the US-RCN through an annual convening and ongoing promotion of the community directory website.
