<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at Grand Valley State University will provide talented undergraduate students from across the nation with first-hand, experiential knowledge of the process of conducting mathematical research. Over the course of eight weeks each summer, eight undergraduate students will engage in mathematical research on an interesting, original, and mathematically significant topic selected by a faculty mentor. Research results may have applications in national security, political science, and industry. These experiences will enable participants to make an informed decision about pursuing a career as a mathematician.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the program, faculty mentors will work to enhance students' written and verbal communication skills and build a community of scholars. Students are expected to present their findings several times over the summer. Projects funded by prior REUs at Grand Valley State University have resulted in prize-winning posters and numerous award-winning student talks at national meetings of mathematicians, and at least twenty published or accepted papers in peer-reviewed journals. Most of the alumni of the previous REUs choose to attend (or have attended) graduate school in mathematics or a closely related field. These students report that the REU had an impact on their choice to pursue a career in mathematics or a related field. The nonacademic career choices of program alumni include software engineering, working for the National Security Administration, and financial engineering.</AbstractNarration>

In addition to presenting their work at local, state, and national conferences, many program participants have continued to work with their mentors after the conclusion of the summer program to prepare manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals.  Many papers about the research have either been submitted or are in preparation.  While many of the 2013-2015 REU participants are still completing their undergraduate studies, others have gone on to enroll in graduate programs in mathematics or related fields.  Currently, alumni of the 2013 program are enrolled at Iowa State University, University of California-Berkeley, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, University of Colorado-Boulder, California State University-Sacramento, and University of Minnesota.  Alumni of the 2014 program are enrolled at Macalester College, Mills College, and one is a mathematics instructor at Johnson College Prep in Chicago.  In summary, the Summer Mathematics REU at Grand Valley State University provided 24 undergraduate students an opportunity to conduct original research in mathematics and to present their work in various local, state, and national venues.  These students won numerous awards for their research, and many have gone on to graduate school in mathematics and related fields.  The research from this REU has practical applications to problems such as designing voting systems.           Last Modified: 01/28/2016       Submitted by: William C Dickinson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
