<AbstractNarration>Most animals grow by periodically shedding and rebuilding external skeletons (cuticles). However, the mechanisms by which cuticles are removed and remade have not been fully characterized in any organism. The molting cycles of roundworms are particularly interesting, because their skin is composed mostly of collagen produced by cells similar to human skin cells. Proliferation of these stem cells is coordinated with the molting cycle. This research focuses on characterization of the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate these complex events, using a combination of genetic, biochemical, cell and molecular biological, and biophysical approaches in the model roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Previous studies revealed a family of extracellular proteins, MLT10, that are required for proper cuticle formation and this work will follow up to uncover novel but conserved mechanisms that regulate extracellular matrix and stem cell dynamics. Similar processes are critical for development, tissue homeostasis, and wound repair; deregulation of these processes can lead to disorders of skin and connective tissue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anticipated scientific findings will produce new tools that will enable further studies of the role of extracellular matrix proteins in development. The activities will also educate and advance a diverse group of young scientists, including more than 120 students who will participate in an innovative and effective curriculum on scientific writing.  The curriculum and related activities associated with pedagogical effort will be disseminated widely to enable faculty at other institutions to implement similar programs.</AbstractNarration>
