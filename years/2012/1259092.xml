<AbstractNarration>The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) is providing technical assistance to key leaders in state education agencies (SEAs) to: 1) build SEA leaders' knowledge about effective mathematical professional development research; 2) deepen their understanding  about necessary supports and structures that should be in place at the SEA and district level to scale up reform efforts needed to successfully implement the new college- and career-readiness standards; and 3) enable SEA leaders to incorporate what they learn and analyze, with the help of experts and peers, their existing mathematics college- and career-readiness standards implementation plans to ensure their plans are reflective of the research and best practice.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To reach these goals, CCSSO is inviting two key leaders from each state to a national meeting in the Washington, DC area where they will interact with and receive feedback from national mathematics education experts and peers on how to strengthen, revise and refine their standards implementation plans.  The project is guided by an advisory group consisting of a broad range of experts in mathematics, mathematics research and mathematics practice.  The project is creating a tool that will allow state leaders to evaluate the quality of their implementation plans based on research and promising practices.  State teams have access to the experts and CCSSO personnel following the national meeting as the teams refine their implementation plans.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Council of Chief State School Officers is a nonpartisan, nationwide, nonprofit organization of public officials who head departments of elementary and secondary education in the states, the District of Columbia, the Department of Defense Education Activity, and five U.S. extra-state jurisdictions. CCSSO identified the major goals of the project to be building state education agency (SEA) leadersÆ knowledge about effective mathematics professional development research; deepening their understanding about necessary supports and structures that should be in place at the SEA and district level to scale up reform efforts needed to successfully implement the new mathematics college- and career-readiness standards; and, enabling SEA leaders to incorporate what theyÆve learned and analyze, with the help of experts and peers, their existing mathematics college and career readiness standards implementation plans to ensure their plans are reflective of the research.   The project focused around three main topics in kindergarten through eighth grade mathematics: content knowledge for teachers, improving professional learning techniques, and creating partnerships. In addition it was determined that the plan of action with the highest probability for success was responsive, meeting states where they were in their planning and implementation of college- and career-ready mathematics standards.   An Advisory Board consisting of a diverse group of researchers, mathematicians, mathematics educators, state department math specialists and standards implementation specialists and project staff was convened early in the project to review initial drafts of a mathematics education implementation tool (http://mathtool.ccsso.org) and to create plans for the collaborative meeting with state math leaders and practitioners. In addition, 12 reputable coaches from the national math education community were selected and prepared by project staff to work with state math leaders before, during, and after the summer 2014 collaborative meeting.   At the collaborative meeting, state math specialists and standards leads from 28 states gathered to collaborate with professionals from the math education community -- both practitioners as well as researchers-- in order to plan for implementation of college- and career-ready math standards. States shared successes and challenges, heard from practitioners in the field, and learned about mathematics education research. Current and emerging state needs around math implementation were identified along with promising strategies to address these needs.   State leaders reported that they had acquired a deeper understanding of research on effective mathematics professional development, as well as instructional innovations, and emerging assessment practices as a result of the meeting. State representatives said that they were better positioned to translate research and best practices into their math standards planning and implementation.   Project staff and state math specialists and standards leads maintained an ongoing relationship throughout the project. States came together in various media (webinars, Twitter, Google documents, and newsletters) to collaborate on state-identified challenges to implementing math standards and promising practices.  Five monthly webinars were held on different topics and supported by newsletters highlighting research and practice around the same topic.  Participants reported an increased awareness about productive reforms and the supports necessary to scale up these promising practices.   The mathematics education implementation tool mentioned earlier was created through a research and development process that incorporated multiple rounds of feedback both from professionals in the field as well as potential end users of the tool.  An interactive website (http://mathtool.ccsso.org) was developed by CCSSO staff to display this revised version of the tool.  The CCSSO Math SCASS (State Collabora...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
