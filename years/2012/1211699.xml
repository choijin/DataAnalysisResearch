<AbstractNarration>In this collaborative project, the PI's will use spectroscopy and photometry to measure the abundances of Li and other elements for hundreds of stars in seven open clusters, in order to constrain models of interior stellar structure. The collaborative component of the project will bring together photometry and spectroscopy expertise so that the investigators can address the mystery of anomalous Li abundances, which may indicate that additional, as yet unknown, physical mechanisms act in stars. Both PI?s have institutional access to appropriate observatories (WIYN and Mt. Laguna). The work will have broader impacts to Galactic evolution and cosmology, and the PI?s will train undergraduate and graduate students in research at two universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    "Standard" models of the current Sun are superb, as evidenced by helioseismology.  However, the Sun has also led a secret life: inside stars, Li nuclei are destroyed by energetic protons, and mixing can then deplete the surface Li abundance.  Standard theory predicts the Sun's Li to be 30% of its initial value, and yet it is only 0.7%.  This huge discrepancy suggests the action of physical mechanisms not included in standard theory.  Worse, nearly ALL stellar Li observations contradict standard theory, so the Li problem is quite broad.  We have investigated this problem by studying Li in "open" star clusters (belonging to the Milky Way Disk), which are among the very few astronomical objects whose ages can be determined.  The following non-standard features must be explained, as illustrated by the Hyades, the fundamental reference cluster for the field: a) excess Li depletion during the main sequence (MS) for M &lt; 1.1Msol, with decreasing M showing greater Li depletion; b) a depleted Li plateau for M = 1.1-1.3Msol; c) a very steep Li depletion (the "Li-dip") for M = 1.3-1.5Msol; and d) near-initial Li for M &gt; 1.5Msol.  Our results:     1) Deriving accurate Li abundances and interpreting them properly requires knowledge of the surface stellar temperatures (Teff) and some cluster parameters; to derive these we have conducted (and published) photometric studies of target clusters using "broadband" UBVRI and "medium band" Stromgren filters.     2) We refined the Hyades Li-Teff relation.  We showed that Praesepe has indistinguishable age and metallicity.  (Solar-composition stars are made of 98% by mass H and He, and the remaining 2% is their "metallicity".)  Importantly, we found the Praesepe Li-Teff relation and scatter about the relation also to be indistinguishable, implying that no additional cluster parameters (such as distribution of initial angular momenta) are important for stellar Li depletion, at least for these two clusters.  At Teff where one cluster lacks data, the other cluster fills in the pattern remarkably consistently.  The combined data for both clusters provide a nice reference for the future.     3) One super-metal-rich (3x solar) cluster (NGC 6253, 3 Gyr-old) shows that metal-rich stars deplete more Li, consistent with standard theory, and began life with higher initial Li, consistent with expectations from models of Galactic Li production.  The Teff of the center of the Li-dip is independent of metallicity, but its mass correlates with metallicity.  Another super-metal-rich cluster (NGC 6791, 7 Gyr) shows no Li detections, and may be a (unique?) cluster where not even one star has preserved any Li.     4) B in the Hyades is consistent with the B/Be depletion correlation we found previously in field dwarf stars, which supports (non-standard) models where mixing throughout the outer stellar layers due to rotation depletes the surface Li, Be, and B.     5) We found evidence that rotational mixing may be an even more dominant Li-depletion mechanism than previously thought.  We discovered that stars more massive than the Li-dip spin down by a factor of 3-4 between the ages of NGC 7789 (1.5 Gyr) and NGC 6819 (2.2 Gyr), and deplete Li.  The NGC 6819 Li-depleters are evolving to cooler Teff as they approach the end of their main sequence lives (where H is exhausted in the core), effectively creating a second Li-dip but at higher mass than the traditional one.  Also, only 12% of giants in NGC 6819 have detectable Li, as compared to 30% in the younger NGC 7789; perhaps this too is a reflection of spin-down that occurred while the stars were still on the main sequence.     Regarding broader impacts, the Project provided mentoring and professional development for 17 undergraduate students (8 at Indiana and 9 at collaborator Steinhauer's SUNY-Geneseo), 1 graduate student (Indiana), a postdoc, and two faculty at primarily-undergraduate-institutions.  The students learned how to reduce, analyze and disseminate fundamental astronomical data (photometry and/or spectroscopy), and many received data acquisition training using the WIYN telescopes.
