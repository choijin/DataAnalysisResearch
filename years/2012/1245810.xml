<AbstractNarration>Scientific computing groups on university campuses are often limited by insufficient access to computing cycles, storage capacity, and network bandwidth in a flexible and cost effective way. This prevents them from scaling their applications and taking on grand-challenge problems. Moreover, the current network infrastructure is built with proprietary switches, routers and with proliferating appliances such as firewalls and load balancers. As a result, the IT operation group faces increasing complexity, cost, and lack of control of the existing infrastructure. This closed infrastructure also prevents network researchers from exploring new ideas at scale in a production setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project leverages two disruptive technologies that the Web infrastructure and "a cloud" are exploiting: multi-tenancy virtualized clusters and Software Defined Networks (SDN). Multi-tenancy virtualized clusters enable scale-out designs with very flexible resource use and the best cost performance. SDN makes it possible to customize infrastructure and to eliminate unnecessary complexity and costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds an SDN-based Private Cloud to bring these two disruptive technologies to the campus and with them the scale, flexibility, and cost performance. With this private cloud, scientific computing groups are able to share the physical infrastructure while simultaneously customizing computing and networking for their applications. Radar remote sensing and biological computing applications are used as example scientific computing applications to demonstrate value of this infrastructure. The SDN based Private Cloud will impact various communities on a campus and will become a showcase for other campuses and thus help them exploit the latest trends in networking and computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we addressed four technical topics aimed at improving the use of cloud resources for supporting scientific computation.  These include network infrastructure, compute infrastructure, cloud orchestration, and demonstrating application development.  In the network infrastructure area, we improved the capability for monitoring and verification of distributed sensors and central data storage.  We also extended the coverage of 100Gb connectivity in our network and provided methods for dedicated 40Gb links into up to 20 buildings.  For the compute infrastructure we added computational nodes and dedicated storage in order to provide a solution to problems caused by IO and space limitations as a result of growing data set sizes.  Cloud implementation software was improved by further developing a method using OpenNetworking and OpenCloud management software on one of the clusters.  We demonstrated the increased capabilities of the upgraded hardware and software environments by experimental implementations of two application areas that benefit from high-performance computational cloud resources:  computational biology and interferometric radar signal processing.  For the computational biology application we were able to decrease the time necessary to index genomic data. We successfully decreased the start to finish processing time from more than 24 hours to 90 minutes. This was achieved through a combination of OS changes and optimizations as well as the addition of faster storage to the compute cluster.
