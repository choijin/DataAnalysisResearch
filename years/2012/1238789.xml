<AbstractNarration>In order for the institution to continue to meet the needs of its students in the Biology department, the targeted infusion project of Fort Valley State University has as its goal to infuse undergraduate research and instruction into the forensic science curriculum.  Forensic science is a rapidly expanding and interdisciplinary science that has already captured the attention of many undergraduate STEM majors.  The goal of this project is to foster that enthusiasm while also strengthening the existing NSF-funded HBCU UP STEM program at FVSU.  A collection of strategies will be employed to achieve this goal.  They include, but are not limited to: the incorporation of inquiry based lectures and labs in forensic sciences, establishment of a forensic science core research laboratory, undergraduate research opportunities, high school teacher workshops and faculty development.   Ultimately, the activities proposed will not only expose students to the breadth of concepts related to forensic science and its application to real world problems, but will also improve their capacities to compete for highly coveted graduate programs at major research intensive institutions.  Overall, the forensic science program at FVSU will impact over 200 students and faculty each year, thereby significantly contributing to the potential pool of qualified STEM graduates from diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
