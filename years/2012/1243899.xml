<AbstractNarration>The High Frame Rate Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy system promises new fluorescence imaging capabilities at costs dramatically lower than current systems. By integrating detectors and converters on a single platform, frame rates in excess of 100 frames/second at a production cost of under $1000 should be possible. This compares with image acquisition times of a few seconds per frame at near 100 times the cost fopr currently-available systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will assist the team in assessing the commercial viability of the research that was previously sponsored by NSF. If successfully commercialized, the team will deliver a new technology that advances the state of the art in fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. This advancement will allow measurements of dynamics of fluorescence lifetimes with an inexpensive and simple system. These measurements could lead to further advances in microscopy as well as the development of new medical diagnostic systems. In addition to the scientific advances that would be possible with widespread adoption of the system, there would also be positive economic impacts that would result from transitioning the hardware from the lab and ramping production.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded our participation in the ICorps program at the University of Michigan in the summer of 2012, including completing all aspects of this program.  In this project, we are developing a proof-of-concept prototype of a new camera chip that is capable of performing a type of imaging known as fluorecent lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).   NSF funds were employed to enable us to explore applications with customers and complete a proof-of-concept prototype.  The specific application we pursued is esophageal endoscopy to diagnose Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).  Current endoscopy surveillance practice is limited in several ways.  The presence of dysplasia is the only validated measn of risk startifying BE pateints with regard to the risk of developing EAC.  Within BE tissue, dysplasia is non-uniform, patchy, and generally not clearly visible using conventional white-light endoscopy techniques, making it necessary to perform extensive biopsies every 1-2 cm along the length of the BE tissue.  This procedure has to be repeated everyone 3 to 36 months, an expensive process that is also prone to sampling error.  In this project, we developed and are seeking ways to commercialize a new endoscopy imaging system based on FLIM that is capable of identifying dysplastic tissue in real-time during a routine endoscopy through the identifification of instrinsic metabolic biomarkers.  The enabling techology for this system is a wide-field FLIM camera that we have recently desgined.  This camera, which includes a custom integrated imager chip, is designed to record fluorescneice lifetime images at up to 100 frames per second.   Through the real-time identification of dysplasi, biopsies would be performaed only when necessasry and sampling errors, protocol noncompliance, and pathoogist uncertainties would be eliminated.
