<AbstractNarration>This NSF Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Frontiers project "Foundations Of Resilient CybEr-physical Systems (FORCES)" focuses on the resilient design of large-scale networked CPS systems that directly interface with humans.  FORCES aims to pr ovide comprehensive tools that allow the CPS designers and operators to combine resilient control (RC) algorithms with economic incentive (EI) schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Contributions&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing RC tools to withstand a wide-range of attacks and faults; learning and control algorithms which integrate human actions with spatio-temporal and hybrid dynamics of networked CPS systems; and model-based design to assure semantically consistent representations across all branches of the project. Operations of networked CPS systems naturally depend on the systemic social institutions and the individual deployment choices of the humans who use and operate them. The presence of incomplete and asymmetric information among these actors leads to a gap between the individually and socially optimal equilibrium resiliency levels. The project is developing EI schemes to reduce this gap. The core contributions of the FORCES team, which includes experts in control systems, game theory, and mechanism design, are the foundations for the co-design of RC and EI schemes and technological tools for implementing them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Resilient CPS infrastructure is a critical National Asset. FORCES is contributing to the development of new Science of CPS by being the first project that integrates networked control with game theoretic tools and the economic incentives of human decision makers for resilient CPS design and operation. The FORCES integrated co-design philosophy is being validated on two CPS domains: electric power distribution and consumption, and transportation networks. These design prototypes are being tested in real world scenarios. The team's research efforts are being complemented by educational offerings on resilient CPS targeted to a large and diverse audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Cyber physical systems, (CPS), e.g power systems, transportation systems, cyber security systems, consist of multiple users/agents who are selfish,have their own objectives (which they attempt to optimize),, possess different information about the system's status, and interact with one another through the decisions they make.   The major goal of this project was the development of methodologies for the design of secure, resilient and economic cyber physical systems. To achieve this goal, we took into account the key features of CPS, described in the previous paragraph, in irder to create appropriate models; we used these models to develop our methdologies for the design of secure and resilient CPS.  Our major research accomplishments are:  1. The discovery of algorithms for optimal dynamic decision making in multi-agent systems, where the agents have different information about the system's status.  2. The discovery of efficient algorithms for security of networks where their users are selfish, they have different information about the network's status, and interact with one another through their decisions.  3. The design of energy markets that achieve energy policy targets such as reliability (availability of enegy all the time), sustainability ( low carbon emiission)  and price efficiency (low prices)  4. The design of regulations that result in optimal energy production and energy consumption in electricity networks where consumers and producers are selfish and have different information about the status of the network.  5. The  design of contracts for the efficienct incorporation of renewable forms of energy into the elsctricity network.  6.The design of algorithns for coordinating the charging of large numbers of electric vehicles.  7 The discovery of algorithms for the determination of optimal power flow in large scale power systems with extensive renewable resources  8.The discovery of  information disclosure mechanisms (what information should be provided to drivers) so as to decrease congestion in transportation networks.  The results of our research were presented in conferences, and were published in scientific journals.  The grant supported the doctoral dissertations of 10 students. All these students graduated and are now working in Universities or leading industrial organizations.       Last Modified: 05/21/2019       Submitted by: Demosthenis Teneketzis]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
