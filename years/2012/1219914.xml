<AbstractNarration>The Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER) at the Urban Institute (UI) proposes a RAPID proposal to address an urgent Congressional request for information on successful STEM schools. Specifically, the Center, through the access it has to longitudinal state databases from a US Department of Education award, will conduct a preliminary analysis of how to create a survey using current state data and will query the data for what constitutes successful STEM schools. Through the use of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) methods, the project will identify school-level residual effects of STEM fields, holding prior student achievement constant. This work should contribute substantially to an approach for measuring efficacy across diverse programs.</AbstractNarration>

These documents highlighted persistent deficiencies in K-12 education in STEM fields and advocated federal intervention to remedy these deficiencies, particularly among underrepresented minorities (URMs) in STEM occupations.

This project used longitudinal education data from two states (Florida and North Carolina) to investigate the relationship between school and instructional inputs and student achievement on standardized tests in STEM subjects. Two studies were conducted under this project, described below.  The first study, titled "Characteristics of Schools Successful in STEM Subjects," categorizes schools in FL and NC on the basis of average student growth on math and science tests, then compares school-level STEM measures across these performance categories.
