<AbstractNarration>Some dinoflagellates (small unicellular marine organisms) are bioluminescent; they have the ability to emit flashes of light, a beautiful and spectacular sight in the ocean. This project will explore the potential role of voltage gated proton channel (HV) proteins in bioluminescent dinoflagellates, and test their physiological role in bioluminescence. The location of the channel proteins in scintillons (the light emitting organelles of these dinoflagellates) will be examined, as well as their biophysical properties as proton channels. This project explores a novel aspect of dinoflagellate biology and provides an excellent model in which to study the general mechanism of proton selective transport, which is an essential aspect of the processes of photosynthesis and respiration. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact:  This project will generate knowledge of the basic biology of the dinoflagellates, some of which are responsible for toxic "red tides" whilst those that are bioluminescent create threats of exposure for night-time naval operations involving divers, swimmers and underwater vehicles. This project will provide a unique opportunity to train a postdoctoral fellow and undergraduate and graduate students at the interface of molecular biology, biophysics and marine science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 1972, J. Woodland Hastings proposed that a then-unknown protein, the voltage-gated proton channel, was the triggering mechanism for the flash emitted by bioluminescent dinoflagellates.  These single-celled organisms live in the ocean and when the water is disturbed, by waves, predators, or swimmers, they emit a bright blue flash of light.  As shown in the figure, motion triggers an action potential (like a nerve impulse) that travels as an electrical wave over the membrane of the large flotation vacuole inside each dinoflagellate.  Hastings and others had identified the source of these flashes as small organelles called scintillons, which contain luciferin and luciferase, the chemical and enzyme that activates it to produce a light flash.  Hastings had shown that the luciferase enzyme was activated by protons, and he proposed that protons rush into the scintillon from the vacuole when proton channels open in the scintillon membrane.  In 2011, we collaborated with Hastings to show that dinoflagellates do in fact have voltage gated proton channels (Smith et al., 2011, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 108:18162-18168).  This was strong evidence for Woody?s hypothesis.  However, the species we had used was not bioluminescent.  A main goal of the present project was to identify proton channel genes in bioluminescent species, and then prove that they were genuine voltage gated proton channels. We selected the main species that Hastings had studied, Lingulodinium polyedrum and identified a putative proton channel gene.  Then we optimized the bases for a mammalian expression system, and grew cells that produced the channel protein and inserted it into their membranes.  Then we used voltage clamp techniques to study toe properties of the channels.  We proved they are proton selective, and activated by membrane depolarization, as required for their proposed functions.  We also used fluorescent antibody staining to demonstrate the presence of the protein in actual dinoflagellates.  This study solidly establishes that Hastings? hypothesis was correct and we now understand in detail how bioluminescent dinoflagellates produce their beautiful blue flashes.
