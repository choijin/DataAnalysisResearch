<AbstractNarration>This NSF award to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) funds U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by the G8 Research Councils Initiative ?Structural Bamboo Products.? This is a pilot collaboration among the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Canadian National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), the German Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR),and the United Kingdom Research Councils (RCUK), supporting collaborative research projects selected on a competitive basis that are comprised of researchers from at least three of the partner countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international project with MIT, the University of British Columbia (Canada) and the University of Cambridge (United Kingdom) develops green construction materials and building codes for bamboo. China, India and Brazil have rapidly expanding economies with increasing demand for building materials. The production of conventional construction materials such as steel and concrete is energy intensive and unsustainable: concrete alone accounts for 5% of global CO2 emissions. Bamboo is a fast growing, renewable building material widely cultivated in these countries but not utilized to its full potential in modern construction. Its mechanical properties are similar to wood but it produces up to six times as much mass per hectare as conventional timber plantations. Structural bamboo products, similar to plywood, oriented strand board, or glue-laminated wood products, therefore have enormous potential to partially replace the use of more energy intensive materials in rapidly developing countries.  This project aims to: characterize the mechanical behavior of bamboo as a material; develop methods for processing pieces of bamboo into structural products such as panels and beams; test structural bamboo panels and beams; suggest adaptations to existing wood building codes for structural bamboo products; and assess the energy performance and life cycle costs of buildings made using structural bamboo products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will contribute to the knowledge base and use of engineered bamboo and increase the sustainability of building products by the development of a renewable, lower-carbon alternative to conventional structural components. The development of building codes for structural bamboo products will contribute to the more efficient and widespread use of bamboo as a building material.  Understanding energy inputs to structural bamboo products could help identify areas of possible savings.  The project will also contribute towards the development of human resources, in training students and postdoctoral researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Structural Bamboo Products               Bamboo is an abundant, sustainable resource, mostly concentrated in the rapidly developing countries of China, India and Brazil.  Bamboo has been used as a structural material for millennia. Traditional bamboo structures use entire culms (stems) for framing and woven mats for paneling. Recently, there has been increasing interest in engineered structural bamboo products (SBP), analogous to engineered wood products such as plywood, oriented strand board and glue-laminated timber.  Such products could, in some structures, substitute for conventional construction materials such as concrete and steel that are highly energy intensive in their manufacture, reducing CO2 emissions and climate change.              The use of structural bamboo products is currently limited by a lack of material property data and appropriate building codes.  In this project, we have studied the microstructure and mechanical properties of both bamboo tissue and structural bamboo products.               Bamboo is made up of vascular bundles in a matrix of foam-like parenchyma tissue.  The vascular bundles include both nearly fully dense, stiff, hard sclerenchyma fibers as well as thin-walled vessels that transport fluid and play little mechanical role.  Bamboo differs from wood in that its density varies radially through the culm, or stem, wall, as a result of variations in the amount of sclerenchyma and parenchyma .  We have characterized the microstructure of bamboo, measured its stiffness and strength and developed mathematical models to predict its mechanical properties based on its density.  We have compared the properties of three species of bamboo widely used for structural purposes: moso (from China), guadua (from South America) and tre gai (from Vietnam). We find that the guadua is slightly stiffer than the other species and that all three species have similar strengths.               Mathematical models for plant materials rely on understanding how each tissue behaves independently.  For bamboo, we were interested in understanding how the parenchyma tissue behaved in more detail.  Since the sclerenchyma fibers are embedded in the parenchyma, it is difficult to cut specimens of parenchyma out of the culm wall.  We developed a method to fabricate larger scale replicas of the parenchyma tissue.  We first used x-ray computed tomography, similar to that used in medical imaging, but able to detect features as small as one thousandth of a millimeter, to obtain a three-dimensional image of the parenchyma cell structure. We then used these images to fabricate a larger scale replica of the parenchyma cell structure using 3D printing, which could be tested mechanically.  The test results then yielded information on how the cells within the parenchyma deform and behave.              Scrimber is a structural bamboo product made by compacting pieces bamboo to increase their density and then bonding the pieces together.  We measured the mechanical behavior of, and developed mathematical models for, densified bamboo with a view to evaluating the effectiveness of scrimber.  We found that although the densification process increases stiffness and strength, it also introduces defects into the bamboo structure.  If the stiffness and strength of densified bamboo is compared with those of natural samples of bamboo of the same density, the scrimber has lower properties than natural bamboo.              Bamboo oriented strand board can be made by slicing strands and bonding them together, similar to wood oriented strand board . Our collaborators at the University of British Columbia fabricated and tested specimens of bamboo oriented strand board in bending.  The boards use higher density strands on the top and bottom and lower density strands in the middle of the board. The strands are also more oriented in the top and bottom layers than in the middle. We developed a mathematical model to predict the stiffness of the board. This model uses our previously developed model for the stiffness of moso bamboo tissue and accounts for the orientation and density of the bamboo strands in the different layers of the board.              Overall, our project has increased our understanding of the mechanical behavior of both bamboo and structural bamboo products which should contribute to enabling the use of structural bamboo products more widely. We have disseminated our findings through conference presentations, peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations to a general audience (through "Tree Mobs" at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston).  We have made typical test results available through MIT Libraries' DSpace website.  The project has trained one doctoral student and given research experience to 5 undergraduate students.                Last Modified: 05/12/2017       Submitted by: Lorna J Gibson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
