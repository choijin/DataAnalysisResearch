<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Perception, Action, and Cognition Program and the Linguistics Program in the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, and the Animal Behavior Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems in the Directorate for Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is enormous diversity in the ways that animals move, from crawling and swimming to courtship displays and talking. Of special interest is whether the context of the movement, such as whether or not it performs a communicative function, fundamentally changes the coordination principles. The proposed research brings together an interdisciplinary team of biologists, linguists, and psychologists to investigate the movements of a diverse set of animals: human, octopus, and a nematode worm. The work allows, for the first time, a comparison of communicative and non-communicative actions both within and between animal species. The cross-species comparisons also allow an exploration of how symbolic and discrete linguistic communication in humans could have evolved from the continuously moving tongue and arms. More generally, movement control systems, in common with the human linguistic system, have a generative capacity to create new functional complex movements (or sentences) from smaller subparts. Does muscular control underlie this generative capacity in any way? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inclusion of both dysarthric speech movements and signed speech enhances the broader impacts of these experiments. In addition, the worm C. elegans shows promise as a model for the dysarthria that occurs in Parkinson's disease; dopamine synthesis and uptake in C. elegans  will be manipulated so as to model the abnormal dopamine signaling in people with Parkinson's disease. The investigators have also partnered with the USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative to bring the research to the attention of students in local high schools, especially those serving minority students under-represented in science.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this project was to establish common mathematical principles that allow us to understand and describe commonalities in the variety of movements we observe regardless of purpose and environment. One specific thing we tried to understand is the flexibity of movement, as one of the general properties of animal movements, and to study this propert we investigated a variety of highly flexible muscular systems, locomotion worms, deforming octopus arms, and tongues speaking languages. These systems share a biomechanical principle of movement, even though they exist in very different parts of the animal kingdom. Indeed, even though you and I are vertebrates, our tongues are invertebrates, more akin to octopus arms and worms. We also studied rigid muscular systems like the tongues of people with Parkinson's, a disease in which the neurotransmitter Dopamine is compromised in the brain, to understand what actually happens when flexibility is compromised. The animal that allowed us to study flexiblity and rigidity of movement in greatest quantitative detail was a one-millimeter worm <em>C. elegans</em>, an animal that is very well-understood genetically and neurally. Even though this worm does not have a brain, it has 8 cells that produce Dopamine, which are also known to be involved in the production of smooth flexible movements. We were therefore able to manipulate the worm genetically to mimic a spectrum from normal to Parkinsonian-like worms, and were able to study the movement under genetic conditions predesposing the worm to flexible vs. rigid motions. We also collected data on naturally behaving octopus in the ocean, as well as dynamic tongue movement as imaged in an MRI magnet. Besides a variety of new empirical findings on the movements of each of these systems, we found a set of common principles that can be described in a mathematical framework called reaction-diffusion dynamics that was initiated by Alan Turing in 1952 to descibe different biological patterns like zebra stripes and the formation of tentacles on hydra. We showed that this framework can be extended to describe how our three animals move. Furthermore, we were able to quantify characteristics of flexible vs. rigid movements based on an abstract analysis offered through Turing's mathematical techniques.
