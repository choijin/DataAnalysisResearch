<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Harold Dibble and Alain Turq, in collaboration with a large international, inter-disciplinary team, will spend three seasons of excavation at the Middle Paleolithic site of La Ferrassie (Dordogne, France).  The original excavation of La Ferrassie, which took place around the turn of the 20th century, revealed a number of Neandertal individuals and other features that suggested both a deliberate arrangement of space within the site (possibly with symbolic significance) and deliberate burial of the Neandertal remains.  In addition, La Ferrassie is the eponymous site for the Ferrassie Mousterian, a relatively rare Middle Paleolithic industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The renewed excavations at La Ferrassie will provide new and detailed information on Neandertal ritual and mortuary behavior, an important yet controversial aspect of Neandertal life that has tremendous significance for the evolution of human cultural traits in general.  Neandertal treatment of the dead is a topic that has been debated for decades in paleoanthropological research, but most of the evidence on this subject was recovered before the advent of modern techniques of excavation and documentation. Because of the rarity of such finds, having new data is usually due more to chance than it is to an explicit research design.  It is clear, however, that La Ferrassie has the potential to provide new information on this subject and thus contribute significantly to the debate. The new excavations will continue to build on the standards of other recent work concerning the level of precision, accuracy, and completeness of data recovery in order to avoid the kinds of ambiguity that has plagued earlier finds of this nature.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explicitly encourage the participation of undergraduate and underrepresented students from all over the world in the excavation process, providing important research experiences and training for the next generation of archaeologists.  Plans are also developed to provide informal public education through the web and film documentary.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "Grand Abri" of La Ferrassie is located roughly west of the village of Les Eyzies in southwest France. Excavation at the site was initially carried out by Peyrony and Capitan in the early 1900s, and then by Delporte in the 1960s, who excavated primarily only the Upper Paleolithic deposits (Delporte 1984). In addition to its sequence of Mousterian and Upper Paleolithic stone tool industries, La Ferrassie is also well-known for the discovery of several Neandertal remains.  These finds made La Ferrassie central to the question of Neandertal mortuary behavior because they have traditionally been interpreted as some of the best examples of deliberate burial in the Mousterian.  However, given the time when these excavations were carried out, the techniques used for excavation, dating, and reporting were clearly not up to modern standards.  The present project re-opened the site in an area immediately adjacent to where two of the Neandertal skeletons were discovered by Peyrony.  Our goal was to provide various strategic views of the stratigraphic sequence and to increase the volume of sediments from which new samples of the lithics and fauna could be obtained.  Our work also focused on trying to understand the processes by which the site was formed and to obtain new dates for the archaeological sequence.  This was a large-scale, multi-national effort that included training for a large number of students from around the world.              Among the more significant findings of our work (although analyses are still on-going) are the following:  Geoarcheological studies showed that the site of La Ferrassie is actually a cave system and instead of being one large site, it is rather a complex of distinct occupation areas focused at the entrance and further back in the cave. The later Middle Palaeolithic layers are in fact slope deposits emanating from a raised area that no longer exists (removed by road construction) to the West of the site. All of the levels of the Upper Paleolithic of the western part of the large shelter are in a secondary position, the origin of the deposits being located at the level of the cave terrace.  However, the different levels remain well individualized, with homogeneous industries representing little mixture. The last Neandertal remains to be discovered, LF8, is situated stratigraphically below the skeletons of LF1 and LF2, meaning that all of the human remains were not deposited contemporaneously. The characterization of several of the Middle Paleolithic stone tool industries were significantly biased by the poor excavation procedures used in the original excavations. An Upper Paleolithic industry known as the Ch&acirc;telperronien was discovered intact and without apparent mixture, thus supporting the notion that it is distinct from either the underlying Middle Paleolithic or overlying Aurignacian. The "monticules" &ndash; small mounds of rocky sediment &ndash; that were discovered by Peyrony  and interpreted by many as being of ritual signicance, are, in fact, examples of patterned ground brought about by periglacial conditions.
