<AbstractNarration>This project is to support student involvement in the IEEE Engineering in Medicine &amp; Biology Society (EMBS) conference "Translational Engineering in Health &amp; Medicine: The Intersection of the Lab, the Clinic and the Community", to be held in Houston November 7-9, 2012.  This conference provides and opportunity for physicians, engineers, and health professionals to share their knowledge and issues, and to work together on innovative solutions. It is the only meeting specifically designed to outline the key engineering imperatives in medicine and biology for the next several years and work toward achieving this future.  The goal of this project is to facilitate meaningful involvement by students in all facets of the conference, from meeting planning to presentations and session leadership to post-conference evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the First Annual IEEE Healthcare Innovation Conference in two ways: 1. Participation of students and junior faculty through scholarships for travel and registration costs. 2. Support for an innovative "unconference" design challenge facilitated by IDEO design specialists.  The IEEE Healthcare Innovation Conference: The Intersection of the Lab, the Clinic and the Community was held in the Texas Medical Center in Houston, TX November 7-9, 2012. The conference's overarching goal was to bring together thought leaders, key funders, and policymakers in medicine and engineering. Thus, the conference was an unparalleled opportunity for physicians, engineers, venture capitalists, regulators, funders, and health professionals to share their knowledge and issues in translational biomedical engineering. This award helped students and junior faculty participate in this unique opportunity to network and share innovative approaches to moving technology from the bench to the bedside and community.  Intellectual Merit: The Conference brought together leading scholars, practicing clinicians, academic biomedical engineers, and representatives from industry to identify and discuss critical issues and challenges facing the biomedical engineering community and larger society. The Conference provided new, targeted solutions to key issues in translational engineering in health. The NSF award facilitated meaningful involvement by students in all facets of the conference, from meeting planning to presentations and session leadership to post-conference evaluation.  Broader Impacts: The aim and the spirit of this conference is to connect physicians to engineers in order to work on problems that are relevant to healthcare. We designed a format for the conference that encourages fruitful interaction. The broader impacts of the Conference include identification of important challenges for larger society, broad dissemination of the conference papers and outcomes via the EMBS network and media coverage, publication of select papers in the open-access journal Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine, and strong community and student participation.  Student Participation  Student participation in the conference was led by a committee of medical students and biomedical engineering students.  Chair: Miguel Craig. Committee Members: Joshua Adams , Justin Badal, Andrew Bolano, Kathryn Bolles, Anand Ganapathy, Cameron Landers, Kasra Rahbar, Ronnie Kuo Ren, Breck Sandvall.  Student committee members moderated the Space Medicine Roundtable, volunteered throughout the conference, and wrote pr&eacute;cises of every session for dissemination to EMBS members and the media.  Scholarships Awarded: 49 students and trainees received scholarship support ($200-$800) to attend the conference. They applied online through the conference website and scholarships were awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.  Attendance  Total Registered: 208 EMBS Members: 44 EMBS Student Members: 39 IEEE Members: 10 IEEE Student Members: 8 Non-Members: 76 Student Non-members: 27 Government: 4  Evaluation Although exact attendance numbers are not available, all sessions were well-attended, particularly the keynotes and IDEO unconference. Evaluation was conducted real-time at the penultimate session, using audience-response pads: 194 pads were distributed and used at that session = 93% participation. &bull; &gt;90% rated HIC 12 Very/Fairly Good or Exceeded/Met Expectations. &bull; Most respondents (80%) said they would attend HIC 13.  Unconference IDEO Design Challenge Nov 7: Introduction &amp; Mini Design Challenge for all Participants Nov 8: Track Session and Overnight Charrette Nov 9: Interactive Report and Design Competition    27 teams submitted design challenges. Nine ideas were chosen via online voting to participate in the full workshop. 40 participants worked on design challenge teams. The winning design was chosen via audience response voting: "TransVU: an ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
