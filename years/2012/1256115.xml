<AbstractNarration>Almost all known organisms, from humans to soybeans, are attacked by parasites that cause disease.  Parasites vary in their transmission rate, which influences how quickly they can spread; and in their virulence, a measure of how strongly they worsen the health of their hosts.  Recent research now shows that other organisms in the environment can influence the transmission and virulence of parasites.  For example, antibiotics in milkweed plants that are eaten by monarch butterflies can protect the butterflies from parasites, and female monarchs that are already infected with parasites show a preference for laying their eggs on plants containing high concentrations of the antibiotics.  But what makes one milkweed plant contain more or less antibiotic than another?  Fungi in the soil interact with the roots of plants to influence the concentration of antibiotics in plant leaves, and so may be determining rates of parasitism above ground.  Using monarchs as a model, this project explores interactions between soil fungi, plants, herbivores, and their parasites.  The researchers hypothesize that the abundance and identity of the fungi in the soil help determine the infection rates of the butterflies above ground, and that plants that are colonized by soil fungi become more attractive to egg-laying butterflies that are already infected with parasites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has broad impacts beyond the study of butterflies.  The parasites studied in the project are related to those that cause malaria in humans, so the research may help understand the transmission and virulence of human parasites.  Many crop pests have parasites that might be made more effective by managing soil fungi. Students trained on this project will come from diverse backgrounds and join established mentoring programs at the University of Michigan and Emory University.  Schoolteachers will develop teaching plans in association with the project, and monarch butterflies remain popular for teaching scientific principles to the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All animals, including humans, are attacked by parasites.  Organisms as diverse as birds, bats, and butterflies must defend themselves against attack by agents of disease.  Like us, many animals have immune systems that help them to combat their parasites.  However, many animals also use medicines to help fight disease.  Animals often use plants as sources of medicine, and must search their local "green pharmacy" for the appropriate drugs.  Monarch butterflies are attacked by a protozoan parasite that is related to the parasites that cause malaria and toxoplasmosis in humans.  When monarchs get infected, they find it difficult to fly and to reproduce.  However, monarchs can use medicinal compounds in milkweed plants to help combat their parasites.  Milkweed medicines called cardenolides are quite effective in reducing parasitic disease in monarchs.  We noticed that milkweeds vary enormously in their medicinal value for monarchs.  We suspected that some of that variation might result from the fungi that associate with milkweed roots.  Most plants form a symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi in the soil, with the plants providing sugar to the fungi in exchange for soil nutrients.  We hypothesized that variation in the amount of colonization by mycorrhizal fungi might influence the medicinal quality of milkweed foliage and therefore the susceptibility of monarchs to their parasites.  As predicted, we found that the medicinal value of milkweed foliage changed dramatically depending upon the species of fungus, and the degree of colonization, in milkweed roots.  This is important because it suggests that the medicinal quality of plants may actually depend on interactions with organisms that live in the soil.  This is a new discovery in ecology, and suggests that the parasite burden of many animals may vary with the density and diversity of fungi in the soil.  In practical terms, conservation of pollinators like monarch butterflies may require us to manage the health of our soils to ensure a diverse community of soil fungi.  More generally, the health of our wildlife and livestock may depend on maintaining high-quality soils.  Finally, since humans still get around 50% of our new drugs from plants, our ability to find and extract new medicines from the plants around us will demand careful management of soil resources.  This project contributed to the education and training of both graduate and undergraduate students from diverse socioeconomic, cultural, ethnic, and racial backgrounds.
