<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to investigate innovative optimization models and algorithms for problems in restoring supply chains after significant disruptive events, constructing supply chains to support humanitarian relief efforts, and transitioning supply chains to their next-generation redesign.  These application areas have in common that the supply chain is operational as efforts are implemented to change its design.  Therefore, the optimization models will focus on scheduling when and how the supply chain will change over time.   In particular, limited resources will be allocated to perform tasks that change the characteristics of the components of the supply chain.  The project's optimization models and algorithms specifically recognize the temporal aspects of the application areas and are innovative in the area of scheduling, since they focus on the interactions of the completed tasks within the supply chain.  The educational program of this award will experiment with teaching methods that help to customize the learning experiences of engineering students based on their own interests and projected career paths.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide tools that enable companies and organizations to propose and analytically assess strategies for their restoration, construction, and redesign efforts.  This will help lessen the economical and societal impact of extreme events, since decision-makers in supply chain restoration and construction will be able to benchmark existing strategies and the impact of policy shifts in responding to the event.  These tools will further help companies to understand how to integrate advanced manufacturing capabilities, including energy-efficient components, into their existing supply chains.  The educational program will promote undergraduate research and develop new methods to better prepare students to apply optimization models in their projected career paths.  These educational activities will help to promote the diversity of future options available to industrial engineering students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this research are novel analytical models and algorithms to improve supply chain resilience and to expand supply chain capabilities to meet future demand.  In terms of supply chain resilience, the research has studied how to effectively restore supply chains after large-scale disruptions impact them or disrupt the infrastructure which they rely upon.  It has further examined how to mitigate the impacts of such disruptions on supply chains through pre-event planning and investments.   In terms of expanding supply chain capabilities, the research has examined how to effectively invest annual budgets over time to meet both current demands and projected future demands placed on the supply chain.      A broad range of applications have been considered during the project.  The project has considered restoring interdependent civil infrastructure and supply chain networks when decision-makers from each network will form their own restoration plans based on their own priorities.  It has considered how to manage critical lifeline supply chains into communities, such as those delivering pharmaceuticals, food, and fuel, after large-scale disruptions to infrastructure within the community, such as those caused by a hurricane or earthquake. It has considered the recovery of defense aircraft manufacturing supply chains and pharmaceutical manufacturing supply chains when multiple suppliers in these networks have been disrupted by the same extreme event.  The project has also considered how to expand oil spill response infrastructure in Arctic Alaska in order to best meet future demand for these capabilities in this remote region.    This project has created analytical methods that span multiple disciplines of Operations Research (OR) including network design, scheduling, game theory, integer programming, and network interdiction.  These analytical methods allow decision-makers to either plan more effectively or quantitatively assess important characteristics associated with their decision-making environments.  For example, the OR methods created by this project can allow one to: (i) quantify the losses associated with community recovery when individual infrastructures plan their restoration efforts individually with no coordination; (ii) quantify the improvement that can be gained when infrastructures share information about their plans, while still making them according to their own priorities; (iii) provide conditions when having each supplier within a supply chain optimize their own recovery will lead to the optimal global recovery of the entire network; (iv) quantify the improvement in community recovery after a disruptive event when infrastructures plan their restorations while specifically incorporating the impact of their decisions on critical lifeline supply chains; (v) assess the improvements in oil spill response capabilities in Arctic Alaska as one increases investments into infrastructure within the region; and (vi) understand the vulnerabilities of disruptions that cascade from infrastructure systems to supply chain networks.       In terms of educational outcomes, the project has explored the effectiveness of supplemental online learning experiences in undergraduate OR classrooms and the impact of flipping advanced undergraduate OR courses.  The project has created 25 video tutorials for undergraduate OR courses that have over 50,000 views on Youtube.  The project found that these videos decreased the amount of time students spent in office hours and, more importantly, have increased accessibility to answers to questions traditionally asked during office hours since they can now be answered through the video tutorials.   Further, the project has created a new case on workforce scheduling, based on a real-life consulting project, that can be used in introductory OR undergraduate courses and increase the prevalence of project-based learning in OR.  The project implemented a flipped classroom, which is one where videos are required to be viewed outside of class and then class time is dedicated to solving homework problems, in an advanced undergraduate OR course.  This implementation resulted in a decreased workload on the students which allowed them to learn more about programming OR algorithms during the same amount of class and homework time.  Finally, this project has included fifteen undergraduate research students that have helped to create the models and data sets associated with the project.  Three Master's theses and five Ph.D. dissertations have included research related to this project.           Last Modified: 08/02/2019       Submitted by: Thomas Sharkey]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
