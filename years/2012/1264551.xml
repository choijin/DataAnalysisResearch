<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project investigates students' ability to generate ideas (ideation) as they learn engineering design. Ideation is a critical skill for all engineers as they explore problem spaces and develop both short-term and long-term solutions to societal problems. The project investigates three key factors hypothesized to contribute to students' idea generation capability, and explores the interrelation between the factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arise from the potential to support ideation flexibility among engineering practitioners, giving greater capabilities for engineering educators to support and direct ideation in engineering degree programs. The investigators have proposed an ambitious plan to ensure that the research results are broadly disseminated to engineering faculty members. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The problems faced by engineers are diverse and complex. Engineers generate ideas to solve immediate problems and to support long-term solutions. Across problem-solving contexts, different types of ideas may be more or less appropriate. There are two primary types of change &ndash; radical and incremental &ndash; that represent extreme positions on a continuous scale. Radical change corresponds to the development of new solutions when technical and market uncertainties exist, while incremental change corresponds to the improvement of existing solutions for which infrastructure and processes are already established &ndash; with a range of possibilities in between. The outcomes of engineering problem-solving can be mapped along this scale, with no greater or lesser value attached to any particular position.  Successful engineering solutions must at times incorporate both radical and incremental elements that are developed and synthesized throughout a design process, driving the need for engineers to be skilled in the generation of ideas that span the incremental-to-radical spectrum. If engineers are to solve the diverse problems of today effectively, just having more ideas is not enough; having the right kind of ideas for the current problem is equally, if not more, important. Generating different kinds of ideas leverages the skill of ideation flexibility, which we defined in this project as the ability to generate ideas of different types across the incremental-to-radical spectrum.  Supporting students in the development of this skill is made more challenging by the impact of individual cognitive differences. Some engineers more naturally generate incremental ideas (those that build on existing products and align with prevailing paradigms), while others more naturally generate radical ideas (those that introduce unexpected features that are less aligned with prevailing paradigms). These cognitive differences must be considered in the development of approaches and tools that support ideation flexibility, recognizing that while all engineers need to learn how to generate ideas across the incremental-to-radical spectrum, some types of ideas will be easier for particular people to generate.  This research project investigated three key factors that can impact ideation outcomes: 1) problem framing (i.e., the way a problem and its constraints are "set"; 2) the use of ideation tools; and 3) ideation teaming (i.e., interactions with others during ideation). We explored the impact these factors have on engineering ideation flexibility, perceptions on ideation success, and ways that ideation outcomes can be measured aligned with a more radical or incremental approach.

This project has broader impacts in facilitating an understanding of how to support innovation for the challenges our world faces.  More clarity about the impacts of problem framing, ideation tools, and teaming can support educators and practitioners in directing how other engaged in ideation and design and support more successful outcomes.
