<AbstractNarration>This project implements discovery-based laboratory modules in a large, multi-section introductory biology course  at two Armstrong campuses, the main Armstrong Atlantic campus and the satellite Liberty Center Campus. The lab modules involve students in applying a suite of molecular biology techniques to screen Wolbachia from insects gathered by the students.   It is based on a set of modules originally developed for high school laboratories and then up-graded and tested, by the PIs, in an honors introductory biology laboratory.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This project represents one of the many approaches being introduced into student laboratories that give students a taste of being part of the scientific process at the same time it benefits the scientific community by adding to an important data base.  Laboratories are being used to help reinforce understanding of basic biology principles that are difficult for students to understand.  In addition students are learning to work in collaborative groups to develop hypotheses, complete literature searches, make observations, perform cellular/molecular techniques, use laboratory equipment, collect and analyze data, make conclusions, work on presentation skills, and formulate future questions. The proposed exercises also provide opportunities to develop mathematics, chemistry, computer science, and bioinformatics skills, further engaging students in the interdisciplinary nature of biology. The work is being coordinated with initiatives started through existing awards in two other NSF programs, a Noyce and a STEP award, resulting in much greater efficiency in use of resources.  Workshops will be developed and offered to acquaint faculty (~25) with the laboratory modules and their delivery to the students. A rigorous evaluation plan will be implemented to assess student and faculty gains from the LEAPS project and results will be disseminated through appropriate educational journals. All course and workshop materials will be available for other institutions to adopt thereby increasing the impact of the project on the greater STEM teaching and learning community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:   Successful implementation in 35 lab sections per year at two Armstrong campuses is demonstrating the feasibility of transference of individual modules or the entire lab sequence to similar institutions, especially those with urban, open-enrollment student populations. Novel laboratory exercises and overall project results are being disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at educational conferences. Several measurable outcomes have been incorporated into the evaluation plan and therefore inform the STEM community about the benefits of engaging large numbers of introductory-level students in discovery-based activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Undergraduate STEM education must engage students early in the curriculum to increase retention in the major and in inquiry-based research to prepare students for their programs.  Several obstacles prevent widespread research opportunities for all undergraduates; therefore, novel curricular models incorporating research experiences at the introductory level are essential to engaging the most students.  The LEAPS Project developed and implemented a student-centered, discovery-based laboratory research module to engage students in the process and application of science.  Our curriculum presents core concepts of cellular and molecular biology as tools to be used within the context of other areas of biology, such as entomology, microbiology, bioinformatics, and phylogenetics.  Students are also introduced to several mathematical, bioinformatic, and technological concepts and skills.  This approach engages our students in the interdisciplinary nature of biology, and science, in general.  The curriculum is defined by an authentic semester-long research project that culminates in the delivery of a final presentation in which students reflect upon their experience as scientists.    Each laboratory exercise is structured to support student success: pre-lab assignments prepare students for full engagement, while integrated discussions and post-lab assignments encourage synthesis and application skills. Students collaborate to collect local insects, identify them to Order, examine the literature, and develop hypotheses regarding the potential for the infection of their insects with the common bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia.  Students extract DNA, perform PCR to detect insect and Wolbachia DNA, analyze Wolbachia sequences to determine their novelty, propose mechanisms for local Wolbachia spread, and organize and communicate results in a final PowerPoint presentation.  According to survey data, students completing the curriculum have increased confidence in quantitative analysis, technical skills, scientific communication, and information literacy. Objective assessments (pre/post-tests) indicate student gains in understanding molecular biology concepts and skills as well as the interdisciplinary nature of science.  Various resources, including an instructor manual, workshops, and weekly meetings, are provided to enhance faculty development and promote a cohesive group of dedicated instructors.  Since its original inception in August 2013, this curriculum has been implemented in 172 lab sections (on two campuses), impacting 3839 STEM and allied health majors and 27 different faculty. The exercises have been published in student and instructor manuals which are available for course adoption through Hayden McNeil.  Our strategy of integrating research into the curriculum can be adopted by other institutions and is applicable across STEM disciplines.  Successful implementation in up to 45 lab sections per year at two campuses demonstrates the feasibility of transference of individual modules or the entire lab sequence to similar institutions, especially those with urban, open-enrollment student populations.  For our faculty, this approach has promoted the scholarship of teaching and learning, professional development in active teaching and learning strategies, curriculum redesign, and has led to the development of a departmental community of scholars dedicated to teaching students the process and application of science.  Members of this community have transformed the second course in our introductory biology sequence using the LEAPS curriculum as a model.  Interestingly, preliminary data indicates a 7% increase (41.8% average 2010-2012 to 48.21% average 2013-2015) in retention to our second semester introductory biology course since the implementation of the new curriculum.   Additionally, our faculty have introduced other engaging and active teaching strategies (research, case studies, clickers, etc) into other course offerings in the department. While our students have developed skills that prepare them for success in STEM disciplines, they have also compiled novel data regarding local Wolbachia distribution, helped develop our curriculum, became teaching assistants and peer-mentors, and have even been recruited to be research collaborators.  Overall, our department has seen a significant increase in student interest and demand for undergraduate research experiences.  Project ownership is a key factor that leads to persistence in the sciences and has been shown to be related to student retention.  For the past two years, we have been assessing student engagement in the LEAPS curriculum by surveying students? sense of project ownership using questions from a validated survey tool (Hanauer et al 2014). Students report a high level of project ownership of their introductory biology research experience.  This seems to translate to greater engagement within the major.  Since 2006, the total number of independent research credit hours in biology has increased 9-fold.  Preliminary analyses indicate that one increase occurred in 2010 following the implementation of our college?s five-year, NSF-funded STEP research program; however, a greater increase was observed between 2014 and 2017 following initiation of the LEAPS curriculum.  Five of our faculty have expanded their scholarship to include supervision of undergraduate research projects focused on Wolbachia-related research questions.  Results from the LEAPS project have been disseminated at regional and national conferences, and one manuscript has been published.
