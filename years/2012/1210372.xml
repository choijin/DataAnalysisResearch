<AbstractNarration>This award will support a long-term comprehensive spectropolarimetric survey of all types of supernovae.  The principal goal of this effort is to improve the understanding of the characteristics and importance of asymmetries in supernova explosions by focusing on the observable evolution.  Polarimetry allows one to probe spatial scales in a supernova that cannot be resolved through direct imaging from earth or space.  Spectropolarimetry further enhances the power of this technique by revealing wavelength dependent variations that may result from optical depth dependent geometries.  In recent years, evidence has grown that nearly all supernovae exhibit departures from spherical symmetry.  These results, together with advances in computing power that enable full three dimensional modeling, are exposing the possibility that asymmetries are not just observable consequences of supernovae, but may in fact be a necessity of the explosion mechanism itself.  The investigators will obtain repeat spectropolarimetry of the brightest core collapse and thermonuclear.  These data will be augmented with both photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to have an impact on astrophysics as the diagnostic power of polarimetry continues to advance, especially in the era of giant telescopes and time-variable astronomy.  This project will also support a number of outreach and education efforts at each institution and will contribute to the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students.  In addition, Dr. Hoffman will continue her leadership of the Collaborative Research in Astrophysics (CORA) program at the University of Denver.  This program is based on studies that show that participation in group research projects increases retention of female students in scientifically and technically demanding majors.</AbstractNarration>

But although supernovae are fundamental contributors to our understanding of the cosmos, much about them is still not well understood, including the shapes they create as their stellar material explodes into space. The SNSPOL project, which was funded by this award, measured the polarization of light emitted from over 100 supernovae to investigate their shapes and distribution of material in the explosions as they changed over time.

Understanding this type of supernova is key to identifying the characteristics of the stars that explode, which can help us learn how stars change over their lifetimes and whether a binary companion is necessary to create some kinds of supernovae.

She used these results to extrapolate the characteristics of the stellar wind that could have created the disk-like configuration of material, and concluded the progenitor star was most likely a very hot, evolved star called a luminous blue variable (LBV). LBVs lose mass in dramatic episodes such as the one that created the well-known &ldquo;hourglass&rdquo; structure in eta Carinae.

The dense, hot material in the bow shock and surrounding nebula can polarize light, and these polarization signatures may persist even after the star has exploded, thus contributing to SNSPOL&rsquo;s measurements of supernova polarization. Shrestha tested a range of bow shock densities, temperatures, orientations, and illumination sources (Figure 2) and identified scenarios in which her models, combined with polarization measurements, can reveal unique information about the stellar wind and the star&rsquo;s ultimate fate.

The campers came primarily from low-income families and racial backgrounds underrepresented in science; they participated at no cost and took home all camp materials including telescopes, tripods, computers and peripherals, and insect-collecting kits (Figure 3).
