<AbstractNarration>This REU Site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site led by Professors Osvaldo Cox and Beatriz Zayas both at Universidad Metropolitana in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The REU Site is located at four campuses of the University of Puerto Rico and the Arecibo Observatory. The research projects supported at these Sites entitled, "Research Training in Cross-disciplinary Chemical Sciences" will engage disadvantaged Hispanic STEM students and will to bring together five institutions and a multidisciplinary mentoring team to increase the research competitiveness of these chemistry students and improve their numbers in the STEM pipeline in the chemical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site anticipates an increase in chemistry majors who will experience research competitiveness, gain confidence, and develop an interest in graduate schools, as well as become professionals who are prepared to enter the STEM workforce. This REU will also benefit the entire community of chemistry students at UMET who can also participate in the REU developmental activities during the academic year. It brings together five institutions and a mentoring team who will increase the research competitiveness of these students and positively impact the STEM pipeline in the chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

The participating institutions were: Universidad Metropolitana, University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras, University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, University of Puerto Rico at Humacao, and the Arecibo Observatory.</p> <p>Project based learning was used to mentor undergraduates during thirty-two (32) weeks in the academic year and eight weeks (8) weeks during the summer.&nbsp; The research mentors were well established researchers from the campuses involved in the project. The REU summer experiences offered to the students included a selection of mentors in the five sites in Puerto Rico, as well as opportunities at research labs in the United States. This project was also able offer an opportunity to students to travel with their mentors to universities in the mainland to conduct research with major research instrumentation not available in Puerto Rico. One of the sites was the Center for Materials Science and Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the other was at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (known as CHESS), at Cornell University.</p> <p>An important component of the project was the mentoring offered to the undergraduates during the academic year. The students participated in weekly meetings where they attended lectures on various research topics from mentors and invited speakers. This offered them the opportunity to share with established scientists and begin to network and envision their future STEM careers. Additionally, during the working lunches, students had the opportunity to present their own work and to share with their peers and mentors their research work and travel experiences. Among the presented topics during these activities were: seminars/workshops in research-essential techniques, research ethics, safety measures, scientific English writing, and GRE math strategies.</p> <p>These undergraduate students produced more than sixty (60) research posters, oral presentations in Research Symposia, Conferences, and Meetings in Puerto Rico and the US Mainland. Additionally, three (3) papers were published in peer-reviewed journals.&nbsp; REU student&rsquo;s participation in these events was outstanding, several of them were recognized as best posters and oral presentations while others received especial awards such as the Waters Corporation Award.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the close of the project, already nineteen (19) of the REU students had completed their Bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in Chemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology, and Environmental Sciences with ten of these entering graduate programs in Puerto Rico and the US Mainland to the following institutions: University of Pennsylvania, the University of Puerto Rico (Mayaguez and Rio Piedras Campuses), Florida International University, Southern California University of Health Sciences, Wright State University, Boston University, and the University of Texas Pan American.</p> <p>As broader impact, this REU project have increased research competitiveness, confidence and interest in graduate schools, as well as professionals prepared for the STEM workforce.
