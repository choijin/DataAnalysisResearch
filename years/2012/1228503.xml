<AbstractNarration>Autism presents major public health concerns. Almost one in every hundred children born today has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  Most research has been directed to causation and treatment of ASDs in childhood, although much remains.  However, little is known about these children as adults: how they adapt; their social, legal, and medical needs; their challenges and successes.  As they become adults, persons with ASD may face many different concerns, including employment discrimination, independent living, educational needs, health insurance, medical treatment and capacity to consent, risks of exploitation in business dealings, guardianship and conservatorship, and more.  The affective disabilities characteristic of ASD also may affect work performance, relationships, community living, social and recreational opportunities, abilities to access governmental services, encounters with law enforcement, and other legal needs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Utah's postdoctoral fellow in Law and Social Science will develop an understanding of the experiences of adults with ASD and their legal needs.  Unique data resources are available at the University of Utah, including families involved in long-term genetics research in the Utah Autism Research Program and the extensive family and other data in the Utah Population Database.  Individuals in these families will also be able to provide valuable insight into attitudes about the growing number of genetic tests becoming available for ASD.   From these data, the fellow will identify issues facing adults with ASD, research the experiences and needs of adults with ASDs, and explore unmet legal needs of these adults and their families.  Mentoring the fellow are law faculty at the S.J. Quinney College of Law, social scientists, physicians, and lawyers representing persons with disabilities at the Utah Disability Law Center.  A planned outcome of the project is the identification and recommendation of legal proposals that may be critical across the life cycle of people with ASD.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Diagnoses of autism in the United States are increasing annually.  In addition, numbers of persons with intellectual disabilities surviving to adulthood are also increasing annually.  Although a great deal of attention has been paid to the needs of children with intellectual disabilities, much less study has been devoted to these persons as they reach adulthood.  In particular, studies of their legal needs and whether an how these needs are being met are lacking.  This study employed a post-doctoral fellow to research the legal needs of adults with diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder.  It began by identifying the areas of greatest legal need:  understanding the factors influencing guardianship and other protective proceedings, and understanding needs with respect to housing, employment, and other social services.    Key findings included that individuals with autism diagnoses are more likely to be under guardianship if they are more severely symptomatic but that guardianship in this population was not associated with psychiatric or physical comorbidities. Parents are overwhelmingly likely be be guardians of their adult children with intellectual disabilities, a finding that will raise questions about the need for additional support as these adults and their parents age. Persons with autism under guardianship are more likely, even controlling for the severity of their conditions, not to receive vocational rehabilitation but to receive Medicaid, Social Security, or other disability services.  Guardianships were far more likely to be plenary than to be limited.  Many guardianship determinations were made without specific medical determination and with a waiver of the respondent's presence.  Factors influencing adherence to legal protocols for guardianship determinations included whether the petitioner was the parent of the respondent and whether the petitioner selected the representative for the respondent.  Public policy outcomes of this research included development of a program for independent pro bono representation of respondents to guardianship proceedings and continuing efforts to develop legislative proposals for supported decision making.  Further research on guardianship is ongoing, as is research on reasonable accommodations in employment and housing for adults with intellectual disabilities.
