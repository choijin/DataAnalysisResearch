<AbstractNarration>This Informal Science Education project is about facilitating learning STEM concepts by integrating a historical perspective (Conner Prairie Museum) and a science center-based perspective (Science Museum of Minnesota). This unique integration coupled with the well established protocol of the Conner Prairie Historical Museum interactive learning suggests the development of a new approach to learning STEM concepts that may be helpful to families. Further, this approach will be adapted and piloted in four additional historical museum venues in order to gain confidence in broadening the reach of the idea. Finally, an open source template will be generated enabling other museums to adapt the ideas generated in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on the extensive studies of Conner Prairie on learning strategies in the historical context and the learning strategies and development of the exhibit by the Science Museum of Minnesota. The integration is fairly complex deriving sufficient understanding of each other's approaches and professional development. It is anticipated that both participants will gain from the experiment. Included in the plan are an additional two to four STEM concepts, but the first experiment will concentrate on energy and electricity. Museum visitors will experience the decorum of a period-dressed docent, the history of energy derivation and progressions to the present with opportunities to experiment with energy driven efficiency (wind-charger blade design, for example) and the newest generators. In addition, there will be opportunities for the families to learn more about electricity use and storage. During the development phases and on-the-floor time, visitors and staff will be evaluated not only to assess the success of the concepts, but also in an effort to enhance the learning and experience. Evaluation of visitors will occur at the site as well as various periods after the visitation. Finally, four additional history-based museums will be participating in the design and development of the exhibit from the initial phases as well actually setting up adapted exhibits in their own facilities near the end of the experiment. These museum participants include: The Museum of America and the Sea, Mystic, Connecticut; The Oliver H. Kelley Farm, Minnesota Historical Society, Elk River, Minnesota;  The California State Railroad Museum, California State Parks, Sacramento, California; and The Wabash County Historical Museum, Wabash, Indiana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The careful and documented effort of this integration and subsequent implementation is to generate a model for the concept so that it can be adapted broadly both in history museums and science centers. An open template shall be generated to facilitate adaptation by other sites. Further, the issue of learning under this regimen will be reported with the evaluation results. An additional distinction in this endeavor is that most of the visitors are rural families.</AbstractNarration>

The project also included four other participant history museums: Mystic Seaport, the Wabash County (Ind.) Historical Museum, Oliver H. Kelley Farm, and the California State Railroad Museum. These institutions vary in size, geographic location and subject matter focus, and each created their own history-and-STEM exhibitions developed in alignment with historical narratives relevant to their institutions.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<em>Create.Connect</em> exhibition went through multiple rounds of evaluation which allowed the project team to test and further develop best practices for integrating history and STEM learning. The goal of the project was to present a balanced interdisciplinary learning experience, where visitors would engage with both STEM and history ideas during their visit.&nbsp;</p> <p>The culmination of this work was the final&nbsp;<em>Create.Connect </em>exhibition at Conner Prairie, which features four areas, each of which focuses on a time in Indiana history when STEM innovations impacted people&rsquo;s lives. All four areas include related hands-on STEM make-and-test activities, where visitors mirror the engineering and design process by creating, testing and adjusting something they create, such as an electric circuit. &nbsp;Each area is designed to resemble a time and place from the past and includes hands-on historical objects and period-appropriate media and costumed interpreters. The four participant history museums also developed and fabricated their own smaller history and STEM exhibitions that combine these elements and highlight local historical stories that relate to STEM innovation.</p> <p>During the summative evaluation of Create.Connect, evaluators collected visitor data through observation, surveys, recorded conversations and interviews. The team found that visitors spent a significant amount of time making and testing at the STEM activity tables. The majority of these groups exhibited behaviors that are associated with successful engagement in STEM pursuits, such trying a different approach to solving a problem. This was true of both boys and girls who were observed using the exhibition. The majority of visitors also interacted with some aspect of the historical setting, such as a media component or hands-on historical object. The summative evaluation also showed that nearly all visitors (99%) felt the exhibition made sense and fit in at Conner Prairie. The four participant history museums also found that their exhibitions were well-received by staff and visitors, and that participating in this project expanded staff capacities and has even sparked new STEM initiatives at their institutions. Data collected at two of the participant sites show that their exhibits are being used in much the same way and to the same extent as the <em>Create.Connect</em> exhibition.</p> <p>Understanding and leveraging the power of family conversations has long been a focus for Conner Prairie, and the project team wanted to explore the features of family conversation in <em>Create.Connect.</em>&nbsp;Evaluators recorded the conversations of adult-child pairs as they explored <em>Create.Connect</em> and analyzed these conversations for evidence of engagement with history and STEM, domain-specific thinking within each discipline, and moments when visitors seemed to be engaging with history and STEM at the same time. In recorded family conversations, every family group talked about STEM topics or described their approach to making and testing at the activity tables. Over three-quarters (80%) of these groups also discussed the historical context presented in the exhibition. Every recorded family group also verbalized thinking strategies that are associated with higher-level engagement with STEM, such as using the activity as a model to better understand STEM in the real world, and 66% of cases showed evidence of higher-level thinking about history, such as comparing the past and present. About half of the recorded family groups had discussions that could be described as interdisciplinary; for example, trying to understand a historical technology like a windmill from an engineering perspective, or experimenting with a technology and talking about how it might be used in the past. It is in these conversations that we can begin to understand the unique features of interdisciplinary learning that were a goal of this project.</p> <p>These findings generated by the iterative development and evaluation of <em>Create.Connect</em> show that history museums are viable venues for informal STEM learning. Information on this model of history and STEM integration is available for free to any institution that is interested in creating an interdisciplinary experience of their own through the project website <a href="http://www.createconnect.org/">www.createconnect.org</a>. The evaluation of <em>Create.Connect</em> provides a glimpse of the power of interdisciplinary learning and suggests avenues for future research to better understand how children and families integrate distinct disciplines in informal learning environments.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/21/2016<br>      Modified by: Cathy&nbsp;Ferree</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1223770/1223770_10203460_1476454248596_DSC_0969--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1223770/1223770_10203460_1476454248596_DSC_0969--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Create.Connect"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1223770/1223770_10203460_1476454248596_DSC_0969--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Create.Connect"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Create.Connect exhibition at Conner Prairie was opened in March of 2014 after several rounds of prototyping and evaluation.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Courtesy of Conner Prairie</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Cathy&nbsp;Ferree</div> <div class="imageTitle">Create.Connect</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1223770/1223770_10203460_1476455430027_DSC_0918--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1223770/1223770_10203460_1476455430027_DSC_0918--rgov-800width.jpg" title="A combination of activity, setting and facilitation."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1223770/1223770_10203460_1476455430027_DSC_0918--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A combination of activity, setting and facilitation."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The model of exhibit development that the project team created combines historical settings and objects with hands-on STEM activities that relate to the history stories presented, augmented by live facilitation.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Courtesy of Conner Prairie</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Cathy&nbsp;Ferree</div> <div class="imageTitle">A combination of activity, setting and facilitation.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1223770/1223770_10203460_1476456020827_DSC_0325--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1223770/1223770_10203460_1476456020827_DSC_0325--rgov-800width.jpg" title="STEM activities with a historical connection"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1223770/1223770_10203460_1476456020827_DSC_0325--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="STEM activities with a historical connection"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">At the hands-on STEM activities, visitors experiment with STEM concepts, such as making a working circuit.
