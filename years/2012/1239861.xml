<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a web-based, general-use handbook, titled "A Field Guide to Maize Mutant Phenotypes".  The guide will describe ~175 common mutant phenotypes of the maize (Zea mays L.) plant, each with a brief descriptive caption along with one or more photographs clearly showing the condition. The Field Guide will also have a short glossary of common maize terms and plant parts. Introductory material will discuss issues commonly encountered when attempting to describe observed mutations in the corn genetics field; for example, effects of background, nutrition, or disease. The Field Guide will be organized into logical phenotypic groups and include accurate definitions of the most common phenotypes of maize as well as photographs that clearly show each condition described.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Field Guide will be an entry point for new researchers, from undergraduate students to postdoctoral researchers and established scientists whose expertise lies outside of maize research.  It will serve as a resource for developing questions, and recognizing at a glance phenotypes commonly seen in the field. Because the Field Guide is image-based, it will provide a simple way for researchers and students working with other organisms, both plants and animals, to look for phenotypic similarities.  The guide will be made available online through MaizeGDB  (http://www.maizegdb.org/) for screen viewing and printing, and for download as an application for mobile devices.</AbstractNarration>
