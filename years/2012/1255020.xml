<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1255020&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Many challenges face the emerging field of nanotechnology. Engineers, scientists and policy makers must balance the promise of beneficial nano-enabled products and applications with the potential negative impacts resulting from the release of these novel materials into the environment. The ability to detect, quantify and track engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in the environment is a key to understanding the environmental implications of these materials. At present, there is a lack of suitable methods for detecting ENPs in environmental matrices. For some classes of nanomaterials such as metal oxides, a major challenge is simply distinguishing between ENPs and the natural background &lt;br/&gt;concentration of the element(s) in question. Given this challenge, the PI hypothesizes that labeling ENPs with elements of low background concentration will facilitate their sensitive and unambiguous detection in the environment. This hypothesis will be tested through the completion of three tasks: (1) synthesis of labeled ENPs using doping and/or core/shell techniques; (2) characterization of labeled ENP physicochemical properties and comparison with unlabeled ENPs; and (3) spike and recovery of labeled ENPs from representative environmental matrices using ICP-MS and Instrument Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA), an analytical technique with high sensitivity and low susceptibility to matrix effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complex, multi-faceted and multi-disciplinary challenges facing the emerging field of nanotechnology environmental health and safety also highlight the need for a workforce of scientists and engineers with excellent critical thinking  skills and a firm grasp of the scientific method. There is a need for innovative teaching methods that focus on this type of development. Integrated with the proposed research, the PI will develop, implement and assess a novel virtual laboratory pedagogy for environmental engineers focused on ENP removal from water. The industrially-situated, problem-based instructional design centered on the iterative process of designing experiments, running virtual trials, and analyzing data will facilitate the development of key skills and knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research will result in the development of a unique method to detect and quantify ENPs in environmental matrices. This work is transformative because it results in a tool that will enable the work of many others studying environmental transport, fate, toxicity, modeling and risk assessment of ENPs. The larger body of work made possible by the project, both by the PI and by many others, will likely facilitate the establishment of real science-based regulations for the safe handling of ENPs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a virtual laboratory for environmental engineers has tremendous potential to improve environmental engineering education both at OSU and at institutions across the country. Appropriately balancing the benefits of nanotechnology with the risks to the environment is a key challenge and preparing engineers for these types of open-ended and ambiguous tasks is critical for success. The work proposed here integrates fundamental scientific inquiry and novel tool development with the development of novel pedagogy for training tomorrow's engineers. The proposed virtual laboratory will expose students to the emerging field of nanotechnology environmental health and safety while developing the the broad and universal skills, knowledge and expertise necessary to tackle these emerging challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other broader impacts include the formation of human capital through the education of at least two graduate students in nanomaterial synthesis, characterization, and presence/behavior in the environment. In addition, the PI will strengthen the educational experience at all levels in the School of Chemical, Biological and Environmental Engineering at OSU through 1) the incorporation of research findings into undergraduate and graduate courses and 2) providing research experiences for high school and undergraduate students through established programs at OSU (Johnson Scholars, ASE and SESEY). These students will become an integral part of the research team on the work in question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of the experimental and educational research will be disseminated at national and international conferences and top journals in the field of environmental engineering and engineering education will be targeted for wide publication. The developed virtual laboratory pedagogy will be made available for use by other engineering institutions in the U.S. and abroad.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) and nanotechnology-enabled products hold tremendous potential to improve society through the novel properties they exhibit. Yet, these potential benefits must be appropriately weighed against the risks that these novel materials pose to environmental and human health. One key question in this regard is how engineered nanomaterials behave when they enter aquatic systems including groundwater, surface water and seawater. How are ENMs transformed, and their properties changed, as they move through lifecycle stages of manufacture, use and disposal? Where do ENMs end up if released to the environment? Answering these questions is made difficult when the ENMs in question are made of elements common in the environment. For example how do we tell the difference between an engineered TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle and naturally occurring TiO<sub>2</sub> in the environment (Ti is the 9<sup>th</sup> most abundant element in the Earth's crust)? The objective of this research was to develop tools and approaches to improve our understanding of ENM behavior in aquatic systems so as to better quantify the risks of this promising class of materials. Integrated with the research was an effort to develop a novel teaching/learning pedagogy that aims to better simulate industry practice and complement/enhance traditional laboratory experiences for environmental engineering students.</p> <p>In this project, our research team developed and demonstrated the use of gold core, titanium shell nanoparticles as a tool for examining the transport and fate of metal oxide nanoparticles in environmental systems. The gold core can be used as a "tracer" due to its low abundance in most environmental systems while the titanium dioxide shell ensures that the particles mimic their unlabeled counterparts. This tool and approach has the potential to facilitate the study of metal oxide transport and uptake in complex environmental systems in fields ranging from environmental science and engineering to toxicology. Our work included developing guidelines for selecting appropriate labeling techniques for examining ENM behavior and toxicity.</p> <p>Our team also utilized gold nanoparticles as a model system to investigate the role of natural and engineered surface coatings on the ENM behavior. We demonstrated that the behavior of pristine, "as manufactured" ENMs was strongly influenced by the chemistry of the engineered surface coatings in both synthetic and natural waters. However, when these same particles were exposed to municipal wastewater, a likely step in the lifecycle of an ENM, their properties and behavior were significantly altered. Further, the behavior of the "aged" ENMs were distinct from their pristine counterparts, highlighting the need to perform laboratory experiments using materials more realistic of those expected to be encountered in the environment (i.e., having undergone relevant environmental transformations).

These findings provide important parameters necessary for the mathematical modeling of ENM transport as well as guidance for the design and execution of laboratory-based assessments of these processes.
