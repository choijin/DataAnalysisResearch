<AbstractNarration>Amazonia is Earth's most iconic center of biological diversity and endemism and is among the most important terrestrial biomes due to its contributions to global systems ecology. This project seeks to answer an overarching question in biodiversity science: How was the modern Amazonian biota and its environment assembled across space and time?  The research is designed to understand the evolutionary and environmental-ecological history of late Neogene-Recent Amazonia through a comparative approach that integrates across the disciplines of systematics, population biology, ecosystem structure and function, geology, Earth systems modeling and remote sensing, and environmental history. The project also investigates how biotic and environmental change over this time-period influenced Amazonian functional diversity in biogeochemical flows, and how these, in turn, shaped the dimensions of biodiversity seen today as well as the history of global-scale changes in biogeochemical cycling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, which is a collaboration with Brazilian scientists and funding agencies, represents the most integrative examination of Amazonian biodiversity and its history to date.  The approaches taken describe a methodological template for analyzing information about the history of biotic and environmental change across large, ecologically complex landscapes that can be generalized to other systems.  The project creates a large framework for formal and informal education including the training of students, development of a major museum exhibit on Amazonia, workshops for K-12 STEM teachers, publications in professional educational journals, and a web portal, The Evolutionary Encyclopedia of Amazonian Biodiversity, that will make all results available to the public, as well as serve as an informational platform about Amazonian biodiversity and its global importance. This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Amazon is a vast area of mostly tropical rainforest that spreads over portions of multiple countries in South America and harbors the highest diversity of species of any of biome in the world. Our large collaborative grant included seven academic institutions in the United States, and partner investigators in Brazil, Canada, Great Britain, and Argentina, funded by local science and federal agencies.  Our research posed a series of major questions designed to significantly advance our understanding of the origins of the Amazonian environment, and its biota, and potentially predict its future.  In order to do that we assembled an integrative team of systematic and evolutionary biologists and ecologists specializing on butterflies, birds, primates, and tropical trees, as well as geologists specializing in hydrology, stratigraphy, palynology, paleoclimate, and remote sensing.  One primary goal was to build an evolutionary tree for the organisms we were studying at the species level using modern genome-based data.  Once having this, we sought to understand the historical assembly of the Amazon biota and to understand the events in Earth history that resulted in the modern Brazilian landscape and its diversity.  The project has completed its primary genomic objective of sequencing most of the target species using ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) of the genome yielding many thousands of gene fragments for each species. Our sampling now encompasses more than 2000 species, the largest for any region of the world.  The phylogenies and their temporal pattern of our target organisms provide strong evidence that the current Amazon landscape and its extant biota is relatively "young."  We infer that most of the contemporary vertebrate and butterfly species are generally less than a million years old but that plant species are on average slightly old. This finding of a young biota is a generality that conflicts with much of the narrative in the scientific literature on Amazonia.  In coordination with these biological studies, the geologists of our group have investigated the temporal history of the Amazon river system using field studies of stratigraphy and hydrology as well as remote sensing.  Their results are largely consistent with those of biology, namely that the Amazonian landscape is geologically young, and substantial expanses of the flood plains, and their forests, are hundreds of thousands old or young, whereas the upland terra firme forest is older.  Thus, Earth history and biotic history are largely consistent with one another spatially and temporally.  Because we have the largest sampling of birds, primates, and several diverse angiosperm families currently available for Amazonia, we are able to describe patterns and  mechanisms of the origin of Amazonian diversity at a much finer spatial and temporal scale than ever before. This work also entails the implementation of novel methods of biogeographic analysis.  This research has been exceedingly productive.  Our team has annotated 225 publications  across the disciplines of the grant, with the last publication date included being 2018-2019.  Many other papers have been published or are in press since then.  Numerous synthetic papers have been published in books and key journals in the relevant fields.  The training and outreach components of the research have been significant.  A large number of students, associated with investigators on the grant, have been trained at multiple levels.  This includes ~20 technicians, 45 Masters students, 56 PhDs, and 26 postdocs across the fields of systematic botany, butterflies, birds, primates, geology, and data analysis. Members of the consortium organized nine symposia on our results at various meetings in the United States, Brazil, France, and Australia, presented 262 talks or posters over the course of the project, and participated in at least 58 public outreach interviews, online articles, and public talks.   In addition, the grant has helped support extensive training of several hundred middle- and high-school science teachers with hands-on workshops that educated them about Amazonian diversity and also trained them in remote sensing methods to provide them with the tools to do their own research on environmental change in the classroom.     This collaborative research has impacted not only the institutions of the co-PIs but also internationally, and particularly in Brazil, mainly through the spread of genomic-scale studies within ornithological and plant systematics. Because our research adopted ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) as the data source, many graduate students in the U.S. and Brazilian institutions who were undertaking studies on South American groups adopted these genomic methods to enhance comparisons. This also resulted in multiple graduate students coming to the U.S. for training and education.  These tools have been transferred to a large number of students who now have academic or research positions in Brazil. Moreover, there is little question that the interdisciplinary nature of the research has fostered more integrative studies among the primary geological and biological investigators.
