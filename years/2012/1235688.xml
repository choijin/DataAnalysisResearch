<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;1235688 (Skerlos).  The objective of this project is to quantify the net greenhouse gas emissions associated with using carbon dioxide (CO2) as an input to sustainable manufacturing operations. CO2-based processes have been found to serve as excellent substitutes for processes utilizing large quantities of toxic and polluting materials in manufacturing. However, companies considering the on-site use of CO2 face an instant and major increase in "carbon footprint" according to current carbon accounting and life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies. Current accounting and LCA practices make CO2 use appear unfavorable from a sustainability perspective when the import of CO2 to manufacturing operations can provide clear benefits to the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research will be to advance the field of consequential life cycle assessment (cLCA) to enable estimation of the market driven emissions associated with the recovery and use of CO2 in sustainable manufacturing operations. Current economic allocation methods are inadequate for this purpose. Therefore an economic allocation methodology will be created that encompasses market forces, technology selection, and process substitution options. The cLCA methodology will then be exercised using life cycle modeling to permit an estimation of emissions associated with CO2 capture from various sources (e.g., the production of hydrogen, ammonia, and ethanol) as well as from different modes of transportation (e.g., trucking versus pipeline). Then regional supply burdens associated with the supply of recovered CO2 will be estimated for the entire US. Having addressed the supply-side emissions, the project will then estimate demand-side emissions associated with replacing existing manufacturing technologies with CO2 based technologies. Three case studies will be developed: semiconductor manufacturing, machine cleaning, and metalworking. Putting the regional supply side emissions together with the net demand-side emissions will allow the market driven emissions associated with recovered CO2 to be determined for sustainable manufacturing operations. We will extend the methodology to show how the framework for cLCA created for commodity gases can be extended to other commodity and pseudo-commodity materials (e.g., alloys of aluminum) used in sustainable design and manufacturing applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal will include advancements in the general field of cLCA, cLCA education for undergraduate, graduate, and distance learning students at the University of Michigan (UM), cLCA education for LCA students and practitioners world-wide, and the needed development of cLCA graduate student talent in the U.S. UM has recently launched a Program in Sustainable Engineering with a cornerstone undergraduate course in Sustainable Engineering. This course (CEE 265), which teaches approximately 125 students per semester (and growing), already teaches economic and environmental assessment methods and will in future directly teach the cLCA methods developed in this project. Graduate students taking Sustainable Design of Technology Systems (ME 589: approximately 130 students per year) will study the case studies of this project in depth and apply the cLCA methodology in their term projects. In addition to journal and conference publications, a web based portal to cLCA resources will be created that will include at least five 20-minute video short courses and case studies based on this research. As part of the broader impacts of the project, modifications will be proposed to the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development accounting standards and also a working document will be developed to standardize the cLCA treatment of commodity gases in parallel with existing ISO LCA standards. It is also expected that, by challenging existing LCA and accounting treatments of carbon dioxide, it will be possible to promote the diffusion of CO2-based processes where appropriate as a sustainable manufacturing strategy.  The project PI recently led the development of a cLCA methodology for consumer products with market driven design, a methodology that recently attracted national attention via its use to analyze Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards. The development of an analogous cLCA methodology for industrial commodities, using similar economic methods, is a natural extension that can be anticipated to lead to significant research, education, and technology transfer impacts related to sustainable manufacturing and LCA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Commercial CO2 is almost exclusively obtained as a recovered waste product from ammonia plants, distilleries, ethylene oxide plants, and natural gas processing plants.  Prevalent practices in life cycle assessment, the most common tool for evaluating the environmental impacts of product and processes from their inception to their end of life, recommend that the environmental impacts of recovered CO2 be determined based on its mass, volume, or price relative to main product of the process such as ammonia or ethanol.  The problem with this approach is that mass and prices of CO2 have no causal relationship with the environmental impacts of the process of CO2 recovery and purification.  The approach in fact places the environmental burdens of the parent process of the recovered CO2 on the CO2 even though the parent process is built and operated to meet the demand for the main products such as ammonia or ethanol.  To overcome these methodological limitations and knowledge gaps surrounding the environmental impacts of industrially used CO2, our research thoroughly examined the recovered CO2 supply chain and CO2 recovery and purification processes.  Based on this study we developed a new "market-based" environmental impact allocation method for recovered CO2.  Under this approach, only impacts from those processes such as the recovery, purification, compression, and transportation of CO2 that are triggered on the margin due to the demand for commercial CO2 are ascribed to the CO2.  Consistent with this approach, we also developed a revised set of greenhouse gas accounting rules that distinguish between CO2 generation and CO2 emission, a distinction that currently does not exist but is necessary to properly account for reuse or sequestration as the ultimate fates for recovered CO2 (see Fig. 1).  Using this framework, we developed detailed emissions, energy use, and water use inventories for CO2 recovered from major industrial sources.The results show that mass or price-based impact allocation methods overestimate the impacts of recovered CO2 by a factor of 10 &ndash; 20.  Overall, we found that 1 tonne of recovered CO2 leads to additional greenhouse gas emissions of 147 &minus; 210 kg CO2 eq. while consuming 160 &minus; 248 kWh of electricity, 254 &minus; 480 MJ of heat, and 1836 &minus; 4027 kg of water (see Fig. 2).  The ranges depend on the initial and final purity of the CO2, particularly because higher purity grades require additional processing.  These inventories for recovered CO2 were applied to ascertain the life cycle impacts of using CO2 as coolant and lubricant metals machining operations (see Fig. 3) and as a cleaning agent in semiconductor device fabrication.  The results showed the use of CO2 over the conventional technologies in each of the applications significantly reduced the life cycle impacts of those processes, while providing better functional performance, and encouraged further exploration of CO2-based technologies in other industrial applications.  During this research we uncovered critical flaws in some of the published literature on the energy and economic penalty (i.e. additional energy and costs) arising from adding a CO2 capture plant to a fossil fuel plant.  We found that these studies often overlooked recursive mass and energy feedbacks that are inherent to carbon capture systems.  These feedbacks arise from the fact that to capture CO2 we need energy and when this energy is obtained by burning more fuel, it creates more CO2 to be captured.  When accounting for this feedback, we found that the fuel costs of a power plant can double as opposed to the 30 &ndash; 40% increase that the literature claimed (see Fig. 4).   In the context of retrofitting of existing power plants with carbon capture, this research further went on to establish the relationship between the pre-capture and post-capture efficiency of a power plant and quantified the effects of potentially more stringent quality requirements for CO2 sequestration on the thermal efficiency and costs of carbon capture.  Finally, the research also developed a set of analytic expressions for the thermal efficiency, CO2 emissions, and economics of all major carbon capture retrofit designs. The expressions and the design framework they are applied in dramatically reduce the computational cost of comparing design tradeoffs (see Fig. 5) and selecting optimal retrofit strategies for different power plants, which are normally evaluated using costly process simulation software.  The life cycle inventories for CO2 recovered from both industrial sources and fossil fuel power plants have been made available for public access through their respective research articles in the journal Environmental Science &amp; Technology.  Further, the mass and energy balance methods used, life cycle inventories developed, and methodological insights gained into life cycle assessment practices have been incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses on sustainable engineering and design at the University of Michigan through several case studies.
