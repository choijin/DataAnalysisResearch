<AbstractNarration>This study examines genomic consequences of population decline within the endangered Florida Scrub-Jay, a bird species currently disappearing across its entire range. Capitalizing on a remarkable 43-year study of a locally protected population, DNA from 4,000+ individual jays sampled over 25 years will be characterized and compared using 9,000+ genetic markers. Ancestor-descendant pedigree, behavioral and structural characteristics, and lifetime reproductive performance for each individual are well documented. Combining field and whole-genome data for such a large sample of individuals over multiple generations is unprecedented for a wild animal population, providing exceptional opportunity to 1) measure how a contracting population changes genetically through time; 2) associate specific genes with individual variation in performance-related attributes; 3) identify areas of the genome responsible for reduced performance among inbred individuals; and 4) document how changes in immigration rate affect genetic structure of local populations. Overall, this longitudinal genomic characterization of a declining population promises to be the most detailed ever conducted in a free-living organism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides being broadly informative for conservation genetics, this project is especially compelling because the Florida Scrub-Jay is a popular public symbol for biodiversity conservation amidst rapidly growing human populations. As local populations disappear, demand increases for information about the condition and viability of each population that remains. This study provides the means to measure genetic health of remnant populations, informs habitat protection priorities, and helps prescribe effective translocation strategies for genetic rescue of the most critically endangered populations. Students of all ages will gain experience in genetic methods, and outreach will occur at Archbold Biological Station and through Cornell Lab of Ornithology.</AbstractNarration>
