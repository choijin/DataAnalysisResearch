<AbstractNarration>Brominated flame-retardants (BFR) are ubiquitously distributed in the environment and capable of being transported to the arctic by long-range processes (i.e., global distillation). The proposed research would measure BFR concentrations in air and water, and study processes that control their fate in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and light from surface water bodies at the Toolik Lake long-term ecological research (LTER) station. Specific objectives include:&lt;br/&gt;1. measure BFR levels in air and water bodies at the Toolik Lake LTER;&lt;br/&gt;2. collect, isolate, and elucidate the structural and photolytic properties of DOM from water bodies at the Toolik LTER;&lt;br/&gt;3. study BFR partitioning to DOM and assess the role of DOM composition on this process;&lt;br/&gt;4. measure the degree to which direct and indirect photolysis occurs for BFR in the respective presence and absence of DOM using solar simulators and natural sunlight at Toolik Lake; &lt;br/&gt;5. identify the reaction products produced by the phototransformation of BFR; and&lt;br/&gt;6. elucidate reactive pathways that control the phototransformation of BFR in the presence of DOM.  &lt;br/&gt;This project would study a BFR environmental pathway that is a critical link in the bioaccumulation of these substances in the arctic food chain. It would primarily provide lab and logistical support for a doctoral student, and would also support an undergraduate assistant during the summer field season. The investigators plan an active outreach program including interfacing with the LTER Schoolyard program and ARCUS, and the graduate student would maintain a research blog.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) have been commonly used as flame-retardants in a large number of products ranging from childrenÃ†s clothes to circuit boards.  They have been recently classified as persistent organic pollutants (by the Stockholm Convention) that is readily transported to the Arctic through "global distillation" from lower latitudes.  They have a propensity to bioaccumulate up the food chain and could pose a threat to top predators and humans alike.  Even though the last of the PBDEs (deca-brominated or BDE-209) has been phased out of production their ubiquity in household products continues to be a source for these compounds.   In this study we 1) measured the atmospheric concentration of PBDEs in Arctic Alaska, USA to assess temporal variability in their atmospheric transport, 2) examined the role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in binding PBDE making them less bioavailable and possibly more amenable to attenuation by sunlight, and 3) determine whether photolysis in the presence of DOM produces the more toxic lower brominated congeners (variants of the diphenyl ether molecule with one or more bromines attached) of PBDE.  Studies were conducted at Toolik Lake Field Station (TFS), which is an integral part of the NSF Arctic Long Term Ecosystem Research site that is located on the North Slope of AlaskaÃ†s Brooks Range (68o 63" N).  We collected air and water samples and isolated DOM from a variety of water bodies in and around TFS.  Experiments were conducted at TFS as well as back at Ohio State and the University of Otago (Dunedin, New Zealand who is our collaborator on this project).   We collected air samples for Task 1 from around TFS and observed strong seasonal variability in the distribution of these substances whereby the lower brominated congeners had the highest abundances early in the summer while the higher brominated PBDEs (like BDE-209) appeared later in the season.  The BDE congeners associated with the penta-BDE commercial mixture (BDE?47, -99, and -100) were the most frequently detected BFRs and were found at concentrations consistent with those reported for other Arctic sites. Correlations with temperature suggested that either volatilization from local sources or re-emission from secondary sources (that is, re-volatilization of BFRs that had migrated northwards from distant sources) was the mechanism for lower-brominated PBDE transport during the warmer months.  Finally, the higher brominated PBDE compounds were predominantly associated with particles as oppose to the gas phase.   For Task 2 the partitioning of six PBDE congeners between Arctic DOM and water was measured using the aqueous solubility enhancement method. Measured dissolved organic carbon&ndash;water partition coefficients (KDOC) values were nearly an order of magnitude lower than previously reported values for the same PBDE congeners determined for soil or commercial humic acids and varied from 103.97 to 105.16 L Kg-1 of organic carbon.  Measured results compared favorably with values calculated using poly-parameter linear free energy (pp-LFER) models.  Thus, the magnitude of the KDOC value for these compounds is a metric of their bioavailability.  Those compounds with high KDOC values tend to be less bioavailable and for many of these compounds they prefer the DOM phase in Arctic surface waters.   Finally in Task 3 we investigated the mechanisms and products formed when 2,2Ã†,4,4Ã†-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) is photolyzed in solutions of water and a range of DOM (Arctic derived and from other locations) assuming that the partitioning mechanism described previously influences its photofate.  We observed that BDE-47 undergoes both direct (degradation by sunlight alone) and indirect photolysis (in the presence of a catalyst like DOM) with rate constants of 4.8 x 10-6 s-1 in distilled water and up to 8.9 x 10-6 s-1 in DOM.  The rate of reaction was strongly dependent on DOM composition and increased with the DOM electron...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
