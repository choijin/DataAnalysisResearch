<AbstractNarration>Polymer foam core sandwich composites have been utilized for modern marine vessels, civil infrastructures and large wind turbine blades. These structures experience continuous cycles of loadings and continuous exposure to hostile environments, which could lead to degradation in the materials and structural failures. Our aim is to predict the time when global failure starts, and its critical location in the sandwich structures during their service. This will be achieved through the development of material and structural models for the sandwich structures that incorporate the time-dependent mechanical loadings coupled with thermal and moisture diffusion, and degradation in the properties of the constituents.  A comprehensive testing scheme including accelerated fatigue tests will be conducted on the sandwich composite and its constituents at different loading histories and various moisture and temperature conditions. The experimental results will be used to characterize the material parameters in the time-dependent (creep) material model, hygro-thermal diffusions, and degradation model for each component of the sandwich structures and verify the prediction of the time and mode when fatigue failure initiates in the sandwich structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thick and multi-layered nature of sandwich structures lead to multiple failure mechanisms, which can be difficult to detect from their surfaces. Currently, fatigue failure in sandwich composites has been determined mainly by counting the number of repeated loading cycles until overall failure is observed in the composites without any explanation on the failure mechanisms and consideration of the environmental conditions. The results of this study will significantly improve our understanding on the life performance and fatigue failure mechanisms in many structures and infrastructures made of polymer sandwich composites undergoing mechanical loadings while being exposed to hostile environments. The research outcomes will help engineers in improving the design of structures/infrastructures made of these composites in order to avoid catastrophic failures. This information can also help manufacturers and researchers designing better quality polymeric composites. The proposed modeling concept will address the above challenges, which will enhance the reliability of polymeric sandwich structures and hence public safety.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Sandwich composites are often exposed to complex loadings, such as due to gust wind in turbine blades and intense cyclic loading in bridge decks, in addition to a constant exposure to hostile environments, i.e., temperature changes and fluid sorption. Coupled mechanical loading and hostile environments cause the constituents of the sandwich structures (polymeric foams, composite skins with fiber reinforcement) to experience different time-dependent behavior and degradation: polymers show pronounced viscoelastic response at elevated temperatures and high humidity, and hostile environments accelerate the degradation. The thick-layered nature of these structures leads to heterogeneities at various scales (see <strong>Image 1</strong>): skin, core, fiber-matrix constituents, which causes multiple failure mechanisms, making it hard to predict their failure behavior.</p> <p>This study aims at understanding the effects of different time and field coupling (temperature, moisture, and mechanical load) response of the constituents (epoxy matrix, glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) skin, polyurethane foam core) on the life performance of polymer sandwich constructions, and predicting durability of sandwich structures due to various external mechanical loadings and environmental conditions. The results of this study improve our understanding on the durability and lifetime performance of polymer composites, and will enhance the reliability of using polymer sandwich composites.</p> <p>Highlights of research findings are summarized below:</p> <p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A multi-scale approach was considered in order to incorporate different responses of the constituents in the sandwich structures, due to continuous changes in mechanical loading and environmental conditions. <strong>Image 1</strong> illustrates the stress, deformation, and temperature response in sandwich composites under simultaneous heat conduction and mechanical loading.

In some materials, volume changes during the diffusion process were not negligible, and the commonly used Fickian diffusion was not adequate in capturing the diffusion process. A couple deformation-diffusion model was then considered. <strong>Image 2</strong> summarizes the diffusion behaviors in a sandwich composite and its constituents (polyurethane foam, epoxy matrix, and glass fiber reinforced polymer skins) immersed in deionized water at two temperatures: 25<sup>o</sup>C and 50<sup>o</sup>C.

A multi-scale approach was used to integrate different response of the constituents in predicting the overall response of sandwich composites. <strong>Image 3</strong> shows the results from the model and experimental tests, and good correlation between the model and experiments was observed. Specimens that were subjected to more severe environment (water diffusion at 50<sup>o</sup>C) experienced reduction in the stiffness and strength.

The macroscopic response of composite showed small hysteretic area due to the existence of elastic fibers, however at the local region of the polymeric matrix, more pronounced hysteretic response was observed. The hysteretic loops changed with time due to the continuous temperature increase, which eventually soften the polymeric matrix. Voids are often seen in composites, due to manufacturing defects. The existence of voids in composites accelerated the time-dependent failure, indicated by significant increases in the strains.

The energy dissipation caused continuous and nonuniform temperature increases in the structure, which formed thermal gradient and altered the mechanical properties of the structure. This eventually leaded to out of plane deformations, which can be considered as the onset of structural instability. <strong>Image 5</strong> presents the stress and temperature profiles in the plate at different times.
