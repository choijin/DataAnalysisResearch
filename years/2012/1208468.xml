<AbstractNarration>Robots cannot currently grasp objects or perform other contact tasks in unstructured environments with speed or reliability.  This project is developing techniques for accurate real-time perception in support of contact tasks.  In the proposed method, sensor data tracks the continuous motions of manipulated objects, while models of the objects are simultaneously updated.  Particle filtering, a kind of Monte-Carlo simulation, ensures consistency of this tracking and updating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strongest impact of this work will be in robotic grasping and manipulation.  Because of the synthesis of modeling and probabilistic inference, further impacts can be expected, for example in real-time haptics for telepresence.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project developed several new perception algorithms to enhance the manual dexterity of robots, so that future robots will be able to do "simple" job, such as putting clean dishes in the cupboard.

Some of the results were implemented in the widely-used robotics simulator, Gazebo, by a student supported on this project during her internship at the Open Source Robotics Foundation.  Her contributions are in the main branch of the code repository.  The project supported several PhD students who have now graduated.  One has returned to his teaching position at Nantucket High School.  One works for Home Depot in their market research department.  Another works at LinkedIn.  The fourth has defended his PhD thesis and has accepted a job in the robotics research group at General Electric's Global Research Center.
