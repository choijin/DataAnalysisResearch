<AbstractNarration>This action funds Noel M. Bartlow of Stanford University to conduct a research project, entitled "Migration of slow earthquakes in the Hikurangi subduction zone, New Zealand," during the summer of 2012 at GNS Science in Lower Hutt, Wellington, New Zealand.  The host scientist is Dr. John Beavan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to study how slow slip events change over time in Hikurangi and compare them to similar events in Japan and Cascadia in the US.  Monitoring and studying these events has implications for evaluating the hazard of large megathrust earthquakes on the same subduction faults, since they indicate how far inland a large earthquake rupture will go, and some theoretical models show that slow slip events may become larger just before a big earthquake.  Also, because it is unclear if discoveries made in one subduction zone apply elsewhere it is important to study as many subduction zones as possible.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  This project begins a new collaboration between earthquake scientists at Stanford and GNS Science, including transferring a new GPS analysis code to GNS Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the past 15 years, scientists have observed the phenomenon of slow slip events in subduction zones around the Pacific.  In a subduction zone, two tectonic plates collide and one (usually the oceanic one) sinks below the other.  The contact surface between the plates, called the plate boundary, hosts large "megathrust" earthquakes such as those in Japan in 2011, Chile in 2010, and Sumatra in 2004.  In the late 1990's, scientists first observed, using high precision GPS instruments, that the plate interface can slip slowly over the course of weeks without releasing damaging seismic waves.  It was later shown in both Japan and Pacific Northwest of the US (Cascadia) that these "slow slip" events occur on the deeper extent of the plate boundary, below the megathrust region, and are usually accompanied by emergent seismic signals called tectonic tremor.      Since these early observations, slow slip has been observed around the world in many places including New Zealand, Costa Rica, and Mexico in addition to Japan and Cascadia.  In the most well studied areas of Cascadia and southern Japan, slow slip events are always accompanied by co-located tectonic tremor, and have predictable repeat intervals.  However in the last few years, new types of events have been observed that don't fit the original model developed for Cascadia and southern Japan.  These include slow slip events that last 1 year or more, seen in Mexico, Japan, and New Zealand, slow slip events without tectonic tremor, and slow slip events that trigger earthquakes up to magnitude 5.      In this study, we create a complete time-dependent model of slow slip on the Hikurangi plate interface in New Zealand for the period late 2009 - early 2012.  This model includes 1 long-term slow slip event of 1 year in duration, multiple events with 1-3 week durations, and a variety of depths of slow slip ranging from 10 to 50 km.  This model can be compared to tremor observations published in a recent paper by S. Ide in the Journal of Geophysical Research.  We show that unlike other areas, the tectonic tremor in New Zealand is not co-located with the slip.  There is also no tremor detected in areas that do have slow slip.  Additionally, the slow slip events appear to trigger at least 2 earthquake swarms, with magnitudes up to the M4 range.  These observations show that Hikurangi is fundamentally different from the other well-studied subduction regions and serves as a caution against applying observations from one subduction zone to another.     Additionally, this is the most complete model of slow slip patches in Hikurangi to date.  Although this is still being studied, it is likely that future large earthquakes in this region will not rupture through the slow slip regions, and the slow slip events themselves are relieving the stress in these regions.  So, the locations of the slow slip areas delineate the possible extent of a future large quake, which can be used to assess hazard.
