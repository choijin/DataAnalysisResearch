<AbstractNarration>With the support of an award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program (CSDM) at the National Science Foundation, Professor Joseph M. O'Connor of the University of California, San Diego will lead a research program that will investigate the chemistry of metallacyclobutene and vinylcarbene complexes.  Such complexes have been widely proposed as intermediates or transition state structures in metal-catalyzed reactions that impact the fields of organic synthesis, polymer chemistry, pharmaceuticals, material science and theory.  The approach will involve a combination of synthetic, structural, computational and mechanistic work.  Targeted molecules are chosen to maximize the potential for subsequent reactivity and to reveal mechanistic features of new and existing chemical transformations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed chemistry will advance the fundamental knowledge base of organic, inorganic, and organometallic processes, and contribute to future advances in the environmentally friendly construction of molecules with useful properties.  A key objective of the proposed studies it the interdisciplinary training of graduate students in the area of organometallic chemistry which will position them to make important scientific contributions to both industrial and academic endeavors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Metallacycle chemistry has impacted a number of fields in the chemical sciences including organic synthesis, polymer chemistry, pharmaceuticals, material science, and theory.  Under the support of NSF Award 1214014 we have investigated a promising but little studied class of metallacycles: the metallacyclobutenes, as well as vinylcarbene complexes derived therefrom. In order to improve reactions that may proceed via the intermediacy of metallacyclobutenes it is important to understand the physical properties, structures, and reactivitiy patterns of this compound class.  We have employed a combination of synthetic, structural, computational, and mechanistic work in order to understand how metallacyclobutenes form from alkyne precursors, and how they may undergo subsequent transformations to give new molecules and materials that may ultimately benefit society.  By its very nature, organometallic chemistry provides valuable interdisciplinary training for undergraduate and graduate student researchers.  Of particular importance for understanding and developing metallacyclobutene chemistry is the elucidation of reaction mechanisms that come into play when metallacyclobutenes undergo transformations that involve readily available small organic molecules.  A key advance accomplished under this grant is the observation that metallacyclobutenes are capable of existing in equilibrium with vinylcarbene species.  On the basis of our recent results we now believe that most metallacyclobutene chemistry involves the formation of vinylcarbene intermediates.  If chemists can learn to control the structures and reactivity of these reactive vinylcarbene complexes it will be possible to develop useful catalytic reactions of metallacyclobutenes.  We have determined that by controlling the steric bulk of a metallacyclobutene substituent it is possible to control the stereoselectivity of metallacyclobutene reactions.  We have further demonstrated that metallacyclobutenes are useful intermediates for the synthesis of highly functionallized conjugated dienes, cobaltocenium cations, and trisubstituted aromatics.  Intellectual Merit: The results obtained with the support of this NSF award represent a number of key advances in our fundamental understanding of metallacycle chemistry.  A foundation has now been laid for the future development of catalytic processes that will lead to key components needed for the construction of new materials and pharmaceuticals.  Broader Impact:  The results obtained under this grant promise to impact a number of fields including polymer chemistry, pharmaceuticals, material science, and theory. The graduate and undergraduate students who participated in this research, including students belonging to underrepresented groups, are well positioned to make important future contributions to both industrial and academic endeavors. The results of these studies have established new bond-forming and bond-breaking processes that will ultimately lead to new, highly efficient, economical, and environmentally sound processes for the rapid construction of useful organic molecules.
