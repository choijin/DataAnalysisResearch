<AbstractNarration>This award will support development of a new method to measure erosion rates beneath glaciers and ice sheets.  The method is based on interpretation of depth profiles of cosmic-ray-produced nuclides (Be-10, Al-26 and Cl-36) beneath glaciated bedrock surfaces.  Nuclide concentrations, ratios, and profile gradients are sensitive to the exposure and erosion history.  We will invert these data to determine erosion over the past 0.5-1 million years.  To verify the method we will measure profiles at up- and downflow ends of glacial landforms in eastern Maine, where existing theory predicts different erosion processes and strongly contrasting erosion rates.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide a quantitative method for the study of landscape evolution in glaciated terrain.  This will allow geomorphologists to re-examine long-standing questions concerning the erosional effects of the Pleistocene ice sheets, formation rates of characteristic glacial landforms, and the origin of glacial valley profiles.  Broader impacts of the work will include: (i) Graduate student training, (ii) Undergraduate participation in field- and laboratory-based research, (iii) Collaboration with the Maine Granite Industry Museum, where project results will be used to explain the glacial imprint on the surrounding landscape, and (iv) Evaluation of glacial erosion as a risk factor in planning for long-term isolation of nuclear waste in high-latitude countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we developed and demonstrated a method for measuring the erosion rates that have shaped glaciated landscapes over the past few million years.  Our method is based on the build-up of rare, cosmic ray produced isotopes, which accumulate in rock exposed at the Earth's surface. Cosmic ray produced isotopes have long been used to measure erosion rates in temperate areas which were free of ice cover during the last glacial period. The method developed in this project extends such measurements to glaciated landscapes, and allows estimates of erosion over hundreds of thousands of years, covering many ice-age/climate cycles. Using this method, we can show that in the case of the classic "glacial" landscape of southeastern Maine, million-year glacial erosion rates have been modest, removing only tens to approximately 100 meters of bedrock throughout the ice ages.  This is not sufficient account for the height of present-day mountains, and we infer that although erosion beneath ice sheets undoubtedly produced streamlined landforms, U-shaped valley cross-sections and other characteristic glacial landforms across southeastern Maine, they did so largely by re-shaping pre-glacial mountain- and valley networks.  This work has broader impacts in climate science, where the method developed will be used to analyze cores drilled from beneath the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets.  Measurement of cosmic ray produced isotopes in bedrock from beneath these ice sheets can tell us whether the bedrock was ice-free in the past - in other words whether the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets retreated during warmer climatic periods in the past. This provides important information about the sensitivity of the ice sheets to climate warming, and thresholds in the climate system that might trigger deglaciation and sea-level rise.  However, because cosmic ray produced isotopes build up mostly within the topmost few meters beneath the bedrock surface, even small amounts of erosion by ice sheets can erase or modify the record.  The methods developed in this project provide ways to identify the effects of erosion, and recover information about the million-year record of deglaciation and bedrock exposure in Greenland and Antarctica.
