<AbstractNarration>This postdoctoral research program at the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) comprises performing innovative research and creating usable products that not only support the mission of the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) but also address the needs of the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a technical perspective, the research is framed by two statistical themes and two key societal issues. The first statistical theme is characterization of uncertainties arising from novel methods of integrating and analyzing data, addressing a critical need in an era of declining data collection budgets and decreasing participation in government surveys. The second theme centers on conducting experiments with real data, simulating phenomena of interest in order to evaluate, and in some cases enable, methodological advances.  Key issues regarding surveys, such as how many times and by what means to contact nonrespondents, are too complex to be treated analytically, and infeasible to address with real world experiments; therefore simulation is effectively the only laboratory available. Specific research topics include data integration, prediction, model to design feedback, data-quality-aware statistical disclosure limitation and cost data quality tradeoffs. All Federal statistical agencies stand to benefit from the research, which will produce innovative theory, novel, methodology and algorithmic implementations, together with datasets, analyses, software and insights that inform future data collections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The societal issues are labor economics as it relates to the science, engineering and health workforce (SEHW). Understanding phenomena such as salaries, fringe benefits, mobility and training/job relationships is crucial to maintaining the United States' competitiveness in a global economy, as well as to facing the challenges of difficult economic times. The second issue is aging, because other than the role of students born outside of the US, aging is the most important phenomenon taking place in the SEHW (and, arguably, in society as a whole). For both issues, understanding the dramatically increasing richness of observed behaviors within the SEHW is a profound opportunity. New kinds of family structures, shared positions, and an array of forms of post-first-retirement employment are among the central social trends of our times. This project will generate new insights that inform both future research and sound policy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project created new, more informative methods for producing small areas estimates for the National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG), which are applicable to other surveys of the scientific workforce, as well as more broadly.  The NSRCG (which has been succeeded by the National Survey of College Graduates, or NSCG) was conducted biannually from 1973 to 2010 by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics at the National Science Foundation. It provides demographic, educational and employmeninformation about recent recipients of bachelor?s and master?s degrees in science, engineering, and health (SEH) fields from U.S. academic institutions.  According to the NCSES website (http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvyrecentgrads/), NSRCG data "help users understand and predict trends in education, employment opportunities, and salaries of recent (SEH) graduates."  The NSRCG survey was designed to provide reliable national estimates for domains defined by degree type (bachelor?s or master?s), major field of degree, race/ethnicity, and gender. However, it was not designed to provide estimates for a cross-classification of those domains. Constructing such small-domain estimates was the original motivation for the project.  The goal of small area estimation is to construct population-level quantities of interest for small geographical areas or small population subgroup domains, such as the average salary of Asian women receiving a Bachelor's degree in engineering from a research-oriented university.  So called direct estimates are unreliable because of very small sample sizes. Instead, statistical modeling is employed in order to "borrow strength" across domains. The technical contribution of the project was to extend the well-known Fay-Herriot modelmodel for small area/domain level estimates, which can be interpreted as a linear mixed effects model in which the true domain-level means are normally distributed. This assumption was replaced by a nonparametric specification that allows greater modeling flexibility, at the cost of increased computational but manageable burden.  The investigation focused on the intercept-only model, which is used in the absence of the external domain-level information. The new methodology was demonstrated to be effective using a number of simulation experiments. These showed that the new method performs as well as Fay-Herriot when the normality assumption is satisfied, and performs significantly better when it is not.  The new method was applied to estimate salaries using NSRCG data, and revealed previously unsuspected heterogeneities. As a result, our understanding of the scientifc workforce has been deepened.             Last Modified: 08/31/2016       Submitted by: Alan F Karr]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
