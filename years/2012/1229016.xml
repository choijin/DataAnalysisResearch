<AbstractNarration>Flow cytometry has become an integral tool in biological and biochemical research because it combines the versatility of fluorescence microscopy with the strength of quantitative population-based methods. This NSF MRI award provides funds for the purchase of a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer to introduce and expand the use of flow cytometry at Birmingham-Southern College (BSC). Important for use in an undergraduate research program, the Accuri C6 flow cytometer is compact, cost-effective, and capable of complex cellular fluorescence and counting analyses, supplying the functionality of a full-scale cytometer in a table-top apparatus. The versatility of this instrument will facilitate its use by undergraduate researchers in the Chemistry and Biology Departments in a variety of broad applications. The instrument will be used to quantitatively assess cellular fluorescence of bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells. In particular, flow cytometry will be used to address important questions in biology and chemistry, such as understanding the mechanisms that regulate membrane trafficking and control cell cycle progression in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, characterization of iron uptake pathways in Staphylococcus aureus, and investigation of the interactions between complex sphingolipid homeostasis and cell physiology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The CSamplerÂ® accessory will further allow BSC researchers to perform high-throughput fluorescence-based assays for large-scale screening and identification of new avenues for research. Importantly, the ease of setup and use of this instrument makes flow cytometry accessible for researchers at the undergraduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flow cytometry allows researchers to rapidly quantify fluorescence levels in thousands of individual cells within minutes, providing quantitative information about cell populations that can be used to address many important biological and biochemical research questions. Introduction of flow cytometry will impact undergraduate education at Birmingham-Southern College, a primarily undergraduate liberal arts college of approximately 1300 students with well-regarded programs in biology and chemistry. Typically, one-third of each incoming class expresses an interest in the sciences. Though primarily for undergraduate research, this instrument will have a significant impact on teaching, training, and learning due to (1) the research requirement for all natural science majors at BSC and (2) integration of research into the curriculum of BSC?s teaching laboratories. Our intensive senior research programs are among the greatest strengths of the natural sciences at BSC. Every graduate of these majors must engage in a minimum of two terms of research. This instrument will provide senior research students with the opportunity to utilize an important technology not currently available at the College. Acquisition of this flow cytometer will also significantly impact students enrolled in biology and chemistry courses. Flow cytometry will be incorporated into research-based laboratories in Honors Cell and Molecular Biology, Genetics, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry, exposing students in these courses to flow cytometry data collection and analysis. Students will gain hands-on experience with flow cytometry, impacting the vast majority of science majors at BSC.</AbstractNarration>

Purchase of the flow cytometer has provided researchers at BSC with access to a technology that was not previously available on campus. Three faculty members at BSC have used flow cytometry in their research laboratories: Melanie Styers (the PI), Pamela Hanson, and Leo Pezzementi (a new user). In the Styers laboratory, flow cytometry has been used to explore the effects of deletion of specific genes in fission yeast on the cell cycle, endocytosis, and maintenance of intracellular pH. Results from these studies in the Styers lab have provided significant insights into the mechanisms that regulate membrane transport and organellar homeostasis in fission yeast and have supported the efforts funded by her NSF-RUI award (#1329506). The cell biology of membrane trafficking in fission yeast is largely unexplored. Therefore, these studies will help to solidify fission yeast as a model for study of the mechanisms that underlie membrane transport. In the Hanson lab, flow cytometry has provided insight into mechanisms of sphingolipid homeostasis, as well the effects of the anticancer ruthenium complex KP1019 on the cell cycle, gene expression, and oxidative stress in the budding yeast <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</em> Use of the flow cytometer in course-based research experiences has synergized with the efforts associated with Hanson&rsquo;s NSF-TUES award (Award Number: 1140330).
