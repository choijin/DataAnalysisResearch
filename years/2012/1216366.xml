<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to investigate multi-level preconditioning techniques for solving linear systems of equations, placing a high emphasis on robustness issues. One of the key concepts used in these methods is that of coarsening, i.e., the method of reducing a set of variables of a system (called `fine' unknowns) to a smaller set (called `coarse' unknowns) which yields a good representation of the fine set. So far, coarsening has been viewed mostly from the angle of algebraic multi-Grid. A number of multi-level ILU type techniques, primarily based on coarsening ideas, will be studied. The research team will also investigate a new set of Multi-Level Low-Rank approximation techniques within Domain-Decomposition type methods. A number of factors make these methods very appealing, including their robustness and their potential effectiveness on  high-performance computers, e.g., ones employing GPGPUs. Finally, in an effort to tie the development of preconditioners more closely with applications, the research team will consider methodologies for developing what may be termed `application-tailored preconditioners.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though enormous progress has been made  in the last two decades in the solution of large sparse linear systems of  equations  by iterative methods, the state-of-the-art of these methods remains unsatisfactory in  many areas. Foremost among these is the lack of robustness of iterative techniques in dealing with a variety of real-life problems. Recent research on Preconditioned Krylov Subspace Methods (PKSMs) has aimed at achieving a good compromise between generality and efficiency by incorporating techniques  from different horizons, including multilevel concepts to improve scalability and adopting ideas from direct solution methods to improve robustness. At the same time that these improvements are being deployed, the demands on developers of iterative  solution methods are changing. Applications have become much more challenging, and new computational environments are making obsolete complex software that often took several years to mature. The aim  of this research proposal is to address new challenges and questions that have emerged for PKSMs in recent years as well as to explore more common research issues where progress is of vital importance. All general use codes that will be developed under this project will be freely distributed under the GNU public use license. The PI already has a long practice with distributing codes in this fashion. This project will have an impact on the training of graduate students in a field that is vital to the needs of academia, industry, and government laboratories. At a time where  there is a significant upsurge of demand for specialists in computational mathematics, the number of graduate students trained in this broad area has diminished. The PI will place a major effort in attracting and training students in topics related to  scientific computing and high-performance computing. Because it is important to sparkle the interest into these areas at an early stage of the student career, the proposal highlights plans for employing two undergraduate summer interns to work  on specific  topics of this proposal, throughout its duration. Among other training activities the PI will continue the practice of freely disseminating books, lecture notes, and MATLAB scripts for educational purposes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Although enormous  advances have been  made in iterative methods  for solving large  sparse linear systems  of equations, the  state-of-the-art of these methods  remains unsatisfactory in  many areas.Foremost among these is their lack of robustness when dealing with a variety of real-life problems, such as those that arise from wave propagation phenomena (Helmholtz, Maxwell, equations,...).  Among standard iterative methods, those based on a combination of preconditioning and projection on Krylov subspaces are popular due to their excellent compromise between generality and efficiency.  A preconditioner is a process  for obtaining  inexpensively an  approximate solution to  the original system.  For  example, common preconditining  techniques are  those based on Incomplete  LU (ILU) factorizations that approximately  factor the original matrix into  the product of a lower  triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.  These preconditioners tend to work  well for linear systems that are diagonally dominant  but do  poorly for highly indefinite systems. The primary focus  of this project has been to develop preconditioners that are  robust, i.e., that can deal with highly indefinite or very ill-conditioned linear systems.  The research emphasizes 'multilevel techniques'  as well as techniques that perform well on high-performance computers.  One of  the main contributions of  this project has been  the development of a class of Multilevel  Low-Rank (MLR) preconditioners.  An  attribute of this class of techniques,  which was  the original motivation for this  work, is that operating with low-rank  preconditioners requires dense linear algebra and this tends to yield very good performance on machines equipped with GPUs.   It was later found  that another  major attractions  of MLR  preconditoners is that they  are not  as  sensitive to  indefiniteness as  ILU-type preconditioners. Thus, we  have recently  shown that  one of  thepreconditioners developed provided  an effective solution techniques  for highly indefinite linear  systems such as those  issued from solving Helmholtz  equations, which are currently among the most difficult to solve by iterative methods.  The research has unraveled an alternative approach to  preconditioning techniques.  So far, researchers would typically just find an approximation to the original matrix  to  use as a preconditioner, whether in the form of  an ILU factorization or an algebraic multigrid technique for example.   Preserving sparsity is a major goal of these techniques.  What we have shown is  that good approximate inverse preconditioners can be developed  provided that low-rank approximations are exploited to correct some initial approximation. In this approach sparsity is no longer the main focus.  Thus, while ILUs are not enough and low-rank approximation techniques by themselves have  not been proven effective, certain combinations of  these two completely different methodologies can  lead to very efficient solution techniques.  This  does not seem to have been observed so far.  The broader impacts of the  proposal include the dissemination of software and the  training of students in an area that is in  vital need of growth. In addition, there is  a clear potential impact of this line of  work in the applications areas.   Good iterative solution techniques are  crucial in a wide range  of scientific and engineering disciplines.   This work may lead the  way to alternative techniques for building preconditioners for these iterative solvers,  that may be far more effective than those currently in use.
