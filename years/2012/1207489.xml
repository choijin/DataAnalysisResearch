<AbstractNarration>Technical Description: Scientists in the University of New Mexico (UNM) and the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) are engaged in a multi-investigator research project to study the physics of energy states located at and below the optical band-gap energy of semiconductors. While the presence of these states has been known since the earliest days of semiconductors, there has been an ongoing disconnect between experimental and theoretical research. This project aims to close that gap. The band-tail states, also called Urbach tail, are studied by measuring and modeling the dynamics of absorption, luminescence, and heat transfer to the lattice using established and new methods of time-resolved optical and terahertz spectroscopy. The temporal response of the band-tail states holds a wealth of interesting and important physics. The project sheds new light on energy band-tail states in semiconductors by studying their temporal response to optical perturbation. New and improved methods of time-resolved spectroscopy leading to extremely high sensitivity are being developed at UNM. JHU is producing a new theory of band-tail state dynamics that is crucial to the interpretation of the experiments. This theory is sufficiently general to accommodate states that are extended, local, or a mixture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: The research project aims at gaining a fundamental understanding of light absorption by semiconductors at the long-wavelength absorption tail and the subsequent photoluminescence (emission) from these materials. A success of the project can have implications for future development of optoelectronic devices and semiconductor laser refrigeration. The project also serves as a vehicle to educate and train graduate students who are in the early stages of their careers. It is particularly valuable because of its multidisciplinary nature in the broad fields of physics, materials science, and optics. An important educational component is an exchange program between UNM and the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, co-located in Albuquerque. Supported UNM students are responsible for setting up optics labs and mentoring at both facilities.</AbstractNarration>

This was suitable for measuring small absorbances in large gap semiconductors and optical solids, but not applicable to GaAs (or other small gap materials) since the probe laser will be totally absorbed.&nbsp; We reassembled this apparatus last year, this time using a 1.55 mm laser (external cavity diode laser- ECDL) as the probe.&nbsp; The set-up is shown in Fig. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>After running calibration tests (with GaP), in conjunction with modeling the mode-mismatched condition, we&nbsp; have commenced measurements in GaAs/GaInP DHS samples.&nbsp; Note that for this purpose, the DHS samples have to be epitaxial lifted-off and bonded to a flat substrate (2mm ZnS).&nbsp; In the analysis, we have to be mindful of the complexity from Fabry-Perot effects, population lensing (carrier effects),&nbsp; as well as the fact that the thermal lens can form in both DHS and ZnS.&nbsp; &nbsp;The initial results are rather interesting and potentially quite revealing.&nbsp; As stated earlier, our samples were two InGaP|GaAs DHS that differed in the thicknesses in the InGaP and GaAs layers as a method to help distinguish whether the background absorption was originating from the bulk material or from an interface. The sample with a thinner GaAs layer, called the &ldquo;thin&rdquo; sample, had 1020 nm InGaP layers and a 128 nm GaAs layer, while the InGaP and GaAs layers for the second sample, called the &ldquo;thick&rdquo; sample, were all 750 nm. The samples were van der Waals bonded to 2 mm thick ZnS windows since this material has been shown to have low background absorption10. Although it is not necessary to perform a full Z-scan, doing so ensures that there are no additional effects present in the measurement. One such measurement performed on the thin sample can be seen in Figure 3. Here we see exceptional overlap between the calibrated blue curve and the experimental data, red points, indicating that only thermal lensing is present. This lends support to results obtained from performing thermal lens spectrometry measurements. Performing such measurements gave an absorbance for the thin and thick DHS samples of (1.26 &nbsp;0.14) &acute;10<sup>-3</sup> and (0.95 &nbsp;0.12) &acute;10<sup>-3</sup>, respectively.
