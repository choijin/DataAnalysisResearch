<AbstractNarration>PI: Adrian D. Hegeman (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPI: Jerry D. Cohen (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Collaborator: Aaron Rendahl (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the recent rapid expansion in accessible genome and mRNA nucleotide sequence data there is an increasing need for robust methods for connecting observable plant phenotypes with changes at the molecular level. Measurement of metabolic flux (the flow of matter through an organism's network of metabolic pathways) is a direct molecular indicator of an organism's phenotype. Metabolic flux information describes how nutrient resources and stores are used by which segments of a metabolic network to generate and accumulate products required for growth, development, and differentiation, integrated with responses to environmental conditions. Correspondingly, metabolic flux analysis (MFA) provides a direct route for both the discovery (and subsequent manipulation) of the molecular basis of any number of complex plant behaviors. Unfortunately, most MFA is currently performed using cultured cells, both to provide homogeneity and as an easy method for introduction of isotope labeled nutrients. Several challenges need to be addressed before dynamic-MFA can be applied practically to intact plants for molecular phenotyping.  This project will provide for 1) optimize methods for measurement of dynamic metabolic fluxes in intact plant systems using timed stable isotope labeled nutrient incorporation, mass spectral analysis, and automated data extraction and calculation of dynamic fluxes; 2) develop a procedure for finding additional connectivity and pathway components of metabolic network models using dynamic flux information using a publicly available metabolic network model for Arabidopsis with flux data collected from Arabidopsis plants subjected to multiple stress conditions and 3) develop microsampling approaches for dynamic flux analysis by examining crowding stress in maize. Computational and bioinformatics resources for metabolic flux analysis workflows will be created and distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, postdoctoral scientists and graduate students will be exposed to a unique multidisciplinary approach to metabolomics.  In addition, the project will continue to offer a summer workshop for graduate students, postdoctoral scientists and others interested in stable isotope approaches for understanding metabolic flux measurement and how it might be used for biological research. Short-term dissemination of data, processing algorithms and methods will be accomplished by means of the project website (http://plantmetabolomics.cfans.umn.edu/).</AbstractNarration>

This work resulted in observations of dramatic changes in metabolite abundance across multiple pathways that showed the importance of understanding the metabolite abundance responses to stress, and combinations of stresses, before flux analysis can be applied.  In order to be able to measure flux in as many metabolites as is possible, we designed, developed, and constructed new modular stable isotopic labeling chambers to allow timed incorporation of label into plant metabolism using [13C]-carbon dioxide.  This isotope of carbon is one mass unit heavier than typical environmental carbon (12C) and its appearance in metabolites can be measured using mass spectrometry.  Figure 1 shows four of the modules produced by the project.  Our plant 13C-labeling efforts are documented at the website: http://13carbon.com   Plant tissue microsampling:  Metabolite analysis historically uses extracts derived from dried or frozen plant samples often containing multiple tissue and cell types. This can be a problem for understanding plant metabolism as each tissue and cell type may have very different metabolic properties that are effectively averaged across the sample.  In this project we presented two approaches for sampling smaller targeted sections of plant material.  The first is called leaf spray, shown in Figure 2 makes it possible to measure mass spectra of metabolites in intact leaf (or other tissue) samples directly.  The second approach uses a laser to dissect out a small tissue zone for subsequent extraction and analysis.  Both of these approaches have disadvantages, but do make it possible to measure metabolites at a higher spatial resolution than conventional extraction methods.  Data analysis and visualization software:  Several software tools were produced by this project.  These include: 1) a package written in R for calculating molecular turnover using mass spectrometry data from isotopically labeled plants; 2) a metabolomics visualization tool called OpenVanKrevelen using an approach originally used for classifying petrochemical mixtures; and 3) our project worked with the workflow 4 metabolomics (W4M) team to implement metabolomics tools and workflows for the larger scientific community.  Broader Impacts:  Workshop.  We organized and offered a Plant Metabolomics Workshop (Figures 3-5) as part of the broader impact proposal for this project.  The workshop was offered twice on July 20-24, 2015 and July 24-28, 2017.  The workshop was designed to provide basic information about metabolomics, and the use of stable isotopes for metabolite analysis as well as hands on training on the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
