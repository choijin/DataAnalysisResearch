<AbstractNarration>Feehan&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1237722&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his colleagues organize the "Mathematical Finance and Partial Differential Equations Conference" November 2, 2012, at Rutgers University.  Methods of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations to solve fundamental problems in mathematical finance provide the common theme that underlies presentations by the invited and contributing conference speakers.  Almgren and Guo address applications of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and stochastic control to efficient management of order books and trading.  Research of Levendorskii and Nistor concerns advanced methods for numerical solution of partial differential equations arising in American-style option pricing problems.  Hobson considers robust methods for pricing complex options.  Keller-Ressel describes affine stochastic volatility models and their generalizations while Pop explores extensions of Gyongy's theorem to the case of degenerate Ito processes with unbounded coefficients.  Mazzeo considers degenerate diffusion processes and associated partial differential equations in mathematical biology.  Protter discusses applications of probability theory to bubbles in finance.  Zitkovic describes his work on portfolio theory and incomplete markets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The purpose of this conference is to develop academic and industry research collaborations based on the themes discussed by the speakers.  Conference participants come from both the academic mathematical research community and the financial engineering industry.  Interactions among the participants encourage cross-fertilization of ideas and transfer of knowledge and lead to identification of future research problems for academic researchers and of possible methods to solve them.  The participation of representatives from the financial engineering industry ensures that practical problems in derivative security pricing, risk management, and trading are introduced to academic researchers with relevant expertise in applied mathematics.  The industry applications include improved methods to control model risk, better understand the origins of financial bubbles, and improve asset and portfolio management for individuals and pension funds.  The participation of academic researchers ensures that the latest academic research and methods are described to practitioners in financial engineering.  Presentations by researchers from both academia and industry foster mathematical finance and partial differential equations as a research discipline for Ph.D. students in pure and applied mathematics.  Conference materials are posted on the web at http://www.finmath.rutgers.edu/mfpde2012/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Partial differential equations, probability, and analytical methods are fundamental in the modeling and description of financial markets. The purpose of the November 1, 2013 and May 1, 2015 conferences were to highlight the new methods, directions and the most recent research in partial differential equations, probability, stochastic control, numerical analysis, and their application to mathematical finance. The meeting encouraged the participation of academic and industry researchers in this field and contributions on related topics were welcome.  More specifically, the goals of the conference were as follows:  - to bring together renowned speakers and experts (9 in 2013 and 10 in 2015) in mathematical finance, partial differential equations, and probability to give oral presentations on the latest research in these fields.  - to attract a large audience of mathematicians from academia and industry, including a large number of junior participants and members of underrepresented groups, with the goal of disseminating ideas, stimulating collaborations and discussions of research and helping to train the next generation of mathematicians in these fields.  In addition, there were 30 contributed talks given by junior researchers in 2013 and 20 contributed talks given by junior researchers in 2015.  There were more than 55 confirmed participants in each of the 2013 and 2015 conferences, who came from all over the United States and the world to learn about the latest developments in the fields of mathematical finance, partial differential equations, and probability theory.  The invited speakers came from various fields across the mathematical finance community, and from academia and industry, and this encouraged the cross-fertilization of ideas and transfer of knowledge.     A key objective of the conference was to encourage the broad participation of junior mathematicians and members of underrepresented groups. This objective was largely achieved. In 2013 there were more than 50 confirmed junior participants and more than 4 confirmed women mathematicians and members of other underrepresented groups. In 2015, there were again more than 50 confirmed junior participants and more than 16 confirmed women mathematicians and members of other underrepresented groups.           The two conferences provided a major venue for the presentation and discussion of some of the most recent and exciting developments in mathematical finance, partial differential equations, and probability theory. These ideas and others were presented in the conference talks to a broad audience of junior and senior mathematicians, as well as representatives from industry. The conference helped to disseminate these ideas and provide fertile ground for collaboration and exchange of ideas.  The conferences facilitated the transfer of latest results of academic research to applications in industry and increased awareness of academic researchers of the mathematical problems of most interest to industry practitioners. In addition, the conference served to assist researchers in mathematical finance proper alert researchers in purer areas of mathematics such as partial differential equations or probability to problems of potential interest to them and vice versa.
