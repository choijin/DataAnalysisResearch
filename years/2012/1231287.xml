<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the fundamental research on a novel centrifugal spinning process that is capable of producing polymer, carbon, ceramic, and composite nanofibers at high speed and low cost.  Centrifugal spinning eliminates the limitations encountered by current nanofiber production methods.  In this research, the foundation of the novel centrifugal spinning process will be established through the fundamental understanding of the nanofiber formation process and the processing-structure relationships.  Guidelines for producing nanofibers of polymers, carbons, ceramics, and composites will be established, and the processing-structure relationships obtained in this work can be used to guide the design of advanced nanofiber materials for a wide variety of potential applications including batteries, fuel cells, solar cells, biocatalysts, purification, sensors, composites, and protonic and electronic microdevices.  In this work, the potential use of centrifugally-spun nanofibers in batteries and fuel cells will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;      &lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will lead to a new centrifugal spinning process that can produce nanofibers of many different materials, which have significant impacts on a broad range of applications.  Nanofibers of polymers, carbons, ceramics, and composites will be obtained.  The exploration of potential applications, especially in energy storage and conversion, will help alleviate foreign oil dependence, improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable development.  In addition, emerging research concepts, theories, and technologies relevant to the proposed work will be implemented in classroom teaching to accurately reflect the changing trends in the profession, and produce students with the skills needed to participate in and advance novel processing and manufacturing technologies.  These research and education activities will also help the United State stay in the leading position in these strategic fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       The project focuses on the fundamental research on a novel centrifugal spinning process that is capable of producing polymer, carbon, ceramic, and composite nanofibers at high speed and low cost.  So far, electrospinning is the most used method for producing nanofibers.  However, the wide-spread commercial use of electrospinning is limited due to its low production rate, poor safety, and high cost.  Most other nanofiber production methods, such as phase separation, template synthesis, and self-assembly, are complex and can only be used to make nanofibers from limited types of polymers.  The new centrifugal spinning developed in this project eliminates the limitations encountered by current nanofiber production methods and can produce nanofibers from various materials.          In this research, two centrifugal spinning systems were developed and demonstrated.  One system was based on a batch process while the other one was for continuous production.  Utilizing these two new systems, the foundation of the novel centrifugal spinning process has been established through the fundamental understanding of the nanofiber formation process and the processing-structure relationships.  Guidelines for producing nanofibers of polymers, carbons, ceramics, and composites have been established, and the processing-structure relationships obtained in this work can be used to guide the design of advanced nanofiber materials for a wide variety of potential applications including batteries, fuel cells, solar cells, biocatalysts, purification, sensors, composites, and protonic and electronic microdevices.  In this work, the potential use of centrifugally-spun nanofibers in batteries and supercapacitors was explored.             In summary, this research has led to a new centrifugal spinning process that can produce nanofibers of many different materials, which have significant impacts on a broad range of applications.  Nanofibers of polymers, carbons, ceramics, and composites have been obtained.  The application of these nanofibers have been demonstrated in lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries and supercapacitors.  Batteries and supercapacitors using centrifugally-spun nanofibers have improved performance and reduced cost, and they could help alleviate foreign oil dependence, improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable development.  In addition, emerging research concepts, theories, and technologies relevant to the proposed work have been implemented in classroom teaching to accurately reflect the changing trends in the profession, and produce students with the skills needed to participate in and advance novel processing and manufacturing technologies.
