<AbstractNarration>Animal migration is perhaps the most spectacular ecological phenomenon on Earth. Be it tiny Arctic terns navigating annually between the poles, or millions of wildebeest doggedly traversing the Serengeti plains of Africa, migration captures the imagination of people like few other biological events. Yet despite its ecological importance and cultural significance, the science of migration remains poorly understood.  Even basic questions about why, when, where, who and how animals migrate are largely unanswered. Why, for example, would a 600 pound giant tortoise -- a large reptile that can easily survive for a year or more without food or water -- migrate seasonally up and down the lava strewn volcanic slopes of the Galapagos Islands? Why is it that only adults migrate? And why do tortoises on some islands barely move at all? Giant tortoises represent a tractable "model" for understanding animal migration because many distinct species have evolved under very different environmental conditions within a small geographical area. In this project, a suite of research methods, including GPS telemetry of both young and adults will be used to track Galapagos tortoise movements. Tortoise health, including exposure to infectious diseases, parasite infection and stress levels, will be studied through blood and dung samples, while traditional field work will measure reproductive success of migratory versus non-migratory individuals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will answer  some of the fundamental questions underpinning movement ecology in all animals, not just giant tortoises.  In a world that is rapidly changing due to human activities, understanding animal migration is key to predicting which animals will be most affected and devising management plans for them.  Because migratory animals can be important vectors of diseases that impact humans and agriculture, the significance of this work extends beyond wildlife. Finally, all results will be packaged into an exciting outreach program with the aim of inspiring and educating children in both Galapagos and the USA toward a stronger appreciation of ecological sciences and strategies of conservation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Humans are fascinated by spectacular long distance animal migrations, yet migratory systems are in a precipitous global decline. Understanding why some animals migrate while others do not remains a fundamental question in ecology and evolutionary biology, with important conservation implications. We documented an intact partial migratory system involving giant tortoises on the Galapagos Islands, recognizing the unprecedented opportunity the system presented to elucidate the drivers of movement owing to the radiation of genetically and morphologically distinct tortoise species that evolved under contrasting environmental conditions. Our goals included inspiring interest in and concern for giant tortoise conservation biology among young people and translating science into management applications to sustain long distance migration.</p> <p>We tracked using GPS and radio telemetry tags over multiple years the movements of &gt;100 individual Galapagos tortoises from four species on three islands with body sizes ranging over five orders of magnitude in body size (from 0.06kg hatchlings to 250kg adults). We quantified environmental variables from field measurements and remote sensing, examined adult tortoise health and reproductive status, measured reproductive success along resource gradients, and documented tortoise seasonal distribution, diet and ecological impact.</p> <p>Movement strategies of tortoises are governed by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The propensity to migrate is high when the seasonal distribution of resources is predictable along spatial gradients. Sedentary and nomadic movement strategies prevail when conditions are less predictable.&nbsp; We developed a bioenergetics model of the full annual migratory cycle from foraging and metabolic theory. The model accurately predicted the seasonal timing of migration, the body size at which migration should begin and the limits of tortoise body size. Unlike most migratory systems, the model revealed that the energetic gains at migratory destinations are more important determinants of migratory behavior than the energetic costs of the migratory journey.&nbsp; Moreover, tortoises base their decision to migrate on an aggregate of conditions over multiple past years rather than conditions during the current year, suggesting that under rapid climate change tortoises may be unable to adjust migration timing, with potentially high fitness consequences.</p> <p>Female tortoise movements are less tightly linked to forage distribution than are those of males, likely due to the constraints of nesting. We found dramatic differences in the survival of eggs and hatchlings and hatchling growth rates driven by temperature and rainfall patterns over an elevational range of just 150m. Flexibility in nest site selection in response to climate change may be critical to future population dynamics of tortoises.</p> <p>On islands inhabited by humans migration takes many adult tortoises out of the Galapagos National Park and into private, unprotected lands, sometimes for over 50% of the year. Our work showed that access to such private lands is critical to the energy balance, body condition and reproductive potential of tortoises.&nbsp; Worryingly, private land use on Galapagos is shifting from extensive farming compatible with tortoise migration toward high production agriculture and fragmentation into small lots for residential use, both with serious implications for the integrity of tortoise migrations and population stability. Landscape scale conservation that maintains the qualtiy of migratory routes and destinations is critically important.</p> <p>In aggregate, our work has revealed the mechanisms by which intrinsic and extrinsic factors interact to determine movement strategies of Galapagos tortoises, and highlighted the threats to the migratory system posed by climate and land use change. Our suite of thirteen publications and more in preparation (most of which we have translated into Spanish) provides a solid body of scientific work with highly applicable outcomes for managers.</p> <p>The &ldquo;Galapagos Tortoise Education Partnership&rdquo; has translated our science into numerous tangible products for the community both on Galapagos and the US. We held teacher workshops on Galapagos to build capacity in inquiry-based field and classroom curriculum development. Our contribution to the field program of the Ecology Project International led to over 1000 high school students on Galapagos receiving hands-on training in scientific methods and immersion in tortoise habitats, with demonstrably positive results in knowledge, understanding, and perceptions toward ecology and conservation. &nbsp;In the US, we led three teacher training workshops and cemented links with the education departments of the St. Louis and Houston zoos, which have combined annual visitation rates of over 6 million people. Over 1000 middle and high school students in St. Louis participated in field curricula based around box turtle movement ecology. The Ferguson-Florissant school district has developed a turtle movement ecology project at their field station. Teachers in both Galapagos and the US have access to education resource packages that target state and national learning standards and the entirety of our tortoise movement data are freely accessible to the public at <a href="http://www.movebank.org/">www.movebank.org</a>.
