<AbstractNarration>Nerve cells in the brain send messages to each other using fast electrical pulses that are referred to as action potentials.  A signal response is initiated in a nerve cell axon, and the resulting action potential travels forward along the axon which acts like a cable going to other nerve cells.  In most brain cells, the action potential also travels backwards up the axon and into the nerve cell body and its dendrite projections.  There are, however, three types of nerve cells in the auditory system, where, for unknown reasons, the action potential does not travel backwards.  These auditory nerve cells encode information about sounds through the unusually precise timing of their action potentials.  This project will investigate whether the lack of backward action potentials in these cells explains their notable ability to precisely time their forward action potentials.  To investigate this distinct neurobiological problem, two laboratories, one in the US and another in Germany, have set up a collaboration.  An existing computerized, real-time interface will be used to simulate backward action potentials in auditory cells that normally do not produce backward action potentials in response to sound.  The results of this analysis will be used to determine whether sodium conductance disrupts the precise timing of the forward action potentials that are normally exhibited by these cells.  The experimental data will be tested against a fully computational model of nerve cells to gain insight into the relationship between normal action potential initiation and the precise timing of action potentials, as well as to understand the enhanced capabilities of these three unusual cell types.  The software for the computer interface that will be developed in this project will be made freely available online to other researchers.  The project will provide significant training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in laboratories with differing, but complimentary, areas of expertise. Development of the computer interface will involve computer science undergraduates taking a course in Real-time and Embedded Operating Systems.  (A companion project is being funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             This project set out to understand adaptations that contribute to the function of a set of highly-specialized neurons.  These neurons share several features in common.  They are all involved in auditory processing, and even more specifically, they all process precise timing information about sounds.  Precise timing information is used to determine where a sound is coming from, and behavioral evidence indicates that mammals are sensitive to timing differences as short as 10 &micro;s.  Such phenomenal precision requires that neurons in the auditory system must be highly adapted to preserve timing, at least until sound location is determined.  Many neuronal adaptations have been identified for these timing neurons, including high expression of potassium channels to speed the cells up.              We observed that these neurons also have a further characteristic in common, that they all have very short action potentials.  Action potentials are used to convey information from one place to another in the brain, so their initiation must be very precise.  We wanted to understand if there was a link between precision and short spikes.  Spike initiation and amplitude depends critically on the characteristics of sodium channels, so we measured their characteristics using nucleated patches.  We found that sodium channels in one of these cell types, called bushy cells, were fewer in number than normal neurons, and those sodium channels were more likely to be inactivated.  This could account mechanistically for the short spikes.              We also wanted to understand functionally why short spikes occur in these time-sensitive neurons.  To test this, we increased the sodium conductance in these cells, using an electrophysiological approach called dynamic clamp.  A major task in this project was to develop a dynamic clamp that could go fast enough to mimic a conductance as complex as a sodium channel.  This has been made available to the public, and described in a published paper.  We used our recordings of sodium channels to set up the dynamic clamp, and found that as we added more sodium conductance, we could obtain normal-looking spikes.              However, increasing the sodium conductance had negative consequences.  Bushy cells are normally activated by auditory nerve fibers carrying information from the ear.  When we stimulate these fibers artificially, the bushy cells follow reliably.  However, this reliability decreases as sodium conductance increases.  This appears to happen because the higher amplitude action potentials recruit potassium channels.  Once potassium channels are activated, the cell becomes less responsive to subsequent auditory nerve activity, and the reliability of the bushy cell decreases.              Furthermore, sodium channels interfere with other properties of bushy cells.  Under some conditions, bushy cells require multiple auditory nerve fibers to be active simultaneously.  This phenomenon is called coincidence detection, and is thought to yield even more precise timing in bushy cells compared to auditory nerve fibers.  For greatest precision, each synapse must be active for a minimal amount of time.  However, when there is a normal sodium conductance. even before an action potential is initiated, the sodium channels activate, which amplifies and prolongs synaptic activity.  The consequence is that the window for coincidence detection becomes wider and precision decreases.  We reported these functional effects in a published paper.              This was the core of this project.  In addition, we conducted additional projects about how long-term changes in acoustic experience change the way the auditory nerve fibers drive bushy cells.  This endeavor has resulted in two published papers so far, with another two expected.              Besides this significant scientific impact, this project also has had broader impact.  We have involved undergraduates in this research project, providing them valuable exposure to the rigors of research.  In addition, the dynamic clamp program has been made available to the wider scientific community, and some labs have started to adopt using it.
