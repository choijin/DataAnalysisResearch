<AbstractNarration>A new center is to be planned named the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Social Technologies and Analytics. The planned I/UCRC intends to conducts research of high-end applications for accessing the Social Media data ecosystem, whereSocial Media refers to how users generate content, exchange information and share ideas in public and private platforms over the Internet.  Research foci of the planned center include Big Data analysis, cyberinfrastructure, mobile applications, technology and people, business intelligence and society and computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The social media ecosystem represents a significant and growing global resource that offers a wide and varied set of new applications with potential impact spanning the private and public sector.  The planned center has the potential to build a corporate, government and university cooperative to address research challenges in this area and accelerate its growth. The planned center would engage students at all levels and train them in through its research. The effort will draw on existing university programs to engage a diverse set of participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal requested support for a planning workshop that will result in the establishment of the Consortium for Social Technologies and Analytics (COSTA). This NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center would have been focused on research, and development of high-end applications for accessing the Social Media data ecosystem. Social Media refers to how users (individuals, organizations, and communities) generate content, exchange information and share ideas in public and private platforms over the Internet.  Thus, broader impacts of this research center include the novel integration of Social Media with advanced computing research to solve important problems of interest to our industrial partners, as well as training graduates that will have skills with immediate application to industry.    The intellectual merit of this research center includes strong collaboration with computing, including: 1) Big Data Analysis: social media at scale, including the acquisition, storage, search, analysis, and visualization of potentially TBs of data; 2) Cyberinfrastructure: architectures and sustainable funding models for secure large scale storage, computing, and high-speed networking to support social media applications; 3) Mobile Applications: hand-held devices, wireless network technologies, including applications to emerging economies; 4) Technology and People: issues of how social media affects the human condition; 5) Business Intelligence: how business can use social media to improve business processes; and 6) Society and Computing: policies regarding privacy, use of social media in medical, education, or other novel application areas.   Due to a number of unforeseen circumstances we decided not to pursue this project. Since no one is trying to pursue forming an IUCRC any longer, we have endorsed returning the unliquidated balance of our planning grant award to NSF.The allocated funds of $11,500 have now been returned back to the NSF.
