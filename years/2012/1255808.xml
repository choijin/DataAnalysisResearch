<AbstractNarration>Flowers exhibit a multitude of forms that are astounding to human observers, but critical to the reproductive success of plants, and much of floral diversity has been shaped by evolutionary interactions between flowers and pollinators. Evolutionary shifts from bee- to bird-pollinated flowers have occurred numerous times, and contributed significantly to flower diversity. Yet there are two central issues that remain largely unexplored. What are the genetic changes that allow for an evolutionary transition from bee- to bird-pollination floral syndrome? And do similar genetic changes explain the many independent transitions to flowers optimized for bird pollination? The genus Penstemon is one of a few flowering plant groups well suited to address these questions - bird pollination has evolved more than ten times independently, and many species are inter-fertile, allowing for a genetic approach to determine the genes responsible for a complex suite of floral traits associated with bird-pollination. This project will develop molecular genetic tools in two closely related bee- and bird-pollinated Penstemon species. Tools will include transgenic approaches, genome sequencing and genetic mapping that will allow the researchers to explore the genetic changes necessary for a transition from bee- to bird-pollination floral traits. These early insights into the genetics of a pollination system shift will establish the foundation for a novel, highly integrative approach involving evolutionary, ecological, genetic and developmental studies to determine processes that underlie the evolution of complex traits. This project will contribute to the training of a postdoctoral researcher and undergraduate students at the interface of plant evolutionary genetics and development, and provide individuals from the emerging generation of scientists with skills in applying next-generation sequencing technology to critical questions of trait evolution. Undergraduates will be recruited through nationally funded programs at the University of Kansas aimed at increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
