<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to combine data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to provide a high-precision measurement of the spatial clustering of obscured quasars. The scientific objective is to establish if the obscured QSO population has a different origin from unobscured QSOs, for example if they live in larger dark matter halos.  This may lead to important new probes Dark Matter Halo structures and the evolution of galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate students, and outreach to middle-school teachers via summer workshops in collaboration with the Department of Secondary Education at the University of Wyoming, with the primary goal of increasing the quality of middle- and secondary-level physics education in Wyoming and New Hampshire.</AbstractNarration>
