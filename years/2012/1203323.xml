<AbstractNarration>The project will establish a modern liquid nitrogen storage system to ensure the long-term preservation of the tissue and genetic collections housed at the California Academy of Sciences (CAS). This one-year project will acquire and install new liquid nitrogen freezers, an oxygen deficiency safety monitor, and a dry ice maker. This will be followed by the transfer of tissues and DNA collections from -80ºC electric freezers to the new system. Liquid nitrogen provides colder storage (-190ºc) and reduces costs and risks of electric freezers.  This new system will provide efficient, stable, and reliable long-term storage for irreplaceable biological resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The growing tissue and genetic collections at CAS support the global scientific community. These genetic resources have been used in numerous studies, including studies of biodiversity, the effects of global climate change, studies of conservation policy and management, as well as basic scientific research.  In addition, every step of the proposed project will be documented by the CAS Science Visualization team, who will produce a video for the "Science in Action" exhibit. This video will be used in the museum public floor, web pages, and other institutional resources, and it will communicate the value and importance of frozen genetic collections.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project is to establish a modern liquid nitrogen storage system to ensure the long-term preservation of the tissue and genetic collections housed at the California Academy of Sciences.  The grant allowed us to purchase and installed five liquid nitrogen freezers.  Installation included a seismic upgrade to our freezer room to prevent the liquid nitrogen tanks and their associated dewars from moving during an earthquake.  Venting ducting was installed and attached to the dewars in the event of a malfunction of the pressure release valves. We installed an oxygen deficiency monitor to protect staff in the event of excess nitrogen release.  Each LN2 freezer is equipped with a controller that monitors the environment inside the freezer.  Each controller alarm system was wired to our in-house Building Maintenance System (BMS).  If the nitrogen level drops or the temperature increases, the controller will alarm at the freezer controller and also alert the CASÆs stationary engineers control room and other key personnel via phone, text message, and/or email through the BMS.   Other items associated with the project included purchasing 14-shelf freezer racks, enough to populate all freezers.  We also purchased a computer and monitor, to be kept in the freezer room, so specimen databases can be queried by staff working with the frozen collections.     We produced a video highlighting the process of obtaining, curating, and storing genetic resources.  The video was recorded in high definition and shown on two 42-inch media screens on our public exhibit floor.        Last Modified: 08/25/2015       Submitted by: Warren B Simison]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
