<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research program is to develop and to test experimentally a revolutionary new approach to modeling and predicting two-dimensional turbulent flows. A set of weakly unstable invariant Navier-Stokes solutions will be identified and transitions between invariant solutions will be characterized to provide a coarse global description of the nonlinear dynamics of turbulent flow. Quasi-2D flow in a shallow electrolyte layer continually driven by Lorentz forces provides the setting for theoretical, analytic and experimental development of this approach. Novel and proven techniques, such as periodic orbit theory, group representation theory, Krylov-subspace numerical methods, Newton and variational solvers will be used to develop this viewpoint, which will be tested in experiments where the flow can be measured with full spatial and temporal resolution throughout the entire flow domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will impact several areas of science, engineering, and medicine. Although the focus of this investigation is on fluid turbulence in two dimensions, the proposed approach has the potential to provide new ways to model, and ultimately control, a wide range of spatiotemporally chaotic systems, such as magnetic confinement fusion reactors and abnormal cardiac dynamics (from mild arrhythmias to potentially lethal fibrillation). The most immediate practical application, however, is the reduction of turbulent drag responsible for a significant part of the fuel consumed in the automotive, aviation, and shipping industries. Even an incremental reduction of drag by the proposed flow control methodology would have a tremendous economic impact. All software and data produced by the research program will be made publicly available with a central aim of lowering the barrier of entry to dynamical systems research by providing well-documented, easy-to-use interfaces to state-of-the-art numerical algorithms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Fluid turbulence is omnipresent. Indeed, the flows of air and water  surrounding us are typically turbulent. Turbulent flows are characterized by  complicated, irregular, almost random patterns. Oddly enough, the governing law  of fluid dynamics - the Navier-Stokes equation - is completely deterministic: the  evolution of the flow is entirely determined by initial conditions, i.e., the  velocity field of the fluid at some instant in the past. Understanding how  apparently random dynamics can arise in such a deterministic system and how we  describe - and forecast - these dynamics remains one of the greatest unsolved  problems of classical physics.  The key insight and the biggest hurdle to understanding turbulence is the nonlinearity of the Navier-Stokes equation, which implies that solutions  describing turbulent flow cannot be found in analytic form. On the other hand,  fully-resolved direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equation are  computationally so expensive that real-time forecasting of turbulence remains out  of reach despite the advances in computational hardware and numerical methods.  Due to these limitations, fluid turbulence has been described primarily using a  statistical framework which, despite being successful in characterizing some  aspects of turbulence, falls short in providing a tractable means to predict the  evolution of a turbulent flow even over relatively short time scales.  Recent studies have approached turbulence from a new perspective, which stems  from the observation that turbulent flows often exhibit recognizable transient  patterns that recur over time. These patterns, called "exact coherent structures"  (ECS), are related to a class of unstable solutions of the Navier-Stokes  equation, which can only be found numerically. The ECS exist in the same  parameter regime where turbulence is found, but being unstable, they are observed  only fleetingly. It has therefore been speculated that it may be possible to  construct a predictive description of fluid turbulence as a deterministic walk between neighborhoods of a hierarchy of ECS.  The objective of our research was to test, in numerical simulations and  experiment, whether ECS do indeed play a dynamically important role, with each  ECS guiding the evolution of turbulent flow over a finite period of time.  Furthermore, we wanted to test whether the transition from one neighborhood to  another is random or follows a prescribed route, which again corresponds to a  solution of the Navier-Stokes equation connecting different ECS. ECS and  connections between them can be thought of as a map of cities and roads between  them, with turbulent flow as a car driving down a road. While the "roadmap" is  static, it is the motion along the "roadways" that represents the evolution of  turbulent flow, with apparent randomness arising from the sensitive dependence of  any route on the initial conditions.  To facilitate these tests we focused on a nearly-two-dimensional flow in a  thin fluid layer. In the experiment the flow is driven by an electromagnetic  Lorentz force, which can be controlled much more precisely by varying the  electric current flowing through the fluid electrolyte. We have also derived a  two-dimensional mathematical model of the flow by depth-averaging the Navier- Stokes equation and validated the model by comparing its predictions with  experimental observations. This model has been used to describe the transition  from the (simple and predictable) laminar flow to turbulence. Furthermore, we  have identified several tens of ECS using initial conditions obtained by  analyzing both numerical and experimental data and have demonstrated that these  ECS do indeed play a dynamically important role in both experiments and  simulations.   In the process we have made two unexpected discoveries. We found that the  transition to turbulence is mediated by a temporally quasi-periodic solution,  while the vast majority of ECS correspond to equilibrium (time-independent)  solutions of the model. This discovery directly contradicts, and calls for a  through reassessment of the previously hypothesized scenario accepted by most  researchers in the field, that turbulence should be described using hierarchies  of temporally periodic solutions. Furthermore, we have developed a novel  numerical method that, for the first time, allows computation of not only the  unstable solutions describing ECS, but also the connections between them, which  is crucial for our ability to construct "roadmaps" of turbulent flows.  In sum,  we have shown that it is possible to make forecasts over time intervals of  moderate length by using the "roadmap" based on ECS and their connections. We  have demonstrated that connections originating near an ECS "guide" all turbulent  solutions in their vicinity, in both experiments and numerical simulations, over  many characteristic time scales, when the flow loses any resemblance to the  initial condition.
