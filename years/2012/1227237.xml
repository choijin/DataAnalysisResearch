<AbstractNarration>This award provides continued funding for an innovative effort to gather data about prices and incomes for many goods across many countries and across a very long time span.  The PIs and their collaborators in the US work with a global group of scholars to assemble data on the prices of staple goods and on the distribution of income. They make extensive searches of a variety of archival data sources to assemble this information.  The result is publicly available data that can be used to make comparsions about per capita incomes and living standards across time and across distance.  The PIs will continue previous effort with expanded data collection in China, Russia and Latin America. They will collect a new fiscal history data set that will compare certain indicators of government revenues and expenditures over the past centuries. The PIs plan research into whether relative prices are a cause of class-specific lifestyles and the structural determinants of fiscal capacity and fiscal choice. The PIs will also add this historical data to the Penn World Tables, which provide similar data for the period since 1950. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include training both undergraduate and graduate students in the necessary research methods.  The data are also useful for policy makers who want to understand the historic roots of modern economic systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             The Global Price and Income History (GPIH) Group has greatly expanded the worldÆs knowledge of peopleÆs wages and earnings, and the prices they had to pay, between the year 1200 and 1950, when other international sources take over.  It now offers downloadable historical data on the internet site gpih.ucdavis.edu, plus dozens of publications of frontier research. The Group is proud of this, and is grateful to NSF for its crucial research support.              The central question driving the GroupÆs research efforts has been "Who had better living standards than whom in the past?" The answers provided by the GPIH GroupÆs research, and the downloadable data it supplies, have expanded since NSF support began.  A key starting point was to make the units of measurement comparable across countries, converting currency units into silver or hard currencies, and converting idiosyncratic local physical units into metric units.  Once this was achieved as part of NSFÆs initial support, the Group measured, and wrote about, real wage rates around the world.  Its public data set on wages and prices now numbers 222 downloadable sets of time series, with emphasis on the period 1500-1800. The resulting publications did much to clarify when, where, and why there were "Great Divergences" between Europe and Asia.               The next focus was on government fiscal growth and its share of nominal GDP, again covering as many centuries as the primary data permit.  The GroupÆs internet site sprouted new folders on government budgets and on nominal GDP.  Books published in this phase were Philip HoffmanÆs Why Did Europe Conquer the World (2015), Guanglin LiuÆs Chinese Market Economy, 1000-1500 (2015), and a still-forthcoming book by Debin Ma and co-authors on ChinaÆs economic growth over the last millennium, which they have previewed at length in the Journal of Economic Literature (March 2014).               Supported by these earlier waves of new data on wages, prices, GDP, and government spending around the world, a new phase of research has focused on inequality and fiscal redistribution, and also on some major revisions in the history of nationsÆ relative purchasing power.  The main book in this phase is the forthcoming (2016) book Unequal Gains, by Peter Lindert and Jeffrey Williamson.
