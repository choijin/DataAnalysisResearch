<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Harmata of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri-Columbia will explore the development of methods for the generation of allylic cations under mild conditions and study their [4+3]-cycloadditions with dienes.  Silyloxyacroleins will be prepared and treated with catalytic amounts of chiral Lewis acids in the presence of dienes.  Such studies will also be conducted with vinylogs of these species.  Chloroketones and various derivatives will be treated with chiral amine bases in the presence of dienes in anticipation of the generation of oxyallylic cations bonded to chiral counterions able to induce stereoselectivity in subsequent reactions.  Silver salts of chiral non-nucleophilic anions will be used similarly, as will chiral thioureas with chloroketone derivatives.  Finally, the photoionization of certain derivatives of allylic alcohols and the gold-catalyzed generation of allylic cations from selected esters of allylic alcohols will be developed.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The [4+3]-cycloaddition reaction results directly in the synthesis of seven-membered rings, a substructure of a vast number of compounds that are biologically important.  Further, studies from the Harmata group and others have demonstrated that this reaction can lead to a variety of ring sizes, increasing molecular complexity of simple starting materials in short order to produced value-added structures economically.  The successful results of this work could positively impact the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and specialty chemical industries. In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Studies on the synthesis of the antitumor agent chinensiolide progressed to some degree, but stalled due to synthetic difficulties.  Happily, methodology associated with the synthesis was investigated independently and it was found that both a gold-catalyzed and an Bronsted-acid catalyzed (4+3)-cycloaddition were viable in certain instances, paving the way for the development of asymmetric, catalytic versions of this reaction (Scheme 1).  This chemistry will be pursued when further funding is obtained.     The synthesis and chemistry of 2-borylated allylic sulfones was published and further studies have enabled application of the research to the (4+3)-cycloaddition reaction.  In the approach shown, a polycyclic product was produced that bears the ring structure of ingenol mebutate, a compound used in the treatment of actinic keratosis (Scheme 2).     A regiodivergent synthesis of 1- and 2-arylsulfonyldienes was developed such that a single precursor gives rise to either product based on a simple switch in reaction conditions (Scheme 3).     Further studies of the silver-catalyzed rearrangement of propargyl sulfinates esters led to the discovery of a new synthesis of alpha-hydroxy ketones.  Attempts to produce a compound that could be used in a Nazarov reaction such that the intermediate in the process might be trapped in a (4+3)-cycloaddition reaction afforded a tetrahedrofuran and led to the development of a new silver-catalyzed synthesis of dihydrofurans (Scheme 4).     This work has been extended to the synthesis of 3-pyrrolines (Scheme 5) and certain dihydropyrans and tetrahydrooxpepins (Scheme 6), opening a new     area of research that will have important implications for the synthesis of materials and compounds possessing cyclic ether or amine substructures .  There are many naturally-occurring, biologically active compounds that fit this description.          Last Modified: 09/16/2013       Submitted by: Michael Harmata]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
