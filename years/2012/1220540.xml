<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project between investigators at Columbus State University and the University of Florida aims to resolve conflicting interpretations of the tectonic origin and age of a number of metamorphosed granitoids in the Ashland-Wedowee-Emuckfaw belt (Eastern Blue Ridge) province of Alabama in the southernmost Appalachians.  Traditionally attributed to latest Cambrian-Middle Ordovician magmatism associated with the Taconic orogeny, the Elkahatchee Quartz Diorite, Zana Gneiss, and Kowaliga Gneiss have been considered by some workers to be part of an obducted Taconic island or peri-Laurentian arc emplaced atop the subducting margin of North America.  SHRIMP-RG results from the dominant quartz diorite component of the Elkahatchee, however, suggest an Upper Devonian emplacement age with considerable evidence for abundant xenocrystic inheritance which may have complicated the initial whole rock and multi-grain analyses completed over two decades ago.  The potential for significant Acadian-aged magmatic components in the Elkahatchee calls into question its association with a Taconic arc; a question which can only be addressed by detailed isotopic analysis of the various lithologies typically assigned to this batholith.  Furthermore, since both the Zana and Kowaliga gneisses were assigned ages using some of the same techniques as those used to assign a latest Cambrian age to the Elkahatchee, attribution of these plutons to Ordovician orogenesis is also suspect.  Spatially resolved U-Pb analysis of these plutons will provide the best temporal context for examining the Lu-Hf systematics of zircon components and, in combination, will allow us to constrain the petrotectonic evolution of parental magma(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project will shed new light on the tectonic evolution of the North American margin and the development of the Appalachian Mountains through the Paleozoic.  Significantly, it will provide new constraints on fundamental questions regarding evolution of the southern Appalachian orogeny because of its bearing on the continuity and nature of subduction along the eastern margin of North America during the closure of the Iapetus and Rheic oceans.  These results will also afford an improved understanding of the role of important plutonic elements in the evolution of the southern Appalachians, which will be of advantage to many institutions in the region for undergraduate and graduate instruction.  Integration of student and faculty expertise and opportunities at these universities will have a significant impact on training professional geoscientists, who are critical to developing a strong national STEM workforce, and will provide valuable support for a faculty research program at a predominantly undergraduate institution through the Research in Undergraduate Institutions program (RUI).  Finally, this project will afford a group of geology undergraduates an invaluable experience (from field to analytical) through participation in a geological research program, greatly enhancing their undergraduate education and enhancing the nation?s STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on establishing an age and tectonic framework for three significant plutons in the Eastern Blue Ridge of western Alabama &ndash; the Elkahatchee Quartz Diorite, Zana Granite, and Kowaliga Gneiss.  U-Pb dating of samples from all three plutons suggests a Middle Ordovician age for the Zana Granite (ca. 460 Ma), Silurian age for the Kowaliga Gneiss (ca. 430 Ma), and Late Devonian age for the Elkahatchee Quartz Diorite (ca. 370 Ma).  Mapping of these plutons in the context of their country rock indicates the Elkahatchee batholith sutures the boundary between stratigraphy of the Early Paleozoic Laurentian slope-rise (Ashland Supergroup) and an overlying Ordovician back-arc basin (Wedowee Group), while the Zana Granite sutures the boundary between units within this back-arc sequence (Wedowee and Emuckfaw Groups).  Coupled with ages of detrital zircons from the Wedowee and Emuckfaw Groups, and along-strike ca. 480-460 Ma metavolcanic units of the Dahlonega gold belt in Georgia, the ca. 460 Ma Zana Granite and ca. 430 Ma Kowaliga Gneiss indicates rapid deposition of sediment within an attenuating "Sea of Japan-style" marginal basin (Wedowee-Emuckfaw-Dahlonega back-arc basin), with magmatic-volcanic activity persisting for ~50 m.y. (ca. 480-430 Ma). Significantly, this has important implications for Early Paleozoic Laurentian tectonic reconstructions, as it produces contrasting models of orogenesis for the northern and southern ends of the Iapetus-facing, Appalachian margin during the Ordovician Taconic orogeny.  In the northern Appalachians of New England and Canada, A-type subduction of continental crust beneath an exotic or peri-Laurentian volcanic arc is typically invoked to explain the earliest phases of the Taconic orogeny.  Similarly-aged, Laurentian-directed, B-type subduction of Iapetus lithosphere in the southern Appalachians suggests that one or more major transform boundaries must have accommodated a flip in subduction polarity between the two ends of the margin during the latest Cambrian-Early Ordovician, similar to that observed along the modern New Zealand Alpine fault at the juncture of the Puysegur and Kermadec-Hikurangi trenches.  Previously unrecognized evidence for younger Silurian magmatism along the southern Appalachian, Laurentian margin (i.e. Kowaliga Gneiss), within the older Ordovician-aged back-arc basin suggests that this plate tectonic setting may have persisted beyond the timeframe typically attributed to the Taconic orogeny.  This project, additionally, allowed a group of nine undergraduate geology students at a small, predominantly undergraduate institution (Columbus State University; CSU) the opportunity to participate in a research experience typically available only at large research institutions.  These students received extensive training in field mapping, petrography, database management, and got the opportunity to work with high precision geochemical analytical equipment (e.g. SEM, XRF, LA-ICP-MS) at the University of FloridaÆs Center for Isotope Geoscience. They were, additionally, able to present the results of their research at national and regional conferences.  These experiences were critical in the decision of six of these students to pursue a post-baccalaureate degree in the geosciences.  Field and laboratory equipment acquired during this grant improved facilities at CSU, and will facilitate research beyond the duration of the project.
