<AbstractNarration>This capacity building project involves Texas A and M University-Kingsville in partnership with Del Mar and South Texas Colleges and the Kingsville, Corpus Christi, and Pharr-San-Juan Independent School Districts.  They are developing a program to increase the number of mathematics, science, and technology certified students graduating well prepared to serve students in the many high needs schools in their area.  The Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, of Teacher and Bilingual Education, of Mathematics, of Biological and Health Science, of Chemistry, and of Physics and Geosciences are all involved in this planning phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This project involves the cooperation of senior faculty from a variety of departments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The broad array of partners involved in this project indicates not only the broad impact the project has within the region of south Texas, but also its potential to serve as a model for other areas throughout the country with similar resources and challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Capacity Building of Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program project led to, (1) phase I Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program project to recruit and train 24 Noyce scholars, (2) Computer Science degree with teacher certificate, and (3)  collaborative relationships between the high-need secondary schools, the community colleges, and TAMUK, (4) selection, admission, disbursement and compliance process for Noyce Scholars.   This proposal is targeted at Capacity Building of Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program. The goal of this proposed project is to create the Future STEM Teachers in South Texas (F(ST)2) program, which will recruit, train, and support prospective teachers. F(ST)2 is focused on encouraging talented undergraduate students in Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville (TAMUK) majoring in Computer Science, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, Geoscience, and Physics to become certified K-12 STEM teachers in South Texas.    The objectives of this project include:   Developing recruitment and marketing plan to recruit students who are presently majoring in STEM disciplines and help them to become teachers. This includes transfer students from community colleges as well as students who are native to the institution.  Developing new courses and curriculum to help STEM students complete their STEM discipline and a teacher certificate. Developing new courses and curriculum to recruit students who already have degrees in STEM disciplines into graduate programs for their masterÆs degree with a teacher certificate.  Developing partnership with community colleges to make sure students can complete the requirements for their degree in their STEM discipline and a teacher certificate.  Developing an institutional structure for coordinating and managing the F(ST)2 program, including course  and curriculum development, materials development, recruitment and marketing, procedures for tracking students after their degree completion, and establishment of necessary connections and articulation agreements with school districts, and community colleges.  Developing a selection, admission, disbursement and compliance process for Noyce Scholars. Developing supportive infrastructure for new STEM teachers to support and retain Noyce Scholars in their first three years of teaching in high-need schools.
