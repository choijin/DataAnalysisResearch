<AbstractNarration>This project is convening a workshop of directors of Quantitative and Mathematics Support Centers (QMaSCs) from across a range of different types of institutions. Such centers serve tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of students across the country each year; and they are present at large universities, at liberal arts colleges, and at community colleges. While each center services a diverse set of needs at its specific institution, collectively they all share a common set of concerns and issues. Yet, there is currently no body of resources from which directors of QMaSCs and their staffs can draw. To fill this void, the PI team has set three principal goals for this workshop:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) to begin a national conversation on directing QMaSCs, in support of this key aspect of the STEM infrastructure on campuses; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) to establish a sustainable network of people involved in the work of QMaSCs in order to provide and share resources; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) to create a handbook of best practices for those who direct QMaSCs or those who may direct QMaSCs in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop leaders are working with the participants to formulate a framework for establishing such a professional organization for staff members of QMaSCs. In addition, the primary product of the workshop is a handbook for directors of QMaSCs, modeled after the Writing Center Directors Handbook (Murphy and Stay, LEA Publishers, 2006) used on campuses nationwide. The QMaSC handbook is expected to be a publicly available document geared at providing materials and proven practices for QMaSC directors, including chapters on the various shared aspects of directing a center and case studies that reflect the broad range of activities undertaken by QMaSCs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantitative and Mathematics Support Centers (QMaSCs) exist in many forms and structures at most two- and four-year colleges and universities in the United States.  These centers provide tutoring to large numbers of students.  For example, the Quantitative Resource Center at St. Lawrence University had over 3500 visits from approximately 550 students during the 2011-2012 academic year.  Similar centers at Hamilton College, Bates College, Michigan State University and Central Washington University recently recorded yearly totals of approximately 1200, 2100, 15000 and 2300 visits, respectively. The centers are pivotal in keeping students in the STEM pipeline and in developing a future work force with the required tools for tackling STEM problems.  Additionally, QMaSCs often serve students outside of STEM majors to broaden quantitative competency in the arts, humanities, and social sciences.   This grant developed a set of materials for individuals who direct mathematics help centers.  We refer to these centers as Quantitative and Mathematics Support Centers or QMaSCs.  As part of this grant, we hosted a workshop where approximately 25 QMaSC directors discussed and critiques chapters on directing a QMaSC.  This event was held in Hartford, CT in July of 2013.  The center directors that were chosen for the workshop were selected for their geographic and institutional diversity.  We had directors from all regions of the country and from community colleges, four year colleges and research universities.  The chapters that were presented at the workshop were then edited based upon comments received during the workshop.  Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of running a QMaSC.  Among the sections for these chapters are Center Leadership and Management; Community Interactions; Staffing, Hiring and Training; Center Assessment; and Starting a Center.  Additionally, there were ten cases studies of QMaSC centers that were written by QMaSC directors.  All of these chapters and case studies have been combined into an over 400-page publication entitled A Handbook for Directors of Quantitative and Mathematics Support Centers which should be available in late 2015 or early 2016.  The materials in this Handbook will provide a valuable resource to QMaSC directors nationally.          Last Modified: 10/13/2015       Submitted by: Michael E Schuckers]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
