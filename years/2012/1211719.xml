<AbstractNarration>The PI and his collaborators plan to collect and analyze data of white dwarfs in star clusters in order to investigate two of the most important outstanding issues in star formation: the amount of post-main-sequence mass loss as a function of initial mass and the critical mass separating white dwarfs from Type II supernovae.   They will observe white dwarfs in star clusters in order to control the variable of stellar age, and thus, stellar mass. The investigators will conduct the work primarily using photometry from 4-m and 8-m class telescopes. They will involve students from high school, Johns Hopkins University and a postdoctoral research associate and generate a significant educational and public outreach effort. The scientific results from this project will be important to other fields within astrophysics, such as stellar populations, interpretation of the mass-to-light ratio of galaxies, galactic chemical evolution and stellar population synthesis modeling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Like human beings, the stars in the night sky have lifecycles.  They are born, they slowly evolve and change, and eventually they die.  A star like our Sun, which is 4.5 billion years old, is a little more than one-third of the way through its lifecycle.  As it becomes older, its temperature, luminosity, and size will change in dramatic ways and affect our Solar System.   The purpose of the NSF Project, "Star Clusters as Laboratories for Measuring Stellar Mass Loss" is to measure the evolutionary process that defines the future fate of stars.  We know that the most important stellar property in shaping this evolution is the mass of the star; more massive stars evolve quickly by burning through their hydrogen fuel whereas less massive stars are more efficient and can sustain their luminosity for much longer.  Yet, despite the mass, for 90% of the life of any star, it remains in a state of equilibrium by balancing the inward force of gravity on its surface layers by the external pressure from nuclear fusion reactions in the core.  The resulting stellar brightness and temperature are approximately constant.  This balance breaks when a star exhausts its hydrogen supply.  The resulting core of the star then contracts and the envelope balloons.  In a "blink of an eye", the star begins losing its mass and dramatically changes, ending up more than 100 times smaller than it began.   To measure the late stages of stellar evolution, we must measure the amount of stellar mass loss that stars suffer.  This remains one of the biggest unsolved problems in stellar astrophysics, and it directly impacts our understanding of the end fate of our own Sun.  To tackle this problem, we observed dozens of clusters of stars across the northern and southern hemisphere.  These clusters are unique testbeds for the stellar evolution process as all of the stars formed at the same time, and therefore, they all have the same age.  Yet, depending on the masses of the individual stars within a cluster, they will all be at different stages of the stellar evolution process.   Within each cluster, we were able to simultaneously observe the stars that are just exhausting their nuclear fuel today (and therefore still have their full mass), and those that are just beginning to die as remnants that have lost their mass.  By linking these two measurements, we can derive the mass lost by a give star.  We then repeated this experiment in different star clusters with different ages, such that the evolving stars are different mass.  The result is the first global initial-final mass relation of stars, extending from stars about the mass of the Sun to those that are 7 times more massive.  Our results show that more massive stars will lose larger fractions of their mass through the stellar evolution process, and the exact nature of the relation allows us to test different theoretical mass loss prescriptions.  Our work is the first to extend this relation up to the most massive stars that suffer this end fate, above which stars will explode as supernovae.   The results of our project have been shared with the general public and students through dozens of public outreach and education events that the PI Jason Kalirai has spearheaded.  We also involved an underrepresented high school student into our project and guided him towards researching stellar evolution.  He job shadowed the PI and built animations on how different stars will evolve and compiled his project into a nice web page explaining stellar life cycles.
