<AbstractNarration>This NSF Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project will develop commercial-grade solid state transformer (SST) related technology and conduct field trials at a major distribution power grid location. Today's existing distribution transformer lacks the ability to send or receive signals, make decisions, regulate power flow, and easily accommodate green technology (including renewable generation). The SST changes this with the use of power electronics and is often assimilated with internet hubs, as information flows similarly and decisions are automatically made at this utility/customer intersection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Named as one of the top ten technologies that can change our life by MIT Technology Review in 2011, the SST is a smart device for integrating renewable energy, electric vehicle, and energy storage into the distribution grid. There is a significant interest to see that this technology is transferred to the market place to benefit U.S. industry and electric utilities. The SST is a critical component for microgrid environments and offers many potential features that will be required in the next generation distribution grid. The AIR project not only is to achieve a comprehensive and impressive list of SST functionalities in smart grid application, but also to do so with an innovative SST design at a cost acceptable to the market place.</AbstractNarration>
