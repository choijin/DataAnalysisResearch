<AbstractNarration>Widespread declines of pollinators are a major concern because of their potential effects on agricultural crops and on reproduction of plants in natural areas. Without pollination many species of plants will be in danger of extinction.  Pollinators are especially threatened in landscapes dominated by agriculture.  Nonetheless, some native species of bees are able to live in these landscapes and are likely to pollinate a large diversity of flowers.  Perhaps they can compensate for the reduction of pollination services provided by non-native honey bees, whose populations are crashing.  This EAGER project will survey native bee communities in agricultural landscapes of southern California.  Researchers will census areas dominated by blueberry and tomato crops.  The primary goal is to determine the environmental factors that best predict which pollinators occur in different areas and which morphological traits best predict their pollination effectiveness.  This information will be valuable for conserving and managing populations of native bees to ensure that the pollination services they provide will be available for the greatest number of flowering plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide basic information about pollination, a critically important process in most agricultural crops.  The lead investigator is at a four-year Hispanic Serving Institution and undergraduate students from groups traditionally underrepresented in science will be involved in data collection and mentored in field research, enhancing their educational and employment prospects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Widespread declines of pollinators are of major concern because of the potential effects they may have on agricultural and natural systems.  It is estimated that about one-third of the human diet benefit from animal pollination, with bees (Hymenoptera: Apiformes) providing the majority of pollination services.  Most crops in North America are commercially pollinated by the non-native honey bee (Apis mellifera), however recent honey bee declines demonstrate the need to characterize the role that native bee species can play in agricultural ecosystems, and to identify the factors that influence their abundance.  For this study I have attempted characterize the native bee communities of two crops in Ventura Co., CA, where honey bees are not normally brought in to provide pollination services, blueberries (Vaccinium spp., Ericaceae) and peppers (Capsicum annuum, Solanaceae).      In southern California blueberries bloom during the later winter to early spring.  During the winter 2013 and 2014 flowering seasons, one and six blueberry fields were surveyed for native bees.  Flowering of the two most commonly planted cultivars was also monitored at these sites.  The peak blueberry flowering period shifted about three weeks earlier in 2014 relative to 2013 (late February) because of the relatively warm winter.  Honey bees were more common early in the seasons whereas native bee species, were more common later in the season (mid-March).  These results suggests that winter weather can increase the temporal mismatch between the time blueberries are in flower and when native bees are abundant.  Although honey bees are not considered to be efficient pollinators of blueberries, the fact that they are active year-round in southern California makes them a viable solution to growers in need of pollination services during years when the weather forces blueberries to flower early.     Peppers are grown during the summer months in Ventura Co.  Bee communities were surveyed during the 2013 and 2014 seasons at six and nine pepper fields, respectively.  Honey bees were extremely abundant in 2013, but their numbers dropped in 2014 in response to the drought conditions.  However, native bee abundance did not change, with over 60 species of native bee species being recorded in both years.  This suggests that native bees may be locally more resilient to climate changes compared with honey bees.     Overall, native bee species richness and abundance was not related to flower abundance or field size, but rather appears to be related to the surrounding landscape.  Sites that were surrounded by greater amounts of native vegetation contained more native bees.  This suggests that bees are nesting in the native habitat but traveling to the pepper fields to forage.  Field observations at three pepper fields during the summer of 2015 also suggests that bees are also responding to daily fluctuations in the weather.  There was a negative relationship with bee activity and wind speed, but a positive relationship between barometric pressure and bee activity.  These results suggests that it might be possible to use daily weather patterns to predict times of day when bee activity would be the lowest so that pesticides could be applied while minimize the exposure risk to bees.       To verify that peppers are benefiting from bee visitation, pollinator exclusion experiments were performed at three pepper fields, and a bee yard, during the 2015 season.  Potted pepper plants were placed at three field sites for several weeks to experience wind-only (caged plants) or pollinators plus wind pollination (uncaged plants).  Plants were returned to a greenhouse so that peppers could mature and be measured.  This aspect of the study is still underway.
