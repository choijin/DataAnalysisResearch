<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish the feasibility of developing a genetically-encoded biosensor to monitor levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an important second messenger component of drug signaling pathways. Unlike existing FRET-based biosensors that depend upon energy transfer between two fluorescent molecules, this sensor will employ a single, circularly permuted fluorescent green protein. This green sensor can be coupled with  differently colored biosensors for other second messengers to produce simultaneous readouts for multiple components of a signaling pathway that change when activated by a drug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that multiplex, genetically-encoded assays reporting multiple cell signaling events would expand the depth of knowledge about signal transduction by improving information on the timing, location and pathway cross-talk in physiologically relevant tissues. These assays are homogenous, do not require multiple steps, or cell lysis. A growing trend in the pharmaceutical industry is screening in primary cell cultures, and genetically encoded assays are ideally suited for this. The technology to be developed in this proposal represents a new innovation in fluorescent live-cell assay and has strong potential to reduce the cost and improve the reliability of drug discovery to find safe and effective drugs that provide better treatment outcomes and improved human health.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  SBIR Outcomes: New Fluorescent Biosensors for Signaling in Living Cells  Reducing the risk and cost of drug discovery is a continuing challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. High throughput screening assays are not very good at selecting drug candidates that succeed in late stage clinical trials, which means that there is an urgent need for better assays that can answer questions about how drugs affect biology.  Does a drug act differently in different cell types? Does drug concentration determine cell signaling pathway selection? Does a particular drug select a pathway different from other drugs that activate the same receptor? Can localized signals be detected?   This SBIR project produced new, single fluorescent protein-based assays for screening drugs that activate G-protein coupled receptors  (GPCRs). Designed for use in living cells, these can be multiplexed and have the potential to identify new drugs that are more likely to succeed as safe, effective treatments for a wide variety of diseases.   GPCRs, also known as seven transmembrane domain (7TM) receptors, are the largest and most versatile class of drug targets. As therapeutic targets for numerous diseases including diabetes, heart disease and nervous system disorders, GPCRs are the focus of many drug discovery programs. A critical component of GPCR signaling is the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In our Phase I project, we created robust genetically-encoded cAMP sensors that we coupled with other sensors , to measure multiple responses that occur when a GPCR is activated in a living cell. These multiplex assays can determine when a drug selectively engages a particular signaling pathway.  Genetically-encoded sensors are also compatible with use in physiologically relevant cells. Because a drug may respond differently in different tissues , the ability to measure drug activity in specific cell types has the potential to identify new drugs for diseases that lack effective therapeutics today.  In summary, the objectives of this project were successfully achieved by:  Creating very robust green fluorescent protein cAMP sensors (40-100% intensity change) Developing a prototype red fluorescent protein cAMP sensor (30-40% intensity change) Developing a light-activated system for optimizing red fluorescent cAMP sensors in Phase II.
