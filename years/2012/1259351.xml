<AbstractNarration>This project is providing financial, academic, and peer support of high-need STEM majors who, because they desire both to be trained as a professional scientist or mathematician and seek a career in teaching, are traditionally marginalized by the culture of the research university.  The project is enabling these talented students to give back to the community, to make a difference, and to serve as a steppingstone for graduate school as appropriate to each individual S-STEM Scholar.  A robust assessment and evaluation plan includes longitudinal data that will assess the impact of research experiences and mentorships on a teacher's classroom practices and its subsequent effect on motivating the teacher's students to purse STEM education and careers.    The assessment is also establishing the effect of the mentoring experience on graduate students' confidence and success in entering academic positions in higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a scientist or mathematician, each S-STEM Scholar adds one person to the workforce; as STEM teacher, each S-STEM Scholars can inspire many students to pursue STEM careers.  The scholarships are reducing unmet financial need, thereby enabling S-STEM Scholars to concentrate on course-work during the academic year, to pursue strategies to shorten time-to-degree, to have time to engage in meaningful near-peer mentoring activities, and to participate in a variety of professional networking opportunities.  The project is devoting equal resources to continuing UCLA students and to students completing their final years after transferring to UCLA from a 2-year school.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Introduction  This S-STEM project targeted undergraduate students planning on teaching careers at either the secondary or tertiary level.  The 46 S-STEM Scholars were provided financial aid (usually for 5 quarters) and were paired up with a STEM PhD graduate student in their field ,who served as a ?near-peer mentor.?  All 46 Scholars graduated or will graduate by June 2020 with an average GPA of 3.3.  Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation data were collected.

(Response rate 70% for Mentors, 69% for Scholars.)  Scholars  Overall, the scholar participants reported a productive experience.  Financial Assistance. The most frequently cited aspect of the program that had the most positive impact on them was the financial support.  In addition to reducing stress and removing the burden of debt, the scholars were able to focus on studies and/or pursue other opportunities.  Other positive aspects included the help and support of mentors, the peer community, and the guidance provided regarding the process of becoming a teacher.  Interpersonal Connections. Although a few scholars did not have very much interaction with their mentors and felt neither positively nor negatively about their mentor/mentee relationship, the majority of scholars had very positive experiences and developed strong connections with their mentors. Several indicated they really enjoyed meeting with their mentors and found them to be very helpful and supportive. Scholars noted they had discussions with their mentors about myriad topics including: undergraduate experiences, laboratory research, future plans, academic goals, ideas about teaching, math tutorials, and even vacation plans.   My interaction with my mentor was very influential. He encouraged me with my teaching endeavors and provided immense support.   Field Knowledge. Scholars responded they learned subject-content knowledge (e.g., math, theoretical physics, biology, marine biology) from their mentors, which they found interesting, inspiring, and helpful to their own teaching efforts.  Connecting with someone who has experience with research and had a rich knowledge of biology was helpful for supporting me with my student teaching and introducing academic rigor into my classroom.   Resources and Guidance. Scholars noted their mentors connected them to useful resources and networks, helped them navigate the process of becoming a teacher, and provided advice and feedback about graduate school admissions and life as a graduate student.  My mentor took me to the [campus] telescope for the first time.  The meetings were helpful, and she connected me to [the] CNSI Nanoscience Summer Camp Program, where I ended up getting paid to work for a summer session - I learned so much there! My mentor was very supportive of me as I went through the graduate school application process.  This support helped me be more confident in myself during the whole process.   Mentors  Overall, the mentors enjoyed their experience in the program and welcomed its activities.  Fostering Community. Mentors appreciated the program's collegiality and opportunities for supportive interactions.  The primary benefit is being placed in a community of enthusiastic teaching faculty, graduate students and undergraduates.  ?. In particular, the moral support is so important. To be in a community with similar interests who see the value of thoughtful teaching is something I cherish.   Giving and Receiving Guidance. Mentors indicated they not only enjoyed dispensing advice and guidance, but that they also liked learning from their mentees and understanding more the undergraduate experience.  I had a wonderful time mentoring the two scholars I was paired with. I learned so much from them, enjoyed becoming friends with them, loved telling them about science, research, and academia,   Appreciating Teaching. When asked if their interactions with the scholars had an impact on their views about teaching and learning, about three quarters of the mentors responded indicated it affirmed their interest in and decision to teach, helped them to understand the student side of things, increased their interest in reaching out to underserved students, helped improve their explanation of math concepts, and gave them "insight into the training of K-12 teachers.?  Impacting Career Goals. When asked if their interactions with the scholars had an impact on their personal STEM career plans, most mentors responded that it did not. A few mentioned that the mentor experience affirmed their career goals, reinforced to them the value of mentorships, and generated excitement about their research. Two mentors noted that it did influence their career objectives.  It helped to shape one of my career objectives in that I want to develop  ?  biology courses tailored for students who are pursuing careers in secondary school teaching.
