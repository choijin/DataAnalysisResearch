<AbstractNarration>Doctoral Dissertation Research: &lt;br/&gt;"The Great Pacific Garbage Patch as Matter of Concern"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the production and sharing of knowledge about plastic pollution in the Pacific Ocean. It traces how the material practices of science, activism, and education constitute the Great Pacific Garbage Patch--the massive accumulation of waste floating between California and Japan--as an environmental problem and public concern. The methods of participant observation, interviews, and textual analysis will be used to follow the transformation of plastic samples, and with them knowledge about plastic pollution, as they move from expeditions at sea through laboratories, offices, presentations and publications around the Pacific.  Particular attention is given to the impact of the March 2011 tsunami on plastic pollution research and education, as debris from the event continues to test existing scientific models, shift public concerns and contribute physically to waste already at sea. The research will present findings so as to foster cooperation between sceintists, activists and policy makers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research investigated how people come to know about plastic pollution in the Pacific Ocean, a problem seemingly distant from everyday life, yet directly connected to it. The focus was on the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch" of waste accumulating between Hawaii and California.   It considered how ways of knowing produce different versions of the problem and shape the kinds of solutions that seem most reasonable. For example, ocean plastic pollution understood as a solid trash 'island' encourages responses based on clean up and recycling, whereas pollution that cannot easily be seen or measured may not be considered a problem at all.   Conducting fieldwork with scientists, activists and artists in California, Hawaii, Oregon and Japan allowed for nuanced understandings of the many efforts that shape public understanding of a global environmental problem. At the same time, in documenting the ways plastic cannot simply be taken back or cleaned up from the ocean, research supports the need for preventative, upstream solutions. In doing so, this project pushes academic conversations and theories about the role of objects in social lives towards questions and practices of responsibility.  In addition, photographs taken as part of this work have been contributed to a museum exhibit and geography textbook.
