<AbstractNarration>The Cordilleran cyclicity model predicts that detachment of dense continental lithosphere should be accompanied by rapid uplift of an orogenic plateau and resulting rapid advance of deformation in the frontal fold-thrust belt.  In the central Andean plateau, recent isotopic studies argue for rapid surface uplift of the southern Altiplano in Bolivia between 16 and 13 million years ago, which has been attributed to removal of dense material at depth.  The Cordilleran cyclicity model predicts that the Andean fold-thrust belt should have responded to this rapid uplift event through rapid eastward propagation of the deformation front.  However, accurate records of the timing and magnitude of deformation in the thrust belt in southern Bolivia are not available, which leaves this key prediction untested. In this project, we are performing a field-based study aimed at documenting the response (or lack thereof) of the Andean fold-thrust belt to the rapid rise of the hinterland plateau.  The project involves geologic mapping along an east-west transect through the thrust belt in southern Bolivia, which will support construction of a balanced cross-section.  By sequentially restoring deformation in the cross-section, we are generating a record of shortening over the last ~20-30 million years.  This record will be integrated with deformation timing constraints from analysis of field relationships of sedimentary rocks deposited during crustal shortening, and timing estimates for erosion of multiple thrust sheets obtained from low-temperature cooling histories.  The final goal of the project will be to generate a timing record of forward propagation rates of the thrust front and of contemporaneous depositional centers.  Together, these records will allow us to evaluate the orogenic response to rapid hinterland surface uplift, and therefore to test a key prediction of the Cordilleran cyclicity model. This project is training graduate and undergraduate students (including a Bolivian graduate student studying in the U.S.) in a STEM field, and is contributing to the broadening of representation of underrepresented groups in the earth sciences; it is facilitating a new collaboration between U.S. investigators at two institutions (University of Nevada Reno and the University of Texas at Austin); and it is fostering a valuable international collaboration between U.S. and Bolivian scientists. This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      This project addressed potential feedbacks among geologic processes that affect continents during mountain building, including erosion, climate, lithospheric removal, plateau uplift, magmatism, and shortening.  Our principal goal was to document the response of the Central Andean fold-thrust belt and foreland basin to a proposed episode of rapid surface uplift at 16-9 Myr ago in the Altiplano hinterland plateau.  The project integrated sedimentology, stratigraphy, basin analysis, magnetostratigraphy, structural geology, geochronology, and thermochronology to assess the evolution of hinterland (western) and foreland (eastern) regions of Bolivia.  New sedimentary, structural, U-Pb and U-Th/He geo/thermochronological datasets for Neogene clastic nonmarine sedimentary successions and associated structures were generated for a regional transect at 21&deg;.       Our results indicate that Central Andean deformation advanced rapidly forward (eastward) through propagation of the fold-thrust belt and coupled migration of the foreland basin.  Our field-based research in southern Bolivia reveals a spatial and temporal progression of deformation and synorogenic sedimentary depocenters through the Interandean and Subandean zones consistent with protracted east-west shortening.  However, inherited structures formed during Mesozoic extension may have allowed for spatial focusing of later deformation, precluding steady eastward advance of deformation.  New evidence for syndepositional faulting (growth strata), stratigraphic absolute ages, and shifts in sedimentary environments, accumulation, and provenance (from U-Pb age populations, paleocurrents, lithofacies, and sandstone compositional analyses) were integrated with exhumation timing constraints from apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronology to reconstruct the evolving foreland basin architecture and the geometry and kinematics of the critical transition (Interandean Zone) from the Subandean Zone to Eastern Cordillera.  An unexpected outgrowth of this study involved a rich record of detrital zircon U-Pb for pre-Andean (pre-Cenozoic) deposits, underscoring the importance of Paleozoic and Mesozoic tectonic events in controlling early basin and fault geometries but also in conditioning the crustal architecture prior to Andean shortening.       The results indicate that mountain building along ocean-continent convergent plate margins is sensitive not only to recent plateau uplift and the complex interplay between erosion and shortening, but also to inherited structural and stratigraphic features that can strongly influence the spatial and temporal dynamics of fold-thrust tectonics and foreland basin sedimentation.  Several novel aspects include the utilization of U-Pb and Ar-Ar geochronology of interbedded clastic and volcanic materials to assess the ages of growth strata and upper crustal structures.  This allowed us to define the timing of faulting in proximal foreland basin deposits.  Constraining the depositional (stratigraphic) ages of coarse foreland-basin fill has proven difficult, largely due to the lack of interbedded volcanic rocks and diagnostic fossils.  However, our results from U-Pb ages of detrital zircon grains and Ar-Ar ages of rare interbedded volcanic units help define the timing of displacement along several thrust faults, and probable Mesozoic normal faults.  When integrated with paleomagnetic data, the age constraints reveal a late Miocene shift to rapid sediment accumulation, which may correlate with punctuated displacement along a nearby thrust fault or a major sediment influx related to uplift of the Altiplano plateau and/or onset of monsoonal conditions.  Although the correlation does not require causation, a link between foreland basin accumulation and broader lithospheric or climatic drivers warrants further investigations in the Andes.
