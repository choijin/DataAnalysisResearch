<AbstractNarration>This project is establishing a three-semester curriculum, Introduction to Research I-III, that begins in the  freshman year.  Students complete two semester-long projects,  begin reading peer-reviewed scientific articles while learning about faculty research on campus, and choose a faculty advisor to aid them in writing a research proposal.  Experienced juniors and seniors serve as mentors for the freshman and sophomores.  It is based on a successful pilot project designed to test the feasibility of the design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Students gain an understanding of how research is conducted and skills they can use either in their graduate work or as they enter the work place.  Faculty have an opportunity to establish a research program at the institution that serves as the base for the work of other students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  This system is designed to serve as a model for other departments on campus and for other Predominantly Undergraduate Serving Institutions because of an educational  research component designed to study the effects of undergraduate  research on academic success and students' career choices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is difficult for faculty and students to engage in meaningful research at predominantly undergraduate institutions.  Faculty have limited time for research because of their teaching loads and students are often unprepared to provide valuable contributions that will move research projects forward.  We proposed a unique research training curriculum designed around a graduate school model where well trained students are responsible for the bulk of the research occurring in a faculty memberÆs laboratory.  The key to the model is to train many students early in their collegiate careers so they can provide multiple semesters of quality research when they are juniors and seniors.  We implemented a three semester Introduction to Research curriculum that begins in the second semester of a studentÆs freshmen year.  The curriculum trains students in basic molecular techniques with an increasing amount of autonomy as they progress through the three course sequence.  The courses include one semester of learning research techniques with considerable oversight from a faculty member.  The second semester involves a semester long project accompanied by weekly progress reports and troubleshooting from the instructor.  Also, interested faculty are invited to present their research to the students during the weekly meetings.  Finally, the third semester of the curriculum pairs students with a chosen faculty research advisor who helps the student develop a research proposal.  The project proposals are developed in the form of a grant application that gets vetted through our stateÆs Academy of Science grant competition.  Most students complete the three semester curriculum by the end of their sophomore years, leaving two full years to work on their proposed research project.  While the training curriculum is designed to give undergraduate students unique research opportunities, it also expands research opportunities to faculty members.  As more students are equipped to perform research, more hands are making progress in a faculty memberÆs laboratory.  Historically, most of the research accomplished at our undergraduate institution has been directly produced by the faculty member.  This training curriculum implements a graduate school type model where students do most of the work and faculty members support the students.  Because students learn research techniques as freshmen and sophomores, faculty do not need to spend time training those students.  Rather, faculty can spend time troubleshooting problems, working on grants for additional funding, or publishing past findings.  Finally, this model is designed to build a hierarchy of seniority within a laboratory.  The research curriculum pairs sophomore students with research advisors.  Those advisors likely have upperclassmen in their laboratories who can act as mentors to the upcoming research students.  In addition to providing guidance with research techniques and strategies, the mentoring students can pass long-term projects to younger students without interruptions in progress.  This is consistent with graduate school models where research faculty can explore larger complex questions because they have a continuum of researchers that maintain project momentum from year to year.  This research curriculum has been conducted for three years with data collected about the student participants and how those students compare to their non-researching peers.  While we are continuing to collect data about the students, we have observed that students engaged in research, specifically in the freshman year, are 10% more likely to stay in school.  We plan to eventually publish our results about how research opportunities affect student performance, career choices, and graduate school placement.
