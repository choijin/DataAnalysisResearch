<AbstractNarration>This action funds Alexander Blair Cook of The University of Texas at Dallas to conduct a research project, entitled "Connecting stacked solar cells with carbon nanotube electrodes" during the summer of 2012 at Shimane University in Matsue, Shimane, Japan.  The host scientist is Ichiro Hiromitsu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to better understand the physics of multi-junction solar cells as well to develop more effective techniques to incorporate carbon nanotubes into organic devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  This research promises to advance progress toward cost effective, light-weight and high efficiency solar energy for both consumer and industrial applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research goal of the project was to produce solar cell and light emitting diode technologies with new nanotechnology techniques.  The secondary goal was to foster a spirit of international collaboration in American and Japanese students as well as giving the American student (the PI) a taste of international travel and cultural experiences.  The program consisted of approximately two months of research at two different Japanese Universities.  At the first university, Organic Solar cell (OSC) technology was research and at the second, Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) technology was researched.  At the first University, the PI created OSC with polymers, small molecular materials and nanotubes.  The PI also investigated the synthesis and usage of metal oxide nanoparticles.  This research was beneficial to both the PI and the host institute as it introduced new fabrication and evaluation techniques.  At the end of the month, OSC containing nanoparticles, nanotubes and polymers had been fabricated and tested.  At the second University similar techniques were applied to OLED technology.  The research was of particular use to the PI as it broadened his field of expertise, but also useful to the host institute as it allowed the students to work with new nanomaterials.  Very bright green emitting OLED were produced, but the research also yielded some unexpected new ideas in the field of polymeric transistors.  Finally, This research represented a new generation of collaboration between research groups at the two Japanese Universities and the American University.  This collaboration had started in Japan over twenty years prior with students from different cultures fruitfully working together.  A new generation Students from two different countries had the opportunity to work together and build connections that should prove valuable in future research and professional endeavors.  It also allowed all those involved to be exposed to a culture quite different from their own.          Last Modified: 11/30/2012       Submitted by: Alexander Cook]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
