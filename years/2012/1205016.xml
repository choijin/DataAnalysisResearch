<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator (PI) will work on problems in the geometry and dynamics of Teichmuller space, moduli space of Riemann surfaces, directional flows on polygons and translation surfaces, and the mapping class group. These problems involve a fairly wide spectrum of mathematics including complex analysis, dynamical systems, and  geometry. The objective of the first  part of the project is to study the Weil-Petersson flow on moduli space and the geometry of its geodesics. This metric is fundamental in studying properties of moduli space. There are many important connections between the Weil-Petersson metric  and the hyperbolic geometry and dynamics of surfaces.  In the second part the goal is to study properties of  Teichmuller geodesics and their relation to flows on surfaces, and in the third part rigidity questions about Teichmuller space with the Teichmuller metric. The last part of the project  concerns the action of the mapping class group on Teichmuller space  and on its  boundary at infinity. If the goals of the project  are met, it would add to our understanding of these subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major role of mathematics is to provide a framework or language to discuss processes of science. The framework developed in this project centers on the concept of shape. In mathematics, Teichmuller theory and moduli space theory is the study of the shapes that a surface can assume. Geodesics in a space represent an efficient way of moving or evolving in the space and the study of geodesics is central to geometry.  Both  Weil-Petersson geodesics and Teichmuller geodesics  describe natural and very different ways in which the shapes of surfaces evolve efficiently over time.  This project concerns the study of this evolution under these two different processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved an area of mathematics called dynamical systems.  In this subject one studies the behavior of objects over time.  There are numerous examples of dynamicals that occur in the physical world.  A familiar one is the motion of planets. Another is   the motion of molecules such as gases, or the motions of molecular cells in biology. As mathematics can be thought of as the language of science, ideas in mathematics often tell us a great deal about our physical world.  Another  prominant example of a dynamical sytem involves studying what are called geodesic flows.  A geodesic is a shortest path between points.  An example of a  geodesic flow  are beams of light moving in straight lines as they bounce off the walls of a room.  In the theory of dynamical systems one studies the long term behavior of the objects under consideration.   One asks if objects always return to their starting positions, or do they exhibit the opposite  behavior?  An opposite behavior that can occur is mixing which says groups of orbits move everywhere, and at any given time can be expected to appear in an region  proportional to the size of the region.  An example of mixing is the process of stirring sugar in a cup of coffee. After a certain period of time the amount of sugar in any part of the cup is proportional to the volume of the part of that part of the cup.   Being able to prove mixing  tells one a great deal about a dynamical system. In this project funded by the National Science Foundation, the PI together with several collaborators studied the geodesic flow on what is known as the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. This space is a fundamental object in mathematics occuring  in the subjects of  algebra, geometry, and complex analysis.   The PI and collaborators were able to prove mixing  of the geodesic flow in this space, and in fact were able to find the rate at which this mixing occurs. In the research papers that were published we introduced new techniques in the subject of dynamical systems that we expect will be useful to other researchers. We also expect that other researchers will explore further aspects of this moduli space based on our work.        Last Modified: 08/22/2017       Submitted by: Howard Masur]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
