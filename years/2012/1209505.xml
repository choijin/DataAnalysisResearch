<AbstractNarration>This action funds Robert C. Ferrier of University of Pennsylvania to conduct a research project, entitled "Novel Nanocomposite Conductive Coatings," during the summer of 2012 at Kyoto University in Kyoto.  The host scientist is Kohji Ohno.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is, by utilizing novel polymerization techniques, unique electrically conducting, nanocomposite coatings can be realized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
