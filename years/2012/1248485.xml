<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate a new method for monitoring carbon capture and storage (CCS) sites. CCS reduces global warming by using deep geological formations to store large amounts of carbon dioxide formed at power plants or separated from natural gas. The proposed measurement approach combines two recent innovations to create vadose-zone (i.e., near surface) soil gas analyzers that can discern carbon dioxide that is leaking from deep storage from the carbon dioxide that is formed by biogeochemical processes in soil. Existing soil gas analysis protocols require a year, or more, of baseline measurements to characterize seasonal variations in naturally-occurring CO2 concentrations. The long-term baseline determinations must be made prior to the start of carbon dioxide capture. The proposed approach, in contrast, works immediately and is suitable for retrofit to existing capture sites. Installation will be simple. Analyzers will be the size of a gallon of milk, will not require consumable supplies, and can be powered from small solar panels. Soil gas will be sampled automatically from small-diameter, shallow monitoring wells. Gas analysis uses proven optical methods and includes direct measurement of nitrogen, which is needed to obtain correct mass balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercialization potential of this project is to enable a realistic, near-term mitigation method for global warming. Alternative energy sources cannot solve the problem quickly enough. Limited supplies of rare earth metals constrain production of wind generators and high-efficiency electric motors. Widespread use of solar photovoltaic panels is constrained by the up-front energy requirements for panel production. Carbon capture and storage, in comparison, relies to a large extent on existing infrastructure. Established oil-field technology identifies suitable CCS sites and to pump carbon dioxide deep underground. Coal-rich nations such as the United States can minimize coal?s global warming impact while continuing to use abundant, inexpensive fuel. Monitoring methods are needed to verify performance of storage sites and to help assure the public of the reliability and safety of CCS. Vadose zone measurements are important because it is CO2 mixing with air that contributes to global warming. The initially targeted niche has a near-term addressable market of $200 million. The planned product should capture 30% of the addressable market. This addressable market comprises CCS sites co-located with large coal-burning facilities. There are about 2500 such facilities world-wide and 20% of their locations are geologically favorable for CCS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mesa Photonics, in collaboration with the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas, proposes development and commercialization of compact, fully automated soil-gas analyzers for monitoring carbon capture and storage sites (CCS).  Large scale CCS is a realistic approach to limiting CO2 emissions from power plants, cement plants, natural gas wells, and high-volume CO2 sources.  Carbon dioxide is pumped deep underground where it ends up stored within salt water deposits (aquifers) that are far below fresh water supplies.  As with so many aspects of global warming, CCS generates technical, political, and economic concerns.  Issues include cost and technical questions about long term safety.  We envision a system of soil gas analyzers at each CCS site.  Measurement data will be shared freely with the public through an easy-to-use web site that displays current measurements as well as the data history.   Most CCS monitoring methods probe the deep &ndash; over a mile down &ndash; geological formations at the carbon capture site.  This is not surprising because we need to know if the stored carbon dioxide starts out stored properly.  But, the ultimate question about CCS effectiveness is: How much of that CO2 reaches the atmosphere?  People living near CCS sites are concerned about possible effects on themselves and their land due to leaks from deep underground reaching the surface.  Both issues can be addressed by detecting leaking CO2 in surface soil.  Geologists call this region the vadose zone.  Using standard chemical sensors to measure the amount of carbon dioxide in soil is not all that useful, however.  A lot of carbon dioxide in soil is produced by plants, insects, and microbes that live in the ground.  That makes all the difference when designing sensing methods that are intended to show the reliability and safety of CCS.  The technology being developed in this NSF-funded project can tell the difference between carbon dioxide that is formed by natural processes and any carbon dioxide that is caused by leaks from deep underground.    Results obtained during the Phase I portion of the project were more successful than anticipated. Component costs ended up lower than expected which means that the technology will be less expensive to manufacture and to buy.  At the end of July, Mesa Photonics will submit a research proposal to the NSF for funding that will lead within five years to commercialization of the new technology.   Carbon capture and storage can slow global warming. The US will be able to continue using domestic energy sources while also protecting our children and their children.  Mesa PhotonicÆs contribution will also lead to job growth as we scale up manufacturing, sales, and service of our new technology.
