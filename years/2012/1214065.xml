<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is supporting Professor Phillip Crews in the Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry at the University of California at Santa Cruz. The focus is on myxobacteria, which represent a unique system for the study of bio-complexity. They spread over a surface by swarming and often out-compete other organisms for nutrients. Fundamental knowledge about their basic physiology including colonization processes, prokaryotic development, genetics, and chemotaxis is emerging but at a rather slow pace.  This study aims to increase fundamental knowledge on the myxobacteria taxa obtained from the ocean/land interface, and seeks to uncover new biological systems possessing functional pathways for secondary metabolites. The project invokes a combination of environmental sampling, bioorganic functional chemistry analysis, and microbial taxonomy.  Identifying and characterizing unique myxobacterial strains obtained from untapped ecological niches with the capacity to biosynthesize novel chemical scaffolds is the core activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impact of this project involves developing unique research tools and technology to allow discovery and characterization of molecular structures that will be new to science. It is anticipated that unprecedented structural chemical results will be obtained.  Thus, the project design will provide opportunities for the Crews team to discover, share, and inspire others. The prospects for training are also important and will accelerate the scientific growth of all project participants anticipated to include young scientific professionals, postdoctoral fellows, PhD candidates, and undergraduate students. Also of note is that the PI is one of the few at UCSC from an underrepresented group. He continues to work diligently to insure that UCSC persists in a strong tradition of leadership to promote the advancement of minorities and women in the fields of bioorganic chemistry and chemical biology.</AbstractNarration>

Santa Cruz, NSF CHE 1214065,  "New Chemical Diversity from California Coastal Gram-negative bacteria"     Project Outcomes.   &middot; A Gram-negative bacterial strain derived from a California nearshore sediment sample produces the same metabolite previously isolated from 17 Indo-Pacific marine sponges. &middot;The UCSC campaign to explore chemically-prolific Gram-negative bacteria from nearshore environments has yielded 82 distinct strains, a promising source of new chemodiversity. &middot;The combination of molecular networking and variation of media growth conditions is sparking discovery of novel molecules. &middot;Future prospects include the isolation and characterization of a wealth of new molecules catalyzing many biological processes      Impact &amp; Benefits  &middot;This project has revealed new insights into the microbial origin of marine sponge-associated compounds. &middot;Recent results underscore the value of employing mass spectrometry-based molecular networking techniques for the chemical profiling of unstudied new chemically prolific strains. &middot;Community involvement has occurred through the delivery of talks to the public in CA and beyond.  &middot;Many developing young scientists including community college undergraduates, post-baccalaureate researchers, and postdoctoral scholars have participated in this project.      Overview   &middot;Our team is committed to discovery and information dissemination based on novel chemical scaffolds obtained from Oceana.  &middot;Novel molecular structures coupled with understanding of their sources will catalyze new projects in many US labs. &middot;A unique element of this project is the interdisciplinary nature of the research, inherent in marine natural products, which merges innovative microbiology and cutting edge analytical technologies.
