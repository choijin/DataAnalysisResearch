<AbstractNarration>This mathematics research project by Betsy Stovall will study curvature-related problems arising in Euclidean harmonic analysis and their applications to dispersive partial differential equations.  This work will encompass two directions.  One is to prove new, curvature-independent bounds for generalized Radon transforms defined by averages, linear and multilinear, along families of curves in Euclidean space.  Another direction will be to prove new estimates, both linear and bilinear, for the restriction of the Fourier transform to hypersurfaces and apply these and existing estimates to certain dispersive partial differential equations.   The study of curvature-independent bounds for translation-invariant generalized Radon transforms and Fourier restriction operators has been a popular and fruitful line of research during recent years.  Work performed under this proposal will generalize, extend, and sharpen some of these results.  The particular case of averages on curves has been an important model for averages on higher dimensional manifolds, and there is a strong potential that Stovall's work to prove curvature-independent estimates will facilitate future research in these directions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematics research project by Betsy Stovall is in the general area of harmonic analysis, with a focus on the study of so-called generalized Radon transforms and Fourier restriction operators, and their relation with the geometric notion of curvature.  Both types of operators have been a significant focus of research in the harmonic analysis community for many years, and their study is part of a broader program to understand the effects of curvature on some operators that arise quite naturally in engineering and physics.  For example, one of the specific classes of operators whose study is proposed, a family of restricted X-ray transforms, is related to the (unrestricted) X-ray transform, which is a fundamental tool used in medical imaging. In recent years, research into Fourier restriction operators has been particularly active.  This activity is due both to intrinsic interest in these operators and because their study has led to important advances in the understanding of equations arising in fields such as quantum mechanics and optics.  The inquiries proposed by Stovall address both of these motivations.  As part of this project, Stovall will make a dedicated effort to increase the participation of students and junior scientists from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary:  While supported by this grant, the PI advanced our understanding of a number of questions in harmonic analysis where curvature plays a central role.  In addition, she directly mentored or otherwise helped train a number of researchers, graduate and undergraduate, and helped build research connections within her field.    Intellectual Merit:  The field of harmonic analysis grew out of an effort to understand natural phenomena by studying signals that arise as superpositions of waves.  More than 50 years ago, it was discovered that if the directions and frequencies (wave numbers) of a collection of waves are well-distributed on some curved set, such as a sphere, then the superposition can only be large inside of a bounded region, and outside of that region, the signal strength decays.  An important question that remains open is to precisely quantify this rate of decay, based on how well-distributed the wave numbers are on the initial curved set.  The PI studies this problem in cases where, instead of the sphere, one might start from wave numbers lying on sets that are curved in some places and flat in others.  This work has connections with problems in quantum mechanics, geometric optics, and the basic geometry of space.    In medical imaging, one wants to "see" the inside of a body without surgery.  One way to carry that out is by passing many beams of radiation through the body and measuring how much of each beam is transmitted or absorbed; enough data points allow us to construct a 3D image of the inside of the body.  A long standing program in harmonic analysis has been to study processes like this in which the beams might be curved or otherwise change shape as they pass through different regions of the body.  Roughly, this curvature has a smoothing, or blurring effect on the one hand, but, on the other, it allows us to see more of the body with fewer beams.  Prior to the grant, it had been well understood how much blurring takes place under conditions of uniform curvature, and one aspect of the PI's work was to more quantitatively understand the effects of non-uniform curvature.    Broader Impacts:  This award supported the PI's organizational efforts, including a summer REU, a small research-level workshop, a major, week-long international conference held at the University of Wisconsin, and a semester program at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute. During the award period, the PI mentored and trained junior researchers, including direct advising of two Ph.D. students and three undergraduate researchers and organization of several graduate student seminars.  This award also directly supported the research of one Ph.D. student who was able to complete his degree one year earlier than anticipated and begin a postdoctoral position at a research university.
