<AbstractNarration>This CRPA award addresses the issue of multidisciplinary science and the public's awareness of the ideas. The PIs believe that the prevalence of multidisciplinary science is high and growing fast. Thus, the public and particularly the younger generations need to understand these concepts and to begin thinking in those terms. Thus, they will derive hands-on modules for three age groups that are age appropriate. The project team includes 7 NSF funded researchers who do multidiscipline-based research in biology, mathematics and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These modules will be tested at the Boy and Girls Club of Dane County prior to being exhibited at the Madison Children's Museum and the Aldo Leopold Nature Center.  Further, the local PBS TV station (WPT) will air some of the demonstrations giving the project more visibility and impact. Each set of modules designed for the three age groups shall be evaluated separately using age specific goals and objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a collaboration between 7 scientists and engineers, the Boys and Girls Club of Dane County, the Aldo Leopold Nature Center, the Madison Children's Museum, and the Wisconsin Institutes of Discovery of the University of Wisconsin.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This proposal studied how bacteria coordinate their movement in dynamic, high-density communities of cells that are relevant to infections, ecology, agriculture, maritime, and the industrial transport of liquids. We characterized different factors that affect cells on the adaptability --and hence survival--of the community, including the roles of: 1) interactions between flagella on adjacent cells; 2) the structure of flagella assemblies on cells; 3) close physical contact between the bodies of adjacent cells and the impact of cell length and speed; 4) physical constraints and confinement provided by surfaces and physical interfaces; and 5) fluid viscosity and fluid anisotropy (i.e., long-range physical structure in fluids). We studied how cells chemically, physically, and mechanically respond to surfaces and are continuing to work on uncovering the mechanisms by which bacteria sense surfaces and respond by changing their biochemistry and morphology to optimize their adaptability. We uncovered how surfaces reprogram some types of motile bacteria to change cell mechanical properties as they grow very long and become remarkably flexible, which enables them to pack to high density and maximize cell/cell contacts that are important for coordinating cell motility in communities. Interestingly, these cells are faced with an dilemma: their new pliability provides them with the ability to coordinate community behavior, yet they become highly susceptible to cell wall targeting antibiotics such as the beta-lactams, which kills them.
