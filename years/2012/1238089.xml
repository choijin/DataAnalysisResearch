<AbstractNarration>Advanced Manufacturing and Prototyping Integrated to Unlock Potential (AMP-IT-UP) is a partnership between the Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) and the Griffin-Spalding County School System (GSCS) that focuses on grades six through nine. In this project, students in these middle grades explore their creativity in STEM Innovation and Design (STEM-ID) courses, using rapid prototyping equipment located on GSCS campuses. Students become inspired and drawn into the study of STEM as they watch their creations become reality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematics, engineering and science modules developed in this partnership promote inquiry and situated learning which contextualizes STEM topics to demonstrate their relevancy to AMP-IT-UP students. Through extracurricular local and national clubs and competitions, student experiences are broadened and deepened. The clubs include Junior Makers and Innovation clubs that are mentored by GT faculty and students. This mentorship provides role models for the students and provides the personal touch that is so critical for student retention and self efficacy. The competitions include robotic competitions such as FIRST LEGO League and FIRST Robotics. Approximately 2,400 students each year participate in the exploratory STEM course modules with a total of approximately 1,200 participating in the extracurricular activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMP-IT-UP is conducting research into various aspects of the impact of the STEM-ID courses on the students and their teachers. Some of the effects being measured include exploring how participation affects academic engagement, content understanding, knowledge transfer and student persistence in STEM. Another related research topic involves the implementation of the professional development of the teachers who are using the STEM-ID materials as well as the fidelity of the curriculum deployment. AMP-IT-UP is also developing a theoretical model for understanding changes to the complex system that is education by utilizing resources from an interdisciplinary team that includes experts in both engineering and the social sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both core partners in this Math and Science Partnership illustrate the mutually beneficial nature of their work together. GSCS is being transformed by the middle school teacher development efforts that are enhancing teachers' ability to conduct experiential learning in their classrooms. The GT community is being transformed by a greater interaction with the middle school students and teachers, resulting in an increased emphasis on experiential and active learning environments in the GT undergraduate curriculum as well as an increased commitment to service learning among GT faculty and students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Program Outcomes</span></strong></p> <p>In 2012, the National Science Foundation funded the <em>Advanced Manufacturing and Prototyping Integrated to Unlock Potential</em> (AMP-IT-UP) project through its Math/Science Partnership and Advanced Technical Education programs to develop a program to increase student interest in engineering and more deeply engage students in mathematics and science. AMP-IT-UP educators and researchers at Georgia Tech proposed to collaborate with the Griffin-Spalding County Schools (GSCS), a low-income and high needs school system 50 miles outside of Atlanta, to develop, implement, and assess manufacturing-focused curriculum materials that support engaging and rigorous engineering, mathematics and science instruction, and to implement STEM-focused enrichment activities for both students and teachers. The central outcomes of the project are 1) a thoroughly piloted and evaluated three-year sequence of middle school engineering and technology courses, 2) eighteen 1-week modules for core math and science instruction, 3) a digital, online Engineering Design Process Log (EDPL), and 4) a state-wide K-12 InVenture Prize competition that promotes invention and entrepreneurship.</p> <p>The AMP-IT-UP engineering courses, entitled <em>STEM-Innovation and Design</em> (STEM-ID), align with national math and science standards; promote use of the engineering design process and structured documentation using the EDPL; introduce students to advanced manufacturing tools such as computer aided design (CAD) and 3D printing; incorporate engineering concepts such as pneumatics, robotics and aeronautics; increase student awareness of career paths; and address the concerns of technical employers for workers with good problem solving, teamwork, and communication skills. The mathematics and science modules align with best practices put forth in the Next Generation Science Standards and the Standards of Mathematical Practice and promote STEM learning by engaging middle school students in problem-based inquiry lessons that emphasize collecting, visualizing, interpreting, and communicating authentic and compelling data. The annual K-12 InVenture Prize competition, implemented either in classrooms or as an extracurricular program, challenges students at all grade levels to identify real-world problems and design novel solutions through careful analysis, creativity, and use of the scientific method. InVenture is designed to broaden participation in STEM by bringing authentic invention and entrepreneurship experiences to K-12 teachers and students.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p>For five years AMP-IT-UP curriculum developers, researchers, and educators designed the courses and modules, piloted them in four highly challenging middle schools, made iterative changes based on formative data, and conducted extensive empirical research regarding their impact on student outcomes. The STEM-ID courses, developed for 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grades, provide students with what is, in effect, a <em>5<sup>th</sup> core subject </em>focused on hands-on engineering that requires students to actively engage with foundational math and science content and practices. Our hypothesis was that these applied engineering experiences, implemented in a low-risk, non-high-stakes-tested connections-class environment, would lead to increased engagement and self-efficacy and would positively impact academic achievement in science and math and persistence in STEM. The published AMP-IT-UP research has demonstrated unequivocally that this is correct, as participation in STEM-ID significantly benefitted both students' math and science academic achievement and their engagement in STEM. Research also demonstrated that across grade levels and schools, students were able to transfer knowledge between their engineering course and their core mathematics and science courses.</p> <p>The mathematics and science modules were designed to provide teachers with highly scaffolded instructional materials that would be educative and promote changes in teacher practice in the classroom. The modules demonstrate how project-based learning and the implementation of integrative practices related to data collection, visualization and analysis can effectively enable students to master core math and science disciplinary concepts and practices while promoting high levels of student engagement. Research results have shown that the modules have been effective in supporting teachers' adoption of practices related to project-base and inquiry learning, and evidence suggests that the teachers are incorporating these pedagogical strategies into their other lesson plans.</p> <p><strong>Broadening Participation: </strong></p> <p>AMP-IT-UP products were designed to increase student engagement in math, science and engineering, particularly for students in the low and middle quartiles of achievement who often struggle to find relevance in these fields and who are underrepresented in STEM. The curriculum materials were designed and tested with this population, and research has demonstrated significant positive student and teacher outcomes. After initial work with four schools in one school district, AMP-IT-UP materials have now been adopted by several of the largest school systems in Georgia, by a district in Louisiana, and increasingly by schools across the country.
