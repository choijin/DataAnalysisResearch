<AbstractNarration>The Noyce STEM Teacher Education in the Arkansas Delta (N-STEAD) project is a Phase I effort to recruit and prepare a minimum of nineteen science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors to teach in high-needs secondary schools (grades 7-12) in the Arkansas Delta region. An internship component focuses on providing first- and second-year STEM majors the opportunity to teach within an informal STEM context. Students gain an early experience in science education through planning lessons, presenting science to children, and assessing the outcomes through participation in a science outreach program known locally as "Ridin' Dirty with Science," a cooperative venture between Hendrix College and the Boys and Girls Club of Faulkner County. For juniors and seniors a scholarship component supports STEM majors who are pursuing the completion of licensure requirements for secondary life/earth science, physical/earth science, or mathematics certification. Scholarship recipients participate in an education apprenticeship in a high-needs area, complete eight of their twelve-week student teaching experience in a cooperating Delta region school district, and then teach two years in a high-needs school in the region. A two-year induction program is also a part of their initial teaching experience upon graduation and provides on-site assessments and offers tailored assistance in content, pedagogy, and Delta culture from Hendrix College STEM and Education faculty, and Delta-based master teachers. Membership in either NSTA or NCTM is also provided for these novice teachers to support their enculturation into the profession.</AbstractNarration>

recruit, prepare and sustain highly qualified science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers to work in the Arkansas Delta.&nbsp; The Arkansas Delta consists of 41 counties, whole or in part, located in the Lower Mississippi Delta Region.&nbsp; Most of these counties are rural and have the highest poverty rates in the state.&nbsp; A total of three scholars, 12 interns, and 64 volunteers participated in the program during its five years.</p> <p>Hendrix N-STEAD made an impact on the base knowledge, research, and methods in the field of science education in several ways.&nbsp; Hendrix&rsquo;s Teacher Education Program had a history of developing outstanding teachers, but has now developed a better understanding of how to convert Hendrix&rsquo;s large pool of outstanding STEM majors into STEM majors licensing to teach.&nbsp; For example, this program has led us to revamp our traditional licensure program into one focused on social justice.&nbsp; This minor will allow students to license in non-traditional rather than traditional paths, a process we gained more clarity about through our post-bac scholars program.&nbsp; This non-traditional licensure path will also prepare students to better serve high needs populations.&nbsp; Additionally, N-STEAD enhanced Hendrix&rsquo;s STEM teacher education program by providing a continuum of professional development for prospective teachers and by developing STEM instructional leaders prepared to work with underserved students.&nbsp; This model led us to support not only our STEM teachers but <em>all </em>students who licensed during their novice years of teaching through our classroom visits and seminars.&nbsp; We also developed methods that contribute to the knowledge base of effective methods for the acculturation of students into areas like the Arkansas Delta, such as the cultural seminars that allowed scholars to examine poverty as it relates to educational settings.</p> <p>Hendrix N-STEAD also provided exposure to science and technology to elementary and middle school students in the Delta and from high needs areas of Central Arkansas through our internship and apprenticeship program that consisted of a partnership with Hendrix&rsquo;s long standing <em>Ridin&rsquo; Dirty with Science </em>program.&nbsp; For each of the four years of N-STEAD, this program invited 50 rising 3<sup>rd</sup> -6<sup>th</sup> graders to the Hendrix laboratories for one of two 2-day sessions to participate in modern chemistry, biology, and physics experiments that were designed by our interns and scholars and supported by 16 additional volunteers/year.&nbsp; These internship and scholar apprenticeship experiences also provided STEM resources and inquiry-based, engaged learning lessons to elementary and middle school students in Delta county schools and community centers.&nbsp; We learned from the interns that an effective internship program had to speak to their love of teaching science not just learning about science teaching. &nbsp;We learned about the importance of giving the interns opportunities to engage with young people, positive role models, and to engage with issues of social justice.</p> <p>Lastly, through our work to disseminate information about our project outcomes, we have found the program to be relevant to other small, private liberal arts institutions with an interest in teacher licensure and to educators who work in high poverty, high need regions like the Arkansas Delta.&nbsp; Whether through the literature review, Reasons for Teaching and the Implications for</p> <p>Recruitment, written by our PI and two of our scholars and published in the <em>ArATE Electronic Journal</em>, or through the six refereed presentations at national and regional conferences about our work presented by the PI and Co-PIs, we have received positive feedback about our program and inquiries regarding the surveys used and our program components.</p> <p>The awarding of funds from NSF and work by the Hendrix N-STEAD program have significantly raised the profile of teaching as a profession, and STEM teaching in particular, at Hendrix College.&nbsp; Teaching is now a consistent part of campus career conversations when previously it was non-existent outside of the Education Department.&nbsp; In our recently revamped statement of purpose, we note that &ldquo;through engagement that links the classroom with the world, and a commitment to diversity, inclusion, justice,&hellip;&rdquo; our students lives will be enhanced. &nbsp;The Hendrix N-STEAD program helped to fulfill this mission by elevating the role our campus has in serving fellow Arkansans, while also connecting students with their vocational passions.</p><br> <p>            Last
