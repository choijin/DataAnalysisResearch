<AbstractNarration>This project investigates how education and training methods from traditional work settings can be applied to paid online crowdsourcing. The focus is on how methods such as scaffolding, examples, critique, and apprenticeship affect worker performance, learning, task perseverance, and satisfaction. The project will produce guidelines for a more sustainable crowdsourcing infrastructure where employers can embed relevant domain knowledge into online tasks, and workers can learn key principles and then train less experienced members. The research focuses on worker-centered training strategies in the domain of visual design, which will yield knowledge about effective design principles and instructional methods for visual design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The project will contribute to increase the availability of online work. It will expand the capabilities and skills of crowd workers, thereby allowing online work to become a more viable part of the American economy.  The project will also lead to novel methods for organizations to achieve complex visual design work. More generally, the project will lead to new knowledge about how to train crowds to perform a complex activity and produce practical guidelines to help requesters write tasks and manage the crowd. Finally, the project will provide interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students in socio-computational system design, HCI concepts, educational theory, and evaluation methodologies. All course materials will be available online for reuse and adaptation. Undergraduate researcher training will focus on supporting underrepresented student groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Information technologies are rapidly transforming the nature of jobs and the nature of work. In particular, digital, remote work opportunities performed by freelance workers who are not permanently employed by a company are growing. Employers may recruit workers just-in-time through software platforms for small, specialized tasks that are all completed online. These "crowdsourcing" approaches to work have some clear benefits. For example, they offer greater flexibility for both sides. However, crowdsourcing also brings significant challenges. We don?t yet know how to take many complex tasks and break them into smaller chunks that can be completed remotely through software interfaces. We also don?t yet know how to effectively train remote crowd workers through software to learn how to perform more complex tasks. These challenges limit both the amount of work that is available, and the reward that workers can earn, as more complex work is more valuable. We investigated how to adapt training strategies from offline education and work and apply them to online settings. We explored how techniques such as scaffolding, examples, critique, peer learning and apprenticeship can affect work practices in crowdsourcing. We also investigated how to create effective algorithms and interfaces that make new types of complex work possible for crowdsourcing. We focused on the domain of visual design tasks, such as poster design, Web design, collaborative ideation, and video editing, because of the complex nature of design knowledge and training; and because a lot of work of this type could be available. The main intellectual contribution of this grant are strategies, algorithms and user interface principles that crowdsourcing organizations can apply when they build online work systems for complex, creative tasks. We validated these principles by constructing prototype systems and testing them through controlled studies with users.
