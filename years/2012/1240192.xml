<AbstractNarration>This award supports the scientific workforce development activities of the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) in complex adaptive systems. These activities include workshops and working groups, the visiting scientist program and the Complex Systems Summer School.  SFI is a private, non-profit independent research and education institution that occupies a unique place in the academic landscape. It is dedicated to long-term, creative, trans-disciplinary research across the physical, computational, biological and social sciences, focusing on complex adaptive systems.   This support will expand the inclusion of the broader scientific community in the activities at SFI, maintain the robustness of the workforce development activities, and allow for discovering and communicating to a broad audience the common fundamental principles in complex physical, computational, biological, and social systems.  The award will permit SFI to explore new research areas through workshops and working groups, to expand the breadth of its international scientific community, and to provide support for its educational activities.</AbstractNarration>

Activities supported under the grant included workshops and working groups (8), the visiting scientist program (46) and the Complex Systems Summer School (CSSS) curriculum development. Through these activities we extended our engagement with the broader scientific community and with trans-disciplinary networks of individuals. Workshops and working groups led to new areas of collaboration.   Our research areas are complex systems-based rather than discipline-based therefore this project provided continuing opportunities for many disciplines to be impacted by our activities.  SFI is dedicated to long-term, creative, trans-disciplinary research across the physical, computational, biological and social sciences, focusing on CAS. Workshop and working groups participants, visiting scholars and attendees to the CSSS are all exposed to this trans-disciplinary environment, to methods, tools and theories of various disciplines, and to quantitative thinking, mathematical modeling and empirical data analyses which are then taken back to their home institutions.  SFI recognizes that many of the most challenging and profound questions facing science and society today lie at the boundaries between traditional disciplines. Therefore opportunities for emerging and advanced scholars to participate in collaborations that bridge disciplines is critical to advancing knowledge.  Our activities covered a broad range of interests including:  origins of life; innovation, growth, and evolution of complex adaptive systems, whether organisms, ecosystems, or societies; network dynamics; the inter-relationship between information processing, energy, and dynamics in biology and society; growth, sustainability and the fate of organizations and cities; origins of cooperation; and dynamics of financial markets. SFI plays a unique role in identifying emerging syntheses that can be fragmented and overlooked within the conventional disciplines.  Through this grant SFI?s education and outreach program, covering high schools, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers at all stages of their careers, has been enriched through research ideas emerging from the topics discussed in workshops, working groups and visitor research collaborations. The CSSS was the beneficiary of new curriculum infused with our most recent results.
