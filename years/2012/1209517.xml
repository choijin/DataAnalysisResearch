<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fabrication of a micro tissue structure using a digital mirroring device  For a period of 8 weeks, research was on developing a microscopic chip that will allow researchers to grow cells and test drug interaction with the cells within the cells.  The initial phase of this research project studies the surface properties of chip.  Three surface treatments which are known to enhance the surface conditions to allow for cell growth were investigated.  These surface treatments were a plasma treatment, gelatin treatment, and sulfuric acid treatment.  The findings suggest that the plasma treated surface were the better of the three.  The second phase of the research project developed a three-dimensional chip for the cells to grow on.  Three-dimensional structures mimic the bodyÃ†s architecture better than a two-dimensional feature.  Plasma treatment was used in this phase as the surface enhancer.  The results of this study showed that there were significantly more cells in the three-dimensional chip, in comparison to the two-dimensional chip.  A digital mirror is used to create the chip.  The digital mirror is similar to projectors used in classroom and with projection based television.  This digital mirror (projector) is specially designed to operate with ultraviolet light.  The ultraviolet light changes the chemical composition of the material used to make the chip.  This gives us the opportunity to make micro-structures.  A Cell printer is used to place the cells within the micro-structures.  The cell printer is used for its accuracy and precision.  The Intellectual Merit of the proposed research integrates fundamental photolithography, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems, bio-chemical sciences, engineering sciences, and enabling nano-micro freeform fabrication technologies with applications in life sciences, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine.  The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Additionally, the proposed research will incorporate microfabrication and Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) technologies to develop a micro tissue array with precise spatial control of the biologics within the micro-channels.  The integration of these two technologies will be of great benefit to emerging tissue engineering and biotechnological applications.
