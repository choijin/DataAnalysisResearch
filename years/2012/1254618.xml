<AbstractNarration>The design of adaptive algorithms with provable optimal error decay rates on elliptic problems are well understood, encouraging results are available for parabolic equations while few results are derived in hyperbolic regimes.  Although coupled problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, their adaptive treatment is in its infancy. In fact, ad hoc adaptivity without rigorous justification is very popular but its efficiency suffers from solid mathematical grounding. Yet, the increasingly amount of resources involved in coupled systems makes adaptive algorithms even more essential. The aim of the proposed research is to design, analyze and implement adaptive algorithms tailored to coupled problems. The following objectives are put forward: (i) develop a systematic framework for the design of explicit adaptive algorithms iterating between the resolution of each quantity of interest; (ii) study a new concept of approximation able to describe the nonlinear interactions between each component of the coupled systems; (iii) derive optimal convergence decay rates in the context of elliptic problems, saddle point systems, and time dependent problems; (iv) challenge the new algorithms in the context of living cell motility where numerical methods must confront the complexity of the numerous phenomena involved and their interactions with the cell geometry.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Modern algorithms are able to optimize and balance the computational effort to capture small details without over-resolving the quantity of interest. However, when several processes interacting with each other need to be approximated, the established theory fails to apply due to two major obstructions: (i) the algorithm is required to make decisions without complete knowledge of all interacting quantities; (ii) the abilities to approximate each component of the system are tangled together in a highly nonlinear fashion. We propose to initiate a systematic study of couple problems with special emphasis to physical models related to living cell motility.  The difficulty of modeling cell locomotion is to overcome the inherent great computational expense when considering multi-scale, multi-dimensional and multi-component phenomena. Efficient and flexible algorithms are thus critical in this context. The understanding of cell locomotion has impact on several areas of bio-physics such as in embryonic development,  tissue regeneration, immune response and wound healing in multi-cellular organisms. In addition, the proposed study will actually benefit strategic departments such as energy (oil recovery and carbon dioxide sequestration), environment (groundwater contamination) and  material science (cloaking and filter design).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Motivated by the ubiquitous presence of coupled problems in science and engineering, this research aimed at developing  algorithms for their approximations. The main focus was on adaptive methods able to learn and automatically increase numerical resolution when and where needed.A solid mathematical grounding turns out to be of upmost importance to guarantee their efficiency and eventually pertinence.    At first, a systematic framework has been designed, analyzed and implemented on model problems. Extension to more complex mathematical systems such as saddle point problem appearing for example in fluid dynamics and geometric partial differential equations relevant for human cell modeling were performed. These algorithms were further challenged on physically relevant and complex situations. In fact, the algorithms put forward were able to attenuate the great computational expenses in multi-scale, multi-dimensional or multi-component phenomenon. For instance, it was demonstrated that they are beneficial in the understanding of human cell deformation, complex fluid dynamics, and in the design of micro-actuators.   This research blended different fields of mathematics such as nonlinear approximation, numerical analysis, scientific computation and differential geometry. A particular emphasis was made to confront young researchers to these challenging but interesting and relevant situations. Participation to local research experience for undergraduates, mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, mentoring group studies of young researcher from different backgrounds, design of new classes, and organization of a winter school are examples of successful strategies used to accomplish this goal.
