<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this workshop is to discuss the major accomplishments in the last 15-20 years and the grand challenges that lie ahead in the field of micro/nanotechnology. An emphasis will be on the development of bio-and healthcare systems that will help the rapidly increasing world population and improve quality of life. This objective will be accomplished through presentations by the invited distinguished speakers, as well as, presentations by the NSF junior and mid-career researchers, who were CAREER Grantees in the last 15-20 years. The NSF CAREER Grantees will also present their accomplishments and thoughts via two Poster sessions. Furthermore, a panel session consisting of the distinguished speakers and grantees will be held at the conclusion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The outcome of the workshop will help the participants to develop new system programs and encourage them to submit unsolicited proposals. The outcome will also be very useful to the members of the NSF, in making decisions for future funding for micro/nano-systems in Bio and Health areas. It would also provide useful information for the future EFRI Programs in the Directorate for Engineering, Cyber-Physical Systems, the STC and the ERC programs in the NSF. It is hoped that the outcome of this workshop will bridge the gap between the areas of research in nanotechnology and biology. It is expected that this workshop will lay the foundations for the emerging areas of nano-medicine including targeted drug delivery and implantable devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The plenary speakers? presentations, the Grantees presentation, their poster sessions and the outcome of the panel discussions will be videotaped and documented. The outcome and the discussions at the workshop will be widely disseminated through the web. It is anticipated that the workshop will have a long term impact on a broader group of researchers and educators in the physical science, biology, and health sciences. It will also be useful to those who consider entering into the new interdisciplinary areas of research in micro/nanosystems for health and nanomedicine. This will also encourage the development of new interdisciplinary courses and curriculum for undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
