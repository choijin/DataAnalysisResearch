<AbstractNarration>This action funds Jaylene Ollivierre of Northeastern University to conduct a research project, entitled "Understanding how protein-protein interactions in bacteria regulate cell survival" during the summer of 2012 at the University of Wollongong in Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia.  The host scientist is Nick Dixon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to understand the basic mechanisms of the DNA damage response in bacteria, not only for increasing basic knowledge of the biology of bacteria but also for possible use in developing new strategies for dealing with bacterial infections.  Mechanisms under study include DNA replication and repair and the coordination of the SOS response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of EAPSI project is to understand how organisms repair DNA lesions that are caused by exposure to a variety of damaging agents including ultraviolet radiation and toxic chemicals. These lesions on DNA cause the replicative machinery to stall, halting DNA synthesis. DNA replication is an essential biological process that must continue to ensure cell survival. Therefore, the cell has evolved specialized Translesion Synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases that can bypass the damage and rescue the replication fork. Understanding how lesions are bypassed involves studying the interactions between proteins involved in both DNA replication and TLS. Unlike the replicative polymerase, TLS polymerases are more open and flexible allowing bypass of bulky damage sites. However, this feature allows for errors to occur during DNA synthesis and can potentially lead to many diseases including cancer. We used a sensitive technique called electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to look at the formation and disruption of protein complexes. This can lead to insights into how the hand-off occurs at the lesion site and how damage is bypassed. Specifically we looked at interactions between replication complex proteins &alpha;, &beta;, &epsilon; and the TLS manager protein UmuD. We found that UmuD competes with &epsilon; for binding to &beta; which can potentially lead to the disruption of parts of DNA replication complex at the damage site. This may allow TLS polymerase entry to the replication fork and subsequently lesion bypass and cell survival.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/01/2012<br>      Modified by: Jaylene&nbsp;Ollivierre</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
