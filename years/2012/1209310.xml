<AbstractNarration>This action funds Sahid L. Rosado Lausell of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to conduct a research project, entitled "Role of sunlight on virus survival in tropical waters," during the summer of 2012 at National University of Singapore in Singapore.  The host scientist is Dr. Karina Gin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to determine the presence of human pathogenic viruses and their survivability in water environments. Results permit microbial risk assessments in surface waters to be made and contamination prevention strategies to be addressed, to prevent contamination of surface waters by and thereby reduce infections. More importantly, if this research and its techniques are adopted on a global scale, better water quality could be guaranteed to world populations, thus reducing waterborne diseases worldwide.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

In places where untreated wastewaters contaminate drinking water sources due to inadequate infrastructure, incidences of waterborne diseases are high as a result of viral activity in the water.

While settling has been shown to have little effect on virus removal, the disinfection of viruses in surface waters through solar disinfection has been suggested as a way to alleviate the problem.              Sunlight inactivation of microorganisms could be explained in three mechanisms: 1) direct inactivation, 2) indirect endogenous inactivation and 3) indirect exogenous inactivation mechanism. The latter involves light absorption by exogenous sensitizers, typically natural organic matter (NOM), who then transfer the absorbed energy to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for damaging internal targets of the microorganism. There are many different types of ROS that can be produced upon NOM excitation, including singlet oxygen (1O2), hydroxyl radical (&middot;OH) and triplet excited state of dissolved organic matter (3DOM*). This work specifically focused on studying the indirect exogenous inactivation of the bacteriophage MS2 in different Singaporean surface waters using solar irradiation, with the goal of determining the effect of the exogenous sensitizers present in the natural waters on virus inactivation. Also, the study sought to determine which type of ROS is the most responsible for such inactivation.              MS2 inactivation experiments were performed using three different types of Singaporean surface waters: 1) Singapore River, 2) Stamford Canal and 3) Marina Bay Reservoir.

This was done by using different probe compounds that react specifically with the ROS of interest and by quantifying their decay due to solar irradiation. With this, we were able to conclude that both 1O2 and 3DOM* are the ROS responsible for virus inactivation in Singaporean surface waters. Additionally, we measured the specific UV absorbance determined at 254 nm wavelengths (SUVA254) for all the water samples and correlated these values with their corresponding MS2 inactivation rate constants. SUVA254 is determined by dividing the measured UV absorbance at 254 nm wavelength of the sample by its total organic carbon concentration, and has long been used as a surrogate measurement for aromatic carbon content. Our results showed that 1O2 is the ROS responsible for inactivating MS2 in samples with high aromatic carbon contents, whereas 3DOM* is the ROS responsible for enhancing MS2 inactivation in samples with low aromatic carbon contents.               This work will help understand the mechanism of MS2 inactivation and the ROS that enhance such inactivation. Moreover, this may allow the identification of the DOM moieties that are responsible for the production of these ROS and the resulting virus inactivation.
