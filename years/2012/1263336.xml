<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation supports an International Research Experiences for Undergraduates (iREU) Site led by Professors Randolph S. Duran and David A. Spivak both at Louisiana State University and Gloria A. Thomas at Xavier University in New Orleans, LA. The Site will have projects located in Grenoble France or Leuven Belgium. Each summer, 8 participants will have REU projects that feature aspects of translational chemistry and the Sites will incorporate major European "Innovation Campuses" where national laboratory, industry, and university scientists work as teams. This will provide students the opportunity to experience a network of research not typically available to students at most American colleges and universities. Students with previous experience and a strong desire to continue in STEM areas will be recruited nationwide. To ensure a diverse group of students, the Site will interact with the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (LSAMP) Program for the recruitment of students from underrepresented groups. The PI has experience in developing and directing iREU programs and the other members of the leadership team have been PIs of domestic REU Sites. Outstanding facilities and research support at the proposed locations ensure sufficient resources for participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The iREU site will expose students to the international community of science, allowing them to experience first-hand the collaborative nature of research between universities, national laboratories, and companies. Students will be immersed in a foreign culture, broadening their understanding of what it means to be an active participant in an international effort. By incorporating LSAMP and Xavier University, and by hosting its pre-departure meetings at a minority serving institution, the program will increase participation by underrepresented groups. Results will be disseminated through a proposed poster session abroad each summer, as well as publications and presentations at national and local conferences. Activities will be integrated with a new LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate Program and several other NSF programs at these sites. Mentoring from a network of research mentors, iREU alumni, faculty at home institutions and current graduate students will be encouraged. Eventually, development of an exchange with French and Belgian undergraduate students working in US labs will extend the impact beyond this site, encouraging collaboration between European and US institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       REU Site: The US/France/Belgium iREU Site in Translational Chemistry     Experiences of a lifetime were created for  25 undergraduate students recruited from across the US providing research opportunities ranging from 3 months to 18 months in outstanding French and Belgian research laboratories.  Via a supplement, the program also collaborated with several other researchers in the NSF LSAMP program, national laboratories such as LIGO, and various academic and chemistry research communities to host a workshop that identified best practices for international research collaboration and workforce development.      The first image below shows the class of 2014 at the US National Academy of Sciences Einstein sculpture during their spring pre-departure meeting.  Each year, students with exemplary prior research experience and other leadership attributes such as independence, communication skills, and follow-through that made them ready for one of these challenging international research experiences, were nominated by a US mentor.   Nominations were all based on the US Mentor having direct knowledge of their student?s research skills and experience.   The nomination process also included individualized interviews between students a specific French or Belgian mentor to optimize the learning potential and collaboration results for each participant.     Each of the European host locations: the Institute Pasteur de Lille, France; University of Grenoble-Alpes, France; IMEC (Leuven) Belgium, and University of Toulouse, France; has a world-class university and significant commercial research incubators that present an important industrial translational component to the student?s chemistry research.  For instance, the second image shows participant Erica McClain of Xavier University of Louisiana in front of a prototype human exoskeleton designed to assist aging and injured people get around.     Each participant?s project had high quality science associated with it.  For instance the third photo below shows South West Oklahoma State student Ashlie Walker presenting her research on inorganic chemistry in Grenoble, France to Dr Minh Ha Pham, the Science Consul of the French Embassy.  Ashlie is also a member of the Cherokee Nation and she later presented to a group of US professors brought to France by the Fulbright Foundation.  The fourth photo shows LSU undergraduate Corey Landry who conducted optics research in Grenoble and subsequently won a prestigious NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program award to continue his doctoral studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  Many of the 25 total participants published their research in professional journals or presented their findings at national meetings. The REU participants also had meaningful cultural experiences to complement their research; for instance the fifth photo shows Xavier student Lydia Mensah at the United Nations; Lydia is now a graduate student at the University of Michigan. Cultural events are an important part of the experience, and the participants had many opportunities to participate in range of cultural and scientific activities, that have inspired additional students on their campuses.     In France each summer, the REU Site co-organized a "French American Workshop".  The workshop ran for 2 or 3 days mid-program and involved 80-100 other STEM students from all around the world, faculty, and scientists.  Each of these meetings featured a variety of presentations, poster sessions, and panels designed to benefit the participating students and to make connections between the US community represented and a broad range of Grenoble scientists.        Finally, a supplement from NSF and collaboration with scholars from NSF?s long-standing Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation allowed for a workshop in which best practices for obtaining publication quality research results from an international experience were discussed, shown in the sixth figure below.  The workshop occurred in April 2016 and brought together a worldwide group of more than eighty experts that included representatives from four countries, seven Native American Nations, and twelve LSAMP programs.   The workshop generated 18 recommended attributes for international research success and best practices on best engaging US faculty mentors with international counterparts. Workshop results are at http://irsymposium.weebly.com/proceedings.html , and have also been presented at national and international meetings.
