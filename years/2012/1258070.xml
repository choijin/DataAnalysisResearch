<AbstractNarration>Ecologists have long been puzzled about why there are so many species of trees in tropical forests; the answer is not obvious. Recent evidence suggests that disease microbes hidden in the soil may play an important role in determining how many species can grow in a given area. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis are lacking, though. This project employs a combination of experiments, plant pathology, and cutting-edge genetic approaches to test whether interactions between trees and disease agents in the soil determine tree species composition in tropical forests of Panama.  The study is unusual in the amount of detailed data collected on distributions, identities, and host specificity of many types of largely unknown pathogens.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changes in species composition of soil pathogens as a result of human-caused disturbances and agricultural practices are well documented. However, the impact of such changes on land restoration is poorly understood. This study will provide critical insights to scientists as they search for more effective conservation and reforestation techniques.  Because this project is highly collaborative, it will also provide broad training to U.S. and Latin American students in the ecology of plants and microbes.  Finally, the lead scientists will work with the Missouri Botanical Garden to publically demonstrate the importance of soil microbes to the health and sustainability of both natural and agricultural plant communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tropical forests contain the majority of the earth?s species and store nearly half of the planet?s terrestrial carbon. How thousands of species of plants can coexist in tropical forests is one of the long-standing and central questions in ecology. Answering this question can help scientists devise plans for the protection and restoration of these critical ecosystems. Furthermore, the fundamental science that we learn from addressing this question can transfer directly to sustainable agricultural practices as well as devising successful conservation and restoration strategies for many ecosystems.  Ecological theory suggested many processes, such as herbivory, competition, drought, disturbance, and seed dispersal, were the key processes that maintain high plant diversity.  More recent evidence, however, including evidence from our previous work (Mangan et al. 2010, Nature; Schnitzer et al. 2011 Ecology) indicates that interactions between plants and their specialized belowground enemies (e.g. root-associated fungal pathogens) may be important determinants for tree species coexistence, and may also explain why some species are common, while others are rare.  The main goal of this NSF-funded project was to identify the soil-borne fungi that possess sufficient species-specificity required for the maintenance of tropical forest diversity, as well as to test whether these same fungi play a role in regulating tree species relative abundance. To accomplish this goal, we conducted a series of field experiments where we planted tree seedlings under their own conspecific (same species) adults, and adults of other tree species.  Seedlings were then removed after 3 months in forest, and fungal strains associated with roots were cultured to determine their identities, level of host associations, and pathogen function.  We found that seedlings of different species, despite being grown in close proximity to each other, are infected by distinct groups of fungi, suggesting a large degree of host specificity.
