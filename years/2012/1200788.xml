<AbstractNarration>The research goal of this award is to enable a more effective multi-scale and multivariate modeling process for the design of components comprised of cellular, mesostructured materials by advancing our understanding of how uncertainties at different scales affect product realization. This research will explore fundamental theories and computational tools to cascade uncertainties among meso- and macro-scales, manufacturing processes, and operating environments. Specifically, the new method will resolve the imperative issue of the need of accurate stochastic modeling across multiple length scales while ensuring the link between stochastic models and physical realities. Deliverables include, 1) the implementation of reliability-based synthesis methods to realize robust systems by incorporating the effects of stochastic dependencies in material, manufacturing, and various scales, 2) the experimental characterization and model building of the cellular structures via additive manufacturing technologies, and 3) the demonstration of the integrated design synthesis method on aerospace components comprised of risk mitigated mesostructured materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the research will have a broad impact on the mechanical and materials engineering community, as well as other research, education, and industrial programs by developing new computational models and tools that can be used to design robust meso-structured materials for aerospace or automobile components. A significant benefit to society is expected by providing examples of parts that utilize material much more efficiently than currently possible, leading to improved fuel economy for cars and planes, among other benefits. The research experience for the graduate and undergraduate programs will foster creative and statistical thinking among an interdisciplinary group of faculty and students. Incorporating reliability-based design and hands-on experience into the existing mechanical engineering courses will help better education and train a new generation of engineers who are better prepared to address the challenges in the future.</AbstractNarration>

This work is an instance of a larger research program that seeks synergies in the confluence of reliability engineering, materials engineering, and additive manufacturing technology. The research tasks include 1) the implementation of reliability-based synthesis methods to realize robust systems by incorporating the effects of stochastic dependencies in material, manufacturing, and various scales, 2) the experimental characterization and model building of cellular structures via additive manufacturing technologies, and 3) the demonstration of an integrated design synthesis method on aerospace components comprised of risk mitigated meso-structured materials. During this project, an integrated, multi-disciplinary, and multi-scale research and education program has been achieved by exploring reliability-based synthesis methods for the development of new engineering. These components are comprised of multi-scale systems and cellular material structures that include the inherent uncertainty associated with geometry, loads, and material properties. During the project period, a new classification approach, probabilistic neural network, was developed for its contribution towards reliability estimations in multi-scale systems.  In addition, mechanical properties of the additively manufactured parts were collected, and the corresponding literature was surveyed in Phase 1.  In Phase 2, a multiscale modeling method and a design method, the relative density mapping method, were developed for cellular structures.  Additional experimentations were conducted on additively manufactured parts, and a two-step homogenization method was developed.  In Phase 3, a design example of an unmanned aerial vehicle was designed with cellular structures using the developed relative density mapping method.  In addition, a novel way of validating the simulation model, with the consideration of uncertainty such that the simulation models? accuracy used in the developed framework can be systematically validated, has been identified.  Therefore, a framework for estimating the reliability of a complexly engineered system has been successfully developed by utilizing a stochastic upscaling process with a probabilistic neural network.  Actual physical testing results have been utilized to identify appropriate models of representing uncertainty, and the corresponding information has been integrated into the framework.  The results of the proposed research have made a broad impact on the mechanical and materials engineering community, as well as other research, education, and industrial programs through the development of new computational models and tools that can be used to design robust meso-structured materials for aerospace or automobile components.  In addition, incorporating reliability-based design and "hands-on" experience into the existing mechanical engineering courses at Georgia Tech enhances the student?s received education and trains a new generation of engineers who are better prepared to address the complex challenges of the future.  Therefore, the research experience for the graduate and undergraduate programs foster creative and statistical thinking among an interdisciplinary group of faculty and students.
