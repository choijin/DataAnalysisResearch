<AbstractNarration>A large array of ground based instruments has been installed on the Svalbard archipelago in Norway.  Svalbard is frequently on polar cusp field lines that map to the outer boundary of the Earth's magnetosphere where it interacts with the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). This proposal has two parts: One part is for support for the continued operation of and processing data from an array of four search coil magnetometers (induction antennas). The second part is to carry out analysis of data from these four instruments. Svalbard is the only place in the northern hemisphere where polar cusp field lines can be observed for extended periods in darkness at noon. In addition to the four search coil magnetometers auroral imagers and photometers, several radars (EISCAT, SPEAR and SuperDarn) and the northernmost fluxgate magnetometers of the IMAGE chain are located on Svalbard. This makes Svalbard an excellent place to carry out observations of ionospheric phenomena on magnetic field lines that map to the magnetopause. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three main types of studies using the data from the search coils and other instruments are:&lt;br/&gt;a.) Make a concentrated effort to understand the observations of Pc 1-2 waves in the cusp and their effect on radiation belt dynamics. In the Pc 1-2 frequency range electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves (EMIC) are thought to interact resonantly with MeV electrons in the radiation belts. The waves and radiation belt dynamics and the persistence of waves (sometimes seen for days) will be studied as well as waves associated with auroral precipitation. &lt;br/&gt;b.) Probe the Ionosphere Alfvén Resonator (IAR) by using the Space Plasma Exploration by Active Radar (SPEAR) heater facility in conjunction with the EISCAT radar. The IAR is a region in the ionosphere bounded by the F or E region at lower altitudes and by a peak in the Alfvén velocity at higher altitudes. This research will characterize the quality factor (Q) of the IAR. The quality factor relates the energy stored in the resonator with the energy dissipated. If the IAR is driven long enough the energy contained in the resonator will be proportional to Q. By controlling the input energy from the SPEAR heater they will be able to determine Q. &lt;br/&gt;c.) Investigate the properties of PC3-4 waves at very high latitudes. In this study SuperDARN radar will be used along with the search coils to determine the intensity of PC 3-4 as a function of position with respect to the cusp. The goal will be to determine how these ULF waves reach the high latitude ionosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data from the four closely space magnetometers are very valuable for a number of space physics studies. The team will make the data available to the scientific community through the NASA Virtual Observatories. This proposal will support a graduate student at the University of New Hampshire and an undergraduate researcher at Augsburg College.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Grant AGS-1202267, awarded to Augsburg College, together with NSF Grant AGS-1202827 to the University of New Hampshire, continued a collaborative effort to use data from a closely-spaced array of search coil magnetometers, built at the University of New Hampshire, to study the Earth?s high-latitude space environment.  These instruments were deployed on Svalbard, a Norwegian island archipelago in the high Arctic that is also the site of a number of other scientific instruments deployed by the international space science community.  Search coil magnetometers are of particular use in detecting ultra-low-frequency (ULF) plasma waves.  The combination of data from these multiple instruments and from research satellites has provided an improved understanding of several categories of waves that originate in the magnetosphere, the region of near-Earth space bounded by Earth?s magnetic field, or in the bow shock, the region where the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) first interact with the magnetosphere.   These detailed studies help the worldwide space science community to better understand "space weather," the natural variability in Earth?s space environment driven by activity on the sun, and to be able to better predict and prepare for the magnetic storms that can disrupt or even seriously damage many components of our world?s high-tech electrical infrastructure and electronic communications.  During the period of this grant members of the Augsburg team were first authors of three published refereed papers; a fourth was recently submitted to a scientific journal.   --Posch et al. [2013] provided additional information on the spatial characteristics of the long-period ULF signals that are generated by transient instabilities near the bow shock and of the bursts of higher frequency (~1 Hz) waves often associated with them.  --Bier et al. [2014], in a study of the IMF control of mid-period (Pc3-4) ULF waves, which are generated just upstream of the bow shock, documented for the first time some of the limitations of the existing spacecraft that monitor the solar wind and IMF from their positions at the upstream L1 Lagrangian point.  The use of data from spacecraft much closer to Earth?s magnetosphere is much to be preferred, when available.   --Posch et al.

This grant has also provided research training to five undergraduate physics majors at Augsburg College.  The two students who have now graduated are enrolled in Ph.
