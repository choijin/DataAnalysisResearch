<AbstractNarration>Environmental Change in the Himalayas impacts societies in the most densely populated area on Earth. Rapid glacier retreat in the monsoonal Himalayas affects river discharge, energy production, and agriculture. A serious threat is posed by outburst floods from glacial lakes in the Himalayan country of Bhutan. Bhutan's welfare is directly linked to glacier dynamics because the country's primary source of income, exported hydropower, as well as the national agricultural irrigation infrastructure, are fueled by glacier melt. Melting glaciers and the steep relief have made outburst floods a prime hazard for Bhutan and their Himalayan neighbors, and the hazard potential depends on current and future glacier melt. Determining the rate of glacier retreat in response to climate change is fundamental for predicting future flood probabilities and for designing adaption and mitigation strategies for Bhutanese society. Currently the rate of glacier retreat is very poorly constrained. This EAGER proposal seeks funds to take the first step towards providing robust information about past, present and future glacier and climate change in Bhutan, and in turn contribute to a more robust scientific data for decision makers and mitigation strategists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The identified target area for this EAGER project is Rhapstreng Glacier, in the Lunana area of Bhutan. Over the last decade the PIs have established connections to the scientific and political leadership in Bhutan, in particular with the Department of Energy/Ministry of Economical Affairs and the Ugyen Wangchuck Institute for Conservation and Environment (UWICE), and have also identified excellent climate and environmental records: (i) Outstanding past glacier records, consisting of well-preserved moraine sequences; (ii) Conifer tree species which will allow the PIs to reconstruct climate, especially summer temperature, back through the Little Ice Age and into late-Medieval times; (iii) Bhutanese glaciers that are, according to preliminary mass balance modeling in the Himalaya, particularly sensitive to changes in temperature as compared to precipitation, making them excellent targets for more refined glaciological modeling, and making the tree-ring reconstructions particularly useful to the glacier reconstructions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant supports a concerted field campaign, including geomorphology, geochronology, paleothermometry, and glaciology in order to lay the foundation for reconstructing glacier histories and climate change over the last millennia, and to better predict Himalayan glacier change over the next centuries. The PIs have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts with broad experience in Himalayan glacier and climate problems, including a female junior faculty at a primarily undergraduate university. This EAGER proposal is the first step towards a bilateral educational program, including bilateral student exchange between CU and UWICE and integration of Bhutanese students in annual field campaigns.</AbstractNarration>

Bhutan, in the eastern Himalaya, may be directly impacted by glacier changes because hydropower generation, the primary source of income, and agricultural irrigation, is fueled by glacier melt (Figure: Glacierized Area of Bhutan). In addition, thinning and retreating glaciers and the steep relief have made glacial-lake outburst floods a prime hazard for the societies of Bhutan and their Himalayan neighbors, and the hazard potential in space and time critically depends on current and future glacier melt (Figure: Bhutanese Glaciers and Glacial Lakes). Therefore, it is critical to quantify glacier changes, and impacts of those changes, on water resources. The proposed work focused on quantifying glacier changes over the past thirty years, and projecting changes in the coming decades. The outcomes include three major components: (1) the first quantification of glacier area and volume changes in Bhutan covering the past thirty years, (2) modeling of meltwater contributions to water resources and projected changes in these resources under varying climatic scenarios, and (3) installation of the first glacier and climate monitoring network at a benchmark glacier in the Bhutanese Himalaya. The results of this work show that glacier mass balance has decreased by an average of 10 m over the past 30 years, with some glaciers having lost as much as 30 m over. There is no evidence for net mass gain, or growth, of any of the 600+ glaciers across the region (Figure: 3D Image of a Bhutan Valley). In addition, we show that present-day glacierized area is significantly out of steady-state with mean climate, and that the minimum decrease in glacierized area, even in the absence of additional warming, is ~10%. This change in area gives rise to a decrease in meltwater resources of 25% (Figure: Glacier Area and Meltwater Decrease). Thus, recent glacier changes have been significant, but climate changes have significantly outpaced the glacier changes. Therefore, significant changes in glacier area and water resources are expected to continue in the future. In order to better constrain both the remote sensing data and glacier models, we installed a network of ablation stakes, temperature sensors, and fully-automated weather station at 5,000 m asl in Bhutan. In the near future, we will use these data to more fully quantify the mass balance of target glaciers within Bhutan, and continue monitoring the health of these glacier systems.</p> <p>Two graduate students and three undergraduates participated in all aspects of the research described above.
