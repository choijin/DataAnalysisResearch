<AbstractNarration>This NSF Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Frontiers project "Foundations Of Resilient CybEr-physical Systems (FORCES)" focuses on the resilient design of large-scale networked CPS systems that directly interface with humans.  FORCES aims to pr ovide comprehensive tools that allow the CPS designers and operators to combine resilient control (RC) algorithms with economic incentive (EI) schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Contributions&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing RC tools to withstand a wide-range of attacks and faults; learning and control algorithms which integrate human actions with spatio-temporal and hybrid dynamics of networked CPS systems; and model-based design to assure semantically consistent representations across all branches of the project. Operations of networked CPS systems naturally depend on the systemic social institutions and the individual deployment choices of the humans who use and operate them. The presence of incomplete and asymmetric information among these actors leads to a gap between the individually and socially optimal equilibrium resiliency levels. The project is developing EI schemes to reduce this gap. The core contributions of the FORCES team, which includes experts in control systems, game theory, and mechanism design, are the foundations for the co-design of RC and EI schemes and technological tools for implementing them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Resilient CPS infrastructure is a critical National Asset. FORCES is contributing to the development of new Science of CPS by being the first project that integrates networked control with game theoretic tools and the economic incentives of human decision makers for resilient CPS design and operation. The FORCES integrated co-design philosophy is being validated on two CPS domains: electric power distribution and consumption, and transportation networks. These design prototypes are being tested in real world scenarios. The team's research efforts are being complemented by educational offerings on resilient CPS targeted to a large and diverse audience.</AbstractNarration>

Complex CPS abound in modern society and it is not surprising that many of these systems are safety and mission critical that makes them a target for attacks. Even under normal conditions, CPS face complex issues crosscutting many disciplines with significant implications on essential system functions.

Because of its significance, security and resilience have attracted considerable attention in many CPS application domains. Because of the heterogeneity and complexity, methodologies that improve CPS security are very diverse with different objectives, specifications, and constraints resulting in a broad body of knowledge. Research efforts are starting to use scientific methods and results to shape technology, practice, and policy in protecting systems from attackers, detecting intrusions, and recovering from compromises. Beyond the complex structure and interactions, security and resilience properties emerge from complex interrelationships, they are not explained by understanding the individual elements of the system, and are highly dynamic in response to changing environment and circumstances.  The objective in this NSF Frontier project is to develop the foundations of secure and resilient CPS. The Vanderbilt team, in particular, focused on the following research areas: (1) Robust monitoring, diagnosis, and networked control, (2) Learning and control for resilience, (3) Threat assessment and diagnostics, and (4) System-security co-design. The developed approaches build upon our strengths on model-based design and system and game theory. The overall objective has been to develop integrated solutions that increase our understanding of complex interrelationships in CPS and allow design of defense strategies that improve security and resilience.  The team accomplished the following key results in the project:  1.  Developed and evaluated a game theoretic framework for attack and anomaly detection in CPS. The novelty of the approach lies on incorporating dynamical models of CPS including invariant constraints such as energy and traffic flow as well as data driven component models. The results have been demonstrated using case studies of water distribution systems, process control systems, and transportation networks.  2.  Developed resilient distributed control and coordination algorithms in the presence of malicious agents.  Innovations in this area include the use of trusted nodes for improving resilience of consensus algorithms multi-agent systems and resilient distributed diffusion for multi-task state estimation that can be used for tracking multiple targets.  3.  Developed learning and control methods to improve resilience in CPS that include methods for sensor selection and placement in adversarial setting in the context of transportation networks and water distribution systems, decentralized resilient traffic light control, stochastic message authentication for integrity assurance of resource constraint systems, and integrative methods that combine redundancy, diversity, and hardening for improving security and resilience.  4.  Develop languages and tools for threat and attack modeling in CPS in order to understand the impact of cyber attacks to system performance and operation. The tools allow the representation of novel attack models and the characterization of the actions of that are needed to compromise the operation of the CPS.  The threat and attack models developed were used for vulnerability analysis of transportation networks and power systems.  5.  Developed a suite of methods for system-security co-design using a model-based framework where the software and system implementation task is to derive the code and models such that they satisfy functional, safety, and security as well as the resource constraint requirements imposed by the underlying platform.  6.  Developed simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testbeds and conducted comprehensive evaluation of both system and security properties. The testbeds include a modeling and simulation integration platform that enables evaluation of resilience of transportation networks in the presence of cyber attacks based on attacker-defender games using simulations of sufficient fidelity and a hardware-in-the-loop which connects physics simulators with networked embedded computers for performing analysis of realistic cyber-attack effects in networked CPS.  7.  Broadening participation: The main activity for broadening participation in computing is the organization of summer camps on CPS and CPS security for high school students. The camps use RoboScape, a team-based, hands-on curriculum for teaching cybersecurity, distributed programming, and robotics. We continue offering the camps in Summer 2019 after the completion of the project. More importantly, we are offering a teacher camp in order to involve middle and high school teachers and scale up our outreach and recruitment of women and underrepresented minorities.
