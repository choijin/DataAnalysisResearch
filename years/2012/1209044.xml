<AbstractNarration>Liouville quantum gravity is a model for producing a random two-dimensional surface.  The model was introduced by Polyakov 30 years ago in the context of string theory and is now a centerpiece of a branch of physics called conformal field theory.   Liouville quantum gravity is a continuum theory, but it has discrete analogs.  Just as there are discrete ways to create random paths (by drawing them on grids) there are also discrete ways to produce random surfaces (by gluing together identical unit squares along their edges).  The PI will study both discrete and continuum random surfaces: their relationship to each other, their relationship to gauge theories and other aspects of theoretical physics, and their relationship to conformal random geometry and random curves such as the Schramm-Loewner evolution.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In particular, the PI aims to show that, in some sense, if one builds a discrete random surface out of a large number of very small squares, it looks very much like the continuum random surfaces studied in Liouville quantum gravity.  Moreover, when additional statistical physical structure (Ising or Potts models) is associated with the discrete models, this structure corresponds to continuum random geometric objects (conformal loop ensemble) on the continuum random surfaces.  The PI will work closely with undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, on these and related problems in probability, analysis, and statistical physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal investigator (Scott Sheffield) explored Liouville quantum gravity and conformal probability, including connections to mathematical physics and other areas of mathematics. Results included about 25 new research papers by the PI and co-authors, in addition to a larger number of papers completed by graduate students who were partially supported by this project.  The most important broader impact has been the impact on the careers of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers at MIT.  In particular, the PI advised graduate students Morris Jie Jun Ang, Ewain Gwynne, Nina Holden, Minjae Park,  Joshua Pfeffer, Xin Sun, and Menglu Wang, and Sam Watson. (Park, Pfeffer and Ang are continuing, while the others have graduated.)  The PI has mentored several strong MIT and Harvard undergraduate students on research projects since 2011, including Jiacheng Feng, Mark Sellke, Yair Chaim Shenfeld, and Kirin Sinha, Stephen Yearwood, Ingrid Zhang, and Alex Zhai. A number of these since have gone on to graduate school, not all of them in mathematics.  The PI has also helped to mentor several strong postdoctoral fellows who are still in academia:  Stephane Benoist, Olivier Bernardi,  Ivan Corwin, Lionel Levine, Jason Miller, Charles Smart, Nike Sun, Omer Tamuz, and Hao Wu. Five graduate students spent some or all of the semester at the Newton Institute special semester (co-organized by the PI) during the spring of 2015, and the NSF grant helped to make that possible, which in turn led to a number of new papers and projects.  Overall, the PI has co-authored dozens of joint papers with MIT postdoctoral fellows and students.  The PI has given a number of graduate topics courses at MIT on the topics covered in this proposal, and has given lecture series, including courses taught jointly with Jason Miller at Oberwolfach and at the St. Flour Summer School in Probability.  A 450-page series of papers on "imaginary geometry" was completed with Jason Miller in 2013, and subsequently revised and published over the following years. These papers used a random object called the "Gaussian free field" to describe a new kind of geometry. The "rays" in this random geometry are random fractal curves called SLE curves. It turns out that this random geometry enables one to solve open problems about the SLE curves themselves and other problems from mathematical physics.  The PI also worked with Duplantier, Rhodes, and Vargas to extend the construction of Liouville quantum gravity to the critical value.  The PI co-authored survey papers about fractional and log correlated fields (the former written with three graduate students) that explore generalizations fo the Gaussian free field.  Relations between SLE and Liouville quantum gravity were developed in a "quantum zipper" paper and a 200 page "mating of trees" paper with Duplantier and Miller.  A additional object called "quantum Loewner evolution" was introduced and developed with Miller, and describes analogs of DLA and metric growth on random surfaces.   Deeper understanding of a random surface called the Brownian map was established in a three paper series with Miller (a bit over 200 pages) which proved the equivalence of two random surface models: pure Liouville quantum gravity and the Brownian map.  Additional papers by the PI's graduate advisees and co-authors have explored a Euclidean analog of the tree mating theorem, a relationship between uniform spanning trees and the bi-Laplacian free field, a derivation of the multifractal spectrum for SLE, Airy line ensembles, planar Brownian motion, the KPZ formula and its relationship to tree mating theorems, the equivalence of different ways of defining LQG spheres, and various exploration schemes for Gaussian free field level lines and conformal loop ensembles.  Joint work with Kenyon, Miller, and Werner has shown that random planar maps decorated by bipolar orientations converge in the so-called pure LQG decorated by a fractal curve called SLE_12, which essentially means that certain tree and dual tree pairs converge to their continuum analogs. This is interesting because it adds bipolar orientations to the small pantheon of models for which such scaling limit results can be proved and/or conjectured on arbitrary lattices.  The PI has given a number of honorary and plenary lectures, including the Loeve Prize Lecture in Berkeley, 2012; a Plenary Lecture at SPA in Buenos Aires, 2014; a Clay Research Conference Lecture in Oxford, 2014; a Simons Foundation MPS Annual Meeting Lecture in New York, 2014; a Plenary Lecture at the XVIII Congress on Mathematical Physics in Santiago, 2015; an IMS Medallion Lecture in Oxford, 2015; and the Doob Lecture at the World Congress in Probability and Statistics in Toronto, 2016.  The PI has also given a number of minicourses or lecture series; those given in 2016 include a probability summer school at St. Flour (offered jointly with Jason Miller), the Aisenstadt Lectures in Montreal, and the Minerva Lectures at Columbia.
