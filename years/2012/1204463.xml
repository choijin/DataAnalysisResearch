<AbstractNarration>A team of experienced ATE Principal Investigators (PIs), working in collaboration with ATE Center and project PIs and the American Association of Community Colleges, is initiating a regenerative mentoring system for leadership development and knowledge transfer to broaden the impact of the ATE Program. Targeted outreach is facilitating participation of technician educators from underserved groups and from community colleges that have either not been successful or have never received funding from the NSF. Peer mentoring is facilitating knowledge transfer and helping prepare the next generation of community college faculty leaders in advanced technological education fields critical to economic development and national security. This project builds on three successful pilot projects that engaged new institutions in the work of the ATE Program and improved outcomes for ATE projects and ATE Centers. Mentor-Connect has involved ATE PIs, NSF Program Officers, current grantees, potential grantees, the National Academy of Engineering, and the IBM Corporation in project planning. The project is delivering:&lt;br/&gt;* A system benchmarked to the IBM Global Mentoring Program with multiple innovative mentoring strategies and effective use of technology;&lt;br/&gt;* An increase in engagement with and competitive proposals from colleges and populations underrepresented in the NSF/ATE Program;&lt;br/&gt;* Online referral, resources and support services for use by mentors, prospective and current PIs, and NSF Program Officers;&lt;br/&gt;* A cadre of new, diverse Principal Investigators with leadership skills;&lt;br/&gt;* Broader utilization of existing ATE resources and;&lt;br/&gt;* Engagement of successful ATE PIs as mentors who give back to the ATE Program.</AbstractNarration>

Through this inaugural Mentor-Connect project, the number of new-to-ATE colleges benefiting from ATE resources and/or ATE grant funding increased by 59 colleges from 24 states. Most of these were rural colleges.</p> <p>Through this initial three-year grant, Mentor-Connect successfully engaged and supported the involvement of new, diverse technician educators; developed STEM faculty leadership skills; and facilitated knowledge transfer from more experienced ATE grantees known as&nbsp; principal investigators to those who were new to ATE. Throughout, Mentor-Connect benchmarked to an award-winning industry standard: IBM <em>Intelligent Mentoring.</em></p> <p>Mentor-Connect did all this using a mentoring system that harnesses the collegial culture that exists within ATE. &nbsp;It recruited and selected two-person teams of STEM faculty members, who were new to ATE and had ideas for improving technician education in their respective colleges.&nbsp; It simultaneously recruited experienced ATE principal investigators to serve as mentors. Each faculty team was paired with a mentor to guide them through the Mentor-Connect grant development process from January to October (2013-2015). Mentees received mentoring via two face-to-face meetings, periodic phone calls and email communication with their mentors, and online professional development from Mentor-Connect?s staff for nine months leading up to ATE?s grant proposal submission deadline in October.</p> <p>Mentor-Connect also created a plethora of technical resources that are placed in a searchable digital database to support mentors, mentees, and other individuals who are seeking NSF ATE grant funding. All of these project activities leveraged and expanded the use of available of resources developed by ATE centers and projects, NSF, and the American Association of Community Colleges.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over three years, the project received 93 applications and selected 61 STEM faculty teams from 59 colleges.&nbsp; Of those who were selected for cohort mentoring, 90% successfully submitted grant proposals to the ATE Program. Among those who submitted proposals, 36 received ATE funding awards in the Small Grants for Institutions New to ATE track. These ATE project awards, approximately $200,000 each, infused two-year technician education programs with funding to implement a broad range of initiatives. &nbsp;</p> <p>Recognizing how important it is for STEM faculty who are developing grants to be supported by college personnel, grant writers and college administrators were also invited to participate in Mentor-Connect activities with their faculty team. The Mentor-Connect Winter Workshop focused on competitive grant writing for the ATE Program and leadership development that is embedded in proposal development and project implementation processes for principal investigators. Special break-out sessions were offered to address specific issues for grant writers and college administrators.</p> <p>The Mentor-Connect Summer Workshop, which provided another opportunity for in-person mentee-mentor work sessions, was held in conjunction with the High Impact Technology Exchange Conference (HI-TEC). &nbsp;Along with the Mentor-Connect workshop, mentee team members received support to attend HI-TEC and learn from the many ATE principal investigators who make presentations and showcase their work at the conference. &nbsp;</p> <p>Mentor-Connect applicants who were not selected for cohort mentoring were offered one-on-one Mentor-Connect consultation to strengthen their grant ideas. As a result, two-year college educators who subsequently reapplied to Mentor-Connect did so with improved project concept statements and were accepted for cohort mentoring.</p> <p>There is evidence that the grant-writing skills and knowledge gained through Mentor-Connect has contributed to continued success for mentee colleges in seeking NSF funding.&nbsp; Following their participation in Mentor-Connect, colleges in cohort 1 (2012-13), cohort 2 (2013-14) and cohort 3 (2014-15) have received 9 additional ATE grant awards. Ten have received grant awards from other NSF programs. The number of proposals submitted to NSF ATE in the Small Grants for Institutions New to ATE category has increased each year since the Mentor-Connect project began.</p> <p>Mentor-Connect's regenerative leadership development process for the ATE program has another dimension as well.&nbsp; The Mentor-Fellows program, designed and pilot-tested during the final year of this project, prepares experienced ATE principal investigators to become Mentor-Connect mentors.&nbsp; Mentor Fellows will make it possible in future years for some NSF grantees who have been Mentor-Connect participants to serve as Mentor-Connect mentors.</p> <p>This initial Mentor-Connect project laid the foundation for a regenerative, technology-enhanced, peer-mentoring system for leadership development. Its process for transferring knowledge from one generation of STEM education leaders to another is a model that is adaptable within community colleges and has applications for other NSF
