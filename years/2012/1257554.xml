<AbstractNarration>This EAGER is a high risk-high payoff project that offers immense potential benefit to the scientific community by pioneering tools to allow functional analysis of genomic data from non-model animal systems.  This work will bridge researchers from the animal and plant communities, building synergistic research interactions and collaborations. Advances in all areas of biological research rely on our ability to understand the functions of genes, how genes work together in genetic networks, and how these genes and genetic networks have evolved. To gain this understanding, researchers have traditionally relied on direct tests of gene function and interaction using the techniques of genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology. However, we are now able to obtain sequence data at a rate that outpaces our ability to perform these functional tests. In other words, we can now get sequence data faster than we can&lt;br/&gt;figure out what it means! Moreover, an increasing amount of sequence data is being generated for organisms where sophisticated genetic tools have not been developed, which means that we must find a way to predict the functions of these gene sequences without relying on prior knowledge of other sequences, and without making assumptions that similar genes work the same way in different organisms. To address this problem, this project will develop and validate novel computational tools that will allow predictions about gene functions using new sequence data from organisms that lack fully sequenced genomes, without relying on previously generated data on the biochemical or genetic functions of their genes. This project will build and test these tools using gene transcript sequence data from insect, crustacean and spider model laboratory organisms. These predictive tool will change how existing and forthcoming sequence data are used in research across multiple NSF-supported disciplines. This work will contribute to the development of emerging model organisms by increasing the utility of existing data, rather than generating new sequence data, and by extending existing functional molecular genetic tools for new model organisms. Finally, this project will  make an important contribution to the training of early career scientists in national and international cross-disciplinary collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The biological world is built of cells, working singly and together as multicellular units like plants and animals. These cells must undergo a number of complex operations: they need to know how to grow, divide, stick together or come apart as necessary, create specialized structures like hairs or scales or pigments, and even die at appropriate times. The primary &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; that the cells follow to accomplish all of these tasks are genetic instructions in the form of genes, the informational units of the genome. All cellular life on earth shares a last common ancestor, and thus all cells share a large number of similar genes. However, clearly all cellular life is not identical: flowers are different from bacteria, and mushrooms are different from dogs. These differences are, again, controlled by differences in the way that these genes work, differences that have emerged through the process of evolution. Thus, one of the major challenges for biologists is to understand how genes work, and how these genes evolved. The vast majority of our knowledge of these important subjects has come from the intense study of a very small number of organisms. The advantage of this approach is that when many scientists concentrate on studying one or just a few different organisms, advances in building technologies to manipulate the function of genes, and thus understand how the genes work, can be extremely rapid. The disadvantage of this approach is that we now understand the genetic functions of small number of organisms extremely well, but we understand the genetics of most organisms on earth very poorly. To address this problem, scientists should be expanding their toolkit of gene function study tools, so that they can be used in more organisms than just the small number of traditionally studied animals. That is the objective of this project: to build new tools to study gene function and evolution in a set of relatively understudied organisms, and to disseminate the new technologies developed to other scientists so that they can use them, and build on them for the further study of even more understudied organisms. The project focused on developing two main types of tools: first, tools for manipulating genes and gene functions directly in living organisms, and second, computational tools for predicting the functions of genes without having to manipulate them directly. The organisms that were the focus of this project were a number of arthropods, which are animals with a hard exoskeleton and jointed appendages, including insects, crustaceans, millipedes and spiders. The project was very successful in the first goal, and moderately successful in the second goal. For the first goal, we focused our efforts on a cricket species called <em>Gryllus bimaculatus</em>, and developed new techniques and tools to disrupt the function of more than one gene at the same time, see which cells are expressing more than one gene at the same time, remove or add specific DNA sequences into specific desired places in the genome, take high-resolution images of live cricket embryos using cutting-edge microscopy technology, and use automated computer tools to analyze these images. For the second goal, we developed a computer tool that tried to predict, based only on their sequence, which genes in the cricket genome might be involved in specific cellular behaviors and decisions.&nbsp; The tool that we built was somewhat useful, but not as much as we would have hoped. We think that this may be at least partly because the cricket genome sequence is still very incomplete. Many young scientists were trained in the course of pursuing this projects, including high school students, undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. These young scientists learned to perform scientific research, how to teach other scientists what they knew, how to write and publish scientific articles describing their findings, and how to deliver oral presentations on their work to groups of scientists at conferences. We published several scientific papers describing the methods and tools we developed, and the biological discoveries that we were able to make using these tools.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/20/2016<br>      Modified by: Cassandra&nbsp;G&nbsp;Extavour</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
