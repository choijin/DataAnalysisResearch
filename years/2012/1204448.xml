<AbstractNarration>This conference project features two gatherings of scientists, science educators, and other experts, as well as the development of a web site, list-serv, and related activities. During the gatherings, participants will explore how to build state-based programs that can engage people who are incarcerated in sustainability science programming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work builds off of the success of the Sustainable Prisons Project, which has connected people who are incarcerated in Washington State with science through direct involvement in conservation research, and responds to calls from scientists and corrections staff interested in implementing similar programming in other states. The project will help advance the informal science education (ISE) field by potentially leading to high impact activities for a truly underserved population; building capacity among ISE professionals; and building knowledge and a replicable model of supporting non-traditional collaborations that serve the needs of people underrepresented in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

Nine correctional agencies (OR, CA, MD, UT, OH, and WA states; Multnomah, Los Angeles, and Santa Clara Counties) met in March, 2013 in Salt Lake City, Utah for the second phase of the national conference.

An Advisory Board was established to provide oversight for SPP-Network activities. A peer-to-peer mentoring project provided support for staff from one state to visit and learn from another.  Outcomes for intellectual merit included articles in peer-reviewed journals, handbooks of scientific protocols aimed at prison staff and inmates, and presentations at scientific meetings. Results also included hundreds of individuals of endangered species that were reared in captivity by inmates and released to protected areas through partnering restoration projects. Outcomes for broader impacts include engagement of a highly underserved public group (inmates and prison staff), media (print, television, radio, and social), and presentations in public venues, at the local, state, and national level.
