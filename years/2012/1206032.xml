<AbstractNarration>The Daya Bay collaboration aims to measure the "last" neutrino mixing angle, theta_13, with a sensitivity in sin^2(2theta_13) of 1%. Establishment of a nonzero value for this mixing angle would strongly suggest the possibility of CP violation in the neutrino sector. Daya Bay is an international collaboration, including groups from the People's Republic of China and groups from the United States. This award supports the contributions of the Siena College group.  Siena has contributed to the water pool muon veto shield and is now finishing the design and construction of a multi-channel resistivity monitoring system to monitor the purity of the water in the muon pools. Once this is installed in China, the Siena effort will focus on analysis, first of the data from the water monitoring system and then the physics data from the anti-neutrino detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This program will provide research opportunities for undergraduates and expose them to exciting particle physics developments both in the US and in China. Students will actively participate in the Daya Bay experiment and present results to the collaboration in China and at conferences and meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment was an experiment designed to investigate the properties of neutrinos, specifically looking at how the three different types of neutrinos change into each other as they travel through space.  This tendency to transform between what is known as the three flavors of neutrinos is described theoretically by an oscillation pattern.  This pattern is parameterized by "mixing angles" and the measurement of  the most poorly known of these angles was the goal (and result) of the Daya Bay experiment.  This precision measurement of notoriously elusive neutrinos from the Daya Bay reactor required multiple large, complex detector systems near the reactor and deep underground to shield from cosmic ray background signals.  Three such systems were used at varying locations from the reactor cores to allow for searches for deviation from a simple 1/r intensity which would signal an oscillation.  The size and complexity of these systems required a large, international team of over 100 physicists and engineers to design, build, and operate.  We took part in the design of the water Cherenkov veto system.  This system detects the light produced in water by very fast charged particles.  This dim light is detected by underwater phototubes which can detect a single photon but need high-voltage supplied to them and signal cables to readout the detection signals.  These electrical signals must be provided deep underwater in the pools, and we contributed to the design of the sealed electronic bases for these tubes and provided testing for various designs,  To decrease the loss of light, and hence increase the detection efficiency, it is important that the water be as clear as possible.  One measure that can be used as a proxy for the water's purity is its resistivity as this is dependent on the amount of impurities dissolved in the water.  To monitor the condition of the water in the pools we developed a probe and meter system using off the shelf, inexpensive hobbyist Arduino microcontrollers.  These projects were excellent research projects for our undergraduates at Siena College, and close to 10 students worked on aspects of this experiment in their time at Siena.  Several of these students developed an affinity and aptitude for this type of scientific engineering project and have gone on to further education in engineering or careers at labs such as Global Science &amp; Engineering.
