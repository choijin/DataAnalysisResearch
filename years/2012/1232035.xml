<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The objective of this research is to combine advances in the analysis of non-stochastic hybrid dynamical systems and adversarial Markov decision processes to generate new results for a broad class of hybrid stochastic systems. The salient features of hybrid stochastic systems are that 1) the models combine stochastic and worst-case effects to generate non-unique random processes and 2) solutions combine continuous change with instantaneous change. Most work on hybrid stochastic systems has focused on systems with unique solutions. Nevertheless, the combination of worst-case and stochastic effects is natural and manifests itself in a wide class of engineered systems, including air traffic management systems, financial systems, and networked and logic-based control systems. In recent years, important progress has been made on characterizing robust asymptotic stability for non-stochastic hybrid systems as well as for adversarial Markov decision processes. General invariance principles, converse Lyapunov theorems and relaxed Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions for stability have been codified. In addition, powerful reduction principles and linearization-based results have been extended to hybrid systems. The aim of the current work is to develop analogous results for hybrid adversarial Markov decision processes, which will help pave the way for advances in robust control design for stochastic hybrid systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:The proposed developments will enhance the engineering education base by furthering the available graduate curriculum on stochastic and hybrid systems, and by training graduate students.  Tutorial workshops at the main control conferences will be made available to graduate students, researchers, and industry personnel. All technical results will be documented in acclaimed international conferences and prestigious systems and control journals. The work will foster collaboration with international researchers, continuing student exchange programs with several international universities. The progress of the proposed work will be applied to areas that are important to the broad population, for example the efficient management of air traffic to enhance throughput in the nation?s aviation system.   In addition, early educational opportunities, down to the freshman level via freshman seminars, will be pursued to capture the attention of students early in the curriculum through popular applications of optimization and dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of the work in this grant was to develop tools that control engineers can use to predict the behavior of systems that use certain types of feedback mechanisms to achieve efficient, autonomous behavior.    These predictive tools are useful for decreasing the length of the automation design cycle; they do so by guiding the control engineer to designs that are provably effective on mathematical models of the actual process and thus highly likely to be successful in real life.   The grant focused on tools relevant for feedback mechanisms that combine continuous sensing and actuation with logic variables and decision making while also exploiting randomness.     The interaction of the system that is being controlled (say, an autonomous automobile) and the system that controls it (the software) through feedback produces an overall dynamical system that is called a "stochastic hybrid system".   The word "stochastic" refers to the presence of randomness in the overall system.  The word "hybrid" refers to the interaction of continuous variables (positions, velocities, currents, voltages, temperatures, etc.) with logic variables (on/off, red/yellow/green, left/right).  This grant provided tools for analyzing and predicting the behavior of stochastic hybrid systems.   Our goal was to establish that the analysis tools control engineers are used to using for less complicated dynamical systems (those modeled by differential equations for example) are also relevant for complicated systems like stochastic hybrid systems.    We were successful in this program, establishing that Lyapunov functions and invariance principles continue to provide efficient tools for predicting the behavior of these systems, without having to resort to extensive simulation until after one is very confident in the efficacy of the feedback design.   During the grant, three graduate students and the PI devoted significant time to establishing the desire results.   The graduate students learned about the relatively new field of study that is stochastic hybrid systems, and learned how to show that classical analysis tools are relevant for these systems.  In addition, they demonstrated through academic examples how the new tools can be exploited by control engineers to guide their design efforts. Two of the three students have now moved on to industry where they can propagate their knowledge to their coworkers and applying it on real problems.  Through our work, we have raised the awareness of the feedback control research community about the utility of stochastic hybrid systems as a modern, versatile modeling framework with cutting-edge analysis tools.   This awareness was raised via extensive publication in the top journals and conferences in the field, including tutorial articles to make the methodologies more widely accessible.   Our specific results showed how to think about solutions to stochastic hybrid systems models that might admit a multiplicity of solutions.   Subsequently, we showed how to demonstrate that the stability behavior of stochastic hybrid systems is robust to small perturbations, and we showed that Lyapunov functions are a natural tool to use to analysis stability of stochastic hybrid systems since we were able to show that Lyapunov functions always exist, at least for a large subclass of stochastic hybrid systems.   Despite the extensive progress that was made on stochastic hybrid systems during the execution of this grant, many interesting open questions remain.   The answers to these open questions will give control engineers further confidence in using stochastic hybrid feedback control algorithms to solve important technological challenges.   Hence, we are excited to continue this work in subsequent funding provided by the National Science Foundation and look forward to documenting the results that are obtain in that work as well.
