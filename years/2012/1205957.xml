<AbstractNarration>This award will enable collaborative work by Duke University and the University of Minnesota Duluth's neutrino research groups on the Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO). This is a new experiment designed to detect neutrinos originating in a core-collapse supernova within our own galaxy. The deaths of massive stars which cause these cataclysmic events occur every few decades somewhere in the MilkyWay and emit 99% of their energy in the form of a short burst of neutrinos. Existing detectors are primarily sensitive to electron antineutrinos. Use of lead for its target nuclei allows HALO to be sensitive to electron neutrinos, as well as to all flavor components of the burst flux via neutral current interactions. The effort for this funding cycle will center on upgrading HALO with redundant, fast-failover data acquisition systems. This award will provide modest hardware and personnel contributions to this effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this award include the excellent experimental training for students and postdoctoral researchers. They have been very successful in involving students and postdocs in the past. This project offers a range of experiences, from simulation through detector construction, with operations and data analysis to commence soon. HALO will also be a contributor to SNEWS (SuperNova Early Warning System), which has an intrinsic outreach component.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) is a dedicated supernova neutrino detection experiment based 1.5 miles underground in SNOLAB.  Its goal is to detect electron neutrinos coming from the next core-collapse supernova to occur somewhere in our galaxy.  The deaths of such massive stars are estimated to occur several times per century in a galaxy like ours, and produce a prodigious amount of neutrinos.  The neutrinos escape the star hours before the light, and there are so many of them that a supernova would be a great lab for learning about the properties of these elusive particles in ways we will never be able to replicate on earth: as well as to learn about how stars explode.  Unlike other neutrino detectors, HALO is sensitive primarily to electron type neutrinos: this will allow a much more complete picture of what's going on when comparing what a supernova looks like in different detectors.  While quite exciting to think about, waiting potentially decades for such a rare event requires an experiment that is low cost, low maintainence, and reliable.  HALO is built primarily from parts reused from older experiments, and is designed to be so reliable that even if a part fails, half the detector will still work until someone can get underground to fix things.  It is able to be monitored and controlled by collaborators remotely over the network.  This NSF award allowed Univ. of Minnesota Duluth students and faculty to work on getting the detector from the "it's built and sort of mostly works" stage, to fully completed, tested, calibrated, and running smoothly for the long neutrino watch ahead.  Two undergraduate and one Masters student graduated with HALO as their research project, using the skills they learned to land one an immediate job upon graduation and the other two positions in PhD programs.
