<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to take advantage of the exceptional exposures of shallow crustal igneous intrusions in the Henry Mountains of southern Utah to study in detail the spatial and temporal growth of plutons constructed from multiple magma pulses. Because the intrusions were emplaced during a tectonic lull, they are largely free of complicating tectonic structures and specific variables related to magma emplacement can be evaluated, some that is difficult to in many other geologic settings. Each of the five separate intrusive centers in the Henry Mountains preserves a different stage of the evolution of a shallowly constructed igneous system, ranging from a small-total-volume body comprised mostly of dikes to a fully mature body comprised of dozens of relatively large intrusions.  This project is focusing on detailed studies of three of these intrusive centers: one each at an early, moderate, and advanced stage of development.  Using data field, geochemical, geochronogical, and paleomagnetic data from these intrusive centers, a general construction model for a shallow igneous complex is being constructed. Synthesis of the data and construction of models for data emplacement are being facilitated by the integration of data into geographic information system. Ultimately, a series of fully 3-D models for each intrusive center  will be created using constraints from the collected data to study growth of the composite intrusions in space and time. This research will advance our understanding of how igneous intrusions grow in the shallow crust.  These intrusions are important for many reasons, including that they feed volcanic eruptions, they serve as heat reservoirs for geothermal fields, and that fluids associated with the intrusions are an important souce of economic mineral deposits.  This project is specifically designed to further our knowledge of: (1) the geometries of the plumbing system in shallow igneous systems, (2) how these systems evolve as magma pulses intrude sequentially, (3) magma intrusion rates and their variability in space and time, and (4) the manifestation of magma pulses at different spatial and temporal scales structurally, geochemically, etc. The project is a collaborative effort between researchers at Eastern Carolina University, SUNY College at Geneseo, and Central Michigan University.  In addition to the scientific goals of the project, the research is providing for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in STEM disciplines at all three institutions and results of the study will be used for the development of resources for teaching, research, and outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Henry Mountains are composed of a series of small igneous bodies emplaced into the shallow crust.  As magma moved up through the crust towards the surface it became trapped and froze in place.  These frozen magma pipes provide an opportunity to study the ways in which magma move from deep portions of the crust up to the EarthÆs surface where it could eventually feed a volcanic system.  Our research has focused on constraining the rate at which magma flowed into this preserved plumbing system in the Henry Mountains.  The Henry Mountains are an excellent place to study magma emplacement because they lie within the Colorado Plateau, far away from the disturbances caused by deformation at tectonic plate boundaries.  Here magma forced its way into a package of flat lying sedimentary rocks, therefore all disruption of the local strata can be attributed to magma emplacement.  Moreover, the Henry Mountains consist of a series of five intrusive centers that have been deeply eroded exposing the three-dimensional geometry of this ancient magma feeder system.  Previous research has shown that most igneous bodies in the Henrys form from repeated pulses of magma which create a sheeted stack.  This research project investigated the rate of magma emplacement in two ways:  (1) How quickly does one sheet of magma follow another? and (2) How quickly is a single sheet of magma emplaced?  We address both questions by examining the magnetic characteristics of the rocks.  As the magma intruded and began to cool it locked in and preserved the orientation of the Earth's magnetic field.  Our magnetic data indicate that successive sheets of magma preserve the decade to century scale wander of Earth's magnetic field.  Moreover, detailed investigation of a single sheet of magma indicates that it also records this decade to century scale wander.  These results suggest that it could take decades to centuries for a single sheet of magma to be emplaced, which implies that igneous bodies composed of multiple sheets may take even longer to be emplaced.  This paints of picture of a plumbing system in which magma moves through a series of small pulses rather than a single massive injection.  This NSF grant has had a tremendously positive impact on the SUNY Geneseo Department of Geological Sciences.  Over the three year course of this grant 14 SUNY Geneseo undergraduate geology majors participated in the research.  Seven of these students traveled to Utah to collect their own samples which formed the basis subsequent senior thesis projects.  Those seven students worked directly with co-PIÆs Horsman and Morgan both in the field and afterwards while analyzing their data.  All 14 students presented their research locally at an on-campus science symposium and five students presented at the National Geological Society of America meetings.  Four students are currently enrolled in PhD programs, one in a MS program, and two are currently applying for graduate school.  In addition to benefiting my research group, this NSF grant has had a direct impact on the entire Department of Geological Sciences.  Based on my interest in magma flow processes as demonstrated by this award, I was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to teach and conduct research at the Universidad de Concepcion in Chile in the fall of 2015.  During that time period I lead  36 undergraduate students and 5 faculty from SUNY Geneseo on a field trip to visit both active (Laguna del Maule) and ancient (Torres del Paine) magma systems.  Learning about these systems directly from Chilean geologists greatly expanded my understanding of analogous systems in the Henry Mountains system.  I would never have had the chance to become a Fulbright scholar without the opportunities provided by this NSF grant.
