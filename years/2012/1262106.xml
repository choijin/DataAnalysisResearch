<AbstractNarration>This project will address approximation properties of C*-algebras and their connection to noncommutative dynamics, group theory, and operator spaces. Perron-Frobenius operators are a natural and useful way to study the time-evolution of densities. The principal investigator will study the dynamics of classical Perron-Frobenius operators as well as noncommutative Perron-Frobenius operators, with a special focus on topological entropy. In another direction, he will investigate how the completely bounded approximation property behaves with respect to reduced free products, focusing on the analogies with free products and weak amenability for groups. Finally, the project will study how the local linear structure (from an operator space point-of-view) of a C*-algebra controls the algebraic, topological, and representation theoretic properties of a C*-algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximation theory is an extremely useful concept in mathematics.  The basic idea is as follows: take an infinite (and therefore difficult for the human mind to comprehend) mathematical object that one seeks to understand; then approximate this object by similar, yet finite (and therefore theoretically easier for the human mind to comprehend) mathematical objects;  finally, fit all of these approximations together to compose a clear understanding of the infinite mathematical object.  The mathematical objects in this proposal bear the technical name C*-algebras. They were first studied in the context of quantum mechanics but have since realized numerous connections to nearly all areas of mathematics, for example, to dynamical systems and to group theory. This project aims to treat three seemingly separate areas of mathematics (dynamical systems, group theory, and operator spaces) with the same tool of approximation theory, all in the context of C*-algebras.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major outcome of this award is the six publications produced by the principal investigator and coauthors. All of these works are related to the theory of operator algebras which were introduced by John von Neumann in the 1930s. Operator algebras touch nearly every field of mathematics; geometry, topolgy, dynamics and algebra to name a few.  The six publications interact with the fields of probability, representation theory (a mix of algebra and analysis), group theory (algebra) and analysis.  Probably the most significant outcome during the project's duration was a result linking the nilpotency of a group with the finite (nuclear) dimensionality of its associated operator algebra.  The broader impacts of this project include the mentorship of young researchers. One of the PI's publications was coauthored with a young visiting professor at the PI's university.  Another publication was coauthored with a (then) graduate student.  The PI also invited several young postdocs and graduate students to his university to discuss research and hosted a seminar providing them an opportunity to disseminate their research.   The PI disseminated his reasearch through the above mentioned publications but also through numerous addresses at conferences, seminars and colloquiua throughout the United States, Canada, France, Scotland, Germany and S. Korea.          Last Modified: 09/29/2015       Submitted by: Caleb Eckhardt]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
