<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to understand how tropospheric blocking events lead to stratospheric sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs).  Previous research has shown a statistically significant relationship in which most SSWs are preceded by blocking events, yet the majority of blocking events are not followed SSWs.  The goal of this research is to determine what factors cause some blocks to perturb the stratosphere while others do not.  The research is conducted through a combination of dynamical diagnosis of reanalysis datasets and numerical experiments conducted with an idealized atmospheric model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research topic is of practical importance as well as scientific interest, as SSWs are known to affect subsequent weather and are particularly associated with cold air outbreaks.  Results of this research may thus be of interest for long-range weather forecasting.  In addition, the project supports two graduate students, thereby providing for the next generation of researchers in this area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of the project was to investigate the relationship between anticyclones (clockwise spinning high-pressure systems) in the lower atmosphere (0 - 30 kilometers above sea-level) and the stratospheric polar vortex (a high-latitude, counterclockwise spinning low pressure system 25 - 30 kilometers above sea-level) in Northern Hemisphere winter seasons.  Disturbances to the polar vortex, such as its splitting into two or more vortices or its displacement away from the North Pole, can be followed in time by abnormally cold weather at the earth's surface.  These disturbances were found on average to be preceded in time by the development of an anticyclone over the Aleutian Islands 30 kilometers above sea level, and by the development of unusually strong anticyclones ("blocking highs") closer to sea level.  The mechanism connecting these anticyclones with the disturbed polar vortex was found to be an abnormal flow of warm air from low to high latitudes.  In addition, abnormally cold air near sea-level can help disturb the polar vortex, setting the stage for further cold weather conditions near sea level.        These discoveries were made by the principal investigator and his two graduate students, one of whom earned a Ph.D. degree and is now employed as a research scientist while the other is completing his Ph.D.   This latter student also supervised an undergraduate student on aspects of the project, exposing that student to research methods and discovery.  These students and the investigator published their findings in scholarly journals read by other students and scientists, and presented their work to audiences at scientific conferences.  Finally, the research methods used in the project were introduced to other graduate and undergraduate students in the courses taught by the investigator.
