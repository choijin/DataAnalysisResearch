<AbstractNarration>Developing new analytic tools and proof techniques will advance computer science in a fundamental way.  The aim of this project is to explore techniques used in several different areas of theoretical computer science and mathematics in a unified way. One such development involves the study of low-degree polynomials. This research will address problems arising from two main considerations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Understanding the analytical structure of functions which have a small but significant correlation with a low-degree polynomial over a finite field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Understanding the expressive power of low-degree polynomials over reals for capturing proofs of several combinatorial facts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The former leads to many questions spanning the areas of arithmetic combinatorics, coding theory, learning theory, hardness of approximation and Fourier analysis. Some of these questions extend the notions of list-decoding in coding theory and are also key to developing an algorithmic version of the theory of higher-order Fourier analysis, developed recently to study questions in arithmetic combinatorics.  The latter consideration will strengthen our understanding of  techniques from combinatorial optimizations and proof complexity.  Progress on these questions will shed light on the design of new approximation algorithms using linear and semidefinite programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of this project also includes designing two new courses, to be offered at Toyota Technical Institute and the University of Chicago.  The PI also plans to collect short "research summaries" to outline some of the exciting  questions in different areas of theory, and make them accessible to advanced high-school and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this research project was to unify mathematical techniques based on the structure of low-degree polynomials, for analyzing and understanding algorithms and proof systems. The project led to the following research outcomes:   - Algorithms for decoding Reed-Muller codes, which are derived from low-degree polynomials, beyond the previously best known notion threshold of tolerable error, known as the "list decoding radius".  The work done as part of the project showed that in certain cases, it is possible to algorithmically take advantage of certain duality between "regularity" and randomness in these polynomials, and correct errors beyond the list-decoding threshold.  - An understanding of structural properties leading which make constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) amenable or resistant to approximation algorithms. CSPs are a fundamental class of optimization problems while several of them are known to be hard to solve even approximately, a characterization of properties which make them hard or easy remains elusive. The work done as part of this project gives such a characterization under a conjecture known as the Unique Games Conjecture.  Other results obtained also characterize the ability of algorithms based on linear programs (obtained via polynomial proof systems known as the Sherali-Adams hierarchy) to reason about such problems.  - A study of the quality of approximation obtained my semidefinite programs forvarious continuous optimization problems.   Some of the work done in this project studied multiplicative approximations for basic problems in continuous optimization, such as polynomial optimization and operator norms. While for several norm optimization problems, this lead to a unified understanding of known lower and upper bounds, much still remains to be understood about these fundamental problems.  - A connection of optimization hierarchies with general notions of expansion in the inputs, and applications to coding theory.
