<AbstractNarration>This is an exploratory study of the role of Science Faculty with Education Specialties (SFES) in traditional STEM departments.  These are faculty scientists who take on specialized roles in science education in their discipline. The enrichment of university science departments with SFES faculty members has begun to emerge as a response to critical challenges in three key arenas in U.S. science education: 1) discipline-based science education research, 2) undergraduate science education, and 3) K-12 science education. This project is examining academic climates and institutional contexts for SFES positions addressing the research question "In what institutional contexts have SFES positions emerged, what has motivated this, and what is the perceived impact of SFES?"  The study is examining explicitly the various perspectives in different science disciplines and at different institution types; primarily undergraduate, MS-granting, and PhD-granting institutions.  In addressing the main research question, the study is focusing on three underlying questions:&lt;br/&gt;- What are the initial reasons for creating SFES positions?  &lt;br/&gt;- How do departmental stakeholders (including the SFES faculty themselves) conceptualize the purposes of SFES positions? &lt;br/&gt;- What is the impact and institutional influence of SFES?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the need to understand the roles and impacts of SFES faculty, particularly their contribution to a reform agenda.  Data are largely absent. The cross-disciplinary research team is qualified to examine SFES nationally because of its work defining the SFES field.  It has recently completed a national survey to determine who are in the national SFES faculty based on a combination of factors, including self-identification.  The national survey data and this exploratory study of the SFES academic climates in different departments and institutional contexts are possible indicators of readiness to engage in evidence based teaching reforms at the departmental level.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this study is its potential value to funders and policymakers seeking to improve undergraduate STEM education.</AbstractNarration>
