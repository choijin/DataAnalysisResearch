<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Steven L. Bernasek and his coworkers at  Princeton University will investigate the fundamental mechanisms of heterogeneous reaction systems.  The function of organic corrosion inhibitors in corrosive fluid environments will be examined using electrochemical methods and photoelectron spectroscopy.  The structure and reactivity of self-assembled organic monolayer surfaces will be studied using scanning probe microscopy, with a focus on understanding the formation of chiral monolayers and nanopatterned surfaces.  Plasmonic sensors based on ordered arrays of gold nanodots deposited on oxide substrates will be used to monitor surface reaction dynamics of catalytic oxidation reactions.  This work will be carried out in close connection to measurements of the internal state distributions of the products of these catalytic oxidation reactions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have broad impact on the education of graduate and undergraduate research students.  The interdisciplinary nature of the work carried out in this project provides an excellent training ground for the development of capable researchers.  Interactions with industrial collaborators expose research students to questions of commercial importance.  The fundamental understanding obtained in this research will have important impact in the development of new corrosion inhibitors, in the understanding of self-assembly at surfaces, and in the clarification of the mechanisms of heterogeneous catalytic oxidation processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research supported by this award, "Structure and Dynamics of Heterogeneous Reactions", examined the chemistry of reactions occurring at solid surfaces.  Four general areas were examined over the course of the award period.  They were 1) catalytic oxidation reactions, 2) structure and mechanisms of self-assembly, 3) corrosion inhibition chemistry, and 4) photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of complex composite surface samples.  In each of these areas, specific project outcomes are reported here.  In the area of catalytic oxidation reactions, studies of the internal state distribution of the CO2 product of the catalytic oxidation of acetaldehyde, acetone, and ethanol were carried out.  In each case, the product CO2 was found to be significantly vibrationally excited, with the degree of excitation depending on the kinetics of the reaction process.  In related work, a flow reactor for the study of propylene oxidation was developed which relies on a nanoplasmonic sensor to detect intermediate coverages on the catalyst surface.  The work in this area provides basic mechanistic understanding needed for the design and optimization of catalysts for exhaust gas remediation and for production of commodity chemicals.  Work in the area of self-assembly helped to determine mechanisms and rates of self-assembly of monolayers involving substituted styrene molecules.  In addition, information about the balance of interactions controlling the structures formed during self-assembly processes was obtained.  Information from this aspect of the project is useful for the design of state of the art organic electronic devices and highly sensitive sensor devices.  Corrosion inhibition chemistry was examined from the point of view of nitrogen containing organic molecular corrosion inhibition materials.  This information is useful for the design of corrosion inhibition strategies needed in petroleum production and refining.  Similarly, our examination of the oxidation mechanism for extreme service alloys impacts the development of better materials for use in the chemical process industry.  The final area of research focused on the development of analytical tools that can be used for compositional characterization of complex, composite surface samples that are often seen in technologically important areas such as heterogeneous catalysis, and electronic device fabrication.    In all of this work, fundamental understanding of the systems under study helps to lead to technological applications that rely on this fundamental knowledge.   In addition to the basic knowledge provided by the research supported by this award, students were trained in the art of research and were prepared to carry out independent research in areas vital to commercial product development, healthcare and disease prevention, and national security.  In particular, seven PhD students worked on this research project.  Two have completed their PhD work during the course of this project, and the other five will complete their work in the next two years.  Additionally, four undergraduates and one high school student participated in the work of this research program.  The research carried out here has been reported in five publications thus far, and there are a number of additional manuscripts being written up for publication.
