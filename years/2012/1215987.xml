<AbstractNarration>The continuation of the study of algorithms and complexity for the solution of high dimensional continuous problems is proposed.  Examples of such problems occur in quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, and condensed matter physics. Typical continuous mathematical formulations include partial differential equations, continuous optimization, high dimensional integration, and path integration. Dimension measures the size of a continuous problem. Just as in the rest of complexity studies the PIs are interested in solving large problems; that is, problems of high dimension. One cannot enter a function of real or complex variables into a digital computer. One has to discretize it to obtain the computer input. Thus the computer has only partial information about the continuous mathematical input. This permits adversary arguments at the information level pioneered by the PIs and their colleagues which lead to lower bounds on the problem complexity. This may be contrasted with discrete problems where the information is complete, there are often no adversary arguments at the information level, and one has to be content with conjectures that the complexity hierarchy does not collapse. Because of the importance of information-based arguments the study of the complexity of continuous problems is called information-based complexity (IBC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central issue is to determine for which settings and spaces a problem is tractable; that is, its complexity is not exponential.  There is a huge literature on the computational complexity of d-dimensional problems.  Most of these papers and books obtain results which are sharp with respect to 1/E, where E is the error threshold, but have unknown dependence on d. But to determine if a problem is tractable one needs to know the dependence on both 1/E and d. This requires new proof techniques.  This is the subject of the monograph "Tractability of Multivariate Problems" by E. Novak and H. Wozniakowski. Two volumes of the monograph have been published in 2008 and 2010. These two volumes include 91 open questions. Research will be devoted to trying to answer some of these open questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  How much faster are quantum computers than classical computers for important problems?  We introduced the concept of strong quantum speedup.  For given problem the strong quantum speedup, S, is defined as follows. S is the classical complexity divided by the quantum complexity.  We are particularly interested in problems where S is an exponential function of a parameter.  A different definition of speedup is often used, especially in the computational science literature.  It is T, which is defined as the cost of the best classical algorithm known divided by the cost of a quantum algorithm.  The advantage of speedup S is as follows.  If a problem enjoys speedup T someone may invent a better classical algorithm and therefore decrease T but speedup S cannot be decreased.  To obtain speedup S one must be able to compute good estimates of classical and quantum complexities.  Information-based complexity gives us the tools to do this.  We provide a number of problems which enjoy strong exponential quantum speedups.  One of the problems is the approximation of the ground state energy of an instance of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation with d degrees of freedom and relative error E.  The worst case classical complexity is exponential in d; we derived a quantum algorithm which solves the problem with cost polynomial in d and 1/E.   A second example is the Poisson equation.  It plays a fundamental role in numerous areas of science and engineering, such as computational fluid dynamics, quantum mechanical continuum solvation, electrostatics, the theory of Markov chains, and is important in electronic structure calculations.  In the worst case classical setting the problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality.  We have provided a quantum algorithm whose cost is almost linear in d and polylogarithmic in 1/E.  Work has continued on the tractability of multivariate problems.  Erich Novak and Henryk Wozniakowski published a three volume monograph on the subject.  The total number of pages in the three volumes is over 1600 and 149 open problems are listed for future research.  Henryk Wozniakowski won the Banach Prize for this work.  The third volume deals with algorithms that use function values for approximation of linear operators, such as multivariate integration and approximation, and a number of non-linear operators corresponding to the Poisson equation with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, the Fredholm equation of the second kind, the heat equation, and the Helmholtz equation.  These problems were studied in the worst case, randomized, and average case settings over standard unweighted and weighted smooth spaces of d-variate functions.
