<AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative research effort is to develop micro-electro-mechanical  frequency converters that make use of subharmonic resonances.  The first approach utilizes a chain of N coupled resonators with 2:1 internal resonances among nearest neighbors, which takes an input frequency at one end and provides a set of output frequencies that are the input frequency divided by 2^j, for j=2,?,N along the chain.  The second approach makes use of subharmonic responses in vibro-impact devices; these provide frequency division by integer factors using a single resonator driven with input frequencies near multiples of its natural frequency.  Both systems will be investigated from a fundamental dynamical systems point of view, and the results will be used to develop and optimize MEMS designs.  The resulting devices will be fabricated, experimentally characterized, and tested for performance metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frequency converters are devices that take an input frequency and change it into another frequency at the output.  They are used in spread spectrum communication systems, signal synthesizers, mixers, clock generators, and sensors. The originality of the proposed effort is the combined use of nonlinear mechanical vibrational resonances and the inherent design flexibility of micro-electro-mechanical systems to develop entirely passive converters that do not require the buffers and amplifiers used in most electronic converters.  The anticipated designs are appealing due to their size, ease of fabrication, integration with electronics, ability for frequency tuning, and low power requirements.  The broader impacts of the effort include outreach activities, multi-disciplinary training of students, inclusion of students from underrepresented groups, development of classroom materials, and dissemination of research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Frequency conversion mechanisms are essential elements in frequency synthesizers, which are used in many applications ranging from microwave and RF transceivers to wireless applications to vibration energy harvesters. In particular, the frequency divider, which is an integral part of the phase-locked loop circuit, is essential in modern day instrumentation and wireless communications.  In most systems requiring frequency conversion, electronic frequency converters are used; these components require significant power input and introduce noise into the system.   INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  During the course of this NSF program, the collaborative team introduces a mechanism for eliminating these noisy electronic components by using coupled mechanical elements. This novel mechanism for frequency division using parametric resonance in MEMS  relies on finite deformation kinematics and nonlinear coupling between isolated modes in a structure to divide an input signal through multiple stages using purely mechanical coupling.  The collaborative team, a partnership between UC Santa Barbara and Michigan State University developed a theoretical framework for a generic subharmonic resonance cascade. A microscale device was designed using the theoretical framework to demonstrate an 8x division of frequency.  A single input signal is divided through three modal stages, generating output at half, quarter, and eighth fractions of the input signal.  The team also explored mechanical coupling and boundary conditions through modeling.  The noise characteristics of this mechanical frequency divider are very promising, and show that this type of cascading frequency conversion improves phase noise performance of each individual mode.   BROADER IMPACTS: The Broader Impacts of this project include design and invention of low phase noise frequency dividers for improved radio communication.  The project was a collaboration between theoreticians and experimentalists, and it is supported 2 full time Ph.D. students who both obtained their degrees.  The graduate students gained significant experience through traveling to the collaborator institutions to learn the basics of test and fabrication, and also theory.  The work led to two journal publications, and a number of talks at national and international meetings, as well as one US patent application.
