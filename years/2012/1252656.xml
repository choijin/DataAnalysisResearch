<AbstractNarration>This project continues a 30-year study of Black Brandt geese on the Tutakoke River in Alaska. To date, 2,000 individuals have been marked and 2,000 previously-marked individuals are monitored annually. The length of the study provides a large sample of Brant  that are now over 20 years old, allowing the researchers to examine the consequences of reproduction, senescence, and life-history tradeoffs in a long-lived vertebrate. Data collected over the next five years will explore the new hypothesis that local density, rather than parental investment, influences optimal brood size. The researchers will also pursue a second surprising finding, which is that gosling success likely results from pre-fledging survival rather than from post-fledging effects.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Tutakoke River Brant study provides the principal demographic data used to manage the Black Brandt and other avian species. The researchers work closely with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Pacific Flyway to develop effective management plans. They also work closely with Native Alaskan residents of Chevak, Alaska, particularly to involve students from the village in the research project.  Graduate and undergraduate students also gain research experience by participation in this research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We set out to assess a basic question in life-history evolution: does natural selection favor a specific upper limit to the number of offspring produced in a given reproductive event?  We performed our study on a Black Brant colony on the Bering Sea coast of western Alaska.  We added or removed eggs from color-marked females so they incubated clutches or reared broods either smaller or larger than the ones they had produced naturally.  Five eggs is typically the largest clutch size we observe; only a small percentage of clutches contain six or more eggs.  We found that females could rear more goslings to fledging than they normally produced.  We also found that when females incubated clutches larger than five, reduced hatchability meant that no more goslings hatched than if the clutch had been smaller.  We have also found that in normally laid clutches, (i.e., unmanipulated) goslings from last laid eggs typically survived at lower rates and grew more slowly than goslings from eggs laid earlier in the clutch.  Female brant begin incubating their eggs after the second or third egg so the last laid eggs receive less incubation than those earlier in the laying sequence.  This result suggests that time limitations may also play a role in limiting clutch size.  We also considered the effects of brood size on future reproductive potential of adult female brant.  We found that females rearing broods either larger or smaller than 4 had a lower probability of breeding the next year than females rearing 4 goslings.  Females rearing larger broods molted later than those rearing smaller broods, suggesting a nutritional or energetic cost of rearing a larger brood, which might explain reduced breeding effort in these females the next year.  This finding would certainly select against producing broods larger than 4 goslings. Reduced breeding by females rearing smaller broods requires a more complex explanation.  In geese, family size determines social status in flocks of wintering geese.  We believe reducing brood size reduced social status of females, which reduced their ability to acquire and store nutrients during winter and spring migration.  Reduced acquisition of nutrients, in turn, reduced the ability of females to breed in the year following the reduction of the size of their broods.  This likely resulted in a longer term reduction in breeding because females that skip breeding in one year are also less likely to breed in the subsequent year and so on.  We did not find an effect of brood size on female survival consistent with the idea that survival tends to be protected in long-lived species.  Overall, our results suggest numerous factors act to regulate the upper limit of clutch size at about 5 eggs, the largest commonly produced clutch size in brant.
