<AbstractNarration>The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program at the University of Florida (UF) is funded primarily by the National Science Foundation through the Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FG-LSAMP) with additional support from UF Office of Research. The UF Graduate School directs the program with the assistance of the four UF colleges with STEM disciplines: the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Agricultural and Life Sciences, and Medicine. The BD will integrate students into UF's research networks and education programs to ensure that they are properly trained, mentored and developed for research careers in the STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;UF is strongly committed to increasing diversity at all levels, with a particular emphasis on enhancing diversity in PhD programs and expanding the PhD student population. The BD program at UF ensures Fellows at least five years of support. It provides a variety of professional development components, including regularly scheduled meetings with the UF BD cohort and the University of South Florida BD cohorts, to help retain the participants and facilitate the Fellows' transitions into the scientific workforce. BD Fellows at UF will benefit from the support of the campus community that is committed to providing them with the assistance they need to complete their PhDs and make the transition into professional careers in STEM fields. The expectation is that the UF BD will develop the Fellows as a well-bonded cohort that is able to move successfully from undergraduate to graduate programs, and then move into professional positions in the workforce upon completion of the PhD. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts embedded in the overall design and structure of the UF BD Program fosters activities that benefit the fellows and the broader community. Through linkages with numerous K-12 classroom activities, the BD Program will encourage youth and incoming college students to consider STEM disciplines and careers. The BD at UF also will cultivate a climate that will allow a number of the Fellows to enter the professoriate and further diversify STEM departments in colleges and universities. Such individuals will become role models and mentors for the next generation of STEM students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority ParticipationÆs Bridge to the Doctorate Program (BD) at the University of Florida (UF) provides financial support and professional development activities to enhance the retention and graduation rates of underrepresented STEM Ph.D students.  In addition to retention and graduation, UF aims to prepare our BD fellows as they transition into the scientific workforce through workshops, training and mentoring.  The University of Florida has a rich and successful history with the BD Fellowship Program.  To date, UFÆs first cohort (2008-10) has yielded 10 fellows graduating with PhD degrees (83%).  Thus far, the second cohort (2010-12) has produced 5 PhDÆs, with 5 students currently enrolled for a combined graduation and retention rate of 83%.  Currently, the third cohort (2013-15) has a UF retention rate of 94%, with only one student bridging to a doctoral program at another university.  BD fellows at UF have received outstanding benefits, including access to a broad extensive research network and extensive doctoral programs, which have trained and developed them in preparation for leadership in STEM careers.  The BD program (2013-15) at UF had the following objectives which resulted in the following accomplishments:  Students gained insights into the professoriate through working closely with a mentor soon after entering the graduate program.  Upon entry into the BD program, students were advised on the importance of mentoring relationships and how to choose good mentors.  Within the first year, all fellows were successful in choosing a mentor and research group.  Students are better educated in pedagogical and instructional techniques and are able to apply these skills to communicate their research to diverse audiences.  Through presentation skills workshops and teacher instructional training, BD students received a variety of pedagogical and instructional techniques.  These techniques were applied to diverse audiences in several ways, including research presentations to middle and high school students, oral and poster presentations at national and organizational conferences, and research presentations within their own BD peer group.  Additionally, through teaching assistantships students were able to gain the necessary skills to enhance their instructional techniques.  All opportunities were instrumental in improving the communication skills and were made possible through the support of the BD program.  Students gained a greater appreciation of the possible interdisciplinary nature of their research, how to build collaborations across disciplines and how to work in teams. The research diversity at UF has given BD fellows the opportunity to network with peers and researchers from a wide range of backgrounds.  Through informal and formal research presentations and discussions, students have had opportunities to discuss their research with broad audiences.  Undoubtedly, these interactions have improved the fellowÆs skills but it has also given them a better understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of their work.   Students are better prepared to identify and address ethical issues of research. All NSF-funded students at UF undergo ethics training through the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI).  In addition, UF provides a number of ethics seminars and guides that have been developed and disseminated through the UF Libraries.  The BD Program afforded UFÆs fellows an opportunity to participate in CITI training, an activity that may have been otherwise missed, and will undoubtedly aid in the success of their careers and value of their research.   Students are better prepared to enter the global workforce.  The professional development received at UF through seminars, workshops and faculty mentoring has developed our students into professionals that will be extremely prepared to succeed in any environment.
