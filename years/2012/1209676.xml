<AbstractNarration>This action funds Michael J. Lopez of University of California, Los Angeles to conduct a research project, entitled "Novel catalytic reactions generating chemical bonds using abundant and cheap starting materials," during the summer of 2012 at University of Osaka in Osaka.  The host scientist is Professor Hayato Tsurugi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to develop dehydrogenative borylation catalysts using early-transition metals supported by redox-active ligands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
