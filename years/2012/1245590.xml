<AbstractNarration>Researchers at the University of Maryland and Berkeley are studying the implementation of the Compass program to determine to what extent and how it increases retention of physics majors, especially women and under-represented students. Compass includes a two-week summer experience, follow-up fall and spring courses, a lecture series and a mentorship program all focused on building community, stoking students' interest in physics, and developing students' disciplinary identities and ways of thinking, partly by involving them in research. The project entails quantitative research focusing on retention in physics, especially looking at women and underrepresented minority students, and qualitative research investigating the idea that Compass works by helping students forge an identity as a member of a physics community, defined by both social and intellectual norms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compass was originally developed by Berkeley graduate students, and won the American Physical Society's 2012 Award for Improving Undergraduate Education. This research probes a possible solution to one of the most pressing problems in physics education, that of disturbingly and persistently small numbers of women and underrepresented minorities among physics majors. The research has the potential to shed light not only about whether these programs increase retention for all groups and for underrepresented groups, but also about how they work (or not), via analysis of classroom video and clinical interviews. It evaluates not only the effectiveness of a promising model for retaining underrepresented students in physics, possibly applicable to other STEM disciplines, but also a dissemination strategy wherein a participant/leader in a program at one institution helps to develop or sustain a similar program as a graduate student or faculty member at another university. Since physics departments often financially support their 1st- and 2nd-year graduate students anyway, leveraging those students' experiences and expertise by funding one or more graduate students to lead Compass-like programs may be a powerful way to disseminate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[           The Compass Project, a program at the University of California &ndash; Berkeley, focuses on working toward equity in the physical sciences. The program was founded by physics graduate students to help incoming first-year students&mdash;particularly those from groups underrepresented in the physical sciences&mdash;forge a physics identity and community. Compass, now a decade old, has won a national award from the American Physical Society. But even the most successful programs cannot simply be "exported" to other universities, because each university is different in terms of student population, size and culture of the physics department, and local resources and expertise. We undertook this project to explore (i) the resources and techniques through which Compass helps students and (ii) how some of those insights might inform a similarly-intentioned but differently-structured program at the University of Maryland.        The most pervasive theme emerging from this research is the importance of students? developing community and a sense of belonging in the program and/or the physics department more widely, where "community" is defined not just by social ties but also by shared intellectual norms and sense of purpose. We found that, in the Berkeley Compass program, the intellectual community was defined largely in terms of shared commitment to collaborative sense-making about physics. By contrast, in the Maryland program, the intellectual community centered around participation in authentic physics research through placements in professors? labs.  In both cases, though, doing physics&mdash;making sense of ideas, solving difficult problems collaboratively, contributing to the generation of new physics knowledge&mdash;was central to students? developing a sense of belonging in physics.        In order to help leaders, instructors, and research mentors associated with programs for first-year physics students, we explored both the supports and the challenges students experienced as they engaged in "doing physics." We lack space here to summarize everything we found, but a few key results stick out.
