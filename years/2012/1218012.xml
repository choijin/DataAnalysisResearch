<AbstractNarration>Energy impacts all aspects of society.  Much of the U.S. electrical energy consumption occurs unnoticed due to the ubiquitous nature of electronics that improves and enhances our standard of living.  For example, according to the US EPA Report to Congress, the electricity costs of data centers used by our cell phones and computers amounted to $4.5 billion dollars in 2006 -- the equivalent of 15 power plants. This proposal develops a transformative technology that reduces the power consumption of electronics by a factor of three.  The core of the technology is based on a theory applied to the timing of logic and communication elements on an integrated circuit, where signals can travel up to the speed-of-light in the given medium. The primary result of this funding will be to develop circuit, software (computer-aided design), and design technology that will enable this low power technology to be moved from scientific laboratories into commercial products.  The relative timing theory will be mapped onto the current commercial design and validation flow, using formal proofs of correctness for the translation.  This is what will enable fast commercialization of the technology.  A new ultra low power circuit family will be developed based on exhaustive behavioral investigations.  This family can likewise be technology mapped to current fabrication libraries used by the foundries.  Finally, a factor of three reduction in power as well as the ability to rapidly build commercial products will be demonstrated through the design and fabrication of a complex system-on-chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary impact of the work is the reduction of energy used by our ubiquitous electronics.  The impact of energy usage has worldwide ramifications.  Electronics have had an exponential growth in energy consumption over the last decade.  The energy consumed by integrated circuits already pose a considerable impact on the economy and environment in terms of CO_2 emissions.  The research performed by this grant will continue to improve U.S. technology leadership and competitiveness.  The technology transfer to industry will also create hundreds of jobs and provide taxable revenue.  This research has significant collaboration and support from industry, including direct interactions with Texas Instruments, Intel, Mentor Graphics, and ON Semiconductor.  This work builds on the strong research foundation of the University of Utah.  The University has a strong record of outreach to increase the engineering student population.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research achieves a two to twenty fold power reduction in digital electronics.  Semiconductor devices are ubiquitous today.  Integrated circuits impact all aspects of our lives, in areas as diverse as communication, transportation, business, and entertainment.  The novel technology developed in this National Science Foundation funded grant achieves massive power reduction without impacting performance or manufacturing cost in nearly every application.  To put this into perspective, if this technology were instantly implemented in your cell phone, you would get nearly a week between charges rather than a day.  Likewise, if applied to microprocessors in data centers in the U.S., over $6 billion dollars of electricity usage and its associated emissions would be eliminated.  This federal funding specifically helped mature this technology and make it ready for commercialization by funding the development of electronic design automation to reduce design time and design correctness, to help design new speed-of-light communication on an integrated circuit with transmission line implementations, and to implement and demonstrate the technology through designing an example system.  The microprocessor implemented on our example system-on-chip design consumed less than 10% the power of the same design implemented with today's current methodology.  This funding has resulted in five U.S. patents, and the technology has been licensed to a startup company for commercialization.
