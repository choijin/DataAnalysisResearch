<AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of the research is to understand the process of speciation, in which one species splits into two, often through the evolution of multiple forms of reproductive isolation.  The project focuses on reproductive isolation that occurs because of differences in the timing of major life cycle events, a widespread and potentially major impetus for speciation when differences in time of reproduction restrict gene flow.  In a multi-pronged approach that applies high-throughput DNA sequencing, genetic mapping, population genomic analysis, metabolic profiling and field experiments the research will examine the genetic basis of life cycle variation and temporal reproductive isolation in the European corn borer moth (Ostrinia nubilalis), and evaluate the consequence of these differences in preventing gene flow between populations in nature.  These experiments will provide a rare glimpse into the role of temporal isolation in origin of new species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although a superb model for speciation, the European corn borer is also a major pest of corn and other crops, costing the United States ~$1B each year.  By leveraging the moth as an organism of both scientific and economic interest, the research builds community partnerships to simultaneously promote basic scientific discovery, public understanding of the relevance of evolution in daily life, and sustainable agriculture.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The abundance and patterns of life on Earth depend on the origin of new species, and thus the process of speciation has become one of the most intriguing problems in biology. Species are thought to arise as populations become genetically distinct and individuals change in physical appearance, physiology, or behavior.

The European corn borer (ECB) moth is an exciting organism for study because multiple barriers combine to influence reproductive patterns. Each barrier to reproduction allows for some interbreeding, but the two strongest involve behavior and ecology. In Europe and North America, females release, and males preferentially respond to different sex pheromones. Mating choice differences lead to a partial behavioral barrier to reproduction between &ldquo;E&rdquo; and &ldquo;Z&rdquo; pheromone strain populations. At locations in the Northeastern U.S., pheromone strains also differ in the physiological timing of overwintering diapause. This leads to an ecological barrier to reproduction because mating occurs during different times of the growing season. Z-strain adults mate mid-season in late July and have only a single generation of offspring. E-strain adults mate earlier in June and their offspring then produce a second generation at the end of the season in mid-August. At still other locations in the U.S., moth populations share mate preferences and are Z strain, but differ in seasonal timing.

This leads to an ecological barrier to reproduction because mating occurs during different times of the growing season. Z-strain adults mate mid-season in late July and have only a single generation of offspring.
