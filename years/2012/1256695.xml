<AbstractNarration>Different species have different degrees of specialization between their cells, genes, and organs. Understanding the evolutionary origins and genomic underpinning of this functional specialization is critical to understanding the diversity of life on Earth and the implications of division of labor for complex systems. This project will investigate functional specialization in a group of marine invertebrate species with some of the most extreme divisions of labor, the siphonophores. Siphonophores are made up of hundreds of specialized bodies that each perform particular tasks, such as feeding or defense. The investigators will measure gene activity in multiple types of specialized bodies in twelve species of siphonophores, and characterize the anatomical differences between these bodies. Evolutionary analyses will indicate which genes have shifts in activity that are associated with shifts in the division of labor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test general hypotheses about the evolution and impact of the division of labor in complex, integrated organisms. It will also develop new statistical methods and computational tools that will enable evolutionary analyses of gene activity in other species. In addition, this grant provides support to produce new animations that communicate findings to a broad audience (posted at http://creaturecast.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There is great interest in understanding the role of the evolution of gene expression (a critical component of gene activity) in the evolution of other traits including development, morphology, and physiology. Most previous work on the evolution of gene expression has focused on a large number of genes in a small number of laboratory species, or a small number of genes that have been characterized across diverse species that cannot be grown in the laboratory. New DNA sequencing tools make it possible to describe the expression of many genes in organisms that cannot be grown in the laboratory. This will make it possible to identify which genes have shifts in expression that are associated with evolutionary changes in other traits, including many traits of great interest that are not present in any laboratory species. For these tools to be successfully deployed, though, it is critical that comparisons of gene expression across species be pursued using phylogenetic analysis methods that explicitly model evolutionary changes in expression and other traits.<br />This project had three specific aims. In aim 1, this project &nbsp;built new analysis methods and software tools for the phylogenetic analysis of gene expression. These tools were released as open source software. In aim 2, this project tested the ortholog conjecture. This is the hypothesis that genes that diverge due to speciation will be more similar than genes that diverge due to duplication. It has important implications for how we understand gene evolution and predict the function of poorly known genes based on studies of better known genes. In contrast to studies that did not use phylogenetic approaches, we found no support for the ortholog conjecture.&nbsp;<br />Aim 3 of this project focused on gene expression and the evolution of a unique group of animals, the siphonophores. A fundamental feature of life is functional specialization- the division of labor between cells, tissues, organs, and even whole organisms. One of the most interesting cases of functional specialization is in the siphonophores, a group of jellyfish that are among the most abundant large organisms in the open oceans and include the longest animals in the world. Each siphonophore is a colony, made up of hundreds to thousands of genetically-identical bodies that all bud from a single embryo. The bodies in a siphonophore colony are specialized for different tasks such as feeding, locomotion, and reproduction, and are organized into precise species-specific patterns within the colony. This project collected gene sequence and gene expression data across multiple siphonophore species. These data were used to investigate the distribution of stem cells in siphonophores to learn how the new functionally specialized bodies are added, to test hypotheses about the relationships of siphonophore species, and to compare expression across different functionally specialized body types.<br />This project also produced animations about siphonophores and other marine animals. These animations were distributed at CreatureCast.org and the New York Times. The project also trained undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs in siphonophore biology, phylogenetic methods, and gene expression analysis.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/11/2017<br>      Modified by: Casey&nbsp;W&nbsp;Dunn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1256695/1256695_10237198_1499791534339_Apolemialanosa--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1256695/1256695_10237198_1499791534339_Apolemialanosa--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Apolemia lanosa, a newly described species of siphonophore"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1256695/1256695_10237198_1499791534339_Apolemialanosa--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Apolemia lanosa, a newly described species of siphonophore"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This portion of the the siphonophore Apolemia lanosa includes red feeding and digestive bodies, as well as the stem and tentacles.
