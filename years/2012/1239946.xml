<AbstractNarration>The Tampa Bay Robert Noyce Master Teacher Fellows (MTF) program is a partnership between the University of South Florida (USF), Hillsborough County Public Schools (HCPS), and Helios Education Foundation (HEF).  The project is recruiting and selecting 20 content knowledgeable mathematics and science teachers with a proven track record of effectiveness who participate in a program for developing teacher leaders. Selected Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) participate in a jointly developed Teacher Leaders for Student Learning graduate certificate program, a four-course sequence that examines the links between teacher leadership, job-embedded professional learning, and student learning.   MTFs also participate in a Teacher Leader Academy, a two-year  professional development program designed to enhance their mentoring and leadership skills so they can support mathematics and science programs at both institutions. The Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) assume leadership roles within their schools and school district enabling them to mentor and support beginning and veteran inservice teachers. In addition, the MTFs support prospective mathematics and science teachers at USF by serving as mentors, supervising teachers, guest presenters, and co-instructors in preservice courses. This project builds capacity within the Tampa Bay Educational Partnership (TBEP) by training highly effective mathematics and science teachers to become teacher leaders who support prospective, new, and veteran teachers as they implement new standards for mathematics and science.  Mathematics and science teachers, supported by MTFs, are influencing the STEM pipeline significantly as they teach the approximately 200,000 students in HCPS.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, over the course of the years in which the Master Teacher Fellows executed individual professional development plans, they demonstrated increasing ability to (a) foster a collaborative culture, (b) use research to improve practice and student learning, and (c) promote the use of assessments and data for school and district.  Broader Impact   The Tampa Bay Educational Partnership (TBEP) includes a minority serving university (the University of South Florida- USF) and the eighth largest school district in the nation (Hillsborough County Public Schools- HCPS). Both institutions serve large and diverse student populations of both African American and Hispanic students. Mathematics and science teachers, supported by the Master Teacher Fellows, influence the STEM pipeline significantly as they teach the approximately 220,000 students in the school district.

In an era when teaching and teachers have come under fire, the successes of the Master Teacher Fellows have contributed to school reform in the TBEP, and this project has become an example to ignite such reform across the nation.  The result of the investment of this project in the human capital of teacher leaders is that the benefits to this project do not end with the funding.  The Master Teacher Fellows have demonstrated their ability to improve STEM teaching and learning in the district over the life of the project, and they are equipped to continue their content-specific teacher leadership  throughout the rest of their careers with Hillsborough County Public Schools.
