<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;There are currently no compact, short-pulse (&lt; 10 ps) mid-IR laser sources.  The proposed research will investigate the suppression of spatial hole burning as a means to achieve a self-starting, short-pulse quantum cascade laser (QCL) source. The PI will analyze the parameter range that would achieve stable operation, based on a conceptual gain structure. This simulation will yield a deeper understanding of the physics of coherence in such engineered structures. Preliminary concepts of the structure, derived from earlier concepts that achieved pulsing, but that could not self-start, were recently developed by the PI.  The device would be based on the concept of interleaved gain and quantum coherent absorbing periods, which can be fabricated during controlled growth of the QCL laser structure.  This interleaving should achieve suppression of deleterious continuous waves and favor stable pulsed operation. The quantum coherent absorption is expected to provide robust mode-locking of the laser source as drive parameters are varied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory research will set the design space for a new pulsed QCL structure, which is a needed tool for multiple medical and sensing applications. Indeed many species of interest have strong spectral signatures in the mid infrared. This timely research will also be a good platform for student training.  Additionally, this effort will leverage the NSF MIRTHE Center, centered in Princeton University, which develops QCLs and explores their applications; the MIRTHE center has the necessary equipment to experimentally verify the theoretical results obtained under this proposal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The technical purpose of this award was to theoretically demonstrate the possibility of using the self-induced transparency (SIT) effect to stabilize active modelocking in quantum cascade lasers and to work with our experimental partners at UMBC and Princeton to demonstrate stable active modelocking.  The theoretical demonstration was completely successful and led to several meeting presentations, a published paper, and a patent disclosure.  A figure that shows this stability is included.  However, our experimental partners never attempted to carry out an experimental demonstration because they were busy with other projects.  As promised in our EAGER proposal, we submitted a full proposal to NSF that would have supported the experimental research, but this proposal was declined.  In other work, not anticipated at the time of our proposal, we demonstrated that it is possible to use the SIT effect to create short pulses in a two-section laser in which the absorbing and gain regions are physically separated.  This work has led to a meeting presentation and a patent disclosure.  We expect to prepare a paper on this result for publication.  From a theoretical standpoint, the project was successful, but it has not yet led to an experimental demonstration.  We continue to have discussions with our experimental colleagues, which have included Dr. Razeghi (Northwestern), Dr. Capasso (Harvard), as well as Dr. Johnson (UMBC) and Dr. Gmachl (Princeton).  In other impacts, one of the purposes of this project was to continue a highly successful collaboration with Dr. Talukder at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.  This collaboration has continued, and we are already looking at joint projects unconnected with quantum cascade lasers, including in particular projects that are focused on biotechnology.  Another purpose of this project was to support a female graduate student, who had carried out the preliminary work, demonstrating the feasibility of our technical concept.  Unfortunately, the student decided for family reasons to discontinue her graduate studies.  We have continued to support a graduate student (male Iranian) to work on quantum cascade lasers; however, he has focused on explaining existing experimental results on transport phenomena that have been obtained by the research group of Dr.  Johnson (UMBC).  It did not seem appropriate to involve another graduate student in work on modelocking without experimental data.  In other impacts, we also noted in our proposal that the development of a short pulse quantum cascade laser would have important biomedical and environmental sensing applications.  We still believe that to be true.  Finally, I note that my last EAGER grant --- awarded by Larry Goldberg over 20 years ago --- led to a prediction of self-similarity in stimulated Raman scattering that was not verified experimentally until four years ago.  Once verified, it turned out that this work has potential applications to the generation of high-energy short pulses.  I am hopeful that this EAGER grant will similarly lead to important experiments in the long term.          Last Modified: 01/22/2014       Submitted by: Curtis R Menyuk]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
