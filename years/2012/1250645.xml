<AbstractNarration>The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program is the successor to the Trustworthy Computing (TC) program.  With the increasing importance of cybersecurity to the nation as a whole, and to the Foundation as a research area, improving communication between program officers and researchers supported by NSF and other government funding agencies, coordination among PIs from the different perspectives sponsored by SaTC, and outreach to the broader community is increasingly important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SaTC program provides national visibility with the participation of the Social, Behavioral, and Economics (SBE) Directorate, the Office of Cyberinfrasture (OCI), the Mathematics Division of the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS), and the Engineering Directorate (ENG) in addition to the Education and Human Resource (EHR) directorate. It is arguably the largest single research program in CISE. Across the Foundation, the FY expenditure is estimated to be greater than $100M. There are currently over 500 active awards in the program. The PI meeting will be a large, major event for the Foundation and the community. For this event there is a pressing need to meticulously plan and organize the technical program, the venue and conference logistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding for the venue and conference logistics, including conference registration, audio visual, and meeting space.</AbstractNarration>
