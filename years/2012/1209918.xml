<AbstractNarration>This action funds Elias James Garratt of Western Michigan University to conduct a research project, entitled "Influence of substitutional impurities on molecular bond state and distribution within nano-crystalline diamond films," during the summer of 2012 at Kyushu University in Fukuoka City/Fukuoka/Chikushi Campus.  The host scientist is Dr. Tsuyoshi Yoshitake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to ascertain the influence of impurities introduced under different conditions on overall and specific nano-crystalline diamond film properties. By developing an understanding of how impurities introduced under such conditions affect film properties, it may be possible to refine nano-diamond materials for technological application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

Open, direct communication of scientific ideas and advances which will be shared through the connections made during this project  will serve to strengthen international scientific bonds between the US and Japan in the coming years, and augment the capabilities of both communities.     A summary of the direct outcomes of this project follows. A control (or reference) nano-crystalline diamond film and films implanted with chromium (Cr) to a high fluence (1016 ions/cm2) were successfully prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) method for characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cr implanted films were found to contain distinct regions of implanted ions, corresponding to theoretical calculations of implantation depth, as well as a structure and microstructure different from that of the reference sample as determined by AFM, electron energy loss spectroscopy (performed using TEM machine) and bright and dark field imaging. A loss and subsequent recovery of the surface microstructure of the Cr implanted films was determined by AFM. Characterization of the lower fluence (1011 ions/cm2 Cr implanted) samples is planned to complete this study.     As a immediate result of the expanded communication between the PI and the host, resource sharing between groups has expanded to include sample characterization by ion beam analysis at the PI's home institution. Additionally, the PI has applied to become a direct member of the host's research group through an initiative supported by by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the Postdoctorall Fellowhship award. If successful, this award will result in a greater collaborative effort to investigate the mechanisms behind photoluminesence by metal ion implantation in diamond.
