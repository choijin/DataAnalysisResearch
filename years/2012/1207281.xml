<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diamond has an unusual property known as negative electron affinity (NEA) that allows it to act as a solid-state source of electrons when illuminated with ultraviolet light. The combination of diamond's NEA with its outstanding chemical stability allows it to be used as a solid-state source of electrons operating under non-vacuum conditions, even able to directly inject electrons into liquids. The proposed research supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program, will investigate the factors controlling the efficiency of electron emission into liquids such as water and tetrahydrofuran.  Research efforts will focus on understanding the materials factors that control the electron emission process and identifying conditions that will increase electron emission with a broader spectrum of excitation wavelengths and on enhancing the stability of NEA. Methods to be explored include doping with phosphorus or nitrogen, and manipulation of the electrochemical double-layer at the diamond-electrolyte interface. These measurements will provide fundamental new insights into factors that control the efficiency and stability of photoelectron emission under non-vacuum conditions. This research could enable new technological applications in several fields of science and technology such as improved field-emitter displays and enable new types of chemical transformations in liquids. The project will support training and mentoring of students, including undergraduates and high school students, and efforts to engage with state legislators and other decision-makers to inform about the societal impact of scientific research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emission of electrons from solid materials underlies many existing technologies such as computer displays. Most materials require high temperature and high vacuum conditions in order to emit electrons and therefore cannot be used in water and other liquids. However, diamond, even when used as inexpensive thin films and/or commercial-grade diamond powder, has the unusual ability to emit electrons into liquids at room temperature when illuminated with ultraviolet light, although with relatively low efficiency. This project will explore several different approaches to improving the ability of diamond to emit electrons into liquids. If this work is successful it could lead to improved computer display technologies and to new, energy-efficienct ways to initiate important chemical reactions, including transformation of inexpensive starting materials into more useful products, such as liquid fuels. The project will support training and mentoring of students, including undergraduates and high school students, and efforts to engage with state legislators and other decision-makers to inform about the societal impact of scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research supported under this project demonstrated that illumination of diamond in water and other aqueous media leads to emission of electrons into the liquids. Diamond surfaces have long been known to be excellent electron emitters in vacuum due to the unique electronic structure of diamond,  which allows it to directly emit electrons when illuminated with ultraviolet light.  While diamondÆs ability to emit electrons into vacuum were known for many years, project personnel performed the first experiments showing that diamond can also readily emit electrons into water and other aqueous media. Electrons in water  can be surrounded by water molecules to form a unique entity known as the "solvated electron".  Project personnel showed that solvated electrons are able to initiate novel chemical reactions, including the conversion of nitrogen into ammonia and the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide.   These electron emission characteristics were found on various types of diamond, including very inexpensive synthetic diamond thin films and in commercial diamond powder commonly used as industrial polishing grit.  Solvated electron in water can be detected directly by their ability to absorb red light at wavelengths of approximately 700 nm but had not been previously observed definitively from electrochemical reactions.  Project personnel demonstrated the ability to detect these solvated electrons through spectroscopic techniques and investigated how the structure and properties of the diamond impacted the ability to emit electrons into water through measurements of the solvated electrons and through their ability to convert nitrogen  to ammonia.  Project personnel showed that there is a direct correlation between diamondÆs ability to emit electrons into vacuum and into liquids,  thereby establishing a close link between vacuum-based and liquid-based investigations. Further investigations identify improved methods for enhancing electron emission by using diamond thin films grown by chemical vapor deposition processes and by modifying the surface of diamond to introduce positively charged chemical groups, thereby encouraging electrons to migrate from the bulk to the surface, from which they could be emitted.  The project also provided outstanding training opportunities for graduate  and undergraduate students.  Students were involved in virtually all aspects of the project, including carrying out research activities, mentoring younger undergraduate and K-12 students, and disseminating the results of the research to the public through active participation in several types of outreach activities. Project personnel worked with talented high school students and burgeoning 8th grade scientists on individualized research projects as a way to educate the general public about science and to nurture interest in chemistry and other sciences. At least one discovery formed the basis of a submitted patent application.  The ability to induce novel chemical transformations in an energy-efficient manner has myriad potential technological applications if the efficiency of electron emission can be improved.  Project personnel also provided significant leadership to the scientific community by organizing international conferences in the diamond area, and by providing leadership to the broad scientific community on the importance of surface and interfacial phenomena.
