<AbstractNarration>PI: Amos, Delaina &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Louisville&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The need for innovation in high-efficiency lighting devices has been recognized for some time.  Solid-state lighting devices have the potential to increase two- or more fold over the efficiencies of the best conventional lighting technologies available today. Even though there has been significant progress with solid-state device technology based on single crystal semiconductors, there is still a large need for developing such technologies utilizing inexpensive materials and processes. Organic-inorganic composite lighting technology offers such possibilities in terms of both materials and processes; however, the current state-of-the-art technology is limited by low efficiencies. This BRIGE award proposes to develop new materials, processes and fundamental understanding necessary for transformational advances with light emitting diode (LED) devices based on organic-inorganic composite materials.  The objective is to develop novel quantum dots (QDs), QD/ligand chemistry and conductive polymers (CP) for use in hybrid organic-inorganic LEDs.  Another objective of this project is to investigate the use of inkjet printing and other scalable techniques for the thin film deposition of the multi-layer device. Specifically, the project will focus on the following four directions: (1) synthesis of novel QDs made using earth abundant and less toxic elements; (2) functionalization of QDs and investigation of the QD-CP interface in terms of device performance; (3) use of inkjet deposition to lay down the QD and polymer layers in discrete red, green and blue sections to produce white light; and (4) fabrication and testing of LED devices in terms of energy conversion and light emission efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed broadening participation plan includes the following objectives (1) to create and disseminate a traveling history of lighting display with an accompanying video targeted at regional K-12 students; (2) to create a half-day Engineering school-wide undergraduate and graduate research symposium; and (3) to develop curriculum for a new graduate course entitled "Quantum Dots and Lighting." In addition to research and curricular integration outcomes, the PI plans to focus on various activities for increasing graduation and retention rates for underrepresented minorities in the STEM areas.  Long-term societal impacts will be to elevate the awareness of renewable energy challenges, goals and emerging lighting technologies at the K-12, undergraduate and graduate levels as well as to increase graduation and retention rates for this target population. Technological impacts will include new scalable processing techniques leading to lower cost LED lighting and significantly improved environmental impact and lighting energy efficiencies relative to traditional lighting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The need for innovation in the area of cost efficient low-energy lighting devices has been recognized for some time.  Solid-state lighting devices have the potential to increase two- or more fold over the efficiencies of the best conventional lighting technologies available today.  The proposed project will design and build new materials for integration into a White-Light Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Quantum Dot light emitting diode (LED).  Precursors to this hybrid device have received attention in recent years as one of the most promising technologies to overcome current challenges in realizing cost effective LED or organic light emitting diode (OLED) lighting.  These challenges include creation of new materials and device structures to create stable white-light OLED devices with improved efficiency, drive voltage, and color that are scalable for low-cost production.   Intellectual Merit:  This work involves the synthesis and characterization of ligand attachment to cadmium selenide (CdSe) quantum dots at low temperatures which have prepared to enhance charge transport in hybrid quantum dot light emitting devices. Three different types of ligands, oleic acid, 1,4-Benzenedithiol and 4-Mercaptobenzoic acid, were used to engineer the device hole transport-emissive layer interface through the use of functionalized CdSe quantum dots.  The synthesis is carried out via a hot injection process at the lower synthesis temperature of 140&deg;C compared to the conventional hot-injection synthesis temperature of ~300&deg;C. Fluorescent, monodisperse quantum dots of size 3-5 nm and 8-10 nm have been obtained at an aging time of two and three hours, respectively. Fabrication of a Quantum Dot Light Emitting Diode (QLED) has been carried out and the optimization of the layers shows that the coffee-ring effect may be important for emissive layers.  The hybrid structure contained here utilizes the polymer (Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) as the hole transport layer.  Device charging is also shown to have a negative impact on quantum dot emission and lifetimes.  Inkjet printing of the quantum dot layer was also demonstrated and devices were fabricated using inkjet printing, spin coating and a multilayer thermal evaporative system for deposition of the layers.  Broader Impacts:   As part of this project, we planned and executed the first Annual Engineering School-wide Undergraduate Research Symposium at the J.B. Speed School of Engineering at the University of Louisville.  This was the first school wide symposium of its kind that was targeted at freshman and sophomores.  The symposium was an overwhelming success based on student and participant feedback and plans were made to continue this symposium with additional school wide input and resources.  In addition, a traveling lighting display on the history and implementation of different light techniques was created across a timeline beginning with the discovery of the incandescent light bulb up to and including LEDs and OLEDs.  This display was targeted at middle school and high school audiences and was developed to be both robust and portable for maximum viewing opportunities, particularly in schools and other community resources.  Finally, a specialized course was developed and taught on the research area including findings of this work.  This course entitled, "Quantum Dots and Light Emitting Materials: Advanced Materials for Solid-State Devices" was target at senior and graduate students and involved an interactive modular format that involved student led discussions on major topics of interest.
