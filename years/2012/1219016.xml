<AbstractNarration>The massive growth in the number of images being generated today has fostered a new direction in computer vision research. Images today are almost never generated independently, rather manifest as collections. Therefore, instead of thinking of images as individual entities, we now need to consider images within a group that may have significant correlational structure. Yet, formalizations of several fundamental image analysis tasks such as image segmentation, for the most part, still consider one image at a time. This project makes the case for exploiting this shared structure for understanding content in images. It develops an efficient framework which permits the segmentation of images at a group level and therefore is applicable to various scenarios in which visual data typically presents itself. The primary objective is to design a comprehensive system that addresses all aspects of this problem -- from preconditioning the input using training data, to providing powerful segmentation models that take the group structure into account, to building dictionaries which can then be used to effectively segment a set of related images. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a vehicle for engaging undergraduates to become immersed in research during the semesters and full-time in summers. Students are exposed to and participate in state-of-the-art research in computer vision which furthers their understanding of these topics and stimulate their intellectual curiosity. This can significantly increase the possibility of these students choosing to pursue higher studies in computer science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The identification of constituent components or segments in an image (e.g., foreground and background) remains a fundamental issue in computer vision. In recent time, rapid growth in availability of cheap acquisition devices has led to massive image collections, both in public domain as well as people?s private libraries. Significant shared content is pervasive in such collections; for instance, multiple images of the same object, individuals, or landmarks in a vacation album. People clearly love taking pictures, and this leads to what we may call a collective ?interconnected? image corpora. Whether processing video sequences, editing vacation pictures, analyzing longitudinal medical imaging data, or recognizing the same object in an image ensemble, it makes sense that the low level processing must take the inherent ?group? structure into account. In this project, we studied this shared structure problem in images from an algebraic viewpoint formulating such shared structure as the common subspace shared by a set of images. Using this novel formalization, we proposed new combinatorial algorithms to inform the process of segmentation with a) advice gleaned from an ensemble of similar images and b) expertise already expended in the form of figure/ground labeling of similar images, which can be used for training our models to perform efficiently on related images.    Intellectual Merit: We developed several algorithms and implementation to extend the idea of segmentation and object detection for image ?groups?. In a publication in  ECCV 2012, we developed new algorithms to analyze and exploit the joint subspace structure of a set of related images to facilitate the process of concurrent segmentation of a large set of images. We showed that various desirable properties of such an algorithm (ability to handle multiple images with multiple objects showing arbitrary scale variations) can be cast elegantly using simple constructs from linear algebra: this significantly extended the operating range of such methods.
