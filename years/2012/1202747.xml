<AbstractNarration>Local to Global (L2G) is a project conducted by the Lawrence Hall of Science (the Hall) and the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (BSL), both divisions of the University of California, Berkeley.   The proof-of-concept project seeks to merge two display systems - the Active Earth Display kiosk from the NSF-sponsored Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) and the Science On a Sphere (SOS)Â® from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - to tell compelling local seismic stories in a global context. The project is creating a model for using local seismic events, data, and research to develop public understanding of key geoscience concepts. Seismic activity has a motivating immediacy - people want to know more when something happens (or could happen) that impacts their lives. As a phenomenon the public is already aware of, this is a springboard to learn how local seismic events fit into the global picture of seismology. Science centers like the Hall and research facilities like BSL are both actively sought out by the public and the press when questions arise about seismic events. By linking two real-time data display systems, the public will have a tool to delve into the science behind current seismic events that pique interest and questions. L2G will build on the Hall's earlier work using large-format scientific data visualizations to promote public understanding by encouraging visitors to look for patterns, make predictions, and compare their findings to scientists' findings. This model will be disseminated to existing networks, including over 70 SOS institutions with the infrastructure to support its implementation.</AbstractNarration>
