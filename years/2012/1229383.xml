<AbstractNarration>This award for a rheometer is expected to strengthen ongoing research at James Madison University focusing on the characterization and applications of soft materials through detailed rheological measurements.  The rheometer can be configured to provide temperature control, visualization, and extensional, interfacial, concentric cylinder, and large particle rheometry.  The instrument will directly lead to the training of undergraduate research assistants and will serve as an interdisciplinary tool in a variety of research projects focusing on the interplay of physical, chemical, and rheological properties of soft materials.  The rheometer will serve as a shared resource at JMU's Center for Materials Science, which is composed of twenty faculty affiliates from six disciplines actively engaged in materials research. The four co-PIs will specifically conduct rheological examinations on novel self-assembled colloidal materials, flow dynamics of emulsions and foams, characterization of polymer nanocomposites, and jamming behavior of particulate suspensions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meaningful undergraduate research opportunities and active faculty mentoring are hallmarks of the educational philosophy at James Madison University.  Fundamental and applied research will be conducted with undergraduates as primary participants.  While largely a research tool, the rheometer will also be used as the basis of a laboratory experiment for an upper-level course on materials characterization.</AbstractNarration>
