<AbstractNarration>This project will plan a national study of recent and long-term trends in social mobility between generations in the United States. The National Research Council will ask scientific experts to write papers that explore survey design, instrument choice, variable choice, and analytical approach. These papers, together with discussion at the associated workshop, will inform a published summary. A second meeting of a smaller group will evaluate ideas aired at the workshop, discuss next steps, and begin writing a proposal for the new study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. is often understood to be a "land of opportunity" in which everyone can express their talents and meet their material needs. Thus, the public might imagine that the U.S. regularly monitors trends in intergenerational mobility, ensuring that policy makers and citizens know how much opportunity there is and how fairly it is distributed. That is not the case. Four decades have passed since the last large-scale national mobility survey, yet American society is vastly changed. The nation has seen increased income inequality, an altered industrial and occupational structure, rising immigration, changes in racial and ethnic composition, more complicated family structures, and changes in education and training. The effects of these changes should be assessed in a large-scale study of social mobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two large national surveys, in 1962 and 1973, provided the first reliable evidence on social mobility, led to new methods for measuring mobility, encouraged comparable surveys in dozens of countries, and ultimately changed the national conversation on the extent of mobility and how it might be increased. A third national survey may prove equally influential for research and policy in the coming decades.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[On June 10, 2013, the National Science Foundation sponsored an expert meeting at the National Research Council's (NRC) Keck Center in Washington, DC that was convened to consider options for a design for a new national survey on social mobility. At the meeting, top experts in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences presented and discussed a series of nine concept papers addressing the main problems that must be solved in developing a new survey protocol.   A summary of the workshop was been published by the National Academy Press, Developing New National Data on Social Mobility: A Workshop Summary (2013). Papers from the workshp have been published in the Annals of American Academy of Political and Social Science (January 2015).   Three follow-on meetings of the steering committee which featured a discussion of approaches to developing survey/administrative data on the subject were held at the NRC Beckman Center in Irvine, CA in August 2013, March 2014 and August 2014.  The steering committee heard from Census Bureau experts who proposed a mixed administrative, decennial Census and from survey-based data system and experts in matching and linking data files. As a result of these NSF-funded meetings, the National Research Council (NRC), through its Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT), now proposes to oversee the creation of the American Opportunity Study (AOS), a novel, durable, large-scale, national resource for studies of educational, occupational, and economic mobility across and within generations.
