<AbstractNarration>High-throughput sequencing has been producing millions of protein sequences without solved structures and functional annotations, which raise demand for computational tools especially user-friendly web servers for protein structure and functional elucidation. This project will transform RaptorX, a popular protein structure modeling web server, to one that can also annotate functions of a protein sequence and the quality of a theoretical protein model in the absence of the corresponding native structure. The resultant new server will greatly facilitate the interpretation and proper usage of a theoretical protein model, just like what E-value does for homology search. The server will also predict functions of a protein sequence with coverage beyond what can be reached by native-structure-based methods and accuracy much higher than sequence-based methods. Ultimately, the project will deliver a long-term sustainable cyber-infrastructure for protein sequence, structure and functional analysis that enables transformative biological and biomedical research. This project will also advance protein structure and functional prediction by developing several sophisticated computational methods for model quality assessment and functional prediction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proteins play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Complete description of protein structures and functions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life. This project will benefit a broad range of biological/biomedical applications, such as the study of plant metabolic pathways, drug design, and bio-energy development. The research results will be communicated to the broader community through a variety of venues (wiki, talks, papers and posters). The software will be freely available to the public. Since its first release in August 2011, RaptorX has processed dozens of thousands of protein modeling and analysis jobs for more than 3500 users around the world. After the new RaptorX is implemented, it will contribute much more to the broader community. This project will also contribute to computer science by studying machine learning problems inspired from protein bioinformatics. This project shall enrich and disseminate knowledge on protein bioinformatics, machine learning and web programming. It will also train minority students, future K-12 science teachers and nationwide students in the Illinois online bioinformatics program. All involved students will receive training in the intersection of computer science, molecular biology, biophysics, and biochemistry. The research results will be integrated into course materials, which will be used in the classes and also freely available to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project has significantly improved RaptorX, a web portal for protein structure and functional prediction. Thanks to the support of this grant, RaptorX now yields more accurate predictions than before and has a better user interface. In particular, RaptorX provides the following web services: 1) template-based 3D structure modeling of a protein sequence and model quality assessment; 2) template-based modeling of binding site and residues of a protein sequence; 3) prediction of protein structure properties including secondary structure, solvent accessibility and disorder regions; 4) contact prediction of a protein sequence and contact-assisted protein folding and 5) contact prediction and contact-assisted folding for membrane proteins.</p> <p>As evaluated by CASP12 in 2016 and the live benchmark CAMEO (http://www.cameo3d.org/), RaptorX is one of the most accurate fully-automated web servers for template-based protein structure modeling. RaptorX is also the best web server for protein contact prediction and contact-assisted protein folding. It can predict much more accurate contacts than the other servers and the contacts predicted by RaptorX can fold many proteins without any good templates in PDB. In the past 6 years, RaptorX has accumulated more than 38,500 worldwide academia and industry users and processed more than 233,000 jobs. RaptorX users also include middle- and high-school students. The standalone programs underlying RaptorX have been downloaded by more than 2100 worldwide users and integrated to currently popular protein structure prediction pipelines.</p> <p>This project has resulted in more than quite a few peer-reviewed journal and conference papers. The research results have been presented as highlight and keynote talks at various venues including universities, international conferences and workshops such as University of Washington, Michigan State University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Amazon, RECOMB, ISMB, CASP, ECCB, NIPS, IJCAI, IEEE BIBM, and ACM-BCB, and IEEE ICCABS. The audience includes academia and industry people with background in computer science, statistics, biology and physics. The RaptorX server papers are also highly cited and our recent membrane protein contact prediction paper is featured by Cell Systems. Our work was also reported by Science and The Economist.</p> <p>This project has trained a number of graduate students, postdocs and summer interns (including two women graduate students and 1 woman undergraduate). Through working on this project, they have received training in the intersection of machine learning, mathematical modeling, computing techniques, web development, biological sciences and communication skills.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/05/2017<br>      Modified by: Jinbo&nbsp;Xu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262603/1262603_10245854_1509943932455_RaptorXFrontPage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262603/1262603_10245854_1509943932455_RaptorXFrontPage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="new RaptorX front page"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262603/1262603_10245854_1509943932455_RaptorXFrontPage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="new RaptorX front page"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The front page of the RaptorX web portal.
