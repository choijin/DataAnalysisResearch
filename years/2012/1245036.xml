<AbstractNarration>Software quality is a crucial issue due to industry's general lack of knowledge of Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) benefits and the shortage of V&amp;V practitioners. This project improves software education at the undergraduate level and enhances on-the-job professional training, thereby increasing the pool of professionals with V&amp;V knowledge and skills. The project team consists of an academia-industry collaboration involving seven academic programs and four industry partners, and possesses experience in software development, course development, and project management. The project team is critically examining the existing V&amp;V course at Robert Morris University, enhancing and modularizing selected topics, and improving delivery strategies by incorporating academic research findings and industry best practices. The cogent modules and strategies developed are being assessed, evaluated, and shared among project participants and disseminated to other institutions through an NSF supported centralized repository (NSDL), conferences, publications, professional societies, and websites. Students and practitioners are being equipped with fundamental theoretical knowledge and invaluable hands-on experiences that are measurably increasing their ability to contribute to the industry.</AbstractNarration>
