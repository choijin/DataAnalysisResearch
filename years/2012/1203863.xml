<AbstractNarration>Large-scale atmospheric circulation systems affect the geographic distribution of precipitation in western North America, yet little is known about how these systems may have varied before the instrumental period of the last 150 years.  The main goal of this project is to reconstruct the history of precipitation in Alaska during the last thousand years using ice core records of snow accumulation.  The researchers plan to collect several new ice cores from the Mt. Hunter Plateau in the Alaska Range of Denali National Park and the new ice cores will be combined with an existing spatial array of ice cores in the region to map changes in the spatial patterns of precipitation.  Because changes in atmospheric circulation patterns caused by ENSO and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) affect where the precipitation falls, this spatial array of ice cores will provide a record of how these larger scale climate systems have varied during the last thousand years.  The project will focus on determining the differences in the precipitation patterns at the Little Ice Age (approximately 200 to 600 years ago) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (approximately 800 to 1,200 years ago).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will evaluate how changes in the climate state affect atmospheric circulation and precipitation.  In addition the project includes K-12, undergraduate and graduate education activities, and, in conjunction with the National Park Service, the development of an interactive display showing the climate history of the region and the history of glacier advance and retreat in Denali National Park.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objectives of our collaborative research, involving Dartmouth College, University of Maine, and University of New Hampshire, were to:  1) Produce the first high-resolution record of central Alaskan snow accumulation over the past millenium through the collection and geochemical analysis of new ice cores from Mt. Hunter plateau (3900 m elevation) in the Alaska Range (Denali National Park);  2) Evaluate to what extent the suite of North Pacific ice core accumulation records are representative of regional precipitation and atmospheric circulation patterns over the instrumental period; and  3) Compare model-based and proxy-based reconstructions of North Pacific climate during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climatic Anomaly     Intellectual Merit:  The combination of high annual accumulation rate (~1.4 m water equivalent per year), mean annual temperature of -17&deg;C, the collection of two parallel surface to bedrock ice cores, and high resolution glaciochemical analyses facilitate the development of an extraordinary, annually dated 1200 year long record.  This makes the Denali ice core record the best dated and longest annual resolved ice core record in the North Pacific region.  Analysis of this detailed ice core record has advanced knowledge of North Pacific paleoclimate in several ways:  1. Our results demonstrate that precipitation in the Alaska Range has reached unprecedented levels relative to the last 1200 years. Nearly all of this increase has occurred during the last two centuries in the winter, reflecting an intensification of the Aleutian Low to its strongest levels of the past millennium.  2.

Broader Impacts  Our research project had broad benefits to society, including:  1. Serving as a highly successful platform for introducing graduate and undergraduate students to polar climate research on a socially relevant topic.  Over 30 students, including several women and underepresnted minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines from Dartmouth, University of Maine, and University of New Hampshire have taken part in field work with this project and many more have assisted with laboratory work and research.   2.
