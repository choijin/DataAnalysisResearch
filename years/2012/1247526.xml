<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1247526&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Emami-Neyestanka, Azita&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal explores a new class of microelectrode arrays, Instead of having one large chip that gets connected to the electrode array via a dense cable, many tiny low-cost chips that form a complete system are distributed over a foldable substrate along with the electrodes. The location of the chips and the electrodes will be optimized through the design of the origami structure. The electronic chips will have efficient capacitive sensors that not only can determine the proximity of the chips, but also help to reconfigure the chips/sensors to establish optimum communication links between the chips. The origami structures will have a number of important properties, they: 1) can be folded (e.g. rolled into a cylindrical shape) for insertion into the human body through minimally invasive procedures; 2) will self-deploy when they are released within the human body; 3) will take up unique curved shapes that precisely match the organs to be stimulated.</AbstractNarration>
