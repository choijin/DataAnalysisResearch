<AbstractNarration>Advances in microprocessor technology have been the main engines for growth in the computing industry for decades. Microprocessor performance has improved at a remarkable rate for many years owing to technological and microarchitectural innovations. Unfortunately technology scaling has reached an impasse in recent years. Significant challenges with the chip manufacturing process in low-nanometer dimensions are causing high variability in transistor behavior leading to lower performance, higher power consumption and higher susceptibility to errors. In general, high variability leads to larger design margins making chips less energy efficient. These technological challenges are happening at a time when the need for energy efficient computing is greatest. With the rapid proliferation of cloud-based computing and the explosion of smart mobile devices energy efficiency is now crucial to the entire range of computing markets from servers to smartphones. Achieving continued performance growth in these systems going forward requires dramatic improvements in the energy efficiency of computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this work, new microarchitectural and software solutions for lowering design margins in future chips are being developed, achieving substantial energy reduction while ensuring reliable operation. These solutions employ variation-aware design across multiple layers of the computing environment including microarchitectural innovations, new firmware and operating system-based scheduling and power management solutions. New technology models that for the first time integrate multiple sources of variability are being developed for this purpose, enabling the design of variation-aware solutions. The work identifies new reliability challenges that affect supply voltage stability in chips with large numbers of compute units such as many-core and graphics processors. It develops novel process and voltage variation-aware scheduling and power management algorithms that reduce voltage instability eliminating the need for large and inefficient design margins. At the microarchitectural and firmware levels the work develops new mechanisms for dynamically reducing voltage margins by leveraging on-chip resiliency mechanisms to ensure reliable and efficient execution. These solutions are dramatically improving the energy efficiency of computation and are therefore expected to have a significant impact on the computing industry and society in general.</AbstractNarration>

Building chips with these minute transistors is likely the most significant manufacturing challenge humans have ever undertaken.     The work conducted as part of this project has addressed the challenge of designing faster and more energy efficient microprocessors under the most adverse technological challenges our industry has ever faced.      One of these challenges is increased sensitivity to voltage fluctuations. These fluctuations are caused by abrupt changes in power demand triggered by processor activity variation with workload. If the voltage deviates too much from its nominal value, it can lead to so-called ``voltage emergencies,'' which can cause timing and memory retention errors.

Another significant challenge microprocessors face is high process variation which is caused by increasing challenges with manufacturing transistors at very small feature sizes. Process variation leads to heterogeneity in transistor delay and power consumption within processor dies.  In general, process variation also requires larger design margins making chips slower and less energy efficient.

Finally, we developed a novel approach to lowering the voltage margins of existing processors such by leveraging resiliency solutions already built into these chips.     Our results show that by simultaneously addressing both process and voltage variability enables 30-40% improvements in energy efficiency or CPUs and GPUs.
