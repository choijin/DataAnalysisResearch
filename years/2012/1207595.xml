<AbstractNarration>Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-rays probe the most energetic non-thermal processes known in astrophysics, and provide a wealth of information regarding magnetic fields, shocks, radiation fields, and energetics in the source environment. VHE gamma-rays also enable research in fundamental particle astrophysics, including the study of candidate locations of high concentrations of Dark Matter and direct, sensitive searches for Lorentz Invariance Violation in the lepton sector. This umbrella award will continue support for the VHE gamma-ray astronomy research groups at the University of Utah (UU).  The UU VERITAS group will carry out continuing observations and data analysis from the VERITAS Imagining Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescope array, the world's most sensitive VHE gamma-ray observatory. An upgrade of the VERITAS cameras, led by the UU VERITAS group, will be installed and commissioned in mid-2012. This upgrade will result in substantial increases in sensitivity, and allow exploration of the energy regime below 100 GeV.  The UU HAWC group will participate in the construction, commissioning, and operations of the HAWC Observatory, which is currently under construction near Sierra Negra, Mexico. The HAWC observatory will employ an array of 300 large Water Cherenkov Detectors deployed at high altitude that record the charged particles generated by VHE gamma-rays in the Earth's atmosphere. The group will perform synergistic, coordinated observations between VERITAS and HAWC, once the HAWC observatory is fully operational. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This award will strengthen the UU VERITAS and HAWC groups' existing EPO initiatives on the local, state, and national level. During the past three years, the groups have developed and are now operating the Willard Eccles Observatory (WEO), at Frisco Peak, Utah. This robotic telescope performs multi-wavelength science observations and also provides public observing time to universities, colleges, and high schools throughout Utah. The groups have developed STEM outreach through mentorship of two high school FIRST robotics teams, and developed a statewide FIRST robotics program.</AbstractNarration>

The increase light detection efficiency of the camera, combined with the Field Programmable Gate Array trigger, has resulted in a substantial improvement of the faintest gamma-ray visible by VERITAS, reducing the triggering threshold from 150 GeV to approximately 85 GeV.&nbsp; Using the improved camera, we have increased the distance (redshift) over which distant galaxies can be observed.&nbsp; We have observed the intermediate Bl Lac active galaxy RGB J 2243 +203 (redshift &gt; 0.39) and the flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1441 +25 with a redshift z=0.94 (emitted when universe was less than half its present age). The observation of high energy gamma-rays from distant sources like RGBJ 2243 +203 and PKS 1441 +25 constrains the formation rate of the universe&rsquo;s first stars.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Utah group designed, constructed and deployed the high speed signal cable system for the construction of the HAWC observatory. HAWC was commissioned during the duration of the grant, and the second HAWC northern sky catalog of TeV sources was released in April 2016. This catalog identifies a number of standard very high energy gamma-ray sources,&nbsp; and&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;a number of new gamma-ray &nbsp;sources.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Utah group developed a laboratory technique measuring high-speed correlated fluctuations in optical light to reconstruct synthetic images of simulated stars and binary stars. This technique uses high speed light sensors spaced at various separations. Rapid &nbsp;light intensity fluctuations in each light sensor are recorded with &nbsp;high speed (&gt; 250 Mhz) electronics. The image of the star or binary system is using a specialized 2-dimensional inverse Fourier transform algorithm. This technique may allow widely spaced arrays of optical telescopes (VERITAS) to generate high resolution images of individual stars, binary stars, and exoplanets.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Utah group has pioneered the matched Runs Method (MRM) analysis technique, which substantially increases the sensitivity of VERITAS to extended, diffuse sources of very high energy gamma-rays. The MRM analysis technique was validated by comparing results with standard analysis results on various known gamma-ray point sources and also with modest angular extent (diameter &lt; 0.5 degree) sources. &nbsp;&nbsp;MRM provides sensitivity to large angular extent sources, similar to many of the unidentified sources discovered in the Second HAWC catalog. MRM can also be used to reanalyze all historical VERITAS data to search for extended, diffuse sources of high energy gamma-rays which would not have been detectable using the standard VERITAS point-source analysis techniques.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Utah gamma-ray group has discovered the presence of speed-of light particles moving horizontally through the HAWC observatory. These particle tracks occur at rates of several tens of events per second, and may occur as parallel tacks of two or three simultaneous tracks. They are most likely due to high energy muons being created by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere.

Our multi-wavelength, long term analysis of LS1 +61 303 reveals a significant correlation between the very high energy gamma ray emission observed by VERITAS, and the X-ray emission observed by the SWIFT satellite.
