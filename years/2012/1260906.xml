<AbstractNarration>The Cascade Topology Seminar will hold its 49th meeting the weekend of December 1-2, 2012 in Eugene, Oregon within the University of Oregon's Fenton Hall.  The basic goals of the Cascade Topology Seminar are to provide for frequent contacts between workers in similar fields, to facilitate local mathematician's keep abreast of recent developments in Topology, Geometry and related fields by bringing in speakers from outside the region, to enable graduate students and early career topologists in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Canada to hear, consult, and possibly collaborate with the outside speakers and members of other institutions, and to provide an opportunity for local people to lecture on their own work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the CTS is designed in part to keep its participants abreast of recent developments in their own and related fields, no attempt is made to limit the topics covered in the lectures.  However, the interests of the various organizers tend to be mirrored by the interests of the speakers, thus, the lectures usually concern algebraic, geometric, or low dimensional topology, differential or algebraic geometry, or combinatorial group theory.  The Seminar also coordinates its activities with the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar and the Western States Geometric Topology Workshop with whom joint meetings have occasionally been held.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General information on the Cascade Topology Seminar can be found at http://www.pdx.edu/math/cascade-topology-seminar&lt;br/&gt;Specific information on the Dec1-2, 2012 meeting can be found at http://pages.uoregon.edu/sadofsky/cascade12f.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Cascade Topology Seminar met semi-annually throughout the four year grant period (an initial three years plus a one year extension) at various Universities in the US Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Canada.  The Seminar provided intellectual merit through the  creation of frequent contacts between workers in similar fields, by allowing practitioners to keep abreast of recent scientific developments through the solicitation of speakers and experts from outside the region, and through the enabling of undergraduate and graduate students, post-docs, University faculty and industrial topologists in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Canada to hear, consult, and collaborate with the outside speakers and with practitioners from other institutions, in addition to providing opportunities for local practitioners in academia, industry, and government to lecture on their own work.  Broader impacts of the Seminars activities include fostering the participation of women, early career practitioners and members of traditionally underrepresented groups in the Seminar?s activities and the broader scientific enterprise through dedicated participant support, and through active efforts to recruit practitioners from these afore mentioned groups into presenter and consultant roles.     The Cascade Topology Seminar is designed in part to keep its participants abreast of recent developments in their own and related fields, thus no attempt was made to limit the topics covered.  However, the interests of the various organizers tend to be mirrored by the interests of the presenters, thus, the presentations at the Seminars usually concerned algebraic, geometric, or low dimensional topology, differential or algebraic geometry, or combinatorial group theory.  The Seminar also coordinated its activities with the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar and the Western States Geometric Topology Workshop, with whom joint meetings have occasionally been held.     Recent topics covered in Seminar presentations include triangulations, twist knots and the uniform thickness property, right-angled Coxeter polytopes, hyperbolic 6-manifolds, geometric representatives of homology classes in the space of knots , four manifold topology, finite group actions in Kervaire manifolds, locally symmetric spaces, the cohomology of symmetric groups, metrics on manifolds with large volume and spectral gap, Properties of the Alexander polynomial and knot Floer homology, higher real K-theory spectra ,the bo-Adams spectral sequence, the simplicial EHP Sequence in A1 algebraic topology, Calabi-Yau categories, the Floer theory of a cotangent bundle, and string topology.
