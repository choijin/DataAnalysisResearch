<AbstractNarration>Neodymium (Nd) isotopes are increasingly used in paleoceanographic studies as "quasi-conservative" water mass tracers. However, the limitations of this proxy are not yet fully understood. The proposed work aims to address this uncertainty by critically evaluating the behavior of Nd isotopes as tracers of water mass mixing. The project, led by researchers at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, will analyze in-hand seawater and surface sediment samples collected along a meridional transect in the southwest Atlantic (0 to 50 degrees S) during a GEOTRACES cruise. The sample suite will be used to test 1) whether Nd isotope ratios deviate from expected values for mixing along circulation transport paths, 2) whether Nd isotopes behave quasi-conservatively away from continental margins, 3) whether seafloor features (e.g., continental shelf, volcanic seamounts) add significant external Nd to the system, and 4) whether the Southern Hemisphere wind zones impact Nd isotope values through aeolian deposition. The relationship between Nd isotopes in authigenic surface sediments and those in the overlying seawater will be calibrated for the first time.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By testing an emerging tool in the study of past ocean dynamics, this research will enable a more accurate understanding of changes in the ocean-climate system. The project will support an early-career researcher and a graduate student. Undergraduate students will be involved through an NSF-supported summer internship program at LDEO.</AbstractNarration>

Changes in ocean circulation play a critical role in changes in global climate, and there is a lot of effort among scientists to understand the relationships between ocean circulation and climate. Because old seawater cannot be measured directly, in order to determine how the oceans operated during different climate states in the past, scientists measure "proxies" for ancient seawater, that is, element concentrations or element ratios, or isotope ratios, that trace different aspects of the oceans in the past, derived from deep sea sediments (the approach requires figuring out the time when the sample formed).     In order to be able to trace changes in ocean circulation through time, it is critical to understand how ocean circulation proxies behave in the oceans in the present-day. The isotopes of the rare earth element ?neodymium? (chemical symbol Nd) have been increasingly used as a proxy to trace past ocean circulation, based on observations in the modern ocean that its composition varies by location and depth in a manner that enables the ?fingerprinting? of water masses, and because over long distances the Nd proxy appears to trace water mass mixing. Over the past decade, studies have increasingly focused on the impacts of processes that would alter the true water mass mixing signal. As a consequence, the assumption that the Nd proxy traces ocean circulation in the past is increasingly challenged. This is because Nd could be added locally by sediment eroded from the continent, and local additions would interfere with the global ocean circulation signal.     In order to apply any ocean circulation proxy, it is important to know its limitations. The project critically tested the behavior of the Nd proxy in the oceans in a manner that will clarify its value as an ocean circulation tracer. The southwest Atlantic is the best place to perform this test, based on the configuration of water masses there.     This project focused on testing the integrity of the Nd proxy in a north-south transect in the southwest Atlantic from the equator to the Malvinas/Falkland Islands, collected on a cruise by the British research vessel James Cook.
