<AbstractNarration>This project, developing a systematic methodology for the design of multi-fingered robotic hands and grasping devices for a desired kinematic task, represents a novel formalization of the kinematic synthesis of articulated systems as a tree structure. The kinematic task is to be defined as positions and higher motion derivatives of the fingers, with accelerations related to the contact geometry at the fingertips for grasping actions. This research team aims to develop multi-fingered grasping devices for human-robot and anthropomorphic tasks, however the method will be a general tool for the design of any kind of multiple-finger grasping device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has a number of broader impacts affecting both the academic community and society at large. First, the project will directly result in a design tool for multi-fingered robotic hands to enable the automatic transformation from task specifications to design alternatives ? an important development in its own right. This design tool will increase the ability of industry to design high performance, cost-effective multi-fingered robotic hands and other end effectors. This directly impacts manufacturing by speeding the development of end-of-arm tooling, with secondary benefits to the cost and quality of the final product. This will assist the U.S. to maintain its leadership and encourage the creation of high-quality jobs. The proposed curriculum additions resulting from this project will produce competent engineers for industry with a greater ability of approaching and solving design problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NRI-Small: Collaborative Research: A Design Methodology for Multi-fingered Robotic Hands with Second-order Kinematic Constraints  Summary      The goal of this research was to develop a systematic methodology for the design of multi-fingered robotic hands for a desired kinematic (physiological) task. The task was defined as positions and higher-order motion derivatives, related to the contact geometry at the fingertips for grasping actions. The hypothesis is that part of the complexity of performing a grasping and manipulation task can be assigned to the hand during the design process, thus making robotic hands more successful in performing these actions. In this tool, a set of simultaneous tasks for grasping and manipulation can be specified for hands end-effectors, to obtain a hand design able to perform the defined tasks. The developed methodology results in a general tool for the design of any kind of multiple-finger grasping device. The final product was implemented in an open-source software package. Several designs for human-hand tasks were developed and tested. The proposed systematic methodology opens the door for a great variety of designs for multi-fingered grippers based on kinematic tasks.      The completion of the proposed research resulted in the following series of outputs:   Methodology to integrate the design of several fingers and the specification of grasping and manipulation tasks;  Incorporation of contact conditions in the kinematic synthesis formulation of robotic hands for object grasping;  Novel results on the design of robotic hands with control of the allowable in?hand manipulative actions that ensure that the object motion will be kept in the desired directions;  Numerical solution techniques to be used for any multi-fingered robotic hand;  Open-source implementation of the methodology to create design equations and obtain numerical solutions;  Automatic design implementation of the solutions in commercial CAD software;  Development of a Robot Operating System (ROS)-based environment for automatic testing of grasping actions.       The researchers expect this deliverables to lead to the following future key outcomes:   Increase in the diversity of designs for multi-fingered robotic grippers, especially of non-anthropomorphic grippers designed for anthropomorphic tasks; Improvement in the performance of multi-fingered grippers for tasks implying grasping and manipulation of grasped objects; Metrics and methods to assess the performance of robotic hands for grasping and in-hand manipulation actions; Mechanical multi-finger hand prototypes used in industrial tasks for object grasping and manipulation.            Intellectual Merit     The design of robotic hands has been limited for now to fixture-like gripers, two or three-fingered hands and anthropomorphic hands. However the design possibilities of mechanical devices to manipulate objects is not limited to this. The intellectual merit of this grant is to lay the foundations for applying systematic design methodology to this problem.      The formalization of the kinematic synthesis for articulated systems with tree structure (multiple end-effectors), is a new development. Results of the PIs indicate that this technique extends the application of the finite-position synthesis to articulated systems with a high number of degrees of freedom, such as the human hand. In addition, theoretical results regarding the non-redundancy of tree-like systems for coordinated tasks were derived. First-order kinematic constraints were related to potential finger motion around the finger contact points, to yield designs with specific surface-contact characteristics. The use of second-order kinematic constraints led to new results in the number of fingers required in order to perform grasping actions, as well as new findings in the area of dexterous manipulation, based on characteristics of the grasped object, as well as on synthesis of grasping actions.     Broader Impacts      The research resulted in a design tool for multi-fingered robotic hands to enable the automatic transformation from task specifications to design alternatives. The decisions made on concept selection have a significant impact on the cost and quality of the final product. The design tool increases the ability of industry to design high performance, cost-effective multi-fingered robotic hands. This will assist the U.S. to maintain its leadership and encourage the creation of high-quality jobs. The proposed curriculum additions at the collaborating universities is expected to produce competent engineers for industry with a greater ability of approaching and solving design problems.
