<AbstractNarration>This project provides scholarships to approximately 50-65 full-time, academically talented and financially disadvantaged STEM students in Biological Sciences, Computer Sciences, Engineering, Mathematical Sciences or Physical Sciences at Los Medanos College. Project objectives include: (1) increasing the number of underrepresented minority students in STEM majors who meet their degree and transfer requirements; (2) graduating or transferring at least 75% of STEM scholars within three years; (3) providing robust programmatic infrastructure to ensure increasing success rates within the STEM scholars cohort;  and (4) expanding and enriching learning and career placement opportunities by requiring  STEM Scholars to participate in professional development activities  such as career exploration, job shadowing, mentorships, internships, and research activities. The project is collaborating with the existing MESA program to provide the necessary student support services for the scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project increases the numbers of traditionally underserved, low-income STEM students who obtain STEM degrees and/or transfer to four-year universities as STEM majors. Results from a number of project components could be informative for the larger academic community in its efforts to ensure student success. Project findings are also advancing the understanding and knowledge of innovative teaching and learning practices for working with motivated, academically talented, low-income STEM students. Finally, the project is contributing to local economic development by providing a skilled STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>72 Individual Students (11% more than proposed) were Awarded a total of 132 Scholarships(14% more than proposed). The demographics of these students included: 14% African American,18% Asian, 31% Latino, 36% Caucasian, 1% Other or Undeclared; 50% male and 50% female.Awards for LMC S-STEM Scholarships ranged from $1,000 - $7,500 each with the majority (58%) at $5,000 or above, followed by 29% between $2,000 - $3,999 and 10% between $4,000 - $4,999. The grade point average (GPA) of STEM Scholars in Fall 2017 was 3.45 (3.69 for Asian students,3.47 for African American students, 3.45 for Caucasian students, 3.44 for Latino students and 3.12 forother/undeclared students). A total of eight STEM Scholars (6%) left the program. Of this total, six students became ineligible for the program, three because of poor academic performance, three because they became part-timestudents. Two students left the program for reasons unknown. As of&nbsp; spring 2018 we had a total of 49 graduates; whichis 68% of STEM Scholars. Based on remaining students current course successes and progress intheir educational plans, 15 additional students are on track to graduate in 2018-19, which would bringthe number of transfers/graduates to 64 students (89% of STEM Scholars, 14% higher than proposed). As of fall 2017, 32 (44%) of the STEM Scholars had transferred to four-year universities as STEM majors. While two other students have been accepted to transfer schools, they were unable to transferdue to family circumstances. Moreover, 15 Scholars have been accepted to universities to transfer before the end of the project in fall 2018. This is a total of 47 Transfers, (65% of STEM Scholars).An additional 13 Scholars are on track to transfer in 2018-19, which would bring the number oftransfers to 60 students (83% of STEM Scholars, 8% higher than proposed).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Nicole&nbsp;Trager</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
