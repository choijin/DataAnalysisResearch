<AbstractNarration>This project is increasing Rutgers University's capacity to produce highly trained information assurance (IA) professionals by developing new interdisciplinary degree programs at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. A unique aspect of the effort is that it addresses the dependability of the information and information services, as well as the big data and cloud computing infrastructure, in an integrated manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the investigators are developing three new degree tracks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) A graduate-level interdisciplinary concentration in IA is being created by leveraging the recent creation of a Professional Science Master's Program that offers a Master of Business and Science (MBS) degree. Because it includes business and management training as well as technical training, the MBS degree is particularly well-suited for training current and future professionals to ensure that information assurance is considered at all stages of IT system development and deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) An IA track in the MS program offered by the Computer Science Department is being created. This track allows students looking for a traditional CS degree to receive an in-depth education in IA and to obtain a degree that recognizes this specialized training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) IA tracks in the BS programs offered by the Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) and Management Science and Information Systems (MSIS) departments are being created. These degrees are well-grounded in their individual disciplines but also expose students to IA courses from other departments to ensure that the students develop a broad interdisciplinary perspective on IA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are organizing several workshops to disseminate ideas and results of the curriculum-development activities. They are also hosting a summer camp in IA for high school students, which provides additional outreach as well as a recruitment opportunity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project for enhancing the capacity for information assurance education through interdisciplinary collaboration at Rutgers University has worked over the past three years (2012-2015) to develop programs, which leverage the extensive resources available across RutgersÃ†s many schools and departments to provide comprehensive education packages that unite the many facets of Information Assurance (IA).   Through the numerous efforts described in its annual reports, this project achieved its success. Particular emphases over the years included developing the IA concentration in various education programs, organizing IA related workshops for professional training, and applying for both National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Research (CAE-R) and National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education.   As a major achievement, in 2015, the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security have designated Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Research (CAE-R) as well as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education through academic year 2021.  NSA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) jointly sponsor the National Centers of Academic Excellence in IA Education (CAE/IAE), IA 2-year Education (CAE/2Y) and IA Research (CAE/R) programs.  The goal of these programs is to reduce vulnerability in our national information infrastructure by promoting higher education and research in IA/CD and producing a growing number of professionals with IA/CD expertise in various disciplines.   Also, this project has enabled the opportunities for the development of various workshops. For instance, the workshop "Information Assurance in Big Data Era" held at Rutgers University allows exposing IA students to the broader IA community of researchers and industry people. In addition, through the collaboration with the Rutgers DIMACS center, a number of relevant workshops associated with the special focus on cybersecurity have been organized during the course of the project. These workshops can help the IA professional to exchange education as well as research ideas.   Finally, this project has helped strengthen several master programs with an additional IA concentration. For example, the project has enabled a new concentration on information assurance in the Master of Information Technology program in the Management Science and Information Systems department.
