<AbstractNarration>The proposed work will investigate the potential of carbon-14 in ice cores as an absolute dating tool, as a tracer of the past cosmic ray flux and as a recorder of the past fossil fraction of the global methane budget. Cosmic ray particles produce carbon-14 from oxygen-16 directly within near-surface glacial ice and firn. This in-situ produced carbon-14 quickly reacts to form 14C-containing carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane in the ice matrix. Some or all of the resulting 14C-bearing gases may be lost from the firn to the atmosphere. The proposed work will provide a thorough characterization of in-situ cosmogenic 14C in glacial firn and shallow ice in the Summit region of Greenland. It will examine the retention of cosmogenic 14C in ice grains at all depth levels in the firn column, the partitioning of 14C between carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane, as well as the production rates and accumulation of cosmogenic 14C in shallow ice below firn close-off. A thorough understanding of cosmogenic C-14 in firn and shallow ice will likely enable the use of C-14 in ice for one or more of the following applications:&amp;#8232;&lt;br/&gt;1) If a relatively large amount of cosmogenic 14C is present in ice below the depth at which air bubbles become sealed off, it will be useful as a tracer for past cosmic ray flux. The investigators believe that this is the likely case for 14C-carbon monoxide. &lt;br/&gt;2) If the amount of retained in-situ-produced 14C-carbon dioxide is relatively small compared to 14C-carbon dioxide from trapped air, the study will demonstrate the validity of using 14C-carbon dioxide for absolute dating of ice cores; this has long been a target of ice core studies.&lt;br/&gt;3) If the amount of retained in-situ-produced 14C-methane is relatively small compared to 14C-methane from trapped air, the study will demonstrate the validity of using 14C-methane in glacial ice for determinations of the fossil fraction of the past methane budget, including releases from methane clathrates.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will establish a new international collaboration between University of Rochester (UR) and University of Bern and result in novel laboratory and field analytical systems. The data from the study will be made available to the scientific community and the broad public through the ACADIS data service. One graduate student will be trained at UR, and one postdoc and one graduate student will be partially supported at Oregon State University. Three UR undergraduates will be involved in fieldwork and research. The work will support an early career scientist. All of the investigators will continue to participate in public outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall objective of this project was to characterize the production of 14-C in snow and ice by cosmic rays (referred to as "in situ" production) and its partitioning in to different chemical species (carbon monoxide [CO], methane[CH4], carbon dioxide[CO2]).  By doing this the potential of in-situ cosmogenic 14CH4 (methane) in ice cores for reconstructing the past cosmic ray flux and dating ice will be explored, but the primary goal is to evaluate the potential of using 14CH4 in glacial ice for studies of the past methane budget. If cosmogenic 14CH4 content is either insignificant or can be corrected for, ice core 14CH4 would be demonstrated to be the best tracer for quantifying the fossil fraction of the past CH4 budget, including releases from methane clathrates.  The Oregon State University portion of the award focuses on firn modeling and analysis of methane and carbon dioxide concentrations in collected ice cores, and detailed study of the processes that take place at the firn/ice transition. In addition, OSU staff participated in field work, and supplied analytical equipment used in the field research.  The primary outcome of the work is the most detailed study of how gases are trapped in the polar firn to date.  The data show that the air content of ice in the bubble close off region is layered,  High density winter layers trap air higher in the firn column than low density summer layers. Methane concentrations are and-correlated with air content, because higher air content layers have trapped air for a longer time period and therefore contain older air, which has lower methane concentrations because of the anthropogenic increase in methane.    Layering in the firn is likely to be a common phenomenon and the description provided by this work should provide a framework for interpreting all gas data from ice cores.   The award also contributed to the training of two graduate students and one post doctoral researcher, providing experience with both field and laboratory techniques.
