<AbstractNarration>1226353   &lt;br/&gt;Baru&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Geoinformatics award to the University of California San Diego (PI: Baru) supports a three year development project that is collaborative with Arizona State University (PI: Arrowsmith).  The project plan will improve upon and refine the capabilities of the OpenTopography Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data services web portal that was previously jointly supported by NSF/EAR, NSF/OCI and NSF/CISE (EAR-0930731/EAR-0930643).   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OpenTopography (OT) was designed to allow users web-based access Lidar generated high resolution topographic data sets and analysis tools in support of surface Earth process research, research training and education.  This award will develop OT2, an extensible interface and platform that will allow scientists to develop and plug in functional modules, and a scalable system that will allow archive growth and computer services provided by cloud computing modalities.   OT2 will expand capabilities to handle full waveform LiDAR, TLS data and bathymetric data.  OT2 will continue to ingest extant airborne LiDAR and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data sets from numerous sources beyond airborne LiDAR and TLS data sets produced by continued and expanding use of the National Center for Airborne Laser Swath Mapping Facility (NCALM) and the UNVACO hosted TLS instrument pool.   Hosted data now at OT includes also airborne LiDAR data sets flown for EarthScope science projects, Critical Zone Observatories, NOAA, US Bureau of Reclamation, USGS, Bureau of Land Management, the US Forest Service and numerous state airborne LiDAR data sets.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, OT hosts some 200 billion LiDAR returns and thousands of pre-computed digital elevation models (DEMs) and Google Earth readable kmz files.  OT management has documented high volume use of the web portal.  There are over 1,500 registered users, the site gets between 5,000 and 25,000 page view per month and more than 12,000 automated job runs have accessed over 250 billion LiDAR returns.  OT PIs also report that more than 35,000 pre-computed DEM tiles have been downloaded and over 70 Gb of Google Earth imagery is streamed per month.  The user base is approximately 22% students, 27% academic researchers, 24% government scientists and 15% commercial sector.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Since the funding of this award (OT2) in April 2013, OpenTopography has seen dramatic growth in data (200 billion lidar points to over 978 billion; plus significant regional and global raster datasets), users, and number of jobs run. OpenTopography has also been mentioned in several publications as a top source for free GIS data and is widely recognized in the research community as a premier source for high resolution topographic (especially lidar) data. The OpenTopography community grew more than 10 fold from 1500 to over 16,104 registered users, with countless other guests processing data. OpenTopography is considered the premier lidar data access system and has enabled 255 peer reviewed publications, and 46 other publications (reports, theses, etc), through data access, online data processing, and the education and training materials available. From a 2015 survey, OpenTopography users self identified as students (18%), researchers (23%), educators (15%), public sector (18%) and private sector (26%).<br />&nbsp;<br />As of April 2017, the OpenTopography data catalog consists of 235 lidar point cloud datasets covering 200,820 km2 primarily in the U.S., with data also in New Zealand, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Haiti, Australia, China and Brazil among others. This represents a considerable increase from the 36 datasets and 28,000 km2 available four years ago. We have also added access to Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 30m/90m and ALOS Global Digital Surface Model global datasets, as well as pre-computed DEMs to accompany most of the lidar point cloud datasets.<br />&nbsp;<br />During OT2, we enhanced the OpenTopography data curation process. Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) were implemented (via California Digital Libraries EZID). All hosted datasets are now assigned a persistent DOI, which enhances data citation and facilitates long term archiving of data. The OpenTopography data catalog is also exposed as an OGC Catalog Service (CSW - ISO 19115(Data) metadata standard); the CSW endpoint is federated by data.gov, EarthCube CINERGI and Thomson Reuters Web of Science, enabling broad discovery of OpenTopography data.<br />&nbsp;<br />Recognizing that there are many high resolution topography (HRT) datasets not hosted by OpenTopography (e.g., held by state or local agencies or universities), we developed the Community Contributed Data Registry allowing registered users to submit a polygon and associated metadata (including distribution) about a dataset. This community-populated HRT data catalog increases visibility of available data and is the first step towards making OpenTopography a one-stop-shop for HRT data.<br />&nbsp;<br />OpenTopography also provides a tool registry and an open source code repository - important knowledge resources. The Tool Registry is a community-populated clearinghouse of software, utilities, and tools oriented towards high-resolution topography data handling, processing, and analysis. There are 51 registered tools that range from source code and scripts to full-featured commercial software applications. OpenTopography is built on open source software, and actively contributes to open source efforts. OpenTopography has a GitHub presence where an open source distribution of the Points2Grid (P2G) DEM software along with other project-related software packages are available. P2G is recognized as a valuable community code and has been forked, updated, and merged into the US Army Corps CRREL supported Point Cloud Data Abstraction Library and the open source lidar2dems.<br />&nbsp;<br />A major OT2 effort has been integration of NSF XSEDE HPC resources.
