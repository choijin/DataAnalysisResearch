<AbstractNarration>The proposed antenna system has the potential to allow simple implementation of Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Roadside Infrastructure (V2V/V2I) systems with low-cost, low profile, and enhanced electrical performance.  The antenna system includes specific feed network which  meets the automotive mechanical and manufacturing requirements.  Such feed network allows relatively lower installation complexity for new vehicles during the manufacturing stage and more importantly, it enables aftermarket retrofit, where the antenna system with ground plane independent characteristic allows flexible installation at different positions of the vehicle (i.e. on the roof of the vehicle, in the headliner, or on the dashboard). In essence, the proposed antenna will facilitate the advancement of vehicle safety through communication technologies and contributes to DSRC standards in supporting potentoal vehicle safety implementations especially after the amendment of the IEEE 802.11 standard into 802.11p which regulates the frequency range of 5.85 - 5.925 GHz for DSRC allowing high data rate communications and low power level requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed antenna system is significant to public safety as it will add to the advancement of vehicle safety using Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  ITS aim to streamline the operation of modern vehicles, manage vehicle traffic, assist drivers with safety and other data by providing convenience applications for passengers.  From a commercialization prospective, considering 80 million vehicles enter the market every year, market penetration will strongly influence the effectiveness of V2V/V2I safety and non-safety applications.  Studies have shown that it can take decades to reach 95% DSRC transponder safety device penetration in the global automobile market, even if all new vehicles are equipped during the manufacturing stage itself.  This antenna system will lead to enhanced "V2V and V2I communications" as it is desirable for vehicle antennas to have the lowest possible profile in order to avoid cosmetically altering the vehicle's exterior look and to allow easy and quick installation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report (POR)   1. Project Synopsis The main objective of this NSF project was to study the technology commercialization feasibility for one of the research outcomes of the current NSF award "New Methodologies for System-Level Electromagnetic Compatibility Analysis of Electronic Systems". One noteworthy outcome from the current award was the wire antenna array system for dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure Communications which has been identified as the candidate for "technology commercialization feasibility study" through the I-Corps program. The proposed antenna has potential for simpler implementation with low cost, low profile, and enhanced electrical performance. In essence, the proposed antenna facilitates the advancement of vehicle safety through communication technologies.   From a broader perspective, the proposed antenna system is significant to public safety as it adds to the advancement of vehicle safety using Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

From a commercialization prospective, considering 70 to 80 million vehicles enter the market every year, market penetration was thought to have the potential to strongly influence the effectiveness of vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure safety and non-safety applications.    2. Investigation Team      Name    Institution    Role    Sponsor      Dr. Vijay Devabhaktuni    University of Toledo (UT)    PI    UT      Dr. Mohammad Almalkawi    University of Toledo    Entrepreneurial Lead    NSF/UT      Mr. Lee Cross    Imaging System Tech. (IST)    I-Corps Mentor    IST         Our mentor and our alumnus, Mr. L. Cross, helped us by sharing his contacts. He joined us on the trips to meet with the industry executives and marketing professionals for discussions on cost analysis, intellectual property, licensing, manufacturing, and so forth. Dr. M. Almalkawi led the antenna prototype implementation for demo to industry and investigated the commercial landscape surrounding the innovation through conducting extensive customer interviews and workshop presentations. Dr. V. Devabhaktuni led the I-Corps team and shared the commercialization learning with faculty/students (those without I-Corps grant).    3. Customer Interactions The principal investigator and the entrepreneurial lead from UT teamed up with the I-Corps mentor from IST, Inc. to study the technology commercialization feasibility for the candidate antenna system. Throughout and after the I-corps workshop which was held at Ross Business School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, our team carried out 70+ interviews with potential customers through physical face-to-face meetings; teleconferences; as well as communications via mail.    4. Outcomes of Technology Commercialization Investigation  During the I-Corps workshops at the University of Michigan, we were able to learn several terminologies and concepts required to establish a new start-up business. We also were able to estimate the market size for the candidate antenna system, build our initial revenue models, and define our distribution channels and key partners. After spending six months (July to Dec. 2012) of exploring the commercialization feasibility of the candidate antenna system and after interviewing over 70 potential customers, our decision was NOT to continue further with this product for several reasons as listed below:     There is an interest in our technology from the automotive industry and antenna original equipment manufacturers, however, a viable demand in the automotive market is expected to occur in about 4 to 5 years and research and development is needed to develop a sophisticated product using our antenna so that it can be sold/licensed as an integrated product and not as a separat...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
