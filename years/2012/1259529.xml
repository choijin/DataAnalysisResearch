<AbstractNarration>This project is supporting three cohorts of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need in attaining baccalaureate degrees in electrical engineering at Suffolk University. Scholar recruitment is being done in partnership with the Boston Public High School system, with additional support from local power industries. Cohort-building and developmental activities for scholars build on best practices from other institutions and include a project-based first-year seminar, enrichment and career-development sessions, course-affiliated study groups, faculty and peer mentoring, and internship opportunities. The intellectual merit of the project lies in a cohesive and focused approach to scholar recruitment, retention and career transitions which leverages strong participation by high schools and industry and the supportive community of electrical-engineering students and faculty at Suffolk. The broader impacts include expanding and diversifying the power-industry workforce, as well as providing a well-assessed model for consideration by similar institutions.</AbstractNarration>

Three Boston Public High Schools (BPHS) were partners in this program, and 7 of the 15 scholars came from these schools; 3 came from other BPHS; 1 came from a Boston community college; and 4 came from Massachusetts public schools near Boston. Ten are Latino American, two are African American, three are Asian American, and all identify as male. The criteria were a minimum 470 SAT math score and 2.7 HS GPA, and we slightly relaxed the criteria for two candidates, one of whom (HS GPA of 2.5) was an existing Suffolk student with a GPA of 3.5 and the other (SAT math score of 460) came from a partner school which later closed for weak student performance. Both of those students succeeded in the program, with the former currently working as an electrical engineer/ manager-in-training for a partner company and the latter working as an electrical engineer also from a partner company.

Engagement with other students, along with academic pursuits such as attending study groups and taking remedial math courses, as well as engagement in professional events, compensated for a weaker academic background.
