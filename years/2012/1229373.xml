<AbstractNarration>This MRI grant will help support the development of a particle detector being built by an international collaboration of scientists.  The primary objective for the experiment using this detector is the search for new and exotic forms of matter.  Regular matter is made from protons, neutrons and electrons.  Many other types  of particles are known, but some short-lived particles are predicted to exist from theoretical models of the theory of the strong force, called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). When high-energy photons strike a proton target, many particles are produced, and some of these may be the predicted exotic particles such as glueballs or hybrid mesons.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the process of developing this instrumentation, physicists train students in the use of high-technology equipment and electronics.  Some of these students go on to develop new uses of the technology, such as the diagnostic equipment used in many hospitals, including MRI, CAT and PET scanners.  The economic impact of a highly-trained workforce is well-documented. The development of this equipment will train students with high technology skills that are needed in today's marketplace, while adding to our understanding of QCD.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The forward tagger is a component of the particle spectrometer at Jefferson Lab called CLAS12, which has large angular coverage for particle physics experiments using the accelerated electron beam up to energies of 12 GeV.  The goal of the data collected with the forward tagger is to understand the strong forces between quarks that bind quarks inside strongly-interacting particles.  The strong force is thought to be one of the four known fundamental forces of nature and yet the confinement of quarks inside particles is still poorly understood.  By further exploring the nature of energy-resonances created by scattering electrons from protons (or neutrons) the nature of the strong force can be compared with predictions from the theory of quantum chromodynamics.  The image shown is an example of a test of the forward detector operation, using cosmic rays to hit a portion of the detector and the energy and position of the cosmic ray is recorded by the data acquision computer.  The success of the tests with cosmic rays shows that the detector is ready for operation, and will be installed in the CLAS12 spectrometer in early 2017 for experiments to be conducted in Hall B at Jefferson Lab later in calendar 2017.
