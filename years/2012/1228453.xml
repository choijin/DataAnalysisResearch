<AbstractNarration>Antitrust law prohibits cartels and other anti-competitive practices in order to safeguard consumer interests and promote market efficiency and innovation.  Legal doctrines, theoretical models, and empirical analyses of antitrust traditionally assume "closed" economies, where the boundaries of the market and the nation state coincide.  Yet today, foreign firms often compete in U.S. markets, and exports are increasingly important for U.S. firms.  This project offers a new understanding of antitrust in open economies and gathers extensive new data on antitrust laws and enforcement to allow systematic analyses of the relationship between trade and antitrust.&lt;br/&gt;Two decades ago, less than forty countries had antitrust laws.  Today, more than one hundred thirty countries do.  Strikingly, this rapid proliferation of antitrust laws has coincided with substantial liberalization of international trade, even though trade openness has conventionally been thought to reduce the need for antitrust by increasing market competition.  This raises the concern whether governments are enacting and enforcing antitrust laws with a protectionist bias against foreign producers.  Alternatively, trade openness may require more vigorous enforcement and lead to increased international enforcement cooperation, because open trade creates greater opportunities and incentives for international antitrust violations. &lt;br/&gt;This project examines the trade-antitrust relationship theoretically, as well as empirically by collecting new data on antitrust laws and enforcement (at the industry level over several decades in the United States and in the aggregate for numerous other countries).  It thus provides a stronger theoretical and empirical foundation for the important policy debate over an international antitrust regime.  More broadly, it will improve our understanding of how law mediates the relationship between politics and economics, elucidate the effects of delegating authority to expert bodies in a crucial issue area, and advance our understanding of the political and policy consequences of economic globalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also train graduate students and law students in methods of social science research.  In addition, it will create a database that will be useful to other scholars interested in trade and antitrust, a pressing public economic issue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past three decades, antitrust laws have proliferated across the globe. Today, over 130 jurisdictions have a domestic antitrust law.  Yet we know very little about why countries adopt antitrust laws and how they evolve over time and across countries. We also do not know how these laws interact with other policy instruments. In particular, we have a limited understanding of the relationship between trade liberalization and antitrust laws. Trade economists view trade openness and antitrust regulation as substitutes:  Exposure to foreign competitors, according to this view, makes antitrust law and enforcement superfluous. In contrast, other scholars view trade and antitrust as highly complementary tools to enhance competition.  Yet still others have argued that trade and antitrust are complements, but in a sinister way. According to this view, governments enact or enforce antitrust laws strategically to protect domestic firms from foreign competition, thus undermining the benefits of trade liberalization.  This contentious debate suffers from both theoretical and empirical shortcomings.  First, conclusions of some of the key theoretical models are driven by unstated but problematic assumptions about the political context of antitrust enforcement.  Second, empirical analysis of this question has been impossible in the absence of proper measurement of antitrust laws and enforcement.  This project addresses the gap in the literature by providing a more careful and complete theoretical account of trade-antitrust interaction. It also develops a novel dataset on antitrust laws and enforcement across time and jurisdictions as well as antitrust provisions in preferential trade agreements. These new data capture the variation of antitrust regimes and, for the first time, allows for rigorous testing of alternative hypotheses on the relationship between trade and antitrust law. The emprical results of these analysis will be available in 2017.  This research is crucial for the current, contentious policy debate over the relative roles that trade and antitrust laws play in open economies.
