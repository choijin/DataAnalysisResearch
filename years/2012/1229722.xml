<AbstractNarration>1229722&lt;br/&gt;Van Wijk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation grants support the development of a non-contacting, non-destructive, laser acoustic tomography system for the study of the physical properties of ice cores in support of climate dynamics and glaciological research.   The development will build upon a prototype instrument design but it is hoped that the new instrument components and methods will allow for  differentiation of subtle changes in the distribution of ice crystal size and orientation, fractures, bubble density and particulate matter density along core to enable rapid and automated identification of seasonal layering of glacial ice.  Successful development could enable standard methods for rapid pinpointing of seasonal layering of glacial ice and reduce errors inherent in visual methods and manual thin sectioning and optical characterization of glacial ice physical properties. The proposed development involves testing the robustness of the method for dating ice via its elastic-wave signature and use of the technique in simulated in situ pressure conditions via gas medium pressurization. The technique may have other useful applications beyond studies of glacial ice (e.g., biomedical imaging).  Development will take place in the Boise State University Physical Acoustics Lab and involve Geophysics graduate, and undergraduate students in and outside the classroom at this non-Ph.D. Granting institution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This MRI project developed and tested a novel approach to automatically measuring annual layers in ice cores.  Ice cores contain some of the best climate records available, as the chemistry of the ice can be used to deduce the environmental conditions present when that ice was formed.  One of the challenges to interpreting this record is estimating the age of the ice at each depth.  There are several approaches to developing a depth-age scale for an ice core, using changes in optical, chemical, and electromagnetic properties.  Often this interpretation can be difficult and multiple techniques are used, as there is not one technique that works in all situations.  Current techniques are time consuming and most are destructive.  We developed a new technique that can be automated, using changes in mechanical properties of ice.  A high power laser is used to heat a 0.5 mm area on one side of the ice core, which is not enough to melt the ice, but causes thermal expansion.  This thermal expansion creates an elastic acoustic wave, which travels across the ice core.  We use a laser interferometer to measure the resulting vibrations that arrive on the opposite side of the core, and measure the time it takes for this wave to move through the ice.  With a measurement of the ice core thickness, we estimate the acoustic velocity of the ice.  A mechanical stage moves the ice core in sub-mm steps between measurements, such that a profile of ice acoustic velocity can be measured at sub-mm resolution along the length of the core.  The mechanical properties of ice vary between ice that was on the surface during winter, compared with ice that was at the surface during summer, due to metamorphism controled by near surface temperature and temperature gradients.  We use these differences in mechanical properties, which vary annually, to deliniate annual layers.    This project developed the instrument and technique, and demonstrated that annual layers can be detected reliably in ice and firn cores.  This approach has great potential for dating ice cores for climate studies, as it is non-destructive and can be automated.
