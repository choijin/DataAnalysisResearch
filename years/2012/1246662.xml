<AbstractNarration>The performance site for this LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is California State University, Los Angeles, one of the 22 California State University campuses included in the California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP). The project  provides a Master's level "bridge" to doctoral-level study for a cohort of 12 graduates of LSAMP undergraduate programs.  The Master's-level experience is designed to increase participant persistence and competencies in STEM and their advancement to Ph.D. programs following completion of the Master's degree.  In addition to providing substantial financial support to enable students to focus full time on a two-year program of Master's-level course work and research, the project provides an integrated set of activities designed to advance BD students toward completion of doctoral level studies.  Activities include: (1) quarterly meetings with the Lead Project Director to monitor progress; (2) a workshop series focused on information needed for adjustment to and success in graduate school; (3) writing support; (4) weekly professional seminars; (5) community building activities; (6) "connecting" BD Fellows to doctoral programs; and (7) assistance with applications to Ph.D. programs, financial aid and fellowships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to advancing the NSF's FY 2011-2016 Strategic Plan, which aims to: "Prepare and engage a diverse STEM workforce motivated to participate at the frontiers."  The project will increase the number of Ph.D. level scientists by identifying and developing the talent of students who would be unlikely to pursue graduate-level study at either the Master's or the doctorate level without the project's support.  These include students with deficits in their baccalaureate credentials and others with competitive credentials for direct entry into Ph.D. programs, but who are otherwise unable or hesitant to do so.  Since the pool of LSAMP baccalaureate recipients includes a high proportion of individuals from underrepresented minority groups, the project anticipates that most, if not all of participants will be students from these groups.  Therefore, the project will contribute significantly to broadening participation in academe and science research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CSU-LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate at California State University, Los Angeles (Cohort 10)  Project Description: This project (HRD- 1246662) was an NSF-LSAMP "Bridge to the Doctorate Activity" (BD) associated with the California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP).  California State University, Los Angeles, one of the 23 California State University campuses in CSU-LSAMP served as the "graduate institutional site" for this BD Activity.  The projectÆs goal was to bring the talent of a cohort of 12 graduates of LSAMP undergraduate programs to academe and research at the frontiers of science and engineering. The project aimed to expand the number of students from underrepresented minority groups in doctoral programs at highly competitive Carnegie "Very High" or "High" Research Universities (RU/VH or RU/H) by providing a MasterÆs level "bridge" to doctoral-level study for students who would be unlikely to apply or be admitted directly to doctoral level study upon completion of the baccalaureate. As in past CSU-LSAMP-BD projects, the MasterÆs-level experience was designed to increase participant persistence and competencies in STEM and their advancement to and success in Ph.D. programs following completion of the MasterÆs degree. CSU-LSAMPÆs specific objectives for the BD-X project were: (1) At least 9 (75%) of new BD Fellows would attain a MasterÆs degree within two years with at least 6 of these students being admitted to Ph.D. programs for Fall 2014; (2) At least 10 (83%) of the 12 BD Fellows would attain an MS degree within three years, with a total of 7-9 students (60-75%) being admitted to Ph.D. programs by Fall 2015. Additionally, 3-5 students who do not continue on to Ph.D. programs will minimally have completed the MS degree and have entered the STEM workforce.  Project Activities: The project was designed to provide students, who for financial, academic or personal reasons may be hesitant or not sufficiently prepared to apply directly to a Ph.D. program at a research intensive university, the opportunity to develop the confidence and competencies needed for admission to and success in a highly competitive Ph.D. program.

Outcomes: CSU-LSAMP continues to find that the BD model it has developed is an effective strategy for advancing the goal of broadening participation in STEM doctoral-level study.  This model, which provides financial, academic and professional development support at the Masters level, has proven successful in recruiting, retaining, and advancing talented minority students who, otherwise, would be unlikely to pursue doctoral level study.  The project was successful in attracting a full cohort of twelve (12) talented graduates of LSAMP undergraduate programs to the CSU-LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate Activity at Cal State LA. The cohort was diverse in terms of baccalaureate institutions of origin, race/ethnicity, and disciplinary interest. The cohort included graduates of 8 different institutions, including 6 California State University campuses and 2 University of California campus.
