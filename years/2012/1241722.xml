<AbstractNarration>Mississippi State University (MSU), a 2001/2004/2007/2012 Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE) recipient and a CyberCorps(R): Scholarship for Service (SFS) participating university since 2002 continues to produce SFS students for the government at a rate of approximately 10 new SFS students a year. This project supports approximately 39 students in one of six technical disciplines over a five year period (17 undergraduates, 20 M.S. students, and 2 PhD students). This program continues to be professionally organized and administered by those most closely associated with the Information Assurance program at MSU.  The program continues to benefit from over $19M research funding from DOJ, DOD and NSF as each student funded under this initiative is required to participate in a research experience. MSU continues a strong working relationship with other CAEs, other universities, community colleges, and the law enforcement community. MSU graduates are successful in government service and new scholarship recipients are sought after by additional government employers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;MSU has a strong track record of building strong relationships with schools aspiring to be capable of running a scholarship program.  They have partnered with several HBCUs including Jackson State University, Mississippi Valley State University, and Tuskegee University, as well as other schools, such as the University of South Alabama, the University of Texas at Tyler, and Saint Cloud State University. This project continues that work to ensure that more schools build IA programs that can provide graduates to help fill the cybersecurity workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under PI Hamilton’s leadership, the Mississippi State University (MSU) CyberCorps program has achieved 100% internships and 100% placements and has maintained those statistics for the past three consecutive years.   In addition to placement, MSU’s CyberCorps program has several unique aspects to it.  Diversity is a strength of the MSU program and the CyberCorps student population at MSU has averaged 25% African-American and 25% female participation.  MSU CyberCorps students are able to take directed studies courses to prepare them to take DoD Instruction 8140 - compliant commercial cyber security certifications.   In the first year, three CyberCorps students took a course focused on the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification.  Last year six students spent their Spring Break taking a course for Certified Information Systems Management (CISM) certification.  This year we expect six to eight CyberCorps students to take another commercial cyber certification course during Spring Break 2020.  For the past three years, MSU CyberCorps students have participated in the Department of Energy’s CyberForce competitions.  MSU is one of the few schools who field both a Red Team and a Blue Team at the DOE CyberForce competitions.     A student from the NSF 1241722 effort who failed to be hired was medically excused from the program by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Working with OPM and MSU, we were able to find that student a qualifying position as a state employee.  Helping this student get a position was a significant win and the right thing to do for the program, but more importantly right for the student.     Direct engagement of the Principal Investigator with the CyberCorps students is the standard recipe for a successful CyberCorps Program.  At MSU this is easy to do because the PI relishes engagement with CyberCorps students.  All of us in the MSU CyberCorps program, faculty, staff and students, believe MSU is making a difference in the CyberCorps program and that the NSF CyberCorps program is making a large, critical contribution to America’s cyber security posture.
