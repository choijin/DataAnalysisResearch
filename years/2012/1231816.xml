<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approach:  The research objective is to develop a novel energy harvesting method for self-powered devices. If one could develop sensing circuits that required no power, then the amount of wiring which leads directly to maintenance and production costs could be greatly reduced. It is proposed to develop energy harvesters to create sensor networks that could constantly report on the health of a variety of critical structures. The proposed approach will develop methods of power harvesting from fluid flow using aeroelastic systems and smart power electronic circuits.  Using piezoelectric structures, these devices will be capable of converting flow-induced vibrations into storable electrical energy. Nonlinear switching circuits will be developed to enhance the efficiency of transducer electromechanical power extraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This work also represents fundamental research into a heretofore untapped source of energy for self-powered systems, i.e., the movement of fluid  air and water. The results of this work will give engineers the analytical tools to determine how to harvest power from fluid flows. This could aid in the development of condition-based systems of maintenance for future and existing infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This project will disseminate information for K-12 students by creating teaching modules in cooperation with local middle and high school teachers. These modules will be made available to schools on the web to demonstrate the idea of energy harvesting from the environment. Local teachers will be invited to a workshop at Cornell with their students to help create lessons and experiments for use in K-12 classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project, broadly about harnessing electric energy more efficiently from wind and water flows, ultimately had three objectives with the majority of work being carried out on objectives (2) and (3).  Objectives:  (1) To increase the potential energy yield in airflow with the use of deformable (aeroelastic) structures and nonlinear switching devices that allow energy extraction to be optimized from piezoelectric devices (transducers that convert stress to energy).  (2) To increase the potential for wind energy at an urban building's rooftop by modifying the building's facade to accelerate the wind at the roof while minimizing turbulence.   (3) To increase the vertical entrainment of horizontal momentum (harvestable energy) within an array of turbines (i.e., a wind farm), motivated by allowing wind farms to extract more energy per unit area of land and thus reducing the cost of wind or water flow generated electricity.  Under the first objective an existing piezoelectric device (the Cornell Flapper) was placed in our wind tunnel to validate theoretical data in the literature.  Under the second objective, a series of experiments were performed at 1:300 scale in a wind tunnel where care was taken to replicate the near-ground (boundary layer) flow in a physically realistically way such as is encountered in urban environments. This was achieved by using a combination of cubes and cylinders (roughness elements) mounted to the floor of the wind tunnel upstream of the building being tested. Measurements of the mean wind speed enhancement and turbulence characteristics were made at three locations along the roof top of the building being tested: at the leading edge, a middle location, and trailing end of the roof top.
