<AbstractNarration>Technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;Detection of specific nucleic acid (NA) sequences is crucial to infectious disease&lt;br/&gt;diagnostics, genetic screening for hereditary diseases, personalized medicine, criminology,&lt;br/&gt;paternity disputes, and animal and plant breeding, among many other applications. Although&lt;br/&gt;polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, coupled with oligonucleotide array chips, has&lt;br/&gt;enabled specific identification of multiple sequences present in a sample at very low copy&lt;br/&gt;number, this method requires added labels and reagents to detect the target NA. These labels&lt;br/&gt;and the hardware (e.g., optics) required to sense them significantly increase the analysis time,&lt;br/&gt;cost, and footprint of devices for detecting specific NA sequences.  As an alternative to current approaches, this project will develop novel nanopores capable of detecting pathogenic nucleic acids with single molecule resolution.  These nanopores will be fabricated in silicon and will be engineered to contain beads labeled with complementary NA sequences.  Binding of target oligonucleotides to the beads will result in the change of electrophoretic properties and will lead to nanopores becoming occluded by the beads.  This event will be detected electrochemically for binary yes/no readout of the target NA.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;There is a need to develop simple and inexpensive methods for detecting pathogens for medical or food safety applications.  This proposal will develop a new approach based on small pores containing beads.  The beads will react to pathogen biomarkers, will clog the pores and will result in the change of electrical current.  This method is envisioned to have improved sensitivity and be simpler than the current approaches.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project was to demonstrate the utility of a new device for specific nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) sequence detection that does not rely on chemical methods to amplify the copies of target nucleic acid and does not require any special reagents.  Such a device could offer a relatively inexpensive and rapid means to detect microbial pathogens in body fluids, food and water.  The three objectives of this project were to 1. Scale down the device from the microscale to the nanoscale using silicon-processing technology; 2. Design and demonstrate the device for detection of E. coli K-12 16S rRNA; and 3. Detect pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 in aqueous solution at practically relevant concentration.  Due primarily to insurmountable noise related issues, we switched to the use of glass chips from silicon as the basis for our sensing device.  This necessitated the development of a novel method to micromachine the devices from glass wafers.  A number of other technical hurdles were overcome as well that enabled us to pursue aggressively a detection limit study using E. coli 16S rRNA as the target.  We successfully demonstrated detection at 1 aM (10-18 M), which corresponds to less than one bacterial cell per milliliter.  Further, this detection limit held even in the presence of a million-fold (1 pM) background of RNA from another bacterium, P. putida.  Studies with P. putida RNA alone gave no false positives and false negatives were observed only at E. coli 16S rRNA concentrations less than 1 aM.  Although we did not address the third objective of this project, the detection of pathogenic E. coli, we have established the promise of a new detection technology that is competitive with (if not better than) amplification based approaches for nucleic acid detection without the use of expensive reagents (e.g., polymerases, primers, nucleotides), enzymatic and/or fluorescent labels, and optics.  Further, as we demonstrated early in this project, detection signals can be monitored with very inexpensive electronics.  Thus, this technology may ultimately prove to be an inexpensive, highly sensitive and rapid means to detect the nucleic acids of pathogens in body fluids, food and water; and could lead to useful point-of-care devices for the clinic.  This project also has provided a research experience for 4 PhD students and 7 undergraduate researchers over three years.  It was the focus of research effort for 3 PhD students who have published their work and presented it at scientific meetings.  These three former PhD students have filed their theses, graduated and have secured positions.  One is an assistant professor at the Univ. of Cincinnati, one is a postdoctoral scholar at Livermore Lab, and third is employed at the FDA.  During the term of this project, the PI hosted groups of underrepresented undergraduate students in the lab who performed meaningful experimental projects as part of the formal course, ENGR 87: Introduction to Engineering Disciplines, which is administered by our Center for Excellence in Engineering &amp; Diversity (CEED).  The intent of this course is to introduce students to their engineering major through an engaging research experience.  The hope is that some of these students subsequently will pursue an interest in research and will go on to graduate school in the sciences and engineering.
