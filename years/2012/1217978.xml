<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the issues of network design, provisioning, and traffic engineering for dynamic backbone and metropolitan access networks needed to support a "follow the wind/sun" computing paradigm for green cloud computing.  This paradigm is based on the observation that it is more energy efficient to move data and computations to a site with local green energy than it is to connect green energy sources to a power grid and then transmit the green power to distant data centers.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study network design and traffic engineering when placement of the elements generating the traffic load is a possible degree of freedom.   The sub-problems include 1) placement of data centers to both be close to green energy and aware of existing network deployment, 2) network capacity planning and rate capacity assignment for networks where data centers may be dynamically powered up/down based on energy availability, 3) routing of user service requests to data centers based on network considerations and estimates of green energy availability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore and quantify better use of green-renewable energy by data-centers, a  significant consumer of electric power.   The project will produce insights that assist industry in the future design, placement and operation of green data centers.    The PIs will train undergraduate (via the REU program) and graduate students in the interdisciplinary area of energy management.   As part of the training the PIs will hold highly-interactive weekly meetings in which students actively learn from each other.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Carbon and greenhouse gas emissions have become a major concern for the sustainable future of our planet. The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector is a major consumer of energy, but it also has mechanisms to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel (and hence reduce our carbon footprint) by transferring workloads to locations with abundant renewable energy such as solar, wind, etc.  This workload migration is facilitated by the emergence of cloud computing and storage which enable one to place (and migrate on demand) these resources over geographically-distributed datacenters which are interconnected by a high-bandwidth optical network.     Intrinsic Merit: This project has created new knowledge and understanding on novel network architectures, protocols, and algorithms to design and provision (i.e., operate) low-carbon, energy-efficient optical datacenter networks. This project has investigated how to devise provisioning techniques to minimize energy consumption in datacenter and cloud networks, how to exploit renewable energy for making datacenter and cloud networks green, how to minimize the electricity bill by exploiting the spatial and temporal variations in electricity costs across large geographical areas, etc. Novel system architectures, protocols, and software algorithms have been developed which allow the design and operation of these networks that wisely distribute computation load among the datacenters in the network, according to the in-situ availability of renewable energy.  The concepts of virtual machines (VMs), VM migration, and virtual network functions (VNFs) have been exploited in the above studies.  Using Network Function Virtualization (NFV), the creation of optimal Network Service Chains (NSC) has also been studied.     Broader Impacts: Greening our networks using energy-efficient design and operation can have a profound effect on society as we try to deal with increasing carbon emissions and depletion of our energy resources. This NSF project has shown how to reduce carbon emission by using more renewable energy in datacenter and cloud networks with intelligent resource allocation, service deployment, routing, and virtual machine (VM) migration.
