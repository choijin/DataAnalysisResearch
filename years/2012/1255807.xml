<AbstractNarration>Researchers from the U.S. and from Finland are collaborating in this Science Across Virtual Institutions (SAVI) project to investigate how teachers use the information about student engagement they obtain through the use of mobile technology to make formative decisions about classroom instruction. The members of the U.S. team for this project are from Michigan State University while the members for the Finnish team are from the University of Helsinki. The project involves three face-to-face workshops, during the first of which the researchers identify how the current instruments and processes, including the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), are used to define and operationalize concepts of engagement to improve teacher practice. The second workshop finalizes the specifics of the design of the research and analysis plans, including interpretive frameworks that integrate the different methodologies currently used by the researchers, to conduct the research in classrooms in both the U.S. and Finland. The third workshop focuses on the discussion of the findings from the study and development of prospects for the usability and scalability of the tools investigated in the study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research builds on an existing international postdoctoral research collaboration (Pathways to Adulthood) and extends that research to include the involvement of doctoral students, teacher educators and mentors as part of the research teams. The researchers are extending the approach used in prior work, the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) and its related cell phone technology, to connect to the methodology used by the Finnish researchers.  The researchers are constructing a theoretical base that improves knowledge around students' sense of self-efficacy and the impact of self-efficacy on learning.  The cell phone technology holds real promise as an approach that teachers could use to gain richer information on students' perspectives. The researchers are extending the concept of engagement as it is currently characterized as "flow" to include measures of student interest, challenge and skill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motivation as a factor in student achievement is of growing importance. There is evidence that engagement as self-efficacy is related to achievement in science, and determining ways to enhance motivation and to connect it to teacher actions is important. This project is contributing to the knowledge of how to measure engagement in the environment of teachers' work in the classroom. In addition, it supports cross-national collaboration and learning by developing a cadre of young researchers who actively contribute to this collaborative research agenda.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We collected data on the social and emotional experiences of students in science classes and implemented project-based professional development for the teachers based on the Next Generation Science Standards. Our results show that when students are challenged in their classes and are appropriately skilled they are more likely to feel confident, successful, and happy during specific science classes as well as in other academic classes. When students experience more times of optimal learning in their science classes they are more likely to report that they perceive science as important to them and their futures. Our results also show that the project-based professional development that we provided for science teachers was promising in terms of increasing student engagement.   Our work also highlights a more nuanced finding for why inquiry-oriented or problem-based learning can contribute to optimal learning moments; that it is the challenge and also the importance/relevance the student experiences during their learning that can improve science classroom experiences.  Our work also underscores the problems associated with boring and confused lessons, which detract from science learning.  Perhaps most importantly, learning comes with some levels of anxiety and stress requiring students to expend considerable effort and perseverance however these conditions do not always lead one to feel entirely comfortable.  Most teachers in the U.S. and Finland are often not trained in knowing when and how to balance interest, skill and challenge with stress and anxiety so that it complements rather than undermines optimal learning moments.
