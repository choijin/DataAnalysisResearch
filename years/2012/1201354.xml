<AbstractNarration>The proposed research program is focused on the interplay of dynamics and variational problems, with a special emphasis  on quantitative stability estimates for sharp geometric inequalities. Such estimates and  inequalities provide an effective means to derive properties of solutions of evolution equations and likewise, evolution equations can be used to derive variational inequalities. Exploiting this interplay has been very fruitful in the past work of the investigator, who plans to approach various problems in this framework. One is to prove new sharp non-local version of the  Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequalities that arise in connection with the fast diffusion equation and porous medium equation. Such equations arise in the modeling of many phenomena, physical to biological, and the analytic problems to be investigated are chosen for their potential broader impact as well their intrinsic analytic interest. Another such problem concerns quantitiative stability for the  Brun-Minkowski  inequality and its application in the study of phase transitions.   A similar philosophy applies as well to certain  problems in kinetic theory, where the plan is to derive quantitative estimates on speed of approach to  equilibrium for some inhomogeneous master equations of Kac type that have recently been used to model not only physical phenomena, but also phenomena in population biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many phenomena in science and technology can be modeled by evolution equations. One example that is the object of research  in this proposal is the Keller Segel system, which models the aggregation, or the absence thereof, in the motion of bacteria. Understanding the behavior of solutions of these equations is both biologically and mathematically interesting.  In  particular,  it is often observed that systems of many interacting  agents (such as bacteria) or particles, either classical or quantum mechanical, evolve toward an equilibrium, and they do this at a certain speed.  Determining the the speed of this process is vital to the understanding  of many such models. This proposal concerns research on obtaining themathematical keys to such problems and their application in a broad range of fields. A central focus is solving certain maximization problems, and proving theorems asserting that any input that produces nearly maximal output must be close, in a an appropriate sense, to input that gives the exact maximum. As recent research of the investigator has shown, such theorems provide an effective means to unlock the information in models of the type described above, and the research  proposed here will further this progress.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This National Science Foundation funded project was  was devoted to  research in mathematical analysis,  with a particular focus on mathematical problems that arise in physics  and biology. Many laws of nature can be expressed in  terms of optimization: Nature tends to seek and find the  best ways of doing things -- the shortest path, or a path  that minimizes "energy" "action" or dissipation". For  instance, bubbles tend to be roughly spherical because of  the isoperimetric inequality, known to the ancient  Greeks, which says that among all surfaces that may  enclose a given volume of space, a spherical surface  does so with the least surface area.  Associated to a  bubble is a "surface tension energy", and energy is minimized  when the bubble is spherical.   Of course, the real world is complicated, and there are all sorts  of "fluctuations" going on that will keep a physical bubble from  being exactly spherical.  So what should we expect to see?   Are there other shapes that are very different from spherical that  do almost as well in terms of enclosing a given volume in space with  a nearly minimal surface area?  If so, one could expect to see wildly non-spherical bubble even in a calm "near equilibrium" setting.  The answer turns out to be "no", but this has been only understood fully and  quantitatively in mathematical terms much more recently.  To thoroughly understand those parts of Nature that are  governed by optimization laws, one must  quantitatively study how close near-optimizers are to  actual optimizers. In the contexts of our running example, the question is: If a surface that encloses a unit volume of space has a surface area that is close to that of the spherical surface enclosing the same  volume of space, how "close" must that surface be to a sphere?  Functional inequalities are a tool used by mathematicians to  quantitatively investigate optimization problems, among other things. The isoperimetric inequality is an example. Functional inequalities also play an important role in studying how quickly a physical system  with "relax" to its near optimal state.  This research project was devoted to proving new functional inequalities and to developing new  methodologies for using them to solve mathematical problems  coming from the natural sciences.  The research was very successful.  One of the main results was a "quantitative non-local isoperimetric inequality" devised to treat "surface tension" problems in real physical systems in  which the molecules interact through electromagnetic forces over some  small -- but non-zero distance, and the interface between the interior  and exterior of the bubble is not sharp. Other key results concerned "maximal entropy dissipation" in quantum systems.   In addition to the research of the Principal Investigator, this project supported two graduate students, Katy Craig and Frances Seuffert.  Both students made significant contributions to the achievement of the goals of the project. Both students completed their Ph.D'.s,:  Katy Craig is now a tenure track Assistant Professor at U. C.
