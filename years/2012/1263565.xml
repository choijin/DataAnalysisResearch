<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This PI will use advanced molecular simulation tools to investigate and quantify the effects of key variables such as hydration level, carbohydrate excipients, and temperature on the structure, stability and dynamics of proteins undergoing dehydration and rehydration. The impact from the successful outcome of this project will help develop quality therapeutic proteins and advance the development such therapeutics for the pharmaceutical industry.</AbstractNarration>

Another objective of this work has been the computational investigation of the effects of cold on the structure, stability and thermodynamics of proteins in aqueous solution. The main outcomes of this project are listed below.   (1) Using advanced computational techniques developed in our laboratory, we showed that water adsorption isotherms (water content of a protein as a function of relative humidity) are insensitive to the type of protein matrix on which the water adsorbs (crystalline, amorphous, thermally denatured).   (2) We showed that the nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique known as diffusion maps is a computationally effective means of identifying the folding pathways of proteins.

We found that low-temperature unfolding is favored energetically, but disfavored entropically. We identified the main source of this energetic stabilization, namely interactions between water and polar amino-acids along the protein backbone. Cold-unfolded states involve disruption of the protein?s hydrophobic core, but basic elements of Trp-cage?s secondary structure, such as the alpha helix, remain intact.
