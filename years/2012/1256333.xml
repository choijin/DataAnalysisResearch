<AbstractNarration>This project is documenting the extent of evidence-based STEM instructional practices on the Arizona State University Polytechnic campus  and assessing and enhancing their impact. Evidence-based practices are based on research in learning and teaching. They yield objective evidence of improved student learning in actual classroom situations. They typically incorporate classroom or laboratory activities that require students to express their thinking though actions that go beyond copying notes or executing prescribed procedures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is: (1) collecting and examining course syllabi and instructional materials to determine whether and to what degree they incorporate evidence-based instructional practices; (2) using standard  protocols to carry out observations of selected classes and laboratories to assess implementation of evidence-based instructional practices; (3) assessing student learning in STEM courses, allowing measurement of the effectiveness of future course reforms; and (4) working with instructors to facilitate and enhance the adoption and use of evidence-based instructional practices in their STEM classes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is using state-of-the-art, research-based assessment instruments in diverse STEM fields for gauging student learning and monitoring the effects of reformed instructional practice. It is a key step in the process of increasing effectiveness of STEM instruction through evidence-based practice at Arizona State University, which has the largest student enrollment in the nation. Successful implementation and dissemination of this model of enhancing evidence-based instructional practice will provide both an incentive and a roadmap for other educational institutions that wish to take effective action to improve STEM learning for their students.</AbstractNarration>

Through detailed analysis of student learning data we determined that there was a large and significant positive correlation between students' pre-instruction scores on diagnostic tests, and their final course grades. This strong correlation persisted even when effective evidence-based instructional materials and methods were used. The potential implications of the findings include refinements in the guidance provided to students at the beginning of their enrollment in certain STEM courses. Reports of these findings were made to several professional meetings of STEM educators and education researchers.  The project supported and enhanced uses of evidence-based instructional materials and methods in two very different courses: (i) An elementary course on physical science, entirely based in the laboratory, in which elementary education majors and other non-technical students were engaged in drawing conclusions and inferences from observations made in hands-on investigations; (ii) An advanced physics course on mechanics and vibrations in which an undergraduate student teaching assistant helped to implement the use of research-based "tutorials" that guided students through lengthy chains of reasoning and problem-solving.  The website whose development was supported in part by this project is called "History of U.S. Physics Education." This website includes a comprehensive bibliography and archive of material published regarding physics education in the United States, including the evolution of evidence-based instructional materials and methods. All public-domain materials (e.g., those published before 1923, along with government and institutional reports, etc.) are freely downloadable. Extensive articles (both published and in-press) that describe and explain the materials and their development are available on the website, as well as annotated reading lists, course reading outlines, etc.  The project supported the acquisition of laboratory supplies and small pieces of equipment for use in the hands-on course on physical science targeted at elementary education majors and other non-technical students.

The course focus on elementary education majors helps improve the teaching abilities of future elementary school teachers and enhances their capability of guiding elementary school students in hands-on experiments to test their ideas through observation and argument.  The library of printed STEM instructional materials is specifically focused on materials derived from and/or validated through systematic research on student learning. The materials are made available to STEM faculty on the Polytechnic campus.             Last Modified: 12/31/2016       Submitted by: David E Meltzer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
