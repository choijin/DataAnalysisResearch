<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Alexander Schwab from Appalachian State University and colleagues Grant Holder, Nicole Bennett, Michael Ramey and Michael Hambourger will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) investigation to probe whether there is a kinetic microwave effect utilizing the Wittig reaction of stabilized ylides; (b) structure of the organic anion transporter in biological membranes; (c) cobalt bis(glyoxime) complexes as reversible catalysts for hydrogen production; (d) metabolic screening of antioxidant-bearing raw materials using 1H NMR and multivariate analysis; (e) multifunctional hexaphenylbenzenes; and (f) modular approach to metal coordination polymer networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at Appalachian State University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR) is an essential tool that organic chemists use to determine chemical structure.  This instrument is used in academic and industrial research labs nationwide.  Having such an instrument at Appalachian State University allows us to offer advanced training to our students.  To date, roughly 35 students per year have been trained to operate the NMR, and this level of training can be expected to continue or increase for over a decade.  Furthermore, the NMR allows us to recruit and retain high-quality faculty and enables our faculty to perform cutting-edge research.   With the right combination of energy production and the use of hydrogen fuel, there are a number of strategies which would allow the world to produce and distribute the energy needed to sustain or improve the standard of living but also greatly reduce the mass production of carbon dioxide.  Many strategies to produce hydrogen fuel efficiently require the development of hydrogen production catalysts that can be used in acidic water solutions.  Cobalt bis(glyoxime) complexes have shown promise to be such catalysts.  One of the research pursued using the NMR was the synthesis and characterization of cobalt bis(glyoxime) catalysts.  Unfortunately, the research completed has indicated that cobalt bis(glyoxime) catalysts might not be suitable for this application, though the research completed indicates a set of related compounds that might be more suitable for this application.  The chemical structure of the rubber found in tires makes it impossible to recycle this material in the same way that aluminum or glass is.  Efforts to recycle this material are either require too much energy (i.e. are too expensive) or cannot use all of the available rubber waste.  Another research project supported by the NMR involves developing a new way to generate rubbery materials which are more recyclable.  The research strategy involves using a polymer chain, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), which could give the material properties similar to silicone rubber.  The polymer chain alone is not enough to impart the necessary rubbery properties; these chains must be linked into a molecular network.  A metal coordination complex, iron(II) tris(bipyridine), is used to join the PDMS chains into a network.  Current research results indicate that PDMS chains do successfully nework by the desired synthetic strategy.  The iron(II) tris(bipyridine) network linkages actually impart the material with a red color, which can be used as a visual indication that the material is chemically intact.  Future research on these compounds will involve investigating just how mechanically rubbery the materials are and whether these materials can be recycled as expected.
