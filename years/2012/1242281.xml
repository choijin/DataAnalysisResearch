<AbstractNarration>A Pan American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) on Atmospheric Processes of Latin America and the Caribbean: Observations, Analysis, and Impacts will be held be held in Cartagena, Colombia, in 2013.  The Principal Investigator, John Braun, will be joined on the organizing committee by Hector Mora Paez (Center for Processing and Analysis of Geodetic Data, Colombian Geological Survey), Angel G. Munoz (Center for Scientific Modeling, Universidad del Zulia, Venezuela) and Olga L. Mayol-Bracero (Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies, University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short course is intended to foster a community of early career scientists who are interested in regional atmospheric processes, and is intended as a way of introducing these researchers to the Continuously Operating Caribbean Observational Network (COCONet). COCONet is a regional network of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) instruments and surface meteorology stations that will provide continuous total column precipitable water vapor, surface pressure, temperature, relative humidity, horizontal winds, and precipitation measurements across the Caribbean and Latin America.  The course will provide a comprehensive summary of the state of knowledge of the key processes that are important to the region including global tele-connections, regional monsoon systems, ocean-air interactions, hurricanes, and regional sources of moisture and its transport.  The course will contain lectures, computing exercises, exposure to observational datasets and atmospheric model fields, and software training.  Both the lecturers and students will represent a number of countries in the Americas.  Thus this PASI will provide an environment to advance partnerships and start new collaborations.  The intent of this activity is to allow junior scientists in the Americas the opportunity to gain professional experience beyond their nations? borders.</AbstractNarration>
