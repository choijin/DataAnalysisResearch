<AbstractNarration>In this EAGER proposal, the PI has proposed, as a supplementary educational activity to the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit (ICEAPS) atmospheric-science project (ARC- 0856773), to engage in a formal distance-learning activity with students in Idaho in which students would use off-the-shelf and relatively inexpensive hand-held devices to conduct experiments analogous to those researchers conduct in Greenland, as part of ICECAPS, with far more sophisticated equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In discussions with the PI, it has been decided that this project will be recommended for funding as a pilot, both to see whether the technological capacity exists to carry out the kinds of instruction the PI envisions, but also to see whether the ICECAPS distance-learning project (Adventure Learning @ Greenland) can be made to dovetail with and enhance Science in Education Week, an activity involving U.S. students that is part of the Denmark, Greenland, U.S.-supported Joint Science Education Project (JSEP).</AbstractNarration>
