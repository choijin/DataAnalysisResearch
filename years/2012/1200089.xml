<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop a fundamentally new approach to understand and establish spatial properties of mechanical parts in terms of simple interacting constructs related to part functionality and manufacturing processes. In the context of engineering design, the novel concept of a medial zone provides an explicit representation of the correspondence between mechanical/functional characteristics and spatial properties. More precisely, medial zones provide topologically valid and parameterized initial design solutions. Due to the fact that the medial zones fuse some of the critical geometric and topological properties of both the domain itself and of its medial axis, reformulating problems in terms of medial zones affords the ?best of both worlds? in a variety of applications such as shape synthesis in conceptual design, robotic and autonomous navigation, and design automation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide the first combinatorial model of a part that can be used to explicitly represent the correspondence between mechanical/functional characteristics of shapes and their spatial properties. This, in turn, provides a powerful paradigm for automatically synthesizing topologically correct, and functionally valid mechanical designs. Furthermore, this new framework will stimulate critical new avenues of interdisciplinary research at UConn and beyond. The intuitive nature of geometric skeletons will be used as a vehicle to illustrate non-intuitive engineering behavior during targeted outreach activities to K-12 students, teachers and local school district serving groups that have traditionally been underrepresented in engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Solid modeling remains today a dominant framework for mechanical product description mostly because it satisfies the requirement of "informational completeness" of computer representations of geometry. However, traditional geometry-based systems do not contain key information needed for many engineering activities, including conceptual design, and tend to force costly iterations in a product development cycle.  More specifically, the functional requirements prescribed on any mechanical design almost never define the geometry completely. Consequently, a combinatorial model of a part described in terms of known interacting ?functional boundaries? can provide the much-needed link between form and function in product development activities.  This research developed a new approach to understand and establish spatial properties of mechanical parts in terms of simple interacting constructs related to part functionality. In the context of engineering design, the novel concept of a medial zone provides an explicit representation of the correspondence between mechanical/functional characteristics and spatial properties. More precisely, medial zones provide topologically valid and parameterized initial design solutions.  This project supported the successful completion of several dissertations and theses, as well as of multiple journal and conference publications. The results of this research were used in educational activities, including curriculum development, as well as several outreach activities to K-12 teachers and students as well as to the broad academic and industrial community.
