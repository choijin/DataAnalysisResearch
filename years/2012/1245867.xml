<AbstractNarration>Assured systems, those systems that exhibit confidentiality, integrity, and availability and whose security properties have been verified or proven, are essential for the United States' national security. This project is developing the necessary learning materials and strategies to equip undergraduate computing students with the following capabilities, which are essential for building assured systems:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The ability to account for system security from the start in the form of requirements, specifications, policies, and concepts of operation.&lt;br/&gt;2. The ability to use security and integrity mechanisms (such as authentication and reference monitors) to satisfy confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements.&lt;br/&gt;3. The ability to apply computer-assisted reasoning tools (such as theorem provers and model checkers) to formally verify security properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The learning materials being created include a series of hands-on lab exercises that incorporate security concepts and mechanisms, as well as functional programming and theorem proving.  Materials also include hands-on projects that integrate both security and assurance, requiring students to walk the virtuous cycle of specification, design, implementation, and verification. Through these activities, students experience first-hand how theory, concepts, and tools can be combined to solve real-world problems. This project is identifying the educational foundations necessary for producing graduates who can build assured systems to support the nation's critical infrastructure.  The activity-based and modular nature of the project's learning materials will help foster adoption by a wide range of educators, including those whose primary expertise is not in assurance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has addressed the critical need for curricular materials that prepare undergraduate computer engineering and computer science students to develop the attributes required to build assured systems (i.e., systems that are proved or verified to be secure).  Building assured systems requires the following three attributes: (1) the ability to account for system security from the start in the form of requirements, specifications, policies, and concepts of operation; (2) the ability to use security and integrity mechanisms (such as authentication and reference monitors) to satisfy condientiality, integrity, and availability requirements; and (3) the abiity to apply computer-assisted reasoning tools (such as theorm provers and model checkers) to formally verify security properties.    During this project, we produced a collection of curricular materials to foster these attributes.  These materials included lab exercises primarily related to mastering security concepts (particularly as they relate to the Android operating system), a textbook and lab manual (with lab exercises) to use functional programming and the HOL theorem prover to reason about security concepts, and a series of lab exercises that allow students to walk the virtuous cycle of specification, design, implementation, and verification in the context of components of a secure operating system.  These materials were deployed in multiple venues, including at least seven distinct undergraduate and graduate courses at Syracuse University, two different Air Force summer internship programs, and at workshops for faculty and instructors at other institutions.  This project has directly improved the curriculum and student learning at Syracuse University by integrating security and assurance research into the undergraduate educational landscape. The project has demonstrated the feasibility of moving topics such as theorem proving into the undergraduate curriculum and contributed to meeting the national need for computing professionals who are capable of developing and assuring secure systems.
