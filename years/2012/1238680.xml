<AbstractNarration>This is a small request to support the travel of the PI, Michael Etnier, to participate in the Pribilof School Districts 5th Annual Bering Sea Days educational outreach even April 17-21 in St. Paul, Alaska.  The PI's participation in Bering Sea Days includes a number of presentations introducing students and community members to zooarchaeology and how the field contributes to an understanding of the ecology of key cultural species, fur seals and sea lions. By introducing students to zooarchaeology through hands on activities using the bones of culturally important species, Dr. Etnier hopes not only to inform students about zooarchaeology and their local environment, but to engage them in science in ways that other projects cannot.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "Bering Sea Days" (BSD) is a four-day science camp that is hosted by the Pribilof School District, with financial support from a large number of local, regional, and federal contributors.  I received this NSF funding to cover my airfare from my hometown to Anchorage, and out to the community of St. Paul.     The organizers invite a wide range of scientists who have a history of working in the Pribilof Islands (oceanographers, seal biologists, etc.) and with the community.  I am a zooarchaeologist (an archaeologist who studies animal bones) who has participated in science education in the Pribilofs since 1994.  I was invited to participate in BSD in April, 2012, teaching students K-12 about the kinds of things scientists can learn from bones and teeth.     The younger students sorted through owl pellets to learn about diet, while older students learned about casting (making replicas) and cutting seal, sea lion, and whale teeth in order to: determine the age of the animal, and expose growth layers that can be sampled chemically to determine diet of the animal. We also held a dissection of a fox for anyone who was interested (voluntary participation).     St. Paul is a challenging community to teach in. I have worked with students from St. Paul for nearly 20 years now. There are always a couple of students who just have too many other things going on in their lives (trouble at home, a busy fishing season, or whatever) to be very interested in, or have much energy for school work. But even so, the majority of the kids I've worked with over the years typically find something about the bones-and-teeth activities that they find interesting.     For many of the younger students, this was probably the first time they've ever thought about using bones to study anything (here, owl diet) scientifically. The older students had the opportunity to use a tooth saw owned by the community to cut various kinds of teeth. There are several opportunities available to students to work with seal biologists who conduct research on the island&mdash;my hope is that one or more of them might get interested in studying teeth from their community's subsistence harvest of fur seals.     Although this was primarily an educational outreach activity, the kind of research I do is also directly relevant to the community of St. Paul.  Specifically, I study the historical ecology of northern fur seals, and how the ecology of this species has changed over the past several hundred to several thousand years. One of the primary sources of my samples is archaeological midden sites&mdash;sites that were inhabited by the ancestors of the communities in the Pribilofs. The people of St. Paul and St. George still maintain a subsistence harvest of fur seals, and are keenly aware of population-level changes in the species that have occurred in the 20th Century. They are very interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the longer  (pre)history of fur seals in the North Pacific.
