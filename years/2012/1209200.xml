<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of the California State University- Fullerton (CSUF)  IT-Catalyst proposal is to increase female STEM faculty recruitment, hiring, promotion and retention. The specific aims utilize mixed method data collection to inform policy review and issues surrounding campus climate and culture.  Several specific key elements related to the project include, but are not limited to: identification and revision of policy that most negatively impacts women in STEM; a climate survey; a leadership retreat and faculty forum to dissemination climate results; development of a search committee training and guidelines; and a project website.  The activities are expected to provide CSUF with informed targets and strategies to begin changing campus climate and practices to one that is more inclusive of and agreeable to female STEM faculty.  Finally, the project findings and novel survey instrument/protocols can inform other similar institutions within and without the CSU system.</AbstractNarration>
