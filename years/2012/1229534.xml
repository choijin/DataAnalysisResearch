<AbstractNarration>This NSF MRI award funds the acquisition of a hyper-frequency viscoelastic&lt;br/&gt;spectroscopy (HFVS) instrument for materials characterization. It is especially well suited for&lt;br/&gt;measuring viscoelastic properties of biological tissues and artificial polymers because it can&lt;br/&gt;make non-contacting, non-destructive measurements on small-sized samples over a wide&lt;br/&gt;excitation frequency range. The HFVS instrument will be immediately used in five current&lt;br/&gt;research projects: 1) computational simulation of traumatic brain injury; 2) determining the role&lt;br/&gt;of active and passive forces in microvascular network formation; 3) dynamic characterization of&lt;br/&gt;underactuated legged locomotion, 4) design and fabrication of perching landing gear for microaerial&lt;br/&gt;vehicles, and 5) characterization of a biodegradable, biocompatible co-polymer. The most&lt;br/&gt;significant contribution resulting from use of the instrument on each project is: 1) constitutive&lt;br/&gt;models for human brain tissue at high strain rates appropriate for blast-response simulation and&lt;br/&gt;analysis; 2) characterization of a new extra-cellular matrix biomimetics for studying the effects&lt;br/&gt;of both active and passive mechanical environments on cells, 3) material-tunable, dynamic&lt;br/&gt;models of underactuated legged locomotion for milli-scale robots, 4) tunable-stiffness and ?&lt;br/&gt;damping, polymer fabrication processes for perching landing gear mechanisms, and 5)&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing processes for controlling the properties of a class of environmentally-friendly, copolymers&lt;br/&gt;for medical applications. In addition to supporting ongoing research, the instrument&lt;br/&gt;will enable future research involving related materials and will open new research areas in&lt;br/&gt;bioengineering, material science, and mechanical engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HFVS instrument will substantially enhance metrology capabilities at Olin College enabling&lt;br/&gt;the characterization of materials ranging in stiffness from very compliant, nearly liquid (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;gels) to very rigid by quantitative measurement of mechanical stiffness and energy dissipation&lt;br/&gt;related properties. The characterization of materials plays an integral part in a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;research problems especially those including computer simulations and the custom design and&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing of components or structures involving the given materials. The acquisition of a&lt;br/&gt;HFVS instrument will have significant positive impact on Olin College?s research capability,&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research training efforts, and curriculum. The instrument will directly support the&lt;br/&gt;training and education of undergraduates at Olin College where approximately 45% of students&lt;br/&gt;and 55% of the bioengineering, material science, and mechanical engineering majors are women.&lt;br/&gt;Research training is incorporated throughout the curriculum directly into project-based and&lt;br/&gt;laboratory-based coursework. Students have numerous individual research opportunities to work&lt;br/&gt;with faculty during the academic year and in the summer. The instrument will be specifically&lt;br/&gt;utilized in a number of courses and will be particularly useful in the senior-year, engineering&lt;br/&gt;capstone course in which student teams tackle industry-sponsored projects.</AbstractNarration>
