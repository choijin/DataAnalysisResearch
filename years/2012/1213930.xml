<AbstractNarration>This award funds the cosmic-string research of Professors Ken Olum and Jose Blanco-Pillado at Tufs University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic strings are microscopically thin or even fundamental objects of cosmological length.  They can arise from symmetry breaking in field theory or from superstring theory.  They can produce observational signatures in the cosmic microwave background, in cosmic rays, in ultra-high-energy neutrinos, or in gravity waves.  If cosmic strings are detected, they will provide a window onto fundamental physics and energies beyond the reach of any accelerator.  Over the past three years, the Tufts cosmology group has developed a large, parallel computer simulation of cosmic string networks.  This simulation can handle a much larger volume for a much longer time than any other.  This project will make use of this simulation in order to study the shapes of cosmic string loops, the power spectrum of excitations on long cosmic strings, and the the specific processes which give rise to the spectrum of cosmic string loops.  All these questions are of paramount importance to the observational signatures of a string network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have a broader impact through the involvement of graduate students and through opportunities for students from underrepresented groups to participate in research.  Its results will be broadly disseminated through publication in journals and made available to the public on the World Wide Web.  This project will also benefit society by further connecting studies of the universe with studies of the fundamental laws of nature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cosmic strings are microscopically thin, astronomically long objects that might exist in our universe.  They could arise from symmetry breaking in grand unified field theories, or they could be the fundamental strings of string theory stretched out to astronomical size.  If cosmic strings exist, their discovery would give us valuable information on high-energy physics and the fundamental laws of nature.  Cosmic strings, if they exist, form a "network" consisting of long strings that wander over great distances (perhaps forever if the universe is infinite) and smaller loops.  When two strings cross, they may exchange partners, and if a string crosses itself the crossing may produce a loop.  Loops of a wide range of sizes are continually being produced from the long string network.  Once a loop is produced, it oscillates periodically and emits gravitational waves.  Eventually the loop loses all its energy into these gravitational waves and disappears.  How can we know whether cosmic strings exist?  What signals would they give off that that would tell us of their existence?  An attractive possibility is the gravitational waves emitted by the loops.  These waves might be detected, for example, by precision timing of signals from pulsars.  Other possibilities include gamma rays, ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, distortions of the cosmic microwave background, and several others.  To look for cosmic strings, we have to know what to expect.  How many loops would there be today and at each previous epoch in the history of the universe?  What is the distribution of shapes of these loops? This project sought to determine the answers to these questions and so to enable us to calculate what observable signals might be expected.  How did we answer these questions?  First, we did a large-scale computer simulation of networks of cosmic strings.  From the simulation we determined the rate of production of loops of different sizes.  Then we analyzed the effect of this loop production rate in a cosmological context.  We considered the lifetime of loops and their dilution due to the expansion of the universe.  We found that most loops that exist at any given epoch are small ones (relative to the size of the universe), which were produced much earlier and have lived out a significant fraction of their lifetime.  We gave an accurate statement of the density of loops for use in observational calculations.  As an example, we calculated the gravitational radiation that the loops would produce and set an upper bound on the energy scale of cosmic strings based on the fact that such gravitational radiation has not been observed.  Then we extracted many loops that were produced in our simulations and considered their shapes.  We were surprised to find that these loops were not at all smooth.  Instead, they were composed of several rather straight segments connected by sharp bends (which are called "kinks"). This is very important to the generation of observational signals, because many signals are generated by cusps, where the string bends back on itself and moves nearly at the speed of light.  Nearly all smooth strings have cusps, but strings with kinks typically do not have cusps, so their observational signals are different.  However, this result applies only to strings at formation.  As described above, most strings have lost a significant fraction of their length due to gravitational radiation.  This process is likely to change their shape.  While we have not yet been able to directly simulate the effects of gravitational radiation, we modeled that effect by a smoothing process.  In that case we discovered that smoothing produced the cusps that were absent at the time of production.  The overall outcome of this project is to clearly specify the distribution of loops of different sizes and shapes that would be found in any given cosmic string model, and so to allow comparison with past and future observations to determine whether cosmic strings exist,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
