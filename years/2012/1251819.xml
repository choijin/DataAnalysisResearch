<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this empirical study is to explore the prevalence and impact of stigmatization and stereotype threat on mathematics performance among public high school students (grades 9-12) with specific learning disabilities.  Using a combination of self-report measures and experimental study, the following questions will be addressed: 1) To what degree are high school students with specific learning disabilities conscious of stigma related to their learning disability in the context of mathematics education?, 2) Is greater stigma consciousness associated with poorer performance in mathematics among high school students with specific learning disabilities?, and 3) Do high school students with specific learning disabilities experience stereotype threat that interferes with performance in mathematics? The severity of learning disability will be controlled in all analyses, and tests of moderation will be employed to explore potentially compounding effects of having a math specific learning disability, being a girl or minority student, or coming from a school where stigma levels around learning disability are high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work contributes to Intellectual Merit through advancing potentially transformative knowledge and understanding about the experiences of students with learning disabilities in the context of high school mathematics. The research has the potential to inform and open new avenues of research in the area of stigmatization and stereotype threat for people with disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In regards to Broader Impacts, the findings from this project will significantly inform understanding of the achievement gaps in math of underrepresented groups, and specifically students with learning disabilities, including women and minorities within this population. Understanding the cognitive and affective experiences of individuals with learning disabilities may facilitate the future development of interventions to remedy the current negative outcomes of students with learning disabilities in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, by eighth grade only 35% of students with learning disabilities reach the basic level of performance standard in mathematics as compared to 77% of their peers without learning disabilities. These trends persist and worsen through twelfth grade. Determining why students with learning disabilities continue to struggle in mathematics throughout high school, and then developing the most relevant and highest leverage approaches to intervention will be critical to reversing this trend. Intellectual Merit: With other groups who experience underperformance in mathematics, notably women and African Americans, the experience of stigmatization and stereotype threat has proven influential in contributing to poor math outcomes. Significant prior qualitative research suggested that students with learning disabilities experience stigmatization, but the links among stigmatization, stereotype threat, and performance in mathematics had not until this research been explored systematically through quantitative and experimental research in this population.
