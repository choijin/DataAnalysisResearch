<AbstractNarration>Partners for this Track 1 project to produce 41 high school mathematics teachers include Virginia State University  (VSU) as the lead institution, three community colleges (John Tyler and J. Sargeant Reynolds Community Colleges and Richard Bland Junior College) and two school districts (Petersburg and Chesterfield County Public Schools).   Their overall goal is to recruit, prepare and sustain teachers, from underserved populations, who are capable of creating professional, positive, research-informed, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) responsive, technologically-intensive and effective mathematics learning environments for all students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scholars are being recruited from three specific populations: (1) VSU's current STEM majors, (2) students pursuing certificates or degrees in STEM-related disciplines at the partnering two-year community colleges, and (3) juniors and seniors at local high schools.  As a recruiting tool, summer internships are being offered to 100 freshman and sophomore students from both VSU and the cooperating community colleges.  The internship includes, among other activities: (1) a three credit mathematics course; (2) reinforcement of mathematics skills; (3) introduction to web technology; and (4) an overview of STEM careers.  The program for the scholars emphasizes community building and includes: (1) faculty and peer mentoring; (2) preparation for all requirements of secondary licensure, including the Praxis; (3)  resume writing and interviewing skills; (4) an introduction to useful technology and grant writing; (5) participation in professional organizations and meetings; and (6) team building. Support for the Scholars during their first three years of teaching, includes: (1) a Mentor /Scholar Teacher Professional Community comprised of  new teachers, mentors and faculty at VSU and the partnering community colleges designed to provide individual, group, and internet housed contact among the participants;  (2) summer mini-workshops involving current and past Scholars, exemplary mathematics high school teachers, and VSU and partnering community college faculty that focus on effective pedagogy, problem solving, diversity preparation, technology, and classroom management; and (3) a funded one credit-hour hybrid course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Information from the research-based evaluation of the project will be widely disseminated through contacts in the state and through presentations at professional organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The nature of the student population at the institutions involved and the emphasis of the program on service at underserved schools insures creation of a diverse effective set of secondary mathematics teachers throughout the schools served by this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report  The Program Outcomes of The Central Virginia Undergraduate Scholarship Program (CVUMSP) emanate from the Goals of the program:  Goal # 1: Recruit and support 41 CVUMSP Scholars from among underrepresented groups, including ethnic minority and female students.    The VSU Mathematics program (with minor in Secondary Education) consists of mathematics courses, general education and education courses to meet VSU degree requirements and state licensure requirements for secondary education.  From Fall 2012 to 2018, CVUMSP recruited and provided financial support to 34 CVUMSP scholars. Over the seven-year grant period, the total amount of scholarship/loan disbursed was $485,878.00.  The amount accepted per student ranged from $4000 to $25000. The total amount of repayment outstanding is $190,629.20.  The mean amount still owed by each scholar is $5,776.64 with a maximum of $18,000.00 (for the only remaining undergraduate scholar) and a minimum of $0.00 for ten alumni scholars who have satisfied all of their promissory note obligations.     Of the 33 CVUMSP scholars recruited     -    31 received BS degrees in mathematics from the VSU Department of Mathematics.   -   A total of 16 scholars passed the Praxis II exam (10) or the Middle School Mathematics Praxis Exam (6).  -    25 received and taught mathematics teaching jobs  in high &ndash; needs secondary schools.  -    13 scholars secured teaching licenses &ndash; the remaining scholars had provisional teaching licenses.  -    Twenty-five Scholars secured secondary mathematics teaching jobs in eight school divisions including:  Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, New York City, Texas, Virginia (10 schools districts)(73%), and Washington DC.                                                                                                                            Goal # 2: Increase the number and retention of secondary mathematics teachers who are competent, caring, effective, and reflective practitioners in high-need school districts, teaching in diverse school settings, with an emphasis on public schools in Central Virginia.   This Goal was realized by the scholars’ admission into the PEP program, the completion of courses needed for their BS in mathematics/minor in secondary education, and their preparation and passing of the one of the Mathematics Praxis II Exams.     Teacher Preparation at VSU  In the Commonwealth of Virginia, prospective teachers major in a discipline and minor in secondary education (grades 6 &ndash; 12). Mathematics majors apply to the VSU Center for Professional Education (see supplemental documents) by the end of their sophomore year. The university’s Professional Education Program (PEP) is National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) accredited and the Mathematics program is fully National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) approved.  Admission into the PEP requires a completed application packet that indicates that the student has:  &bull;        Completed the first three semesters of coursework as prescribed in the curriculum.  &bull;        Successfully completed all Professional Studies courses with a "C" or better.  &bull;        Obtained a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or better and passed Praxis II - required to secure a permanent teaching license.  Praxis 2:  Praxis 2 Exam, has posed a challenge for many CVUMSP scholars. Twenty-seven CVUMSP Scholars took two different types of tests needed for securing teaching licenses: (a) 5161 Mathematics Content Knowledge and (b) 5169 Middle School Mathematics test.   Praxis boot camp opportunities were among the key strategies used to address this area from 2014 - 2020, roughly 148 Praxis Boot Camp sessions, lasting 2-3 hours each were provided to scholars via project Praxis Boot Camp sessions. During 2019 -20, (during remote learning due to COVID-19), a Virtual Praxis Boot Camp was employed. Of twenty-seven scholars who entered the program, took the exam, 16 (59%) scholars passed one of the two tests..     Goal # 3: Provide ongoing content, pedagogical, technological and mentoring support for CVUMSP Scholars during their first two years in the classroom.   A critical component of the CVUMSP was its unique mentorship program, designed to foster teacher retention, learning, and development of CVUMSP students’ pedagogical, professional, and career domains after graduation. Professional mentoring support of CVUMSP Scholars began after scholars graduated with a BS in mathematics from VSU, had secured and were actively teaching in a high needs school mathematics program. All new mentees were paired with a CVUMSP-trained mentor/veteran teacher in a partnering school district for a minimum of two years.  Over the course of the grant, CVUMSP has provided 45 - 50 Professional Development (PD) sessions with pedagogical, content, technological and mentoring support,  to 19 CVUMSP scholars via the CVUMSP mentoring program - all of whom completed this CVUMSP benchmark. Both the mentors and mentees were trained via two-hour, Saturday professional development sessions &ndash; (roughly 25 sessions). Mentor activities also included monthly program mentoring conference calls and reports. The PD for mentees and mentees was supplemented by numerous VSU, local, regional, state and  national conferences paid for/sponsored by the CVUMSP.  CVUMSP Mentoring program professional development topics included: Assessment; Technology; Classroom Management; Problem-based inquiry learning; NCTM standards; Culturally responsive pedagogy; Social justice mathematics; Robotics, Coding; Equity, Math Learning disabilities and more.
