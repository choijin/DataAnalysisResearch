<AbstractNarration>This early concept project seeks to build a partnership between two US universities who are currently creating learning environments to support engaged learning in STEM disciplines.  This award will allow these researchers to begin a collaboration with Finnish researchers at Turku University.  The collaborative partnership will allow the research team to collaboratively understand the nature of engagement in complex STEM learning environments to develop better methods for creating authentic learning systems across many settings and contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises from how it informs our knowledge of how to retain and engage students in learning tasks.  These types of environments extend across the learning spectrum from early years into college and also into the workforce.  The international collaboration serves to expand the network and skills of students involved in the project.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by helping the United States be globally competitive through international partnerships.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.</AbstractNarration>

When students learn in environments that match the context in which they will do their professional work, they are more likely to be able to draw on what they have learned as professionals.

The project focused on authentic learning environments to support engaged learning in science and engineering. We studied the innovative learning systems we have been developing where students take the role of practicing professionals (e.g., as an environmental scientist or a semiconductor process engineer) where they are encouraged to use the "language" and "practices" of the discipline to "get somewhere" (develop a product, improve a process, gain a better understanding of a phenomenon) over time. When students learn in environments that match the context in which they will do their professional work, they are more likely to be able to draw on what they have learned as professionals.
