<AbstractNarration>This project will examine anticipated changes in the statistics of weather and hydroclimate over western North America in coming decades from the point of view of needs in the management of water and ecosystems.  Western North America is already experiencing significant climate and hydroclimate change.  Models project that over the next few decades warming will continue, southwestern North America and the southern Plains will become more arid and the northern Rockies and Plains will become modestly more humid.  Additionally precipitation is projected to become more intense, variability on all timescales stronger and significant shifts to occur in the seasonal cycles of precipitation, soil moisture and streamflow.  While these projected changes will have serious implications for water resources, agriculture, rangelands, wildlife management and natural ecosystems including forests, fire, etc. it must be noted that the model simulations of radiatively-driven hydroclimate change to data are not in close accord with actual change.  This could be because the models are wrong or radiatively-driven change is being obscured by potent natural variability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will involve three interwoven efforts:  &lt;br/&gt;1) analysis of policy and management decisions to identify needs for ecosystem and water management, and how to translate science to meet those needs, &lt;br/&gt;2) an assessment of how long term changes in those climate features identified as management-relevant in the decision analysis, play out in terms of day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year weather and &lt;br/&gt;3) application of hydroclimate information to problems in water resources and ecosystem management in the monsoon region and ecosystem management in the Plains.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolution of near term climate due to both natural variability and forced change will be considered, including changes in frequencies and locations of storms, lengths of dry spells, extreme wet or dry years, seasonality etc.  Observational records and Reanalyses, including the 20th Century Reanalysis, will be analyzed as well as the models participating in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5.  Long control runs and last millennium simulations will allow an unprecedented assessment of the range of natural variability of hydroclimate and archiving of daily data will allow a pioneering assessment of how climate change impacts weather in the near term future.  The geographic area of focus extends from the Pacific coast to the Great Plains and from Canada into Mexico; the research effort will consider large-scale climate features and short term weather and how these features may shift in time and space, influencing the landscapes and ecoregions of the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Western North America is a region that has long experienced major swings in climate, droughts and extended wet periods.  It is now also undergoing major climate, hydrological and ecological change due to human interventions in the climate system and ecosystems.  Climate models confidently predict these changes will intensify over coming decades to levels that will pose significant challenges to society and transform ecosystems.  This project explored how climate, hydrology, and ecology have changed in the West over past decades and centuries and how they will evolve in the future.  The work was performed from the perspective of aiding decision making in water, land, and ecosystem management.   Much of our work focused on drought and its impacts.  Our work identified changes in tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures as a cause of the recent record-breaking drought in California but also determined that human-induced greenhouse warming made the drought worse (Figure 1).  That drought came against the background of persistent drought across the entire southwest since the late 1990s that we showed is one of the worst in the past millennium and that has been made particularly severe because of greenhouse warming (Figure 2).  Our work also identified the detailed physical mechanisms whereby rising greenhouse gases impact the hydrological cycle across North America and causes a widespread spring drying that will stress water resources and extend the summer fire season.   Another significant thrust of work was coupling between ecosystems and hydrological change in the context of rising greenhouse gases.  We showed that earth-system models predict that increasing temperatures across the West and rising carbon dioxide will encourage vegetation growth that will partition a larger fraction of precipitation into evapotranspiration and leave less water to recharge soil moisture and flow into streams, i.e. less water for human use - a "greening but drying" response (Figure 3).  We emphasize that this is a model response that must be verified against observations to determine if the models are correct.  The complexity of the real ecosystems in the West has been examined linking climate variability and change to increases in area of forest burned and to outbreaks of bark beetles - system responses that may confound any simple relation between rising carbon dioxide, warming, and enhanced vegetation growth.  We have also extensively studied how climate variability and change are impacting streamflow in the West, as well as the number of ponds and ducks in the Prairie Pothole (PP) Region of the northern Plains, one of the world?s largest waterfowl habitats.  We have also conducted a detailed study of coupling between ecology, hydrology and meteorology in the region of southwest North America that has a dual green-up in spring and summer.  Our research into the 100th meridian, America's arid-humid divide, garnered much attention.  We showed just how real this divide - first proposed by John Wesley Powell - is in terms of climate and hydrology and that it is strongly expressed in human settlement, land use, and the farm economy (Figure 4).  We showed how the arid-humid divide is moving east and will continue to do so and projected that this will lead to a restriction in planting of corn and an eastward expansion of wheat and rangelands, and an adjustment to fewer and larger farms, all else being equal.
