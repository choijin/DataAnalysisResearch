<AbstractNarration>This project will examine community response to abrupt environmental change through analysis of animal remains as they reflect subsistence practices and environmental conditions, from Tse-whit-zen, a previously excavated Lower Elwha Klallam village on the northwest coast of Washington, with occupation beginning around 2700 years ago and intensifying between about 1800-100 years ago.  This time period spans several high-magnitude earthquakes, the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climatic Anomaly, and a gradual increase in sheltered intertidal habitat.  The research team will explore how these events affected animal resources and different people within households and larger communities over time, using predictions drawn from foraging theory. The extraordinary integrity of the deposits, the detailed geoarchaeological field recording of deposits, the large and rigorously collected faunal samples from 7 time periods, and volumetrically comparable samples of birds, fish, shellfish, and mammals at Tse-whit-zen offer a high-resolution record of past human use of animal resources that is unparalleled in the North Pacific.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project will provide models, methods and results of direct relevance to scholars working on Arctic systems and processes, given the parallels and direct linkages between the Northwest Coast and areas to the north. In both regions, boat-mobile foragers with maritime subsistence focused on fish, shellfish, and marine mammals, have adapted to complex, dynamic coastlines affected by periodic environmental, geomorphic and climatic changes.  Global circulation patterns link the North Pacific and Arctic Oceans and migratory species bridge the two areas. Our project also provides an ideal comparative case study for the Global Human Ecodynamics Alliance, an NSF funded initiative developed to link Arctic Polar Ecodynamics to the broader global context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be valuable to the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe who were integrally involved in the excavation of the Tse-whit-zen site, are concerned about the future of the site and the collection. The researchers will share faunal data, publications and professional insights with tribal educators, wildlife managers, and cultural specialists involved in planning a museum. They will also be collaborating with local and state governmental agencies that will develop educational materials from our results, to meet a growing need to prepare the public for future earthquake-related events. The researchers anticipate that their work documenting fine-scale animal response to earthquakes, climate change, local shoreline change, and human exploitation strategies for several ?species of concern? (e.g. salmonids, ground fish, sea mammals) will assist current wildlife management efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A team of researchers have recently completed their National Science funded project which studied remains excavated in 2004 from &#268;&#7727;xwic&#601;n (pronounced ch-WHEET-son), the traditional village of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe of Northwest Washington State.  Located on the shore of Port Angeles Harbor, the village site received national attention when it was inadvertently discovered during the construction of a large dry dock by the Washington State Department of Transportation.   The project was terminated after construction activities and the mitigation excavation disinterred remains of over 300 individuals, causing tribal members profound pain. At the same time, the process of the mitigation project fostered tribal links to cultural traditions and the ancestral village site itself, which had been attenuated since Loqwe Elwha people were displaced from the harbor in the 19th-early 20th centuries. Thus, &#268;&#7727;xwic&#601;n provided an opportunity for healing trauma tied to colonialism.   The extensive excavation shows people occupied the coastal settlement for close to 2700 years.  Work also documented multiple plankhouses, a type of large wooden structure that Indigenous people on the north Pacific coast occupied.  The fieldwork generated one of the largest collections of archaeological animal remains on the north Pacific coast.  The NSF team wanted to study the resilience of people and the village community in the face of recurring catastrophic events like tsunamis and climate change.  They explored these questions by studying the bones and teeth (of mammals, fish, birds) and shellfish (from clams, mussels, etc.), which are the residue from everyday meals and ritual feasts as well as tool making.  Because animal foods are critical to human survival, if animals were greatly affected by tsunamis or climate change, then people would have been affected too.       The team identified over 1.2 million animal bones and teeth, and shells from invertebrates.  Their analyses show that Indigenous people relied on over 100 species of shellfish, fish, birds, and mammals for millennia.    Especially important animals include:  -          Herring, sculpin, cod, sablefish/black cod, salmon  -          Butter and little-neck clams, mussels, sea urchin  -          Murres, ducks, gulls    -          Deer, elk, dog, northern fur seal, whale, sea otter  This wide range in animals illustrates how well Indigenous people knew their environment, where and when to get certain creatures to support substantial village populations.     The village occupation spans large-magnitude earthquakes, tsunamis, periods of climate change, and changes in nearshore habitat. Close analysis of geo-cultural laying of deposits joined with over 100 radiocarbon dates allowed for a detailed reconstruction of the environmental and human occupational history.
