<AbstractNarration>PI:  Devireddy&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CBET - 1261997 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes support for the ASME 2013 2nd Global Congress on Nanoengineeing for Medicine and Biology (NEMB) to take place February 4-6, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts.  &lt;br/&gt;               &lt;br/&gt;The NEMB 2013 mission is to bring together leading experts in biology, medicine, nano-materials, and engineering so as to review experimental methods, synthetic methods, results, models, computations, analyses and innovative methodologies for quantifying and treating medical disorders using engineering approaches. The combination of engineering and biology with a strong focus in medicine will be a hallmark of the planned event. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on the aim of enabling the participation of invited keynote speakers in Track 2: Nano-/Microfluidics in Biology and Medicine: Analysis, Diagnostics and Therapeutic by defraying their registration and travel costs. Technical contributions in Track 2 will consist of oral and poster presentations, including plenary and invited keynote talks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, Track 2 in NEMB 2013 will highlight research elucidating fundamental physicochemical mechanisms associated with microfluidic and nanofluidic phenomena as well as novel microfluidic and nanofluidic techniques for diagnostic, medical, biological, pharmaceutical, environmental, and chemical applications. Track 2 coverage spans a broad range of disciplines and topics, including protein chip, DNA chip, cell chip, lab-on-a-chip, bio-MEMS, biosensor, micro/nano mechanics, microfluidics, high-throughput screening technology, medical science, genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring and micro/nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together a diverse group of researchers and provide a cross-disciplinary forum enabling new research collaborations and synergistic interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstracts presented at the conference will be published on a CD and made available to the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the track chairs and plenary speakers are women.  And accommodations for woman with small children and persons with disabilities have been ensured.</AbstractNarration>
