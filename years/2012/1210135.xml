<AbstractNarration>This action funds Hadiyah-Nicole Green of The University of Alabama at Birmingham to conduct a research project, entitled "Gold nanoparticles and biodegradable thin films and the immune system," during the summer of 2012 at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.  The host scientist is Terry W. J. Steele.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in a new technique using nanotechnology to improve photothermal targeting of cells.  This technique hides nanoparticles from the immune system by embedding them within biodegradable thin films.  This method provides a way to target delivery of gold nanorods to only the desired cells and not to all cells.  Current methods for using nanoparticles have the undesirable result of uptake by the liver, spleen and kidney  which greatly limits the effectiveness of nanoparticles for use in a highly localized and minimally invasive approach to treat cancer.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
