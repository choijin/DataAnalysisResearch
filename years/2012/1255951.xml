<AbstractNarration>In the era beyond Moore's law, it will be imperative to consider improving resistance of integrated circuits to failures due to fabrication defects and variations, soft errors, and wearout as first-order considerations, to ensure economic viability of the semiconductor industry and robust operation of digital systems. This research will develop and demonstrate the benefits of a new multi-layered approach - spanning circuit, micro-architecture, instruction-set architecture, system, and user layers - for improving resistance to failures caused by fabrication, soft errors, and wearout. An approach to characterize user-layer impact of failures within each module will be developed to dramatically reduce overdesign and overtesting in future failure resistant systems. This research will also develop the first infrastructure to support systematic development of multi-layered approaches for failure resistance, including the first comprehensive models of layers, the first systematic method to identify candidate approaches and characterize their performance and overheads, and to derive globally optimal designs. This approach will identify efficient designs that will achieve failure resistance at uniquely low overheads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The utilitarian gains to society should be immediate and and are likely to be substantial. The methods and tools developed will provide significant improvements in yield, performance, robustness to soft errors, and system lifespan. This project will train students and industry experts in the science and art of of efficient failure resistance, and prepare them for the era beyond the end of Moore's law. The principle investigator will also distribute to the community of researchers and industry experts the models, framework, and tools to be developed as a result of this project.</AbstractNarration>

Higher fabrication defect rates decrease chip yield and hence decrease revenues; higher fabrication variations significantly degrade performance for increasing fractions of fabricated chips and hence also decrease revenues; higher incidences of soft errors increase incidences of system crashes and corruption of user data during chip?s operational life and hence are damaging; and increasing rates of degradation during operational life reduce lifespans of systems and can jeopardize critical missions.

In particular, we demonstrated the following.  1)       Our new cross-layered defect-tolerance approaches for a single core within a CPU chip increased performance-per-area for users by 13-36%. Our approaches cover every area-intensive module in modern CPU cores, namely caches (especially, the last-level cache (LLC)), floating-point units (FPUs), integer multipliers (iMULs), ALUs, and branch predictors.  2)       Our cross-layered defect-tolerance approaches for multicore CPUs fabricated in the existing and future technologies provide dramatic improvements in user performance-per-area. Our approaches achieve performance-per-area that are extremely close to the maximum possible.  3)       While our cross-layered approaches can achieve dramatic improvements, the absolute value of performance-per-area for the commonly predicted evolution path for chip architectures for future technologies, namely power-constrained evolution, decreases starting at the 11nm technology node.

To maximize the impact of our research, we focused on BTI aging in static random-access memories (SRAMs).  a)       We developed a new SRAM design method for aging. Our design method addresses one key characteristic of aging, namely differential aging, which occurs since, for most SRAM cells, the stored value is much more likely to be 0. We demonstrated that our new method dramatically decreases the aging quality loss (i.e., failures over chip?s lifetime), and slightly increases lifetime yield, at negligible increase in area.  b)       We developed new methods to test SRAMs for aging. To ensure that the lifetime aging quality loss is extremely low (10-100ppm is typically desired), we developed a new approach that, during post-fabrication testing, predictively detects aging failures that will occur with future use over the expected lifetime (say, over the next 60 months). Our approach, called wordline overdriving test (WODT), significantly outperforms the best existing approach, namely low-voltage testing.                  We are continuing this research in a new project where we are developing completely new methods and tools for aging.
