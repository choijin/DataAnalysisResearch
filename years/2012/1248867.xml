<AbstractNarration>The innovation is a software engine that empowers emergency managers to analyze and process the high volume of incoming citizen messages (e.g., inquiries, calls for help, etc.) on the emergency manager's social media site(s) (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), typically experienced after an emergency alert is issued over one or more social media sites. The core of the Internet-connected software engine consists of two algorithms: a multivariate matching algorithm and a natural language processing algorithm. The matching algorithm optimally selects, based on a number of parameters, other emergency managers who can collaborate with the affected jurisdiction's emergency manager on handling the incoming messages. The natural language processing algorithm is employed to reorder incoming messages based on an intelligent keyword-driven prioritization method. The reprioritization is necessary since certain messages warrant more immediate attention than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the innovation will be the societal benefit of enhancing the nation's emergency notification capability and effectiveness, which in turn bolsters the nation's emergency preparedness and response efforts, potentially saving lives during life-threatening emergencies. Emergency managers currently using social media for emergency alerting will attest to its power as an alerting tool in terms of reaching targeted citizens quickly, inexpensively, and with detailed information; while immediately establishing two-way communication with citizens for the purpose of receiving requests for assistance as well as eyewitness and first-hand accounts of situational developments. Yet, the same emergency managers will warn that the already large number of incoming messages is growing as more citizens join their social media accounts, which will eventually make it unviable/unsustainable for emergency managers to manually process all the incoming messages, especially during period after the alert is issued, when their efforts are focused on responding to the emergency incident. The proposed activity is aimed at developing an intelligent collaboration-based system that will keep the social media message-processing workload manageable during emergency response periods. The insurance-inspired business model for the service ensures affordability to emergency managers and commercial success for the business.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Social media is a new and promising frontier for emergency management, with social media offering several advantages in the context of disseminating emergency alerts to the public. However, there is a significant increase in the workload for Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs); during and after a disaster; in terms of monitoring and responding to messages in the aftermath of issuing an alert on social media.  The objective of the project was to investigate the technical feasibility of a SaaS application, referred to as Social Media Alerting Resources Technology (SMART), which eliminates resource-intensive work related to social media tasks for EOCs, during and after disaster events. The said elimination is accomplished via automation and virtual staff augmentation.  Towards that objective, the research team set out to accomplish two high-level goals:  Build a proof-of-concept prototype for SMART that demonstrates its technical feasibility, while simultaneously serving as the first phase of developing a production version of SMART. Complete the research-oriented analysis and investigation related to the optimization engine (for identifying augmentation staff) and the natural language processing (NLP) engine (for pre-processing incoming messages); and translating the outcome of that research into actual software modules within the proof-of-concept prototype.    The first goal entailed strong engagement with potential users so help make the proof-of-concept prototype a direct first step towards the production version. This had three direct implications. First the overall design of the prototype was modular so that as individual components of it (e.g., the optimization algorithm) would be improved afterwards, by simply replacing one version of a module with another. Second, the underlying database was designed using a relational model for the benefit of future flexibility, scalability, and extensibility in the production version.
