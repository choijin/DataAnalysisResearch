<AbstractNarration>The nature of dark energy is one of the fundamental astrophysical questions of our time. This project will address the computing challenges of current and upcoming cosmological surveys which will seek to answer this question. The research activities will focus on weak gravitational lensing, in which the signal is the distortion of images of distant galaxies, caused by gravitational perturbations of photon paths as they travel through space. The interpretation of these data is a computationally intensive process: the shapes of the raw galaxy images must be accurately determined, taking into account correlated systematic effects such as distortions due to the atmosphere and telescope optics. For the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project, this process must be performed on-line on around one billion separate objects per night. Once these results are in hand, there is the further challenge of processing them: comparing theory to various statistics derived from the observations can give quantitative insight into fundamental aspects of the universe: its expansion history, the growth of structure, and the nature of the dark matter and dark energy which together make up 95% of the energy-content of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great strides have been made in addressing the computational aspects of weak lensing measurement and analysis. Unfortunately, many current methods will have difficulty scaling to the size of future surveys. LSST will image the entire southern sky every three nights over the course of ten years, producing an astronomical database of unprecedented size. Analysis of these data will require the use of new database architectures with new, purpose-built parallel algorithms. The current project will address those issues by fostering a close link between computer science and the "domain sciences" like astronomy. The work will take place within the Database Research Group in the Computer Science&amp;  Engineering department at University of Washington (UW), with close ties to the Survey Science Group in the Astronomy Department at UW. This project will contribute fundamental results both in computational and astronomical science, mainly through the development of techniques within the new SciDB parallel data processing engine to address specific computational hurdles for cosmological research with LSST. This research is vital to the science goals of LSST: current methods will not scale to the size of the survey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this research will reach beyond astronomy to other domain sciences. Many domain sciences are currently producing data at an increasing rate. Scientists in a variety of fields are beginning to see the need for close collaboration with computer scientists who have experience in the methods required to store, access, and process their data. At the same time, computer scientists who are pushing the limits of computation often lack access to datasets on which to test their methods. The PI will foster interdisciplinary connections by developing a seminar in data-intensive computing, geared toward graduate students in a broad array of disciplines. In addition the PI will build on his volunteer experience with Seattle's Pacific Science Center Science Communication Fellow program, which seeks forums for scientists to share their research with the broader public. Through ongoing involvement in this program, he will continue to share the exciting results of data-intensive astronomy with members of the community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Though this was a three-year fellowship grant; I gave up the funding after one year to pursue other opportunities. During the single year of support, the grant supported research and other work that was an essential piece of my being hired to my current full-time research position; for this and many other reasons I consider the fellowship to have been a resounding success. This fellowship was unique because of its interdisciplinary nature, and I embraced this: I spread my time between research in astronomy &amp; astrophysics, scalable computation, statistics, and machine learning. This interdisciplinarity led to many opportunities to speak, write, and work within communities that I otherwise would not have had contact with. This led to broader impacts beyond my own field of research. The primary tangible outcomes of this year of funding were the following:  I worked on research at the intersection of astronomy, astrophysics, statistics, and large-scale computation, and published five research papers and numerous informal blog posts during 2013 on these various topics. I finished work on a graduate textbook on the subject of statistics for astronomy, which is now in print and being used for teaching these topics in departments around the world. I began teaching an annual course at the University of Washington on the subject of effective computational practice for scientific researchers; this has continued beyond the end of the grant. I wrote and contributed to several open source scientific projects and code libraries, which together are used by tens of thousands of people throughout both academia and industry. I developed curriculum on the topic of machine learning, using the software tools I have created and contributed to. This curriculum is meant for use in half-day and day-long workshops. Since 2012, I have used this curriculum on dozens of occasions within both the astronomy community and the industry/tech community.   The less tangible outcome of the year of support was the further development of my focus as an interdisciplinary researcher and data scientist: I have continued to spend my time building tools for effective computational research, have continued bridging the divide between different academic and non-academic disciplines, and have continued to teach and advocate for the open and reproducible research practices that are essential to real scientific progress.
