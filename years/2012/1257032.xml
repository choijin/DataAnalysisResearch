<AbstractNarration>Global climate change, changes in forest management practices, and changes in pollutants in the atmosphere will all interact to alter forest productivity and return of plant litter (for example, leaf fall) to the forest floor over time.  However, it is not known whether the amount of organic matter in soils will change in proportion to changes in litter inputs, or whether there might be non-linear interactions that may lead to disproportional soil changes.  Understanding processes that increase or decrease soil organic matter is critical for understanding the global carbon balance, as carbon in soil organic matter amounts to more than the carbon stored in plant mass and in the atmosphere combined. The flux of carbon between soils and the atmosphere is also large, with the annual amount of carbon released from soils about 10 times that due to fossil fuel combustion.  The DIRT (Detrital Inputs and Removal Treatments) experiment, started at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon in 1997, is a long-term study where litter is manipulated either by increasing above-ground wood inputs, eliminating aboveground inputs, eliminating belowground (root) inputs, or eliminating both above- and belowground inputs.  The experiment is designed to address such questions as: What controls the long-term storage of carbon in forest soils?  What chemical and physical parts of SOM are most stable?  Can added inputs increase soil carbon storage, or is maximum soil carbon storage more determined by climate and soil mineral makeup?  Monitoring changes in carbon storage in the DIRT plots will generate a time course of carbon stabilization and loss under the different treatments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the mechanisms that control soil carbon is vital not only to forest management, but also to the accurate prediction of feedbacks from forests to climate change.  The DIRT experiment is unique to environmental science and uniquely suited to explore the role of litter quality and quantity in determining stabilization of soil carbon, a significant unknown in current ecosystem models.  In this project, focus will also be placed on training of undergraduate Honors students, with results incorporated into a required Honors Ecology course at Oregon State University.  The project will leverage the Long-Term Ecological Research program at the Andrews Forest for outreach to forest managers and the public.  Both the project data and the sampled soils will be made freely available to researchers across the world.  The long-term core data are already available on the Andrews Forest web site and the DIRT web site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Soil organic matter (SOM) controls many critical ecosystems functions.  It is a primary energy source for many belowground processes, it accounts for virtually all of the ecosystem C and N reserve, it provides cation exchange and water holding capacity, and it acts as a major control on soil pH.  SOM also strongly promotes soil aggregation, which in turn accounts for soil drainage and stability.  Soil C accumulation and turnover are important processes globally: soils contain about 1.5 x 1018 g C, which is 2&#8209;3 times that in vegetation.  Thus, any change in rates of soil C turnover will markedly affect the global C cycle.  Changes in litter input quantity and quality are expected under most scenarios of global climate change, but the resulting effects on SOM stability and turnover cannot now be predicted accurately.  To address this gap, we established long-term studies of controls on soil organic matter formation in an old growth coniferous forest at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, OR.  In our Detrital Input and Removal Treatment (DIRT) plots, treatments include doubled annual needle inputs (a high quality litter input), doubled woody debris (low quality inputs), and removals of aboveground, belowground, or both above- and belowground inputs.     The central goal of the DIRT project is to assess how rates and sources of plant litter inputs control the accumulation and dynamics of organic matter and nutrients in forest soils over decadal time scales.  The project examines processes at multiple levels, across decades and centuries, exploring the intricate interconnections of biology and chemistry that lead to the formation of humic materials over these hitherto unexplored long time spans.   We initially predicted that increased inputs of high quality materials, such as low C:N needle litter, would increase soil C stabilization as mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM), in accordance with current biogeochemical theory.  We also predicted that increased inputs of low-quality litter, such as woody debris, would lead to increases in light fraction, or particulate organic matter (POM), but would not affect MAOM.  However, increasing double litter led to a similar effect from priming by the high-quality material as from increased stabilization, leading to no discernable change in SOC in plots with added needle inputs. As a side effect of the doubled wood treatment and the associated change in bulk density, root mass was previously found to have approximately doubled in the doubled wood 0-10 cm treatment soil.  This increase in root mass in the doubled wood soil coincided with a substantial decline in MAOM, which we suggest is due to increased priming and mining of MOAM by rhizosphere activity, likely also due to lowered N availability in these plots due to immobilization of N by the high C:N woody inputs.  Future work on N dynamics and priming will confirm these results.  We also predicted that treatment plots without root inputs would result in decreased MAOM and SOC overall, as roots have been widely reported to be more significant to SOM formation than aboveground litter inputs.  The greatest surprise in this DIRT experiment has been that plots without roots actually showed significant increases in MAOM.  We are hypothesizing that removal of rhizosphere activity stopped the most significant source of priming.  During these first 20 years, the large influx of dead roots still supported MAOM formation by microbes even as priming was curtailed.  Future research will show if this trend continues, or if the continued removal of rhizosphere activity buffers SOC from loss.
