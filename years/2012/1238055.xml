<AbstractNarration>PROGRAM DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP 1238055 &lt;br/&gt;University of Arkansas &lt;br/&gt;Meller &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for a third five-year term (Phase III) of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) at the University of Arkansas. CELDi is a university-based enterprise that provides innovative solutions for logistics and distribution excellence with its member organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of CELDi resides in the unique logistics and distribution models and tools that are created through Center research. The models and tools are tailored to the specific organizations and also generalized for dissemination into the academic sphere. As an applied research and education consortium, CELDi is a partnership amongst the National Science Foundation (NSF), nine major research universities and upwards of 30 member organizations in the commercial, military and government sectors of the economy. CELDi proposes to build on the success of its Phase II award and to capitalize on a Phase-III award to move from Good to Great and long-term financial viability by a)increasing its name recognition to provide a mechanism to grow CELDi, b)leveraging the substantial collective research expertise of the Center, and c)investing in current student researchers to better serve its member organizations and the logistics and distribution fields of the future. The success of CELDi's initiatives will be measured by the verifiable impact of the proposed centers research on commercial and public sector member organizations, the value created through synergy of our member organizations and member universities, and the professional success of all personnel involved in the center's endeavors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two main, broader impacts of CELDi. The first is demonstrating that a model of applied research conducted in member organization facilities is a successful technology transfer mechanism in terms of assisting the members to achieve logistics and distribution excellence. The other main, broader impact of CELDi research relates to students. CELDi has instituted a number of mechanisms that focus on developing student skills, from one-on-one mentoring sessions, group mentoring sessions, pairings of students and IAB members at lunches, a best-poster contest, and roundtable topics associated with IAB student connections. This direct impact on current university students is supplemented through RET projects that allow CELDi to also impact the next generation of university students. CELDi will also continue its efforts to increase the pool of talented students from under-represented groups by actively recruiting and engaging such students. Over the past five years, CELDi research has led to fourteen "CELDi Success Story Awards," which are defined as projects that "have significant, verifiable impact on the partnering organization(s)." Over the next five years, it is expected that over 20 "success stories" will be achieved and over 200 student careers will be enhanced through CELDi activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) is a university-based enterprise providing innovative solutions for logistics and distribution excellence with member organizations.  CELDi started in 2002 with an I/UCRC Phase-I award. The Phase-II award was granted in 2007, and the Phase-III award granted in 2012. At the close of the Phase-III award, CELDi has graduated from the NSF I/UCRC program and has the following active universities in the graduated center: University of Arkansas, University of Missouri, Kansas State University, Oregon State University, Oklahoma State University, and Virginia University.  Logistics and distribution networks (e.g. supply chains, multi-modal transportation networks, etc.) are complex systems that play a critical role in the delivery of goods and services.  Logistics and distribution networks have a huge economic impact within the United States.  For example, there is an estimated 48 million tons of freight moved every day valued at over $46 billion.  The logistics industry represents the second largest employment sector within the U. S., with over 6 million people working in the industry with projected substantial employment opportunities into the foreseeable future. Companies, such as Amazon, Boeing and Wal-Mart, are global leaders because their logistics and distribution networks are designed to meet increasing customer service expectations. Meeting these customer expectations requires an engineering workforce that can develop sophisticated solutions involving technological and engineered systems. Technologies such as the Internet of Things, GPS, smartphones, flexible robotics, additive manufacturing, augmented reality and wearables are disrupting the logistics industry.  In addition, the unprecedented volumes of data involving customer behavior, transactions, and tracking information are propelling disruptive innovations involving artificial intelligence and optimization applications that can improve the control and execution of these systems.  CELDi research has focused on bringing quantitative solutions to problems within this industry including logistics systems analysis and design (45% of research portfolio), supply chain modeling (30% of research portfolio), within facility material flow design and improvement (15% of research portfolio) and intelligent systems design and evaluation (10% of research portfolio) The core competency of CELDi lies in the abilities of its researchers to use mathematical and computer based models to abstract logistics and distribution problems so as to provide insights into analysis and/or design questions.    CELDi also provides the foundation and structure for educating the next generation of engineers in logistics and distribution systems.   CELDi's impact has been substantial over its 15 plus years of operating as an active I/UCRC.  Funding: $37.4 M total, $3.1 M per year Students: 874 total, 73 per year Faculty: 519 total, 43 per year Industry Members: 307 total, 26 per year Projects: 336 total, 28 per year Publications: 287 total, 24 per year Presentations: 561 total, 47 per year More than 90 different companies over time 13 different universities involved over time   Through this activity faculty and students have been exposed to real problems and industrial partners.  Industrial partners have been provided education and new solutions that have saved millions of dollars in operating costs and resulted in new products and services.  For example, CELDi projects have saved companies a projected amount of over $70 million.  Industry partners have gained access to talented students who have been educated on current logistics and distribution problems.  In addition, industry partners have networked with other organizations, developed innovations, and have been exposed to best practices within the development of research-based solutions.  CELDi delivers on the promise of an I/UCRC through member organization synergy and leveraging multiple funding sources for specific and generalized, basic and applied research.
