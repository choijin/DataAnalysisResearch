<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 12-29178&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Cappelleri, David; Backburn, Mark; Mordohai, Philippos; Valdevit, Antonio; Zavlanos, Michael M.&lt;br/&gt;Institution:      Stevens Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;Title:            MRI/Acq.: Large Volume, High Resolution Motion Capture System for an Interdisciplinary Research  Facility&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring a Vicon Motion Capture System, aims to support a wide range of technologies and systems including unmanned vehicles, embedded robotics, sensing, perception and visualization, and collaborative, cooperative, networked robotics. Adding critical capability to researchers, the instrumentation is expected to impact research projects in the following areas: &lt;br/&gt;- Micro aerial vehicles, Active Heterogeneous Sensor Teams, 3D Range Data Generation and Reconstruction, &lt;br/&gt;- Control of Mobile Robot Networks, Biomechanics, Human-Robot collaboration, Concept Engineering, and Concept of Operations Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the institution has initiated a wide range of interdisciplinary high-risk, high payoff technologies and systems, the instrumentation fosters a multidisciplinary research-intensive learning environment. Utilizing highly responsive instrumentation to capture the nuances that can be missed by lesser systems, this work should advance the area of motion capture to the next generation. The instrumentation is also expected to greatly accelerate research progress in the multiple areas addressed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system impacts research projects in many emerging robotics, controls, and scientific areas of national and societal importance. The instrumentation supports a training environment and educational initiatives that contribute to increase the number of undergraduate and graduate students to the system and the research projects that leverage its capabilities. Enabled research will be incorporated into classes and outreach programs. This acquisition fosters further the integration of research and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is the acquisition of a large volume, real-time, high resolution, motion capture system for use in an interdisciplinary, multi-use, research facility.     Intellectual Merit:  Consistent with the U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Partnership agenda of investing in next-generation robotics and the resulting National Robotics Initiative, robotics, automation, controls, and embedded systems research is a major strategic research area of Purdue University. The proposed motion capture system strongly supports the research and education thrust in these areas, pursued by different faculty groups, who have been very successful in establishing strong research collaborations. The acquisition of the requested system will and has made significant impact ongoing research projects in the specific areas of: micro aerial vehicles, active heterogeneous sensor teams, 3D range data generation and reconstruction, control of mobile robot networks, biomechanics, intelligent prosthetics, and human-robot collaboration.  Regular access to the large-volume, real-time, high-resolution capabilities of the requested motion capture system, not previously available, will help in greatly accelerating research progress in each of these areas.       Broader Impacts:  The requested system adds a critical capability to the researchers at Purdue University and the surrounding area, which will directly impact research projects spanning many emerging robotics, controls, and scientific areas of national and societal importance. Given the strong multidisciplinary team of researchers assembled for this project and the interdisciplinary research projects that the equipment will support, the MRI will significantly impact the research-training environment while directly supporting educational initiatives at Purdue. These initiatives strongly couple to the technical merit of the acquisition by greatly increasing the number of undergraduate and graduate students exposed to the proposed system and the research projects leveraging its capabilities.  The PI team has a history of integrating undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented student populations, into their research activities. Research enabled by the requested system will also be incorporated into outreach programs being developed and taught at Purdue.       Outcomes:  A motion capture system from Vicon Motion Systems was installed in the Perception Based Engineering (PBE) Lab at the Herrick Laboratories on the campus of Purdue University in Spring 2014.     The PBE Lab is a 43Æ x 28Æ x 20Æ space that is now configured for the simultaneous motion tracking and control of multiple UAV and ground robots. The room is also vibration isolated. Additionally, the lighting, temperature (55F-85F), humidity (20% to 80%) and sound can be finely controlled, thus simulating various types of environments. The coupling of such a facility with the motion capture system creates a truely unique and novel lab space.   Operational and safety procedures to use the system were written and approved in Fall 2014. There have been 11 undergraduate and graduate student users of the system from 3 different research groups with over 215 logged hours using the system in the past 12 months. The acquired system and facility has been used a basis for 13 collaborative proposal submissions totaling over $9M since the award was made; 1 recently funded DoD project has resulted The lab is a regular tour stop/demo location when various groups visit campus. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated and used to inspire prospective students to pursue education in the STEM fields.
