<AbstractNarration>This project will strengthen the organizational and technical infrastructure of the Center for Historical Information and Analysis (http://chia.pitt.edu), a multi-institutional collaborative of scholars in social, natural, and information sciences structured as a Research Collaborative and a Headquarters. The Research Collaborative links participating institutions that are collecting data on population, climate, and other topics with a crowdsourcing tool to demonstrate the feasibility of building a continuously growing collection of diverse historical data and metadata. The Headquarters assembles and develops knowledge on repository design to develop a repository sufficient to house the incoming data and permit global and interactive analysis. The Center for Historical Information and Analysis?s future plans include expanding its collection and processing of historical data, broadening its community of social and natural science researchers, analyzing historical patterns of global change, and sharing its resources with researchers, policy-makers, teachers and students. CHIA is headquartered at the University of Pittsburgh with participating research groups at Boston University, Harvard University, Michigan State University, and University of California-Merced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand global social patterns as they exist today, it is increasingly clear that we need to understand how they have evolved over recent centuries. The Center for Historical Information and Analysis responds to this need and takes historical analysis into the realm of Big Data. It is expected that the data resources will grow to several terabytes in size. This project will stimulate development of more efficient research collaborations, enabling systematic large-scale consolidation of diverse historical data sources. Once collected and integrated, the data repository and analytical system will allow scholars to address a wider set of questions testing hypotheses about long-term and short-term social change at the global scale and catalyzing an expansion of the evidence base in social sciences. For example, our understanding of important societal issues can advance by linking health to demography and by incorporating climate and health factors into economic studies. Disciplinary theory will advance through interaction among the various scientific fields, so that a global network of social-science researchers will emerge.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report: "Collaborative Research: Collaborative for Historical Information and Analysis" &ndash; March 2016  NSF - BCC Award 1244796; Funding Period: 01/01/2015 - 12/31/2015  Siddharth Chandra, Principal Investigator   Collaborating Institutions: University of Pittsburgh (1244672), Harvard University (1244667), University of California &ndash; Merced (1244282), Michigan State University (1244796), Boston University (1244693).  Project Objectives:  The Collaborative for Historical Information and Analysis (CHIA) proposed creation of an infrastructure to ingest, house, and analyze historical data on global society. Work was divided between a Headquarters at the University of Pittsburgh and a Research Collaborative of five institutions, including the Asian Studies Center at Michigan State University (MSU).  Deliverable 1: an Expanding Repository. CHIAÆs Headquarters planned to deliver a repository sufficient to house incoming historical data and permit global and interactive analysis. This involved designing and constructing a repository to integrate discrete social-science datasets into larger units, populating it with incoming data, demonstrating the repositoryÆs ability to expand as data submissions increase, and conducting the initial set of global historical analyses. Deliverable 1 was not part of the agenda of the MSU project site.  Deliverable 2: Growing Data Collection. The Research Collaborative planned to create a collaborative team and crowdsourcing application for ingesting data and metadata, collecting and submitting data on population, climate, and other topics; and recruiting users to locate, submit, and document growing quantities of relevant historical data for analysis within the repository. The MSU project site focused on this aspect of the project, identifying, acquiring, entering, cleaning, and documenting a variety of historical statistical datasets from Asia.  Site-specific Objectives. The site-specific objectives of the Michigan State University (MSU) site, located in the Asian Studies Center at MSU, included (i) identifying and acquiring historical statistical data on key themes, including demography, health, and economics, (ii) entering and cleaning those data, (iii) documenting the data for the end-user, and (iv) working with the University Pittsburgh project coordinating site to make the datasets available to end-users via the Dataverse Network and to colleagues on the University of Pittsburgh coordinating site to facilitate testing of the software and protocols being used by the coordinating site to harmonize data. The datasets were selected on the basis of intersections with other datasets being prepared on one or more of the dimensions of time, geography, and theme (eg, health, demography). The topic of the influenza pandemic of 1918 was also selected for emphasis because of its global spread and potential implications for knowledge about global public health, including in the USA.    Site-specific Accomplishments:  The MSU project site focused on Deliverable 2 (see above), which involved growing the CHIA data collection. Accomplishments included:  Data Collection and Documentation (Deliverable 2a): Owing in significant part to contributions from the MSU project site, the CHIA Distributed Archive holds a growing quantity of historical datasets, increasingly linked to each other. Dataverse Network holds some 70 CHIA datasets on a wide range of historical processes. Worldwide datasets address socio-economic inequality, aspects of colonialism, and 20th-century linkages of population, climate, and politics. Regional datasets contributed by the MSU project site include data linking disease, population, and economy on a diverse array of Asian countries, primarily in the early 20th century. Asian countries represented include Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan.
