<AbstractNarration>The surface geology of the eastern United States is extraordinary in its complexity. This complexity reflects a wide range of tectonic processes that have operated in the region over the past billion years, including episodes of subduction and rifting associated with two complete cycles of supercontinent assembly and breakup. A record of these processes is preserved in the geological units and topography we see at the surface today. It is unknown, however, how the crust and mantle lithosphere have responded to these tectonic forces over time, and whether and how the geological units preserved at the surface relate to deeper structures. The persistence of Appalachian topography through time remains a major outstanding problem in the study of landscape evolution. There is an ongoing interplay among erosion, topography, rock type, and mantle flow at depth that controls the structures we see at the surface today. However, understanding the complex role played by each of these factors requires better constraints on the history of topographic change and its relationship to the deep structure and dynamics of the mantle. Our project, known as the Mid-Atlantic Geophysical Integrative Collaboration (MAGIC), aims to address these fundamental questions about the geophysical evolution of the eastern United States by studying surface processes, crustal and lithospheric structure, and deep mantle flow across Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAGIC involves a collaborative effort among seismologists, geodynamicists, and geomorphologists. We are undertaking a two-year deployment of 28 broadband seismometers in a dense linear transect from the Atlantic coast to the continental interior. In combination with EarthScope USArray Transportable Array (TA) stations our experiment geometry will provide an opportunity to image isotropic and anisotropic crust and mantle structure from the coast to the continental interior in unprecedented detail, using techniques such as shear wave splitting, receiver function analysis, and tomographic inversions. The dense linear array allows us to target small-scale crustal and lithospheric variations for imaging. Our geodynamical modeling effort focuses on quantitatively testing several different hypotheses for the pattern of mantle flow by using 3-D, time-dependent, numerical models to make testable predictions about mantle anisotropy and surface topographic change, which will be tested against results from the seismology and geomorphology components of the project. The geomorphology component of the project uses quantitative stream profile data and cosmogenic isotopes to understand the history of erosion rates and topographic change throughout the Appalachian region. Insights into uplift history and the approach to equilibrium among lithology, topography, and erosion (and their spatial variation) will be compared to inferences on the mantle flow field and deep crustal and lithospheric structure gained from the geodynamics and seismology components of the project. Insight from all three efforts will be combined to obtain a vertically integrated picture of tectonic processes from the surface through the crust and mantle lithosphere to the asthenosphere and deeper mantle. The education and outreach component of this project focuses on the involvement of undergraduates in scientific research, opportunities for graduate students to mentor and advise undergraduate students, and forging ties with colleges and universities (including many primarily undergraduate institutions) in our study region that are not currently involved with the EarthScope initiative.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, eastern North America has undergone two complete cycles of supercontinent assembly and dispersal, with large mountain ranges forming and eventually eroding away and vast ocean basins forming and disappearing. The central Appalachian Mountains provide an ideal setting to study these fundamental tectonic processes and to understand how they have affected the deep structure of the crust and mantle. This project deployed a seismic array (known as MAGIC) across the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio to study the crust and mantle structure and to understand how that deep structure has been affected by past plate tectonic processes.</p> <p>Major outcomes of this project include several new findings that shed light on the structure and evolution of the central Appalachians. First, we find evidence for anomalous structure within the crust beneath Ohio and western West Virginia, along with evidence for surprisingly thick crust beneath the Appalachian Mountains. We interpret a major mid-crustal feature beneath the western part of our study area as a shear zone resulting from continental collision during the formation of the Rodinia supercontinent over one billion years ago. A second finding of this project is that the mantle lithosphere (that is, the stiff upper portion of the upper mantle that makes up the tectonic plate) beneath the central Appalachians is much thinner than expected beneath an old mountain range. This suggests that part of the mantle lithosphere has been removed and has been recycled back into the deep mantle. Our inference that the central Appalachians have undergone lithospheric loss in the geologic past is consistent with the presence of anomalous rocks in western Virginia that are unusually young (~50 million years old) considering that eastern North America has been located away from a plate tectonic boundary for the past 200 million years. A third major finding of this project is evidence for strong deformation of the mantle lithosphere by past tectonic processes, as evidenced by seismic anisotropy (or the directional dependence of seismic wavespeeds). We find evidence that the mantle lithosphere has been strongly deformed by both mountain building processes during the Appalachian Orogeny as well as by later continental rifting processes during the breakup of Pangea. This finding is important because it suggests that the mantle participates in mountain-building and rifting processes, implying that the deep structure of continental plates plays an important role in controlling tectonics and producing the geology that we see at the surface. Reconciling the findings of our study with previous work on the surface geology of the central Appalachians is an important avenue for future research.</p> <p>The broader impacts of our project encompass public outreach activities, student training, and the involvement of a number of educational institutions in EarthScope science. Specifically, our project provided hands-on scientific and field training to a large number of undergraduate and graduate students, including a large proportion of women and those who identify as members of historically underrepresented groups in science. We have worked with a large number of primarily undergraduate institutions in our field area, several of which hosted seismic stations, enabling their students to learn about EarthScope research. Results from our project and from the EarthScope initiative more generally have been incorporated into several talks aimed at general audiences, helping to increase public awareness of cutting-edge scientific research involving EarthScope in eastern North America.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/22/2019<br>      Modified by: David J.&nbsp;Mcgee</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1251329/1251329_10245403_1558545683592_yalefig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1251329/1251329_10245403_1558545683592_yalefig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1251329/1251329_10245403_1558545683592_yalefig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1 (from Aragon, J.
