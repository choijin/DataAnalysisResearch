<AbstractNarration>The Egyptian, Moroccan and Tunisian elections provide a unique - and fleeting - opportunity to explore a wide range of potential impacts of the "Arab Spring" and the ensuing transitions to democracy. This project will field surveys in these three countries as near to their elections as possible. The data that will be collected in this project will allow the examination of the impact of this process on networks and clientelism, religion and politics, and gender and mobilization among other topics.  This data will also provide policymakers with important insights into electoral strengthening and democratic transitions, especially with regards to Muslim countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regards to intellectual merit, the different contexts of the elections allow for the examination of the nature of clientelism and how this varies across social structures and political conditions.  Specifically,the researchers will examine whether electoral behavior in these contexts should be understood as one-to-one political exchanges, in which citizens and candidates exchange goods for votes, or as one of many exchanges in a web of relationships determined by competing social networks.  This will allow for a deeper understanding in countries with developing electoral institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, as part of a broader collaborative effort with scholars at Portland State University, Harvard University, and the University of Pittsburgh, the research will explore a number of other topics.  For example, how do new entrants in the political system differ from those who participated in elections under the preceding authoritarian regimes?  Does constituency service remain a salient consideration when citizens are uncertain about the future role of parliament?  How does political mobilization change in periods of high uncertainty?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regards to broader impacts, this study has a number of implications.  First, it will provide insights for policymakers on the role of elections in these newly emerging democratic regimes.  This is especially important given their location.  Second, it will provide baseline data for cross-temporal projects, wherein researchers can use the surveys and campaign observation interviews to assess changes in elections and, more broadly, representation as regimes change.  Third and finally, it will help establish and strengthen collaborative relationships with scholars and institutions in the Middle East.</AbstractNarration>

This research focused on understanding electoral behavior and political transitions in the immediate aftermath of the Arab uprisings of 2011. It included the implementation of nationally representative surveys surveys and campaign studies in Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.  The research demonstrated how the strategies of rule that authoritarian regimes employed prior to 2011 shaped public attitudes and dynamics during the transition period.  Parties and party systems varied in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya (which was studied with funding from NDI), depending on whether the former authoritarian regimes left behind parties that derived from social movements, previously loyal opposition parties or ruling parties.

The ancien regime also shaped the level of polarization. The surveys revealed a much higher level of polarization in Egypt, where there were strong divides between those holding Islamist and secularist positions, than in Tunisia and Libya.

In general, the polls revealed widespread uncertainty over the policy positions of political parties, low assessments in the partiesÆ organizations, and lack of confidence in their ability to rule.  The uncertainty and confusion was particularly high among older, less educated citizens, which helps explain why many became less likely to participate in elections during the transition period.

These continue to be analyzed and used in papers exploring theoretical issues regarding transitions, gender and politics, electoral behavior, and survey methodology.   Finally, the project led to capacity building, particularly in Tunisia. There, Ellen Lust and Lindsay Benstead partnered with a professor of statistics at the University of Carthage, Dhafer Malouche, teaching him survey methodology as they jointly trained a team and implemented the survey. This investment has paid off well.  Dhafer Malouche has subsequently worked on three surveys in collaboration with Ellen Lu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
