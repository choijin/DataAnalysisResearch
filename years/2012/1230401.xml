<AbstractNarration>The proposed research targets the investigation of techniques that enable using Threshold Logic (TL) circuits to implement Systems on a Chip (SoC) devices for embedded systems.  The project proposes to take a unified approach to simultaneously address TL circuit synthesis and TL gate design.  The work also plans to investigate TL based on nanodevices and the extension of TL to mixed signal circuits such as Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs). This work also represents the first collaborative project between these two sites of the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the proposed work have the potential to help the semiconductor industry produce more reliable and affordable microprocessors and SoC implementations. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the centers portfolio through collaboration of two of its sites. The PIs research will impact diverse undergraduate and graduate students as well as be used as a tool to recruit students to the field. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The use of cellphones, laptops, tablets, desktop computers, and numerous other digital devices has been expanding at an exponential rate for several decades.  Although miniaturization has resulted in reducing the energy consumption of individual transistors, the exponential increase in the number of transistors within the same chip area, has resulted in a steady increase in the total energy consumption.  A simple manifestation of this is the heating of cellphone after prolonged and continuous use.  As a result of nearly two decades of research and development on ways to reduce power consumption of digital systems hardware, the field appears to be saturated, and no fundamentally new technique at the circuit or logic level has been proposed for over a decade.   This project has taken a radically different approach to reducing power consumption that has not been previously considered.  The intellectual merit of this project is a the development of a radically new approach to the design of digital circuits based on threshold logic.  Although the concepts underlying threshold logic and their potential value in reducing area and delay of digital logic has been theorized for nearly four decades, there have never been an attempt of designing threshold logic gates that can be seamlessly integrated into existing digital systems.  Moreover, no one has previoulsy demonstrated how to use such logic gates automatically to improve the performance, power and area of digital systems.  In general, most techniques for reducing power consumption come at a significant price, namely reduction in speed. A significant achievement of our approach is that it achieves substantial power reduction without sacrificing speed or area. Moreover, unlike many other techniques for power reduction that have never been incorporated into the mainstream design, our approach has been fashioned to be seamlessly integrated into existing commercial design methodologies, paving the way of easy adoption by industry.   The broader impacts of this research are many. First, it has great commercial potential for many microelectronics market segments -- a path that is being pursued by the PI.  Second, the successful adoption of this technology will result in substantial reduction in power consumption without sacrificing performance.  This is fundamentally important for all microelectronic market segments, including mobile, battery powered systems such as cellphones, and tablets, desktop computers, and servers in datacetners.  A major impact would be for the emerging field of internet of things (IoT), especially in the domain of wearable electronic systems that require high performance and low power.  Third, a successful commercialization will contribute to the economic health of the US, as this is likely to create new jobs and opportunties in the high technology sector with a emergence of a startup. Fourth, reducing power consumption without sacrificing performance will contribute to the energy efficiency of the nation's electronic systems.    The key outcomes of this effort have been: (1) development of a novel circuit architecture for threshold logic cells; (2) development of new software tools that can automatically optimize existing digitial circuits using the new threshold logic cells, resulting in substantial reductions in power; (3) the development of a design methodology that fits within the existing practices of industry; (4) new architectures for field programmable logic arrays using threshold logic that achieves significant improvement in energy-delay product; (5) new architectures for non-volatile computation by the integration of emerging devices such as RRAMs and STT-MTJ devices with threshold logic; (6) the use of threshold logics to completely obfuscate the function of a circuit, so protect circuit IP from being copied.
