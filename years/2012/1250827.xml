<AbstractNarration>This project will examine the professional trajectories of public interest lawyers, who play crucial roles in allowing access to legal remedies and problem solving.  Previous research has found that many students come to law school seeking public interest careers but do not ultimately pursue them; even those who do frequently change paths. This study will be the first to investigate what influences those who persevere through law school and beyond in their quest to become public interest lawyers. Since equal access to justice is a significant aspect of how the legal profession understands itself, explaining choice and persistence in public interest careers is significant to explaining the practices of the profession.  Therefore, the project's intellectual merit rests in its contribution to understanding an empirical puzzle in the sociology of the professions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study graduates of law schools that vary according to student population and whether the institutions  are public or private. It will survey students who graduated in 2001-05 to investigate how career choices are influenced by background prior to law school (family, schooling, work, and volunteer activity), law school experience (academic performance, externships and clinics, extracurricular activities, summer jobs, volunteer activities, leadership roles), and experience in each position after graduation, as well as changes in personal circumstances (marriage, divorce, children, responsibility for other family members, educational debt and other financial circumstances). By comparing the career paths of all graduates, the goal is to identify the factors associated with sustained public interest commitment and relate them to different types of careers in the public and private sectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's findings will have significant broader impact; it will provide useful information concerning career choice within the legal profession, of particular importance at a time of extensive reconsideration of education to the profession.  It will also enable law schools to make effective use of scarce resources to support innovative curricula and financial aid programs, such as scholarships and loan assistance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ever since social scientists began studying access to justice a half century ago, they documented the lack of lawyers for unrepresented individual and group clients. At the same time, they made the surprising finding that a large number of those who enter law school seek to serve such clients, but relatively few of them do so after graduation.   This project sought to understand the latter phenomenon, known as "public interest drift." We surveyed 15,000 2001-10 graduates of six California law schools (UC Berkeley and Los Angeles, Santa Clara, Southerwestern, Stanford, and USC), which differed along several variables: public/private; secular/religious, geography,  elite/prestige/regional, and whether they had publci interest programs. We obtained robust response rates of 21-32%. We sought to understand which of the respondents held public interest positions at any time after graduation and which performed pro bono servicesor otherwise contributed money or time.  We looked at three kinds of explanations for these outcomes: endowment (the characteristics and experiences that students brought with them to law school), education (what they did in law school), and environment (each of the positions they held after graduation).  We have a number of preliminary findings. First, as a cohort, more graduates have public interest careers at time of interview than at time of first job (which could have been up to six years earlier), suggesting that graduates may move from private sector positions into public interest positions as time from graduation lengthens.  Second, sticking with a public interest career is more common among elite law school graduates than among those from prestige or regional law schools.  Third, although prior studies found significant relationships between individual characteristics and public interest career choices, our data suggest that challenging life experiences, as well as college and law school experiences, mitigate the relationship between individual characteristics and public interest career choices.  Fourth, mentorship was more important to career choice for public interest graduates than for other graduates, and public interest oriented students who had mentors felt supported and well-trained by their law schools compared to public interest oriented students who did not have mentors.  That is, mentorship seemed to mitigate the "negative socialization" identified by prior studies of public interest commitment.   We plan to explore in greater depth the factors that contribute not only to public interest career choice but also to other measures of public interest support such as pro bono hours and financial donations to legal aid organizations and the like.  We also will analyze the effect of debt and debt forgiveness programs on public interest commitment, all else being equal.  The long term plan is to use multivariate analysis to estimate the relative contribution of these factors to public interest career choice and commitment.
