<AbstractNarration>Trinity College, in partnership with the Hartford Public School System, the Connecticut Chapter of the Computer Science Teachers Association, and other Hartford area high schools, will train approximately 30 Connecticut high school teachers to teach Advanced Placement (AP) computing courses in Connecticut high schools that currently do not teach AP computer science. The course will be based on a mobile Computer Science Principles curriculum, Mobile CSP, which uses the new mobile computing language, App Inventor for Android, to provide a rigorous, programming-based introduction to computational thinking. The main research question addressed is whether the Mobile CSP curriculum is an effective way to teach CS Principles and whether it can serve as one model to help train teachers for the CS 10K project. The curriculum is project-based and takes a constructionist approach to learning computing -- i.e., students learn through constructing their own artifacts and mental models. Student projects will focus on building socially useful, place-based mobile apps using the App Inventor programming language. In this way, student learning will be associated closely with their interests and grounded in their schools, their homes, and their communities. The curriculum, which was developed and tested at Trinity College and the Greater Hartford Academy of Mathematics and Science (GHAMAS) as one of the Phase 2 pilot courses for the College Board's CS Principles project, will be carefully evaluated along several dimensions, including its efficacy at improving programming and problem solving skills and its impact on student and teacher attitudes toward computer science education. The Mobile CSP project has three main goals: (i) To develop a rigorous computer science principles AP curriculum based on mobile computing; (ii) to teach it to Connecticut teachers in 6-week summer workshops; and (iii) to support participating teachers in their effort to implement the AP pilot courses in Connecticut schools that do not currently teach AP computer science. The 2013-2014 cohort of teachers will be drawn primarily from the Hartford school district, a district whose students come mostly from demographic and socio-economic backgrounds that have been underrepresented in computer science. In years two and three the project will expand to other, similarly situated, Connecticut cities and towns.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Mobile Computer Science Principles (Mobile CSP) project provides professional development (PD) and resources to enable high school teachers to teach the College Board's new AP CS Principles (CSP) course. The CSP course was developed by a broad group of academic computer scientists and high school CS teachers with the support of the NSF.  Its goal was to address a national crisis whereby far too few high school students were studying computer science, as measured by the numbers of students taking AP CS courses. Especially troubling was the underrepresentation in CS among high school girls, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and other minority groups. The Mobile CSP project is an effort to broaden participation in CS by supporting efforts to teach the CSP course. The project is supported by this grant as well as grant #CNS-1440947 to the College of St. Scholastica.  The project has three main goals. (1) Provide training and academic year support to U.S. high school teachers through our Professional Development (PD) course and master teacher program. Since 2013 the Mobile CSP project has trained more than 500 teachers throughout the U.S.  Of these, 363 teachers contributed research data to the project, including feedback on the PD and the Mobile CSP course as well as demographic and performance data from their courses.  The main goal of the PD was to provide instruction in CS content and pedagogy sufficient to give teachers, many of whom had no prior CS experience, the confidence to turn around and teach the CSP course in their schools.  More than 95% of PD research participants went on to teach the course at their high schools. A high proportion of teachers (95% or more) agreed after the PD that teaching the CSP course was "highly appealing" to them and a significant number of teachers stepped forward to become master teachers, agreeing to mentor and support new teachers.  The Mobile CSP project continues to offer a flexible PD program, with various modes of participation (online, in-person, or hybrid) and different levels of instruction (extended for novice teachers or immersion for those with prior CS experience.) (2) Provide rigorous computer science education to a broad range of high school students throughout the U.S., including students from traditionally underrepresented demographic groups, and prepare them for the CS Principles Advanced Placement exam.   Since 2013 the Mobile CSP project has tracked more than 8,300 students. As its name suggests, the course focuses on mobile computing.

As Table 1 shows, Mobile CSP students have outperformed the national average in both years of the exam.  In post course surveys high proportions of Mobile CSP students expressed interest in pursuing additional study in CS.  For example, among the more than 1700 students from whom we have data in the 2016-17 cohort, more than 85% of students expressed an interest further study of computing, ranging from taking courses in college (18.2%) to majoring in CS (28.1%), to having some kind of computing career (38.4%). (3) Provide a collection of free, openly licensed, teaching materials and pedagogical resources to support the CSP course. The Mobile CSP course (http://course.mobile-csp.org) and teacher web site (http://teach.mobile-csp.org) host a collection of free, openly licensed teaching materials and resources.
