<AbstractNarration>This action funds Keiko M. Tuttle of Washington State University, Pullman, WA to conduct a research project, entitled "Investigating the control of wheat seed dormancy and germination by plant hormones," during the summer of 2012 at RIKEN Plant Science Center in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture.  The host scientist is Dr. Mitsunori Seo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to advance knowledge about the hormonal control of wheat seed dormancy and germination by measuring hormones Abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), and jasmonic acid (JA) levels in seeds that are either dormant or subjected to dormancy-breaking treatments.  It is essential to advance knowledge about the hormonal control of seed dormancy directly in wheat where problems with preharvest sprouting of seed on the mother plant due to insufficient dormancy under cold or moist conditions cause economic losses for farmers.  Identification and localization of the hormone signal for dormancy release could transform current knowledge leading to new breeding strategies for preharvest sprouting tolerance.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of Japan; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally awareness of the U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Title:  Investigating the control of wheat seed dormancy and germination by plant hormones  Author/PI:  Keiko M. Tuttle NSF-EAPSI-JAPAN-2012  This project has advanced discovery and knowledge about hormonal control of wheat seed dormancy and biology, and advanced knowledge for the fellow through learning of new technologies for hormone analysis.  This has broadened the participation of underrepresented groups by providing the fellow, a female scientist, an opportunity to create new partnerships with Japanese scientists that is benefitting her both in her PhD research and future career.  She benefitted from access to state of the art technology at the RIKEN institute. She also gained invaluable insight from the cultural and scientific experience of performing research with Japanese scientists because this experience has enhanced her ability to develop collaborations and to conduct postdoctoral research with the same Japanese scientists.  As a PhD student in the Molecular Plant Sciences program at Washington State University, with a strong interest in hormone signaling and in Japanese culture, she was well qualified to conduct the proposed research.  The results of this research will be broadly disseminated through the publication of a peer-reviewed journal article in collaboration with Dr. Mitsunori Seo (Japanese host, RIKEN Plant Science Center, expert in seed dormancy and hormones), and through presentations to scientists, growers, and wheat breeders by Dr. Camille Steber (U.S. advisor, USDA-ARS Wheat Geneticist, expert on GA and ABA, seed dormancy) and the fellow.  Preharvest sprouting is a world-wide problem in cereals that results in wheat unfit for human consumption.  Therefore, this research will benefit society because knowledge of the hormonal control of wheat dormancy will lead to improved breeding strategies to increase wheat preharvest sprouting tolerance without creating problems with poor seedling emergence.   Previous research in dicots has firmly established that ABA/GA ratios control seed dormancy. Better known as the "Hormone Balance Theory," which states that the balance between these antagonistic phytohormones is what enables a seed to undergo germination or maintain its dormancy. To strike an appropriate balance between good emergence and preharvest sprouting tolerance, it is essential to understand the balance between the plant hormone ABA that stimulates seed dormancy, and GA that breaks dormancy and stimulates seed germination. Dormant seeds fail to germinate under favorable conditions, and seed dormancy is lost by a period of dry storage termed after-ripening.  While ABA clearly is essential to establishing and maintaining cereal seed dormancy, the role of GA in breaking cereal dormancy is controversial. It is essential to advance knowledge about the hormonal control of seed dormancy directly in wheat where problems with preharvest sprouting (PHS) of seed on the mother plant due to insufficient dormancy under cold or moist conditions cause economic losses for farmers.  Selection for rapid seedling emergence has led to loss of seed dormancy in wheat, resulting in susceptibility to PHS.  Identification and localization of the hormone signal for dormancy release could transform our current knowledge leading to new breeding strategies for PHS tolerance.  Previous work showed that loss of dormancy is associated with loss of ABA sensitivity and increased GA sensitivity. Loss of ABA sensitivity may result from turnover. If so, it should be associated with a decrease in internal ABA. This study performed plant hormone profiling experiments which investigated the hormonal control of the transition from seed dormancy to germination in the cereal crop wheat.  To address whether the ratio between ABA and GA hormones control the dormancy status of wheat this project measured hormone levels in embryos/scutellum and in aleurone/endosperm from imbibed seeds in order to determine whether:  1) A...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
