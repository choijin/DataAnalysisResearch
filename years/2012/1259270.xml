<AbstractNarration>This project is providing scholarships and support to 40 students over five years in order to (1) increase annual full-time enrollment in targeted engineering technology and applied technology fields, (2) increase retention of participating STEM majors from the first to second year, (3) increase the number of participating students who complete their degree within two years, and (4) increase the number of graduating Bridgemont STEM Scholars who become employed in their field or continue their education in their field. The project is investigating the combination of proven retention models and industry interactive activities on student performance, particularly those who are the first in their family to attend college. Students are learning sought-after workplace skills including interpersonal relations, project management, and workplace ethics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project promotes higher STEM education in rural West Virginia through an outreach campaign that is informing a broad audience about high-demand positions available for engineering and applied technology graduates, which is particularly important given the high number of first generation college students in the region. These activities are helping to create a more educated workforce in West Virginia. The program model strengthens the partnerships between community colleges and industry to improve student preparation for STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>BridgeValley Community and Technical College (BridgeValley) located in south-central West Virginia, was award an NSF S-STEM (NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) five-year grant in 2013 to establish a STEM Scholars program to increase: the annual, full-time enrollment of engineering technology and applied technology majors, the retention of and degree completion rates of participating STEM majors, and the number of graduated STEM Scholars who become employed in their field or continue their education. The STEM Scholars Program awards were based on academic achievement and qualifications for financial aid. The amount of the award was such that the student had supplemental funds so that academics can be a priority over part-time employment. Initially the program targeted nine majors for inclusion in the STEM Scholars program. Since the award two majors have been discontinued, Computer-Aided Drafting and Design Engineering Technology and Blasting Technology. &nbsp;However, three new programs in the Information Technology field have been added, Cyber Security, Computer Science Technology, and Web Design. Over the life of the grant, 48 students received awards. Of the 48 participants, less than 20% left the program prior to graduation. The STEM Scholars participants maintained over a 60% retention rate over the life of the grant which is greater than normal for the programs included in the STEM Scholars grant. During the final two years of the grant, the STEM Scholars participants were able to work with the Success Coaches from the Department of Labor TechHire grant that BridgeValley was awarded in 2016. This collaboration between initiatives helped increase the success of the STEM Scholars participants. &nbsp;As a result of this collaboration, 73% of the STEM Scholars participants graduated, transferred, or were still active at the end of the grant period.
