<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to measure noble gases in odp drill core gabbros, diorites and diabases from holes 735B and 1256D. The gases will be extracted by in vacuo and heating methods. He, Ne, and Ar will be measured and ratios used to separate atmospheric, radiogenic and non-radiogenic components of the gas. 3He, in particular, is of interest because the only possible source for this isotope is the Earth's mantle. Preliminary measurements reveal that He is surprisingly high in oceanic intrusive rocks, especially deformed rocks. The hypothesis that deformation adds noble gas to the crust will be tested by a depth study of granoblastic dikes from hole1256D. Preliminary results also reveal surprising small scale variability in noble gas concentration within samples, possibly related to amphibole concentration and hydrous melting. This hypothesis will be tested by a detailed transect in an amphibole diorite with special attention paid to mineralogy and fluid inclusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be the first comprehensive study of noble gas concentration in oceanic gabbroic rocks and the first ever in amphibole. The results will be of interest to a broad range of earth scientists. The work will have implications for the origins and abundance of volatiles in ocean crust and, ultimately, subduction-related volcanos. The project has an international component, will provide funds for a Ph.D. student and will involve undergraduates through WHOI fellowships and collaboration with a local state college.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to determine the abundance and isotopic composition of the light noble gases (helium, neon, and argon) in the ocean crust.    Because noble gases are inert, they are excellent tracers in the earth, but have not yet been widely applied to the ocean crust.   We carried out a suite of noble gas measurements by crushing in vacuum, followed by heating in vacuum, to determine the fraction of each gas that is contained by fluid inclusions within the crustal minerals.  The main emphasis of the project is a deep drill core from the Eastern Pacific Ocean (Hole 1256D) but the study also included drill cores from the Indian Ocean (Atlantis Bank).  There are highly variable helium concentrations in the gabbroic rocks, which are an important crustal constituent.  The results show that helium is dominated by a mantle component, and that post-formation fluid flow does not alter the helium isotopes.  This is an important result because it means that helium might be used to determine the age of the crust, because 4He is produced by radioactive decay of Th and U.  The helium fraction released by crushing varies widely, between 0.5 and 44 %, which suggests that fluid inclusions are an important but variable residence site for helium.  The measurements were all carried out on well-characterized samples in order to evaluate the influence of mineralogy and deformation within the crust.  The data show that amphibole has very high noble gas concentrations, and is therefore an important residence site within the crust.  The data do not show clear correlations between degree of deformation and noble gas abundances, which suggests that mineralogy and fluid inclusion abundance are more important factors than degree of deformation in the crust.  This is an important result because it contradicts previous studies on deformation at deeper levels (below the crust).  This project was carried out in the Isotope Geochemistry Facility at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), which is one of few laboratories in the Unites States is capable of making these measurements.  The project led to important career advancement opportunities to WHOI scientists and the development of new analytical capabilities.
