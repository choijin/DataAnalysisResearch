<AbstractNarration>Modern marketplaces, enabled by recent advances in information&lt;br/&gt;technology, are becoming ever more complex, dynamic and&lt;br/&gt;interconnected. Customers are increasingly more informed about the&lt;br/&gt;choices available to them and are thus able to make better decisions.&lt;br/&gt;For firms, this presents both opportunities and challenges. On the&lt;br/&gt;positive side, the firm has a bigger than ever array of tools at its&lt;br/&gt;disposal that enable it to better sell to its customers. Such tools&lt;br/&gt;are both computational (pricing algorithms, customer targeting data,&lt;br/&gt;social networking information) and economical (dynamic mechanisms) in&lt;br/&gt;nature. The challenging aspect for the firm is that modern technology&lt;br/&gt;also allows consumers to easily learn the opinions of fellow customers&lt;br/&gt;and to be strategic in their decision-making. Having such strategic&lt;br/&gt;and networked customers is not necessarily a net negative for the&lt;br/&gt;firm, but it certainly makes the firm's problem of how to sell its&lt;br/&gt;products a more complex one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims  to develop a framework for understanding how to&lt;br/&gt;sell goods in markets that are fundamentally dynamic and&lt;br/&gt;interconnected. The project will research what mechanisms are revenue-optimal&lt;br/&gt;(or near-optimal, while being simple and computationally tractable) in&lt;br/&gt;dynamic settings where customers can learn from each other. The PIs will&lt;br/&gt;study the effect of network learning on the firm's behavior and&lt;br/&gt;whether it forces the firm to share some of the costs associated with&lt;br/&gt;consumer learning.  The project will also focus on how the social&lt;br/&gt;networkstructure affects the optimal mechanism and will try to&lt;br/&gt;understand whether such network learning effects lead to lower (or&lt;br/&gt;higher) revenue for the firm and aggregate consumer welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental research in the dynamics of networked markets provides&lt;br/&gt;deeper knowledge to a broad audience that includes firms, consumer&lt;br/&gt;groups and regulators.  Curriculum development at the interface of&lt;br/&gt;operations research, information systems and computer science will&lt;br/&gt;benefit from this research experience.</AbstractNarration>
