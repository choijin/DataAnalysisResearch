<AbstractNarration>This research and development project will modify the teacher preparation program for preK-8 teachers at six universities located in different regions of the U.S. The new program is designed to help pre-service teachers learn mathematics well, learn to access students' cultural funds of knowledge in ways that will help them teach mathematics, and learn to encourage students' mathematical thinking. By integrating these important bodies of knowledge, pre-service teachers should be better prepared to teach mathematics to the variety of students in their classes. The developers are designing (a) modules that can be used in teacher preparation courses, (b) a mentoring program for new teachers, and (c) on-line networks to facilitate collaboration among participating teachers and institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes a study of how pre-service teachers learn to apply the knowledge they have gained in the program. The research team has planned a longitudinal collection of data that will track the pre-service teachers into their careers. Their goal is to document teachers' understandings of children's mathematical thinking and children's cultural funds of knowledge and to understand the relationship between teachers' understandings and the learning and disposition of preK-8 students. The study will be implemented at all six universities with staggered start dates allowing for analysis and revisions between cohorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research and development efforts have the potential to impact preK-8 teacher preparation through (1) the development of modules that integrate several relevant proficiencies in mathematics teaching, and (2) the research that studies the impact of such a program on the mathematical learning and disposition of preK-8 students.</AbstractNarration>

We then conceptualized our project goal as supporting pre-service teachers&rsquo; integrated attention to and use of these multiple mathematical knowledge bases. We operationalized that integration by focusing on multiple mathematical knowledge bases from the first day of our methods courses, as contrasted with the more typical approach of focusing first on children&rsquo;s mathematical thinking and then on children&rsquo;s funds of knowledge.

The development and implementation of the modules was guided by our understanding of this trajectory. Finally, our project approach to supporting pre-service teacher learning involved viewing equitable instruction not as an additional topic to be addressed in methods courses and mathematics teaching, but instead as a re-orientation of common practices.
