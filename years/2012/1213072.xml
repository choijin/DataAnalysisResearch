<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Kenneth Carter of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst will develop methodologies to form n- and p-type doped conjugated poly(ionomer)s from a single, neutral parent polymer.  The approach is to synthesize conjugated polymers possessing benzimidazole repeat units either in homopolymer or copolymer form; to probe how acid-base and alkylation chemistries can be used to switch the benzimidazole repeat unit between various types of aromatic systems; to study systematically the effects of these modifications on the electrical and photo-physical behavior of the polymers; and to explore how these polymers can be used to fabricate functional organic electronic devices.  The broader impacts involve training graduate and undergraduate students in polymer chemistry and organic electronics science, disseminating research results and concepts via publications, presentations at conferences and incorporation of material into lecture courses, and broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in chemical sciences via partnering with NOBCChE to bring undergraduates to campus for summer research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.    Electrically conducting carbon-based (organic) molecules and polymers hold enormous promise for realizing highly efficient, affordable, and broadly available electronic and optical devices.  This research explores how chemistry can be used to control and switch the electronic properties of an electrically conducting polymer.  Ultimately, such work could lead to the development of organic electronic materials, low cost solar cells, light emitting displays, and chemical and biological sensors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There were two main scientific thrusts of this two-year project: (1) to synthesize a new class of neutral conjugated polymers which can be easily converted into cationic or anionic poly(ionomer)s; (2) systematically study the effects of these modifications with respect to their processability and the influence of charge on the electrical and photo-physical behavior of the polymers.  Although funding was limited to a single two-year project, we asked for a one-year no cost extension. Even in this relatively short period of time, we were able to make a great deal of progress on the project. We achieved our fundamental objective of this research, which was to gain a detailed understanding of a new class of polyionomers in terms of their synthesis and characterization and application to advanced organic electronic devices.  Our approaches to solving these problems have led to new discoveries in the area of conjugated semiconducting polymers and have created opportunities for the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students in this advanced topic in synthetic polymer chemistry.  Intellectual Merit: Through the incorporation of 4,7-benzimidazole moieties in poly(fluorene) semiconducting polymer systems, we demonstrated the feasibility of a dually-dopable polymeric system.  By the addition of simple acidic or basic reagents, the neutral polymer was effectively doped in solution, yielding stable doped species.  The neutral polymers, as well as both the n-doped and p?doped derivatives, were soluble in suitable solvents and could be processed into thin films.  The non-optimized systems showed the potential for reversibly and systemically manipulating band-gaps of a single polymeric species through post-polymerization chemical methods.  This ability to control the electronic band-structure is unmatched by current synthetic techniques which require synthesis of distinct macromolecules to achieve alternate band structures.  We were able to decouple steric influences on the polymer chain from ionic doping and showed that even in systems that give no appreciable chain in ring to ring twisting, protonic doping results in changes to optical and electronic properties. With the demonstration of their dopability, we believe that these semiconducting 4,7?benzimidazole-based materials represent an important evolution in the progress of conjugated polymers and will offer the exciting possibility of tunable control over hole and electron transporting behavior of these materials in device applications.  Broader Impacts: The project has directly supported one UMass Polymer Science and Engineering graduate student who is now entering his fourth year of study (Mr. Jared Harris).  The project has also enabled the training of three undergraduate researchers, Markus Stihl (Bayreuth), Carmin Fisher (Mainz), and Cathrin M&uuml;ller (Bayreuth), who performed their thesis research on this project and they have gained an excellent education and training on advanced polymeric materials. We have also had the part-time assistance of two postdoctoral scientists (Dr. Charlotte Mallet and Dr. Fatma Koyuncu).  Four of these six people that worked on this project are female. Two additional students are currently directly supported by this project and they are gaining an excellent education and training on advanced polymeric materials. Other group members and university department researchers also benefit from the program in terms of access to new materials, fabrication facilities, equipment and associated training. The project has spawned two new international collaborations, one with Professor Hans-Werner Schmidt at the Universit&auml;t Bayreuth and the other with Dr. Fatma Koyuncu and Dr. Sermet Koyuncu at &Ccedil;anakkale Onsekiz Mart University (Turkey). The PI and students are active in outreach activities ranging from K-12 education, mentoring and career development of under-represented minority and women scientist, local Science Cafes, and indus...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
