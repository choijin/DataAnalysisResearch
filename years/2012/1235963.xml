<AbstractNarration>PI: Bandaru V. Ramarao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: State University of New York, College of Environmental Science and Forestry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Travel &amp; Symposium Grant: Joint Symposium on Forest Based Biorefinery Technologies&lt;br/&gt;International Conference on Biomass-Energy Technologies (ICBT2012)&lt;br/&gt;Nanjing, China October 22-24, 2012. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant is to provide funding to about 12 academic researchers from the USA to participate and present papers at the Joint Symposium on Forest Based Biorefinery Technologies and International Conference on Biomass-Energy Technologies, ICBT 2012 in Nanjing, China, October 22-24, 2012. The symposium aims to provide a communication and exhibition platform for experts, scholars, and entrepreneur in the biomass energy field. The delegates will include not only renowned experts, scholars, and government officials, but also company executives and professionals of investment institutions in Asia, Europe, and the United States. At this event they will discuss and exchange their ideas on ?hot spots??novel technologies?and commercial development so as to encourage cooperative research on biomass energy technologies between China and other countries, and promote the integration of the Chinese biomass energy industry with international enterprises and investment institutions. This conference will also provide new development opportunities for international biomass energy institutions and enterprises.  The U.S. team including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will investigate international collaborative opportunities at the symposium.  This symposium will fill a critical need and bring focus to joint efforts between USA and China on feedstock supply, conversion technologies, kinetics and reaction engineering of biomass conversions, separation and purification processes and novel bioproducts and materials in the context of forest products based biorefineries.</AbstractNarration>

With the rapid rate of industrialization in large parts of the globe, supplies of fossil fuels have been stressed and also serious environmental concerns have developed about the impact of fossil carbon on global climate. It appears that the existing energy resource system based on fossil fuels is unsustainable in the long term and a transition to renewable energy resources will need to occur for sustainable industrial development of society in the future. Amongst the variety of renewable energy sources, biomass presents one of best alternatives, primarily due to its relatively uniform global distribution and the fact of its zero net contribution to the atmospheric carbon load thus avoiding the emissions implicated in climate change phenomena. As the largest developing country with an extremely rapid economic development, China has seen an unprecedented growth in energy demand in recent years. However, a heavy dependence on imported petroleum has jeopardized ChinaÆs energy security and the coal-dominated energy structure has caused serious environmental problems. The Chinese government has realized the significance of developing bioenergy due to its potential in alleviating environmental pollution, slowing global warming, and reducing the dependence on the limited supplies of fossil fuels. Indeed, biomass is widely available as an energy resource in China; its total amount, including that which is used by peasant households in rural areas, is comparable to the amount of coal. The development of new technologies for processing biomass has already become an integral part of the national energy strategy. In this context, biomass has become the focus of R&amp;D and various bioenergy technologies have been developed in China. A great number of scientists and experts have been engaged in the R&amp;D of biomass energy conversion for many years. In order to promote academic and industrial research interactions in the field of biomass energy research and development, the International Conference on Biomass- Energy Technologies (ICBT2012) and joint symposium with AIChE was organized by the Chinese Renewable Energy Society (CRES), Chinese Academy of Forestry (CAF) and the American Institute ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
