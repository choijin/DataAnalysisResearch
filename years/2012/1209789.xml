<AbstractNarration>This action funds Mallory Kate Messersmith of the University of Alabama at Birmingham to conduct a research project, entitled "Utilizing Aerial Imagery to Locate Archaeological Sites in New Zealand and Determine their Functions," during the summer of 2012 at the University of Otago in Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand.  The host scientist is Dr. Mark McCoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the use of remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR analysis to locate and analyze prehistoric earthworks in New Zealand.   While remote sensing has been utilized in some forms for decades, it is only with recent advances in resolution and techniques that its use has become widespread in the archaeological community.  This project utilizes aerial-based LiDAR imagery to identify, categorize, and analyze earthworks and their surrounding landscapes in order to contribute to the broader investigation of the function of earthworks in prehistoric New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Airborne LiDAR Survey of Fortified Earthwork Sites in Northland, New Zealand     Mallory Messersmith (University of Alabama, Birmingham)  NSF EAPSI 2012, New Zealand, University of Otago     In New Zealand, the native Maori civilization constructed some +6,000 fortifications, called pa, in the pre- and early post-European contact era. However, few of these sites have been surveyed at a level of detail necessary to evaluate the commonplace ditch-and-bank feature as a defensive strategy. This research explores the utility of airborne remote sensing imagery known as LiDAR, which measures infrared pulses reflected back from the surface.  A major advantage of LiDAR is its ability to "see" through vegetation and forested areas to reveal a bare-earth digital model.  This opens up possibilities for applications of remote sensing techniques to areas that would be inaccessible to more traditional methods because of terrain, budget, or time considerations. Digital elevation models (DEMs) and digital terrain models (DTMs) for several known sites in the Northland region of New Zealand were used to measure key aspects of ditch-and-bank features at three fortified earthwork sites (pa). These quantitative measurements will prove useful in evaluating the effectiveness of such features in future research. In order for the LiDAR-derived data to be useful for archaeological investigations, it must be proven to be at least as accurate in modeling archaeological features as more traditional mapping methods used by archaeologists.  With this in mind, I visited one of the pa sites and obtained cross-section measurements of the ditch-and-bank feature using a handheld GPS unit, and a tape and compass.  When I returned to the lab, I compared the cross-section models with the LiDAR-derived model. The results support the notion that LiDAR can provide an accurate and cost-effective method for quantitative analysis of these archaeological features.  Furthermore, the resulting measurements contribute to our understanding of Maori fortifications and the effectiveness of the ditch-and-bank defense feature.
