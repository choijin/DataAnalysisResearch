<AbstractNarration>Chorus waves are naturally occurring whistler waves and are nearly monochromatic and discrete in time. Hiss waves are broadband and incoherent.  This proposal addresses the relationship between these two types of waves and in particular will evaluate the idea that chorus waves evolve into hiss as they propagate. The proposal will use ground based instruments, laboratory experiments and numerical ray tracing. This research is important for magnetospheric physics because both types of wave emissions are thought to control the population of energetic electrons. &lt;br/&gt;This is a CAREER proposal and as such it has an extensive education and outreach element. It includes training of K-12 students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. It will involve the use of Capstone Senior Design projects to develop applications for smart phones. These waves are in the audio frequency range and can be received and recorded by using smart phone technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The near-Earth space environment hosts billions of dollars of spacecraft assets.  This project set out to understand key features of a special type of wave in the near-Earth space environment known as the whistler mode waves.  These waves are very important in near-Earth space studies since they interact with very energetic particles.  These wave-particle interactions are a key part of processes known as space weather.   In addition to scientific advancements and outreach activities, the award supported the education of two new PhD graduates and several MS and BS gradautes.  One of the new doctoral graduates is, Ashanthi Maxworth, a female researcher who has continued to build her career as a postdoctoral fellow.  We successfully deployed VLF receivers for whistler mode observations in Alaska.  Analysis of the ground observations led to the following discoveries:  1) It is possible to estimate ionospheric exit point location using the observed wave polarization.  The wave polarization evolves from nearly circular to linear in  a predictable way as a function of propagation distance in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide.  This is a powerful technique that facilitates the interpretation of ground observations and allows for identification of the magnetospheric source region.  In previous work, the magnetospheric source region was not known and had to be assumed.   2) We found strong evidence of a magnetospheric whistler mode source region evolving and generating first incoherent hiss waves and then more discrete type chorus waves.  Utilizing the technique described above we were able to identify ground observed whistler mode waves coming from a fixed source location in the magnetosphere over 2 hours.  It is important to note that such an observation is unique to ground observations and is not possible on a fast moving spacecraft.  The evolution of the source region from hiss to chorus generation suggests that the same plasma instability is behind both wave phenomena. This is in agreement with certain theoretical work but also goes against some prominent hypotheses where chorus waves were said to change into hiss wave through propagation alone.  These results have been a valuable contribution to the community's understanding of hiss and chorus waves.  3) The anisotropy (free energy) of the magnetospheric electron distribution can be estimated from ground measurements.  Lower band chorus is favorably generated spontaneously from background noise, while upper band chorus is more likely to be triggered by external waves.  We identified unique observations of multi-path lightning induced waves triggering other whistler mode waves.  From the observed cutoff frequencies we were able to estimate the anisotropy of the magnetospheric plasma distribution.  The anisotropy of the magnetospheric plasma distribution is a metric of the free energy.  This is therefore a key parameter in space weather but is very hard to measure directly.  Direct spacecraft measurements requires very high resolution of the energy spectrum.  The ground based estimate we made is novel and is in agreement with past work.   The effort on whistler mode propagation trajectory modeling (raytracing) was a success.  We successfully implemented a raytracing code with the inclusion of finite temperature.  Previous work did not include finite temperature effects.  The following discoveries came from this effort:     1) The inclusion of finite temperature background plasma has the most prominent effect on highly oblique whistler mode waves with frequencies near the lower hybrid resonance.  For moderately oblique or field aligned waves, or waves outside of this frequency band, the finite temperature effects can be neglected without large loss of accuracy.   2) The primary effect of finite background temperature on whistler mode propagation is to lower the refractive index magnitude and increase the group velocity with slight modifications to the ray trajectories. Landau damping is shown to increase slightly with the inclusion of finite temperature.  3) Warm plasma theory is an accurate way to find the upper bound of the refractive index for highly oblique waves.  It is more accurate than electrostatic models that have been used in the past.   Our outreach and educational efforts under this project were very rewarding.  A special  smartphone app for recording and visualizing low frequency waves on a smartphone was developed by an interdisciplinary student group comprised of students from electrical engineering and computer science.  This app was then used in classrooms and was also show cased at a public Exploration Station event in San Francisco.  Our radio receiver deployments facilitated outreach to a K-12 school in Akhiok, Alaska.  Undergraduate and graduate students from CU Denver presented science talks to the K-12 classes.  The K-12 students were engaged in helping maintain the VLF receiver that was hosted at the school. In addition to the outreach in Alaska described above, STEM outreach was performed at a school in Tappahannock, Virginia where we also hosted a VLF receiver.
