<AbstractNarration>This action funds Marissa Jablonski of the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee to conduct a research project, entitled "Modeling industrial scale removal of dyes from textile industry wastewater using readily available chemicals in containers made of garbage," during the Summer of 2012 at Beijing Normal University in Beijing.  The host scientist is Dr. Chenghong Feng.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the size, breadth, and sustainability of the study.  Modeling kinetics of photo-Fenton oxidation in 10-liter mobile units and detailing optimal chemical concentrations allows the process to be augmented ultimately to be implemented into larger scale dye houses throughout the global dyeing industry.  The proposed research uses alternate chemicals in the form of animal blood and reactors made of recycled plastic and scrap that lower the cost and make the process accessible to communities at very low cost and in any locale.  Once optimized, the process can work to clean dye wastewater from textile industries everywhere.  Many dye houses throughout the developing world dispose untreated dye wastewater directly onto lawns surrounding dye stations, leaving it to penetrate groundwater and contaminate drinking water with toxic chemicals and dyes.  Photo-Fenton oxidation offers a sludge-free treatment process to benefit those who currently use no treatment, cannot afford to use costly reverse osmosis systems, and are left to deal with hazardous sludge from biodegradation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My research is centered on developing an effective, low-cost, mobile photo-Fenton oxidation and filtration unit to be used in rural communities throughout the developing world to clean textile industry wastewater.  The proposed sustainable photo-Fenton oxidation process will also use a modified photo-Fenton process consisting of iron chemical substitutes in the form of scrap metal and chemicals available in neighborhood pharmacies or general stores.  The primary purpose of this sustainable process is to de-colorize wastewater, with secondary aims to lower the total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels.  If left untreated, dye wastewater can block sunlight essential to sustain plant life, and ultimately be detrimental to existing ecosystems and human health.  Dyes also contain other toxic chemicals that create high levels of pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride, nitrogen, heat, and acidity; without first decolorizing the dye, there is no way to sustain the ecosystem which quickly leads to low-quality drinking water.  In turn, this leads to health problems throughout the developing world.     My research work consists of testing the mobile unitÃ†s ability to decolorize three reactive dyes (red 120, blue 4, yellow 84) obtained from GE Healthcare in Beijing and two wastewater samples obtained from textile dye houses throughout China (Beijing and Guangzhou).  Research was completed at Beijing Normal University under the advising of Dr. Cheng Hong Feng.  The modified photo-Fenton oxidation process utilizes solar UV energy, compares 35% hydrogen peroxide efficacy with 3%, and iron in the form of scrap metal, in solution at low pH with dye concentrations equivalent to industry standards.  Reactors are made from locally available and common plastic washbasins found throughout the developing world.      Although preliminary analysis in China of COD and TOC levels and color change do not show significant trends that can lead one to coherent decisive results, continued work in the U.S. shows that the sustainable oxidation methods using 3% hydrogen peroxide and steel scrap, especially when followed by simple sand filtration, decrease color and organic chemical composition of the solution.  Considering the ease of procurement for all parts of research, and the positive results of the laboratory tests, a pilot study is to be constructed in rural Bangalore during the Summer of 2013 to improve the water quality of 12 families who are a part of a cottage dye industry.
