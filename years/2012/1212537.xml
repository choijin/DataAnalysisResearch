<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Chemical and Biological Separations  (CBS) Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, Professor Lisa Holland and her group at West Virginia University are developing a thermally-reversible, self-assembled, phospholipid nanogel for chemical separations.  These nanogels are a new material with unprecedented ability to separate mixtures of complex biomolecules.  The full range of applications for this material will be characterized by determining the fluidic properties of the material under different conditions and by recording the separation performance for standard sets of biopolymers including DNA, peptides, proteins, and carbohydrates.  The technology to be developed will directly affect research in many fields that rely on electrophoretic and micro-scale separation based assays to identify the biomolecule present in the sample as well as the concentration.  The research indirectly influences other fields utilizing phospholipids for structural analyses by nuclear magnetic resonance, as biomimetic coatings, as templates for fabrication, and for the investigation of membrane protein function.  Finally, self-assembled phospholipid nanogels serve as a model smart-material for which the material properties change under different environmental conditions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teaching, training, and learning fostered under this award lead to valuable support of human resources.  Graduate students who participate in innovative research and interdisciplinary research experiences will earn PhD degrees and enter the workforce with the ability to work across scientific disciplines.  The graduate researchers engaged in this project gain valuable training in bioanalyses, material science, fluid dynamics, and micro-scale separations of biological molecules.  In addition, micro-flow systems in the form of microfluidic devices will be adapted for the middle school science classroom.  Science education at this level benefits young students as they begin the process of career identity.  Lessons will be developed that align with teaching objectives to support the science curricula.  The curricula and micro-flow experiments will be disseminated through local and national presentations, by means of a teaching workshop, and by submitting the material as a collection to the NSF funded National Science Digital Library so that is it freely available on-line.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Self-assembled nanogels were developed to advance chemical separations as a novel material for biomolecule separations.  These nanogels are an alternative to other polymer-based separation additives that are used for electrophoretic separations of biopolymers such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).  The self-assembled nanogel offer important advantages over traditional polymeric viscosity additives.  The self-assembled nanogels have atypical viscosity properties because they are non-Newtonian fluids.  At low temperatures, such as 20&deg;C, the nanogels have a low viscosity, similar to water, but with a 10&deg;C increase in temperature the material increases in viscosity and is transformed into a gel.  This is beneficial in a capillary electrophoresis separation because the switchable viscosity of nanogels makes them easy to introduce and replace in a capillary.  The materials are low cost and do not require custom synthesis because they can be made by mixing commercially available chemicals.  The physical properties of the nanogels can be changed by changing the composition, the nanogel concentration, or the temperature.      Through this award, the performance of nanogels as a separation material was established.  Size based nanogel separation was demonstrated by resolving fragments of DNA, called short tandem repeats, that are used for human identification.  The utility of this material was also demonstrated through analyses of biomarkers that indicate if a person has a higher likelihood of sensitivity to the drug warfarin.  Nanogels were adapted to extend the size range of the separations to longer fragments of DNA than are typically separated by capillary gel electrophoresis (i.e. 1,500 base pairs in length).  The utility of the expanded size range nanogel was demonstrated with DNA biomarkers ranging from 634 to 1,332 base pairs in length to distinguish invasive strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, which is associated with common throat and skin diseases.  Two different nanogels were integrated in a single separation channel.  This allowed us to demonstrate a method of sample concentration called stacking that is commonly used in DNA separations with slab gel electrophoresis.      This award also had components with broader impact.  In addition to offering training opportunities for chemistry students, the activities supported by this award enhanced science in secondary education.  These efforts produced a new classroom experiment to split water (i.e. electrolysis) into hydrogen and oxygen using a chip made of cast polydimethyl siloxane or a chip made of food grade gelatin. This electrolysis is complete in 1 minute and the entire kit (chip, battery, alligator clips, Epsom salt) cost less than $5 at the time it was developed.  Handouts for teachers and students were published with a description of the experiment.  Different workshops were delivered to provide hands-on training as well as kits to some educators who expressed an interest in the experiments.  These workshops were delivered through the West Virginia Science Teachers Association Annual Conference, the Jefferson County, WV school system, and the 248th American Chemical Society National meeting.
