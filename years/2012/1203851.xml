<AbstractNarration>The PIs propose to develop a new, high-resolution (annual to subdecadal) paleoclimate record (0 to ~2,000 y) from sediment cores taken in Arctic lagoonal settings adjacent to rivers emptying into the Beaufort Sea. This effort is a follow-up to an EAGER award that allowed collection of initial core material and a seismic dataset in Simpson Lagoon near the Colville River delta in August 2010. Initial results suggest that these sediment cores contain a valuable history of system response to climate change on the adjacent continent (e.g., river drainage basins) and terrestrial-marine linkages. All cores will be analyzed for stratigraphy (X-radiography), bulk organic and mineral content, granulometry, and geochronology (239,240Pu/137Cs). Detailed analysis for paleoclimate proxies will be carried out: the age-depth relationship for the deeper part of these cores will be determined using radiocarbon. Climate indicators that will be applied are organic biomarkers (lignin-phenols, cutins, plant pigments, and Ã¤13C) and mineral tracers (major and trace element chemistry, stable isotopes, clay mineralogy, heavy mineral assemblages, granulometry, event-layer stratigraphy). The central hypothesis is that lagoonal settings within the Beaufort Sea contain high quality sediment records because they receive sediment input from larger rivers that drain the Brooks Range, that, if exploited, will dramatically improve our knowledge of high Arctic paleoclimate over the last two millenia. The PIs hypothesize three distinct sources: 1) rivers that drain the Brooks Range and the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP), 2) storms that erode shoreline permafrosted ACP deposits and overwash barrier islands, and 3) marine primary production by phytoplankton, ice algae, and benthos. After an initial micro-scale examination of recent event layer (annual and storm deposits) mineral and POC succession, necessary to interpret paleoclimate-induced fluctuations in composition, they will examine the downcore record of temporal variations in layers, contrasting sites to decouple spatial changes in sources. Since the three source end-members have distinct mineral/POC composition, they believe that temporal variations will provide proxy information about climate changes that influence their flux magnitude including 1) landfast ice extent, 2) river sediment supply from the glaciated uplands, 3) permafrost thawing, 4) summer-fall storminess, and 5) coastal primary productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noting the rapid changes that have occurred in the Arctic during the latter half of the 20th century, the federal interagency Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) program has cited the need to determine to what extent recent and ongoing climate changes in the Arctic can be attributed to anthropogenic forcing.  A successful project will contribute to answering that question.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The present project was designed to examine the possibility of utlizing coastal lagoonal sediment sites in the Arctic to serve as a new paleoclimate archive in addition to existing archives (e.g., ice cores, lake sediments, tree rings).  This sediment core archive type has the benefits of being high resolution due to the mm to cm/y accumulation of coastal sediments, and can look at continental processes (e.g., river runoff, permafrost melting, arctic greening) and coastal processes (e.g., fall storm intensities, landfast ice extent, coastal circulation).  The results confirmed that, because coastal lagoons are protected from sea ice gouging by landfast freeze-over in the winter, a high quality record was present in Simpson Lagoon, Alaska adjacent to the Colville River delta.  The inorganic results (e.g., oxygen isotopes, clay minerals, elemental concentrations, downcore grain size) reveal fluctuations in Colville river discharge and coastal, storm-driven erosion over the last several thousand years in this lagoon.   These fluctuations are closely linked to previous information about temperatures and precipitation patterns in the Arctic.  These fluctuations were also traced using organic biomarkers in the sediments that show warm periods are marked by greater input of fresh organic matter, likely due to a recent increase in shrub abundance on the Arctic Coastal Plain (i.e., Arctic greening).  Periods of higher river and coastal erosion flux are also marked by an increased input to the lagoon of old "aged" organic matter originating from tundra peat deposits.  Overall, the results of the present study suggest that a pan-Arctic view of changing climatic conditions over the past several thousand years can be reconstructed by coring multiple Arctic lagoons on different continents.  This record can be key in differentiating between natural climate cyclicity in the Arctic and the impact of humans on climate.
