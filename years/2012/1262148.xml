<AbstractNarration>Effective ecosystem management requires an integrated research approach to determine the links between human and natural systems. To fill this gap, ECO-Link is assessing the social and ecological thresholds and feedbacks that influence efforts to manage the invasive North American beaver and restore riparian forests in southern South America?s Tierra del Fuego Archipelago. We hypothesize that a current lack of local participation in ecosystem management initiatives is influenced by broken incentive structures that do not account for feedbacks between the underlying beliefs about ecosystem service delivery and their impacts on social well-being. The thresholds that separate inaction from action in environmental stewardship can be overcome by explicitly integrating these underlying beliefs and impacts into to the design of effective incentive programs. We will use a suite of approaches to test our hypothesis by i) studying the perceptions and beliefs of nature held by landowners and other stakeholders, as well as the processes and influences that facilitate or constrain decision-making and action; ii) examining the potential for incentive programs to improve participation in ecosystem management; iii) quantifying associated ecosystem services before and after beaver control and reforestation efforts; and iv) integrating perceptions, incentives, and ecosystem services across a large landscape under various land tenures in Chile and Argentina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduced to the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago in 1946, the North American beaver is responsible for the largest landscape-level change to these southern Patagonian forests since the retreat of the last glaciation. The beaver's expansion has caused widespread deforestation and hydrological changes to entire river ecosystems, and since 2006, Chilean, Argentine and U.S. institutions have been collaborating to confront the issue. It is clear, however, that halting the spread of this ecological damage and restoring watersheds will require a large-scale, integrated management plan involving private and public landowners. Incentive programs are being considered to explicitly encourage behavioral changes in private landowners with the goal of positive environmental outcomes. In Tierra del Fuego, which is shared between Argentina and Chile, understanding local landowners' perceptions of the links between invasive species and ecosystem services is critical to designing an effective program that promotes participation and environmental stewardship across  international institutional boundaries. By focusing on important research questions at the nexus of ecology, culture, and outcomes of management actions, ECO-Link is playing an important role in efforts to restore and protect the southern Patagonian forests of South America?one of the world's most cherished wilderness areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CNH-Ex: Ecology, Culture &amp; Outcomes - Linking Human Perceptions &amp; Socio-Ecological Thresholds for Ecosystem Restoration (ECO-Link)  Scientists, decision makers and the general public increasingly recognize that the worldÆs pressing "environmental" problems require the integration of social and natural dimensions, but only recently have disciplines like invasion biology begun to address this challenge. The ECO-Link project used an effort to eradicate invasive North American beavers (Castor canadensis) and restore degraded ecosystems in southern Patagonia as a case study to take an ostensibly "biological" phenomenon and treat it as a "social-ecological system." This research also was explicitly linked with education and conservation outcomes that occurred in an international and interdisciplinary context.  Intellectual outcomes: First, we demonstrated that invasion biologyÆs scientific literature lacks social, management and political dimensions, in spite of the fact invasion biologists and practioners themselves say that these are among the most important research topics. Therefore, we applied an innovative human-centered approach to the issue, explicitly integrating stakeholders into the process. Specifically, we studied ranchers, who on Tierra del Fuego control the vast majority of private lands and are therefore a key social group for the successful implementation of such programs. Ethnographic interviews (n=38) and quantitative surveys (n=134) were used to determine ranchersÆ relationships with nature. Property owners were found to have a nuanced, but diverse and idiosyncratic understanding of their land and the beaverÆs impact. For example, ranchers recognized 61 benefits that they receive from their aquatic and riparian ecosystems, particularly the provisioning ecosystem services of drinking water, water for livestock, forage for livestock and irrigation water, but they also appreciated cultural services like landscape beauty and regulating services like control of soil erosion. At the same time, as a group ranchers perceived both negative and positive impacts by beavers to their land and livelihoods. Nonetheless, there was broad consensus that beavers are harmful and a general willingness to participate in their control.  We did not find support for the hypothesis that historical, cultural and political differences would lead to different perceptions of nature/invasive species between Chile and Argentina. Overall, ranchers agreed that beavers need to be managed, and 57% of them would be willing to participate in an eradication/restoration program, regardless of its characteristics. Yet, it was possible to detect specific factors that would enhance this willingness to participate, such as increased payments ($200-800 USD per month), less involvement from the property owner (the program provides hunters) and an increase in the perceived probability of program success (33, 66, or 99%).

Also, selected environmental variables (e.g., percent forest cover on land) did not relate to landowner perceptions and mental models of nature. Overall, these data indicated that the threshold of changing stakeholder "inaction" to "action" is not a lack of knowledge, but rather economic, social or institutional obstacles that require incentives to overcome.   Broader impact outcomes: Part of the overarching aim of this project was to conduct a coupled nature-human (CNH) study that would be relevant for international and interdisciplinary science/conservation initiatives.
