<AbstractNarration>The proposed five-site data analysis meeting will actively engage community members in international and cross-site analysis of data generated through the National Science Foundation Circumpolar Indigenous Pathways to Adulthood (CIPA) study. Approximately 150 Indigenous people from Siberia, Norway, Canada and Alaska have been actively guiding this International Polar Year study. The current project will further involve some of these youth and elders in cross-site analysis and knowledge production. More specifically, Yupik, Inupiaq, Inuit, Sami and Eveny young people from each participating community will produce digital montages that represent key cross-site findings. Sharing these productions at the cross-site meeting will invite dialogue across communities about key aspects of daily life that are evident (or noticeably absent from) the images. The adult and elder community co-researchers will be able to draw on and reflect upon their own life experiences in relation to the youth montages (and in relation to historic perspectives from older community members) from other communities. Because of the variant pace of social change across the participating communities, this project has an unprecedented opportunity for insight into mechanisms impacting everyday youth resilience?the processes by which they get through difficulties--through the reflections of Sami, Inuit, Yupik, Inupiaq and Eveny elders, adults and youth. We believe this method provides a unique opportunity to engage local people in cross-cultural, cross-national meaning-making. The interdisciplinary research team assembled here brings together investigators from social and medical anthropology, psychology, public health, and education. These diverse perspectives, including those of the indigenous community members?should provide insights into the effect of diverse educational, social, and political policies on the experiences of Indigenous youth as they become adults, and, specifically, into the ways human systems are responding to social transformation in the Arctic. To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to utilize visual elicitation techniques to facilitate international, interdisciplinary and community-engaged data analysis. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Results from the project included; 1) the creation of indigenous youth-produced digital presentations about key aspects of their everyday lives (based on preliminary cross-site analyses) from the five circumpolar study sites to extend and enhance community engagement in interpreting the site-specific and cross-site data from the Pathways project; 2) participation by indigenous youth and community members from the five collaborating sites in a three-day cross-site, international co-researcher meeting in Washington, DC; and 3) dissemination of preliminary findings from the Pathways project at a panel for the Inuit Studies Conference held in conjunction with the cross-site meeting in Washington, DC. Outcomes from the project were particularly striking among the indigenous youth participants and involved a transformative experience for youth involved in the process leading to achievements on their return to their home communities. Other outcomes included; 1) the production of new knowledge on what constitutes &ldquo;resilient collaborations&rdquo; in research for international, interdisciplinary, multi-ethnic and multi-generational teams; 2) the development of a follow-up project with the goals of sustaining and advancing the connection between the Siberian Eveny and Alaskan Yup&rsquo;ik youth and communities that was established at the cross-site workshop; 3) the advancement of research methods involving indigenous youth in the collaborative process in meaningful ways; and 4) dissemination of research findings and process approaches focused on circumpolar youth resilience at a national conference bringing together international leaders, scholars and community members working in the arctic.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/03/2013<br>      Modified by: Stacy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Rasmus</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1216257/1216257_10212976_1386112715296_IMG_3380--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1216257/1216257_10212976_1386112715296_IMG_3380--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Yup'ik site team at the Capitol"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1216257/1216257_10212976_1386112715296_IMG_3380--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Yup'ik site team at the Capitol"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">From left: Fred Edmund, James Allen, Stacy Rasmus, Billy Charles, Travis Isidore, Josephine Edmund</div> <div class="imageCredit">CANHR</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stacy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Rasmus</div> <div class="imageTitle">Yup'ik site team at the Capitol</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1216257/1216257_10212976_1386113084099_IMG_3874--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1216257/1216257_10212976_1386113084099_IMG_3874--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Circumpolar youth participants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1216257/1216257_10212976_1386113084099_IMG_3874--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Circumpolar youth participants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Youth from Siberia, Alaska, Norway and Canada meet together in Washington DC at the Smithsonian I...]]></DRECONTENT>
