<AbstractNarration>Should I stay or should I go now? The clash between changing and staying the course is a very familiar choice in our everyday lives be it a trivial choice such as leaving a social event, or a 'big life choice' such as leaving one's job. This project hypothesizes that this type of decision underpins our most frequent choice: where to look next. On average, we move our eyes in discrete jumps (saccades) twice as often as we beat our hearts. Although this feels very automatic, each movement involves a mostly unconscious decision of when to move. Should I continue to exploit my maximum resolution vision on my current focal point, or is now the time to explore new regions of space? There are also costs as well as benefits to moving, since the visual disturbance during the movement (think major camera shake) is perceptually suppressed, meaning we are mostly blinded during the 10% of our waking lives spent making these movements. This project tests the novel hypothesis that saccade choices are governed by an evaluation of their relative costs and benefits, allowing us to prioritize better choices over worse ones. The same framework will be applied to test if the problems in initiating saccades seen in Parkinson's disease are due to a breakdown in a cost/benefit evaluation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;By understanding how such a simple, but pervasive, decision process is driven, the investigators expect to reveal more fundamental and general principles of decision making in the brain. Understanding how the brain achieves optimal behavior in dynamic environments, more broadly, is a critical issue in neuroscience and for intervening when this process goes awry.  Clarifying these processes in Parkinson's disease could lead to better diagnostic tests of disease onset and progression.</AbstractNarration>

The same framework was applied to test if the problems in initiating saccades seen in Parkinson's disease are due to a breakdown in a cost/benefit evaluation, because the region of the brain that is affected in Parkinson?s disease is involved in evaluating costs and benefits of action selection.  Results from this project challenge the orthodox view that sensorimotor decisions are based on the inflow of sensory information, and are thus make a strong impact on the basic understanding of this commonly studied form of decision making. By modeling the project?s novel data from a cost/benefit perspective, the project is likely to make an impact on decision neuroscience more broadly, enabling cross-fertilization between "low-level" and "high-level" decision making approaches.   By using direct physiological techniques, the project?s impact has been increased by offering both theoretical (modeling) and mechanistic (physiology) explanations for the recorded data.  By applying the approach to Parkinson?s disease patients, the project?s impact has been further increased&mdash; not just in terms of the specific hypothesis originally proposed, but in terms of improved methodology for patient populations. We developed novel, rapid presentation of target methodology, which has allowed us to collect better quality and higher quantity data from patient populations that have previously been problematic to record. This offers potentially a much broader applicability of eye movement diagnostic measurements.          Last Modified: 06/15/2017       Submitted by: Mark Harwood]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
