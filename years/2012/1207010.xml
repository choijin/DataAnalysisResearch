<AbstractNarration>In this project, techniques will be developed and tested to analyze data from advanced gravitational wave (GW) detectors including the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) to search for GWs from astrophysical objects.  There are two main targets of this project: rapidly rotating neutron stars (extremely dense objects more massive than the Sun and the size of a city, spinning tens to hundreds of times every second), and binary systems of black holes and/or neutron stars in the last seconds of the breakdown of their orbits due to GW emission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravitational waves (GWs), distortions of the geometry and space and time predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, provide a new window on the universe, allowing us to supplement the range of information available from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and from cosmic ray and neutrino observations.  A modern generation of detectors including LIGO has been built and recently completed several years of observations which have resulted in limits on the strength and frequency of GW signals.  These detectors are currently being upgraded to their advanced configuration, with an increased sensitivity which should provide the first direct GW detection in the near future.  This project will involve faculty and students of the Rochester Institute of Technology in laying the groundwork for that first detection and the resulting groundbreaking expansion of our knowledge of the universe.  In addition to the search for GWs, visualizations will be produced of gravitational-wave propagation and detection which will aid the general public's understanding of the science done by LIGO.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to develop and apply methods to search for gravitational waves (GWs, distortions of spacetime, travelling at the speed of light, which are predicted by Einstein's General Relativity) with advanced gravitational wave detectors.  The initial LIGO and Virgo detectors ended their runs in 2010 and 2012, and the Advanced LIGO detector began its first observing run in September 2015.  The award also supported the partcipation of faculty and student scientists in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC); the PI (Prof. John Whelan) heads the LSC group at Rochester Institute of Technology and plays a key role on several committees important to the science and communication of the LSC.  Important outcomes of the award:  LIGO made the first direct detections of GWs, from the binary black hole mergers GW150914 and GW151226. The PI supervised a postdoctoral researcher who co-led a project which demonstrated that binary black hole searches could be more sensitive by including the effects of one or both black holes spinning on their axes, which was the case in GW151226. A major objective of the project was implementing the search for gravitational waves from a spinning neutron star in a low-mass X-ray binary system, specifically Scorpius X-1.  (The gravitational waves in this case come not from the orbit of the neutron star, but from the fact that it's deformed and spinning.)  This is one of the most promising continuous GW sources, with a predicted signal strength that may be within the reach of advanced detectors.  PI Whelan and graduate student Yuanhao Zhang produced a search program which was demonstrated to be the most sensitive in a "mock data challenge", and is now being applied to the search of advanced LIGO data. PI Whelan and collaborators produced a new set of coordinates to describe a set of parameters for a continuous gravitational wave signal, and used those to improve the estimation of certain detection statistics. PI Whelan and collaborators worked out a method to account for the uncertainty in detector calibration (turning detector output into GW strength) in searches for a random background of gravitational waves, which has been applied to searches on LIGO and Virgo data. Undergraduate Jackson Henry produced visualization of the directional dependence of LIGO and Virgo's sensitivity to binary neutron stars and black holes.  (The detectors can see farther in some directions than others, and at a given distance, some fraction of the signals will be seen.)   Broader impacts of the award included career development for students Zhang and Henry (both of whom had the opportunity for long visits to the Albert Einstein Institute in Hannover, Germany), and public dissemination of gravitational wave science, especially after the GW150914 and GW151226 dectections.
