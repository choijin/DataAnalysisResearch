<AbstractNarration>An important trend in university-industry relationships is the negotiation by companies, particularly within the pharmaceutical industry, of multi-year partnerships with universities.  Such partnerships provide significant unrestricted and sponsored research funding to universities, often in exchange for the right of the company to license intellectual property from university discoveries in fields of interest and the opportunity to develop collaborations with university scientists.  The performance of university-industry partnerships has varied, though many completed partnerships from the 1980s and 1990s appear to have performed poorly and were not renewed by the industry partner.  In recent years several pharmaceutical companies have negotiated new partnerships with universities that have significant changes in governance arrangements.  The newer partnerships include formal contracts that replace up-front funding to universities with milestone based funding arrangements based on the performance of the partnership, and emphasize close day to day technical collaboration between university and industry scientists through the co-location of industry laboratories near university campuses.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This project studies the goals, governance, and performance of several university-industry partnerships sponsored by pharmaceutical firms.  The project examines whether the performance of university-industry partnerships can be explained by differences in the formal and informal governance mechanisms used within partnerships.  It also studies whether the performance of university-industry partnerships can be improved through innovation in the design of governance arrangements.  The project implements a mixed methodology case study approach to examine the goals, governance arrangements and performance of partnerships.  The research combines descriptive data obtained through bibliometric and patent research with evidence developed through interviews with university and industry alliance managers and scientists involved in sponsored research collaborations within partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Multi-year university-industry partnerships are an important mechanism by which academic science is being commercialized, involving many of the country?s elite universities and science departments.  The project contributes to the field of science and technology policy through creating in-depth case studies of the goals, governance, and performance of several multi-year university-industry partnerships.  The governance of university-industry partnerships is malleable to policy:  the formal contracts, informal norms, and patterns of technical collaboration created within partnerships can be changed to mirror improved practice.   The results of the project are likely to be of particular interest to university and government officials involved in creating policy surrounding university-industry relationships and the commercialization of science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project examined the governance of university-industry partnerships.  Over the past 25 years formal partnerships between universities and companies have grown in importance.  Universities view industry as a source of research funding and a channel through which basic research discoveries can be developed so that they can benefit society.  Companies have turned more and more to university scientists as a source of innovations that they can develop.  This trend is most pronounced in the pharmaceutical industry, in which most large companies have established a variety of drug discovery oriented partnerships with universities.  The "Contracting for Innovation" project was a first of its kind project aiming to systematically examine the governance of university-industry partnerships in the pharmaceutical industry.  While university-industry partnerships offer rewards to both parties, they can be challenging to manage.  Universities and companies have different overarching goals.  While commercializing activities have become important to universities, this goal is often superseded by core educational and research objectives.  While companies are interested in having a positive impact on society, as 'for profit' organizations they must organize their research efforts to maximize the probability of commercial success. These differences can create important governance challenges.    Research findings were used to develop a typology of different types of university-industry partnerships.  This typology is useful, as it can be used to anticipate differences in governance challenges that particular partnerships are likely to face. For example, one popular type of partnership, named a "tapping in" partnership, is structured around an exchange in which companies pay up front funding to universities in exchange to a first right of access to intellectual property from research discoveries in areas of interest. While attractive to university administrators, such partnerships are often frowned upon by university professors, as they restrict their ability to choose how academic discoveries from their labs will be commercialized.  The governance of such projects often involves the creation of supplemental incentives and mechanisms to help ensure that professors actively participate in the collaboration.  Other types of partnerships have different governance challenges.  For example, many recent partnerships aim to foster highly collaborative drug discovery projects between university and industry scientists, often through providing strong financial incentives to professors to participate. While such projects are usually more successful at recruiting professors to participate, they often struggle due to differences in norms by which universities and industry scientists conduct research. As a result, project management becomes a central strategy used to create strong performance.   A central finding of this project is that, across all types of university-industry partnerships, creating incentives for professors to actively commit to university-industry projects is a key challenge.  Many professors with a strong entrepreneurial orientation avoid participation in university-industry partnerships due to a concern over losing commercial autonomy over results from such research.  If university-industry partnerships are to prosper, creating effective incentives that foster active participation by professors, particularly within collaborative research projects, is a key issue going forward.
