<AbstractNarration>The Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SKIO) is awarded funding to continue operations of research vessel Savannah in support NSF-funded scientific research within Georgia's coastal and ocean waters in the year 2012.   For 2012, R/V Savannah plans to operate 168 days, of which 99 days are in support of NSF peer-reviewed sea-going science.  This is a five-year cooperative agreement, and funding for the years 2013-2016 will be re-negotiated and evaluated based on the number of days in service of NSF funded research.  R/V Savannah is operated as a University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) ship, and as such follows UNOLS safety standards and NSF inspection requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual and Technical Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R/V Savannah is a 92-foot coastal research vessel, which was delivered from Washburn and Doughty shipbuilders in September 2001. This ship is one of the most capable platforms for conducting oceanographic research and education activities in the continental shelf, estuarine, and riverine environments of the Southeastern U.S.  The vessel has been used to examine rates of benthic primary production on the West Florida Shelf and South Atlantic Bight, to assess microbial diversity in environments ranging from coastal estuaries to the Gulf Stream, to examine the biogeochemical dynamics within the Long Term Ecosystem Research (LTER) study sites and to develop a regional coastal observing system. In addition, the Savannah has been and will be used for a multibeam survey of the Savannah River. The deck space, a large hydraulic A-frame, which maximizes the cable bend radius necessary to deploy acoustic packages, and generally quiet vessel operations make this vessel ideal for these kinds of projects.   R/V Savannahs design capacity to sleep 19  scientists plus crew enables the ship to accommodate large science parties for it's size.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;Over the past six years, the Research Vessel <em>Savannah</em> has provided a safe and capable platform for oceanographic research at a competitive day rate.&nbsp; As would be expected, as a vessel operating in coastal and shelf/slope regions, the <em>Savannah</em> supported a diverse array of science in this time period, from molecular biology/ecology to trace element biogeochemistry to observational physical oceanography. With a large suite of onboard as well as shared-use scientific equipment, including surface and water column characterization instruments, a wide spectrum of biotic and sediment sampling gear, 300 and 1200 kHz ADCPs, and bottom mapping capability with an Edgetech 4600 interferometric side scan system, the R/V <em>Savannah </em>is well equipped for a variety of science missions in estuarine, coastal shelf and open ocean environments. Indeed, the vessel has supported important work for the federal government in addition to the research support; most notably in support of Southeastern fisheries assessments and as a support vessel for Navy ship trials. The <em>Savannah </em>operated over 200 cruises from 2012-2017, and spent approximately 1,000 days at sea. More than 90 % of the <em>Savannah</em> cruises have been federally funded over the past 6 years, primarily by NSF, NOAA, and ONR. In general, the federal projects are based on competitive proposals and are peer reviewed for their intellectual merit, value to the scientific community and broader societal impacts. &nbsp;It is our expectation that future years of operations will support similar, important research efforts.</p> <p>When the R/V <em>Savannah</em> was designed and built in 2001 for Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, emphasis was placed on providing a research platform that also excelled for educational endeavors. Over the past six years, the <em>Savannah</em> has continued to provide an excellent platform for educational activities.&nbsp; Given the relatively large number of science berths, the <em>Savannah</em> is often used for this purpose, either as the primary cruise mission or by making room for students to join other research cruises. The <em>Savannah</em> continues to see use for educational purposes in 2018 and will continue to do so in years to come.</p> <p>Marine science education projects aboard the R/V <em>Savannah</em> from 2012 to 2017 offered cruise opportunities for hundreds of graduate and undergraduate students, high school science teachers, and observers. During this period, students logged over 2,000 days at sea. Because of strong and close ties that have been built between Skidaway faculty members and faculty members from Savannah State University, a minority institution, SSU is a consistent partner and user of the vessel. In most years students from SSU and other colleges and universities nationwide participated in two-day cruises aboard the R/V <em>Savannah</em> as part of the Research for Undergraduates (REU) and the Enhancing Diversity in Geoscience Education through Coastal Research in a Port City (EDGE) programs.&nbsp; These NSF-sponsored cruises<strong> </strong>allow the students, many of whom represent underrepresented populations, to participate in oceanographic sampling regimes and to experience life at sea aboard a working research vessel. Other universities utilize the <em>Savannah</em> for educational programs as well.&nbsp; In addition, Skidaway Institute of Oceanography and the state of Georgia annually fund approximately 5 days, for use in student educational activities and for use by beginning investigators to build capabilities and new research programs that focus on at-sea efforts.</p> <p>Throughout the year, guided tours of the institute and the Research Vessel <em>Savannah </em>are conducted for members of the public. <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>These tours illustrate how the vessel and its associated equipment are used for particular projects and oceanographic research in general, emphasizing the importance of such assets in the light of increased pressure from development on coastal ecosystems. Each year, the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography opens its doors to the public during the Skidaway Marine Science Day open house.&nbsp; Through displays and demonstrations, many geared toward children and youth, visitors are given a snapshot of some of the challenges facing the oceans and where there are opportunities for involvement. &nbsp;By far the biggest attraction of this event is the R/V <em>Savannah,</em> where scientists, technicians and crew are on hand to discuss various projects, demonstrate equipment and provide a sense of what it is like to live and work at sea.&nbsp; For example, demonstrations during the October 2015 event included AUV, mooring, water column and sediment sampling equipment, along with displays on ship operations, fisheries and zooplankton research.&nbsp; Approximately 1800-2500 people attend each year.
