<AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative research project is to address the grand challenge caused by the skin and proximity effects in high-frequency applications. The objective of this project is to develop copper wires coated with copper-decorated carbon nanotubes to achieve reduced energy loss and overheating in electrical and electronic devices. The research approaches include realization of copper-decorated carbon nanotubes on textured copper wires to reduce the inter-tube impedance of carbon-nanotube films, uniformly aligning carbon nanotubes on copper wires using a simple mechanical wiping method, understanding the mechanism of reduced skin and proximity effects in carbon-nanotube-coated copper wires, and reducing the energy loss and overheating using the carbon-nanotube-coated copper wires. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to significant outcomes, including controllable, aligned coating of carbon nanotubes on copper wires, fabricating robust CNT films through mechanical wiping, and carbon-nanotube-coated copper wires of high electrical and thermal conductivities for high-frequency applications. This research will impact all societal levels by revolutionizing the performance of copper wires in a wide range of applications. Practically, the proposed method is expected to provide a novel approach to reduce energy loss and heat generation in high-frequency applications. The research results will also contribute to productivity improvement, energy savings, and environmental protection in related industries that rely on high-frequency electrical signals and powers. Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit through involvement in the research and classroom instruction. The engagement of K-12 students and teachers in this project will also establish new partnerships between the universities and K-12 schools.</AbstractNarration>
