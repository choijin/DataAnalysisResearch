<AbstractNarration>This project studies Internet censorship as practiced by some of today's nation-states.  The effort emphasizes analyzing the techncial measures used by censors to perform censorship, the extent to which their operations inflict collateral damage (unintended blocking, or blocking of activity wholly outside the censoring nation), and vulnerabilities due to the specifics of how censorship operates.  Regarding this latter, we analyze flaws in either how the censorship monitoring detects particular network traffic to suppress, or in how the monitor then attempts to block or disrupt the target traffic.  This facet of the research focuses on forms of monitoring that eavesdrop on network links, analyze copies of transmitted traffic, and then inject forged traffic, seemingly sent from one of the communication endpoints to the other, instructing the other party to cease communication.  Such "on-path" monitoring is subject to a number of potential manipulations and evasions due to the inexact view the monitor has of the comunication as actually seen by the communicating parties.  We in particular then work towards developing tools and changes to Internet technology that can resist these forms of disruption and thus enable users to access the Internet freely.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on countering abusive government control of citizenry Internet access. The effort primarily tackled censorship by countries such as China and Pakistan, in a number of ways.  (1) We measured the operation of these countries' large-scale censorship deployments, illuminating the nature of the technology they employ and its implications regarding the types of prohibited content and "collateral damage" in terms of inadvertently blocked content due to overly broad censorship mechanisms.  (2) We identified vulnerabilities in these technologies that users could leverage to obtain access to banned content, finding that specific technical decisions by censors often render their devices blind to certain forms of Internet traffic.  (3) We measured how users respond to the imposition of censorship by seeking out alternative content or switching to technologies that can evade the censorship.  In doing so, we also documented how censorship can inadvertently impose financial burdens on third parties such as Internet Service Providers.  (4) We analyzed how academic research efforts can align their efforts with real-world censorship issues, rather than theoretical/worst-case "what-if" considerations that in fact are far removed from the practical capabilities of actual censors.  (5) We facilitated the development of a real-world censorship circumvention system that supports around 10,000 users each day. In addition, this project supported an extensive effort to characterize how countries suppress free expression by employing targeted attacks to surveil, and ultimately repress, those that they deem as standing in opposition to the government.  This work primarily focused on surveillance attacks conducted by governments in the Middle East (Bahrain, United Arab Emirates) against their political opponents.  We documented the nature of these attacks, their technical components, the consequences suffered by the targets, and the commercial products used to conduct the attacks.  We were further able to map out the broader use around the Internet of some of these products, providing evidence that the companies selling the technologies appear to be violating their stated business ethics. Our work assessing the disconnect between academic work on censorship circumvention versus the actual practices of censors has promise for placing the evaluation of censorship circumvention techniques on a more principled, empirical basis than currently employed.  Our work on nation-state surveillance of opponents has helped seed the development of a new sub-field of security that tackles the very challenging domain of targeted attacks for which the targets have very few resources for defending themselves. More broadly, our project aimed to enhance Internet access for millions of users around the world.  This has the potential to deliver a substantial impact on society at large.  The 10,000 concurrent users of the circumvention system mentioned above speaks concretely to significant impact in this regard. Finally, our project seeded a broader collaboration that is now pursuing the themes framed above in a deeper and more extensive fashion.
