<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to develop a cost-efficient approach to harvesting sun radiative energy in infrared spectral range, which constitutes almost half of all solar energy received by the Earth but remains wasted by conventional photovoltaic solar cells. The approach is to implement carbon nanotubes, which have excellent absorption strength in the infrared range, in the form of thin films and highly-ordered planar arrays, either alone or in combination with established high-ZT materials for infrared-radiation harvesting and electrical power generation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This work addresses the fundamental difficulties in harvesting a significant portion of sun radiation and will help realize novel low-cost technologies for engineering spectrally-complementary infrared photovoltaic systems that can also operate in the dark. The study will engage design, synthesis, characterization, and performance modeling of low-cost photovoltaic systems for power generation based on a photo-thermo-electrical conversion principle. Performance assessment models will be built to validate the physical mechanisms underlying nanoscale thermo-electric phenomena and to help better understand the performance bottleneck of electrical power generation in nanostructured, highly complex media. Optimization studies will investigate the role of competing heat transport channels and many floating device parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The study will enhance energy recycling and conservation efforts, including recovering low-grade heat in household and office heating systems, furnaces, and automobiles, that are critical for reducing dependence on non-renewable and environmentally unsafe energy sources. The project will engage graduate, undergraduate, and underrepresented students in nanomaterials and nanodevice engineering for energy-harvesting applications.</AbstractNarration>

Graphene shares the same hexagonal lattice of carbon  with carbon nanotubes and is another candidate material for energy harvesting. Vertically-integrated graphene-semiconductor systems in particular remain of significant technological importance for their promise to propel the development of advanced carbon-based opto-electronic devices, including solar cells. With this in mind, we have assembled and carried out a series of bias-, gate-dependent transport and photoconduction measurements to probe the opto-electronic characteristics of metal-graphene-4H-SiC (0001) (Si-face) heterojunctions.

The results of the photocurrent tests point to a light-assisted minority carrier injection as a key mechanism behind the photoconductive gain obtained in the devices subject to a weak, sub-bandgap cw-excitation, the conditions typical for solar-cell operation. ?     As a part of our study of photo-thermo-voltaic effects in graphene, use of plasmonic nanostructures with graphene to achieve both photosensitivity improvement and free charge carrier manipulation with optical radiation has been one of the promising research venues. Yet, in contrast to prior literature reports we have argued that the photocurrent generation reported in a variety of graphene-plasmonic devices subject to optical excitation is simply induced by photo-thermo-electric effect, which is unrelated to excess photo-carrier generation. This makes it impossible to directly control free carrier density and type in graphene using plasmonic excitation pathways, the prospects of which were mistakenly raised recently.     A low-T vapor-based growth method was proven viable to producing stochiometric single crystal platelets in Cd3As2 that keep promise for implemenation in IR-photo-thermoelectrics (position dependent photovoltaic measurements). Temperature dependent I-V tests confirm Ohmic-like transport behavior consistent with the semi-metallic character of the samples. and the primary pathway of the minority carrier generation in our sample is phonon-assisted interband electronic transitions that likely involve E and A1 electronic bands.  Yet, with combined high room-temperature thermopowers of ~613 uV/K and ultra-low thermal conductivity, bulk Cd3As2 is identified as another, highly promising phonon-glass electron-crystal TE material for application in a low-T high efficiency thermo-electric power convertors/ generators.  Photo-thermo voltaic tests were performed on Cd3As2 and the results indicate on the presence of a strong thermally-induced emf-voltage in IR that makes them equally promising for application in IR photovoltaics, with room temperature ZT well exceeding 1, making Dirac semimetals better candidates for application in photo-thermo-voltaic energy conversion.
