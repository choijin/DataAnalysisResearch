<AbstractNarration>The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems contribute funds to this award.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports participation of students and junior investigators at the 2012 Colloidal, Macromolecular &amp; Polyelectrolyte Solutions Gordon Research Conference that will be held February 5-10. This conference will bring together a diverse group of recognized leading researchers to exchange ideas on the topics of surface lubrication, application of ion-containing polymers in areas of energy technology, solution properties of polymers in ionic liquids, biological and polymeric networks and gels, nanoparticle application in science and technology, electrostatic induced assembly, and rheology and microrheology of colloids and gels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advancements in biotechnology, nanotechnology, energy and soft materials have generated great interest in colloidal and polymer science. The Gordon Research Conference on Colloidal, Macromolecular &amp; Polyelectrolyte Solutions explores the frontiers of research on complex solutions of charged, macromolecular and colloidal systems and their interfaces. This conference has a strong interdisciplinary tradition bringing together materials scientists, engineers, physicists, and chemists. The conference attracts industrial, governmental and academic scientists from around the nation and the world. The program highlights the impact of colloidal, macromolecular and polyelectrolyte solutions on materials and especially advanced nanostructured materials and nanocomposites. The conference will present the latest exciting results of top researchers in the colloid, polymer and polyelectrolyte fields. Fundamental problems within these fields and their application to the other relevant disciplines will be discussed. The impact of these fundamental ideas on specific applications in areas such as formulations, battery design, lab-on-a-chip development, materials design and separation of biomacromolecules with application in drug delivery and other therapeutics will be highlighted through specific speakers and involvement of industrial scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference seeks to gather people in the field and to foster interactions among them and with graduate students and post-doctoral researchers in an effort to generate and disseminate new ideas across the community. Participants from both academia and industry will ensure that discussions range from fundamental aspects to practical applications. The program for this meeting includes representation of female, African American and Hispanic speakers and discussion leaders. The organizers will strive to ensure that during the selection of participants to the meeting, a diverse audience including many students, postdocs and young faculty from US institutions will be achieved.</AbstractNarration>

There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions.
