<AbstractNarration>The proposed research is on second order inferences for causal nonstationary processes. While a causal stationary process can be viewed as generated by filtering a set of past innovations, one can allow the filter to be time-changing, and henceforth introduce nonstationarity. Two sets of problems are considered. First, for linear models with nonstationary errors, the investigator addresses the estimation of covariance matrices of the least square estimates, as well as general M-estimates. Second, the PI studies the estimation of time-varying covariance functions, time-varying spectrum and covariance matrices of the observed time series. Simultaneous inferences of autocovariance functions and spectra can be used to study their patterns and trends, and are also of interests. The study requires several tools to be developed for nonstationary processes, including empirical processes, Gaussian approximations, strong invariance principles and large deviations for quadratic forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stationarity has played an important role in classical time series analysis, which basically says that the overall structure does not change over time. However, in many scientific fields, including economics, engineering, environmental science, finance, and neuroscience etc, it is not realistic to believe the observed time series are stationary. Results from the proposed research will be useful in understanding the nature of the data from various disciplines, making forecasts and conclusions.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the second order inferences in the proposal are general and fundamental, and will facilitate further statistical analysis of nonstationary time series.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Interllectual Merit  The project considers inferences of time series based on sample covariances and autocovariances, which are of fundamental importance, for both theories and applications. Probability inequalities are established for stationary and nonstationary time series, which are of general use for studies of dependent data. Complex autoregressive and moving average type models are developed for nonlinear and non-Gaussian data, as well as functional time series. The project has the following major outcomes.  The asymptotic distribution of the maximum deviation of sample covariances is obtained for dependent data, which is useful in testing the covariance structure for high dimensional data.  The limiting distributions of the maximum and quadratic deviations of sample autocovariances are obtained under the existence of serial correlations, which is useful in testing serial correlation, constructing confidence bands, bandwidth selection of nonparametric spectral density estimates, and order selection of a linear system etc. To obtain these results, various moment inequalities and large deviations of quadratic forms are established under dependence, which are of potential use for other studies of dependent data.  Nagaev and Rosenthal type inequalities are obtained for general stationary and nonstationary time series. The study is carried under the framework of causal representation coupled with physical dependence measures. Both the framework and the results are useful for other asymptotic studies of time series data.  The generalized autoregressive and moving average (GARMA) models with martingale errors are developed.
