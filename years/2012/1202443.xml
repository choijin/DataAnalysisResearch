<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Objective: Seven key challenges have been identified related to theory, design, and manufacturing of metamaterials. Simultaneous solutions to these challenges will transform the design of all devices working on electromagnetic principles and enable novel devices that challenge the human imagination today. This project will address four of those seven key challenges through a single prototype that simultaneously demonstrates (1) full isotropy, (2) negative index, (3) operation in optical wavelengths, and (4) bulk fabrication using a combined ?meandering wire? concept and a novel 3D stimulated emission depletion microscopy-inspired direct laser writing fabrication.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Stringent requirements already imposed by the prototype will set it as a benchmark for many future optical metamaterial devices that challenge the human imagination today. This project will leverage state-of-the art 3D optical lithography and boost other complementary efforts in the field to address the remaining challenges which are (5) compensation of optical losses, (6) tunability, (7) broad bandwidth, and operation in higher optical frequencies for more functionalities.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Broader impacts of the project include (1) exploring the most viable route for "making optics from scratch" and advancing the science of controlling light on-demand, (2) advancing state-of-the-art imaging, sensing, lithography, and nanomanufacturing science and technology, (3) strengthening collaborations with world-renowned national and international research teams, (4) training graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary and international environments, (5) taking the right steps for turning academic curiosity into industrial products, and (6) establishing a popular research track to attract young students for careers in science, mathematics, and engineering</AbstractNarration>
