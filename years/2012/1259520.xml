<AbstractNarration>By Encouraging the Next Generation of Innovative iNtelligent Engaged Engineers to Reach Success, the ENGINEERS program within the U. A. Whitaker College of Engineering at Florida Gulf Coast University gives academically talented students with demonstrated financial need the opportunity to augment their educational experience through enhanced academic mentoring and meaningful extracurricular activities tailored to their own requirements for professional development. In their first two years in the program, participants are provided with enriched academic support, cohort and programmatic activities, discipline specific mentoring, and additional opportunities to engage the engineering community within the University and the Southwest Florida region. Programs designed to improve technical writing skills, resume building, and effective learning are offered to maximize each participant's chances of success. In their last two year in the program, based on their career goals and aspirations, each student links with a mentor whose expertise is consistent with the student's chosen career path (post-graduate education, immediate entry into the work force or entrepreneurial endeavors). Each student, in consultation with the program staff and mentors, develops a plan that encompasses a series of specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely goals that fit their career development needs. Progress is assessed through end of the semester portfolio reviews with the program staff, as well as regularly scheduled meetings with their mentor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to enhancing each participant's educational experience, the ENGINEERS program encourages civic engagement from the demographically diverse cohort. The impact of programmatic activities on the student cohorts undergoes formative and summative assessment with the findings broadly disseminated at the college, university, and national level to contribute to best practices for implementing targeted extracurricular activities that significantly enhance the student educational experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Scholarships to Encourage the Next Generation of Innovative iNtelligent Engaged Engineers to Reach Success (ENGINEERS) Program was run within the U.A. Whitaker College of Engineering at Florida Gulf Coast University from August 2013 &ndash; June 2020. During that time, 52 students participated in the program across 5 cohorts arranged based on their anticipated graduation dates. Most students in the program were identified upon entry or transfer into the University, and thus were provided up to four years of scholarship support. In total, scholarships from this program covered over 45% of the participants’ collective tuition during their time in the program. By the end of 2020, 37 students from the ENGINEERS Program will have graduated from FGCU with degrees in Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, or Software Engineering.  These students have gone on to begin successful careers at a variety of engineering firms within and outside the Southwest Florida region. Additionally, several students have continued their educational pursuits in both Masters- and Doctoral-level programs across the country.     The primary objective of the ENGINEERS program was to develop well-rounded and civic-minded engineers confident in their ability to adapt to the challenges implicit in today’s modern world. In addition to finding talented students demonstrating financial need, cohorts were developed to meet or exceed the national demographics for undergraduate engineering students nationwide with respect to gender, race and ethnicity. Compared to the most recent national numbers for undergraduate engineering students [1], our overall cohort population met this goal, with 52% of the student participants being female (compared to 23.9% nationally), 15.4% identifying as being Hispanic (compared to 13.3% nationally) and 13.5% identifying as being Black or African American (compared to 4.6% nationally). Students were encouraged to develop and maintain relationships within and across the various cohorts through an exclusive, designated study-area within the engineering building. In-person social activities were planned throughout the year, and on-line content related to university activities, services and opportunities was provided through the dedicated ENGINEERS site in the University’s Learning Management System.    In addition to the peer support provided by the relationships developed within and across the cohorts, the program was designed to provide supplemental support, including early and enhanced faculty mentoring, to assist students in their professional development as they progressed through their chosen degree program. Students were also encouraged to create and maintain student enhancement plans (SEPs) that focused on the development of short and medium-range SMART goals (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time bound) within the areas of scholarship, professional development, and community outreach. To further encourage and enable student enhancement, the ENGINEERS program also offered a series of mini-grant awards that provided additional funding for professional development activities such as conference travel funds, aid in purchasing review materials for post-graduate testing (FE, GRE, MCAT, etc.), funding for research supplies, or other materials and activities that the students identified as fostering their SEP goals. These SEPs were regularly checked and revised to provide a framework by which students could identify opportunities to engage in activities that would enable them to be better prepared to meet their stated post-graduation professional goals. The SEPs proved to be effective in terms of student motivation and success and have been adopted as an activity in our required freshman-level Introduction to the Engineering Profession course.
