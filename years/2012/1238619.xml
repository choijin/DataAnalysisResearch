<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project at Carnegie Mellon University tests an educational game aimed at addressing problems students face learning mathematics. The PI plans to design, develop, iteratively test, and scientifically evaluate a potentially transformative gaming technology. This approach combines an educational game environment, erroneous mathematics examples, state-of-the-art interaction design, and adaptive tutoring technology to help engage and motivate students to learn mathematics. The project develops a blueprint for educational games that can be used with middle school students in both formal and informal settings. Two research questions guide the research: Can erroneous examples increase learning and add motivation to an educational game? Will making erroneous examples adaptive to individual students increase learning and motivation beyond the non-adaptive version of the educational game? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project randomly assigns 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students to an intervention that brings together design thinking and design activity in co-designing sessions involving students and their teachers. This approach allows students and teachers to create prototypes of specific interfaces for mathematical games using results from the co-designing sessions. The prototypes involves developing personas, scenarios, wire-framing, rapid prototyping, and speed dating. It also includes rapid concept evaluation sessions created iteratively with students and their teachers to inform the final game design. An online software instrument logs student data from pre-questionnaire, pretest, game playing, posttest, delayed post-test, and post-questionnaire. The software also logs correct and incorrect attempts at solving problems, evaluations of these attempts by the tutor, the number of hints requested, and the amount of time spent on task. These data provide immediate feedback to teachers and researchers about student understanding of specific concepts in mathematics. The project assembles a multi-disciplinary team of experts from learning domains using erroneous examples, educational technology, intelligent tutoring systems, human-computer interaction and interaction design, prolific experimental educational psychologist, and a cognitive scientist with a long history and knowledge of mathematics education. The expectation is that these partners will increase the effectiveness of the design outcome as proven in other co-design studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A pressing need in U.S. education is finding ways not only to teach young people the important and essential skills of, for instance, mathematics and science, but also to motivate students to want to learn in the first place. One way to achieve this is to try to engage them in learning using a technology many young people are naturally excited about: computer games.  In this project we have taken steps in this direction by developing a computer-based educational game that is aimed at motivating students to learn decimals.  The game, called Decimal Point, uses an amusement park metaphor to engage middle school students in learning.  Students make their way through the virtual park, playing games that incorporate decimal challenges, such as ordering a set of decimals, adding two decimals, and completing a sequence of decimal numbers.  In addition to the game, we also employed an instructional device that has been shown to be beneficial in more traditional contexts: erroneous examples, step-by-step solutions to problems with one or more errors that students are prompted to find and fix, to help motivate and teach students.  The integration of a game-like environment and erroneous examples is the core idea of the project and an instructional approach that has not previously been developed or scientifically tested.  During the course of this two-year NSF-funded project, we developed the virtual amusement park, Decimal Point (see the image "Decimal Point - An Amusement Park Game"), as well as a series of 24 different mini-games, each of which provides practice with decimals (see, for instance, the images "Capture the Ghost", "Thirsty Vampire", "Jungle Zip Line", "Knight's Oath").  We conducted a classroom playtest with Decimal Point with almost 100 middle school students and later a full empirical test of the game with 172 other students.  We found that students learned from playing the game, from pretest to posttest and delayed posttest, but we didn't find that erroneous examples made the difference to that learning.  Our student population included an almost equal mix of males and females and a representative mix of students of different ethnic and racial backgrounds.  Our project has uncovered and helped us specify a blueprint for building this type of educational game, by bringing together experts from relevant research areas, such as computer science, learning science, educational psychology, math education, and interaction design. With an initial version of the game in place, our project team intends to continue testing and extending the game software.
