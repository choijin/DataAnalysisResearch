<AbstractNarration>The rule of law and secure property rights are thought to be essential ingredients for economic growth and prosperity. But how does the rule of law emerge? Why do some governments enforce laws while others ignore them? This project investigates the origins of the strong legal institutions through a study of property rights in China. Over the past decade, local governments in China have illegally seized land from hundreds of thousands of farmers. Yet in some areas of the country, farmers evidently enjoy stronger protection of their legal rights than in others. According to official statistics, in some provinces less than 1 percent of land seizures are illegal while in others the figure is as high as 24 percent. What explains the relative strength and weakness of property institutions in different areas of China?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this question, this project uses multiple methods. A new geospatial dataset of close to a million property seizures will provide a broad picture of what economic and political conditions are associated with increased rule of law. This project includes a comparative analysis of cities in four Chinese provinces. These case studies will provide a more detailed understanding of the processes that allow individuals to act to protect their legal rights and strengthen institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The origins of strong laws and secure property rights are of interest to policymakers as well as scholars. Development agencies often work to build stable institutional foundations that can lead to long-term growth without long-term aid commitments. The issue is also relevant to policymakers who want to build the rule of law in unstable countries that pose potential security threats. The project generates theory and data for these efforts to move from well-designed laws to well-enforced ones.</AbstractNarration>
