<AbstractNarration>Borisov's project aims to further the understanding of derived categories of algebraic varieties, which are used to describe boundary conditions that govern the propagation of open strings. He will verify the expected derived equivalence of double mirror Calabi-Yau complete intersections in toric varieties. He will work to construct flat families of triangulated categories that interpolate between derived categories of different crepant resolutions of a toric singularity. Borisov will also attempt to settle the conjecture that states that birational algebraic varieties with the same canonical divisor are derived equivalent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String theory is the leading physical candidate for the unified theory of the known physical forces. Despite steady progress in recent years, mathematical aspects of string theory are not yet adequately understood. This dearth of understanding is an obstacle to further development of string theory which is needed to connect it with the real world phenomena. Borisov will contribute to an active branch of mathematics research which is related to and is inspired by string theory, and will train a graduate student in this area of study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Algebraic geometry is a well-established area of mathematics which studies properties of geometric objects by means of polynomial functions. It has historically been connected to multiple other branches of both pure and applied mathematics as well as physics, computer science and more recently biology.  For the past several decades algebraic geometry has enjoyed a mutually beneficial interaction with the string theory area of theoretical physics. This interaction has led to many important new questions and results in both fields. In particular, on the mathematical side, it lead to a renewed interest in the subjects of toric varieties and of derived categories of coherent sheaves of algebraic varieties, both of which fall within the focus area of Borisov?s project.  Intellectual merit of the project activity. Working with multiple collaborators, including graduate students, Borisov made significant progress in answering a diverse list of mathematical questions. This work resulted in over a dozen publications and/or preprints most of which appeared or will soon appear in peer-reviewed journals, as well as multiple seminar and conference presentations. In particular, Borisov's results connect the string theory inspired algebraic geometry with its more traditional areas which will help further develop the field.  Broader impact of the project activity. Borisov trained two graduate students, Zhan Li and Howard Nuer who received their PhD degrees in 2014 and 2016 respectively. Both of them now continue research in the area of algebraic geometry.        Last Modified: 05/03/2017       Submitted by: Lev A Borisov]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
