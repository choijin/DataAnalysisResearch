<AbstractNarration>The PIs at Otterbein College will conduct a self assessment in the areas of bias/climate, service obligations, work-life balance, and issues surrounding invisible women (e.g., adjunct, part-time, those not well integrated into departments.)  They will use existing data sources as well as subscribe to the COACHE survey.  They will interview women who have left Otterbein, and convene focus groups of invisible women.  They plan to institutionalize some data collection efforts.  In addition they will utilize the existing mechanism of Professional Learning Communities to bring ADVANCE topics to the faculty.  Otterbein is a PUI and aligns their activities well with the specific needs of PUIs. In particular the focus on ?invisible women? is very relevant as many institutions are increasing their non-tenure-track faculty, especially PUIs.  Results could prove to have national significance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From 2012-2015, with the support of the NSF ADVANCE IT-CATALYST grant to Otterbein University, we examined issues of gender stereotypes, service responsibilities, and work-life balance as they pertained to our full-time and part-time faculty, especially women in STEM disciplines.

Using national surveys (COACHE), analysis of existing data, and an audit of 5 years of annual performance evaluations, we examined patterns of service among faculty by discipline, gender, and rank, finding that "invisible service" (e.g., appointed ad-hoc committees), rather than "visible" service (e.g., elected committees) was primarily responsible for gender inequities in service responsibilities. We also found that women faculty were advising a disproportionate number of students and student research projects as compared to male faculty. Although small schools are seen as more female-friendly than large institutions, it appears that there are still ways in which small schools hinder the progress of female science professors. One conclusion is that it is important that small schools recognize this and address systematic biases that make it harder for women to be a professor in a STEM discipline. A large proportion of faculty jobs in this country are at PUI institutions and as such it is important to mentor beginning women scientists on how to have a successful career at smaller institutions.  At our institution, data from the COACHE survey as well as the service audit helped inform many changes related to the governance system with an eye on reducing service obligations and helping to ensure a more equitable distribution of work across faculty.

The treatment of contingent or part-time faculty is a vexing issue throughout higher education.  The STEM fields often utilize part-time faculty in laboratory classes.

Our results also made clear that smaller institutions are not immune to systematic biases that plague R1 academic departments.  They may manifest differently but have similar effects on the career progress of female STEM faculty.  This knowledge may encourage other small institutions to engage in self-study and also impact career counseling for faculty considering a career at a small institution or those who have already embarked on one.
