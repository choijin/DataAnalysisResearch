<AbstractNarration>Cyber physical systems (CPSs) are merging into major mobile systems of our society, such as public transportation, supply chains, and taxi networks. Past researchers have accumulated significant knowledge for designing cyber physical systems, such as for military surveillance, infrastructure protection, scientific exploration, and smart environments, but primarily in relatively stationary settings, i.e., where spatial and mobility diversity is limited.  Differently, mobile CPSs interact with phenomena of interest at different locations and environments, and where the context information (e.g., network availability and connectivity) about these physical locations might not be available. This unique feature calls for new solutions to seamlessly integrate mobile computing with the physical world, including dynamic access to multiple wireless technologies.  The required solutions are addressed by (i) creating a network control architecture based on novel predictive hierarchical control and that accounts for characteristics of wireless communication, (ii) developing formal network control models based on in-situ network system identification and cross-layer optimization, and (iii) designing and implementing a reference implementation on a small scale wireless and vehicular test-bed based on law enforcement vehicles.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results can improve all mobile transportation systems such as future taxi control and dispatch systems. In this application advantages are: (i) reducing time for drivers to find customers; (ii) reducing time for passengers to wait; (iii) avoiding and preventing traffic congestion; (iv) reducing gas consumption and operating cost; (v) improving driver and vehicle safety, and (vi) enforcing municipal regulation. Class modules developed on mobile computing and CPS will be used at the four participating Universities and then be made available via the Web.</AbstractNarration>

However, traditional model-based techniques of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) become inadequate to capture the complexity as systems become larger and extremely dynamic. For intelligent transportation systems, how to identify and make sense of dynamic relationships between urban-scale phenomena (such as demand and supply) to improve the system-level service efficiency is still a challenging and unsolved problem. Intellectual Merit: In this project, we developed a data-driven dynamic robust resource allocation framework to match supply under spatial-temporally correlated demand uncertainties, motivated by the problem of reducing idle mileage for taxi or autonomous vehicle services. We first developed a receding horizon control (RHC) model to dispatch vehicles, which incorporates large-scale historical and real-time sensing data in demand prediction and control. To consider demand uncertainties when making decisions, we then developed a robust vehicle balancing method to provide a probabilistic guarantee about the worst-case cost, and a distributionally robust resource allocation method to minimize the worst-case expected cost.  Our data driven optimization problems were proven to be equivalent to convex optimization forms of the robust and distributionally robust resource allocation problems to ensure computationally tractability and service quality.  Broader Impact: Experiments based on real taxi operational record data were very encouraging that the receeding horizon framework and robust resource allocation methods reduce the average total idle distance and reduce the demand-supply ratio mismatch error across the city by 30% to 45%.   This could have enormous impact on more efficient trasportatonn, less congestion, economically profitable ridesharing services.  Finally we developed an algorithm that can compute the impact of autonomous cars in ridesharing services.   Our algorithm computes the discrepancy of rebalancing between two different methods for controlling the vehicle flows: (1) direct control, which models on-demand dispatchable vehicles such as autonomous vehicles and (2) indirect control based on price differences, which models human drivers as in the current ridesharing scheme.  Numerical experiments of our algorithm were performed using data fa pricing map for the Washington, DC area.          Last Modified: 01/18/2017       Submitted by: George J Pappas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
