<AbstractNarration>The Targeted Infusion Project entitled -Fostering Innovation and Excellence in Computing Systems: Establishing an Innovative Systems Laboratory - has the goal to foster innovation in undergraduate students in the Computer Science program. To foster innovation, this project uses a novel approach which systematically introduces innovation in a step-wise fashion in six courses, followed by the completion of a senior design project in the Innovative Systems Laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are to introduce innovation in six fundamental computer science courses using top down and bottom up approaches; create a web service, cloud computing and mobile computing based infrastructure framework and the associated infrastructure components within this general framework; and use this general framework to develop innovative web services and cloud computing based computing systems projects. The anticipated outcomes of this project are an increase in the number of undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in computer science (African American, Hispanic, and women), who learn the skills to innovate and demonstrate that they can use the current technologies to create innovative computing systems. The approach is scalable and replicable. This project will provide detailed setup instructions, training guides, source code and documentation to other small Computer Science programs nationwide.</AbstractNarration>

Two approaches, a top-down and bottom-up approaches were used to introduce innovation in all of computer science courses. Through top-down approach, senior students mentored lowerclassman and encouraged them to participate in the innovative projects they are working on. Senior students made presentations about their projects in the junior, sophomore and freshman level courses. All the faculties were on board to introduce innovation into computer science education, by having students work on project ideas that were innovative from the very first course of computer science degree plan.

It helped our student&rsquo;s train and think innovatively for 21st-century organizations. For the implementation of their senior design projects, having to work on the cloud-based technology that is currently being used by the corporate America, our students are going into the industry with hands-on experience and innovative thinking.

As part of the top-down approach of the project, senior design students presented their ideas to the junior, sophomore and freshman students. They had to explain their ideas in detail, and in order to explain in detail, they had to come in better prepared. And after the presentations, each senior design team took on some lowerclassman to work with them on the projects and mentored them. As part of this process, some of the students realized they liked mentoring and helping other students learn. Our students graduating college to attend graduate school has been increasing steadily since the project has begun. By continuing the approaches outlined in the project, we believe we will be able to encourage more students to complete graduate school and Ph.D. degree to enter academia.

Computer Science I is the first programming course all computer science students take. Along with CS students, we also have students register from other majors because it is a university core course. All the students (computer science and other majors) were involved with the project activities via Computer Science I course, students were involved in innovative project development via working on small parts of the innovative projects, by listening to the senior students' presentations and by attending other project activities on campus.
