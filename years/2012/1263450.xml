<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the conduct of a public workshop as a primary source of information in order to examine transformative research that has influenced the evolution of the geographical sciences and provide insights regarding how transformative research evolved in the past so that it can be encouraged in the future.  Transformative scientific concepts have resulted in significant advances by reorienting existing fields, creating new fields, and providing new theoretical or technical frameworks.  In the geographical sciences, the so-called "quantitative revolution" in the 1960s adopted a statistical approach to transform the discipline from its descriptive origins into the explanatory science it is today.  Other transformative developments in the geographical sciences have resulted from development of new computational and telecommunications advances, such as global positioning systems and geographic information systems, or through the emergence of new approaches like political ecology that draw on insights and approaches from other fields to create new ways for approaching topics.  The workshop will focus on exploring answers to three sets of focal questions:  (1) How has transformative research emerged in the past, and how did it become transformative?  (2) What might be the early markers of transformative research and how does it become possible to identify their transformative character?  (3) What has helped nurture and bring transformative research to fruition, and how can it be fostered in the geographical sciences?   A final report of the workshop conclusions will be published by the National Academies Press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will contribute to development of an intellectual framework designed to recognize and foster transformative research by examining the mechanism for significant scientific advances in the geographic sciences, with new insights likely to have value for other fields as well.  It will generate new insights that could yield potential advances in the discovery, evaluation, and promotion of transformative research that could provide a valuable guide for researchers, reviewers, and funding agencies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The central purpose of all research is to create new knowledge, with the eventual aim of applying that knowledge to important problems and issues for society and the environment in which we live.  Some research may go beyond simply creating new knowledge and may profoundly advance our understanding of a particular topic or fundamentally change the way we think about the world or approach our activities. In such instances, research is capable of "transforming" an entire field of research.  Some recent examples of transformative ideas and research include remote sensing of the environment and the development of Geographic Information Sciences (GIS).  Remote sensing of the environment has employed new satellite capabilities over the last five decades to observe and monitor important changes to the environment such as the onset and advance of drought and wildfire.  The development of GIS has fundamentally altered the way in which people communicate, travel, and conduct their daily business through subsequent growth of platforms such as Google Earth.  However, although we may recognize transformative research after it has taken hold, identification of potentially transformative research before the research begins is challenging.   Because of its positive impacts, though, transformative research can be regarded as having greater value than more conventional research, and funding agencies clearly regard transformative research as something to be encouraged and funded.  The question posed to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine committee involved in this project was whether transformative research can be identified at the time it is proposed by a researcher rather than after the research has been conducted.  The focus for the project was specifically on transformative research in the geographical sciences which concentrate largely on the relationships between space, place, and the human and non-human aspects of the Earth.  The committee?s work resulted in a report "Fostering Transformative Research in the Geographical Sciences" (publicly available for free download on the National Academies Press website) which explored the concept and history of transformative research, and the way in which transformative research might be fostered by the National Science Foundation (NSF) today.  Although the report focused on the geographical sciences at NSF, the broader findings of the report have applications for other disciplines and other organizations and agencies that provide research funding and are interested to foster potentially transformative work.  The committee?s report found that transformative innovations can arise in a variety of ways but that a research structure supportive of open innovation can encourage the kind of research, interactions, and communications needed to nurture and share transformative work.  The committee found difficulties in identifying unique indicators that could accurately identify research as being transformative prior to the research taking place but did suggest ways in which NSF could help to encourage transformative research.  These approaches included examining ways in which students could be brought into the process of transformative thinking and research; identifying ways to support and enhance diversity in the research community; and recognizing and supporting international, cross-sectoral, and cross-disciplinary collaborations.   The direct outcome of the project was the committee?s report.  Metrics on the potential impact of the report include over 1,100 downloads during the first 11 months of its release, with approximately half of those from within the United States and the remainder from a diverse set of countries in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.  Measurable outcomes of the committee?s report in future may include incorporation of explicit language in research funding calls for potentially transformative research proposals; direct recognition and continued support of diversity in the research environment; and creation of mechanisms that involve students early in the research process and in teams or projects that promote transformative approaches and thinking.
