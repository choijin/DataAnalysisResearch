<AbstractNarration>Record high snowfall in the Copper River basin, AK, during winter 2011-2012 is expected to result in anomalously high water and sediment discharge in early summer (June-July). To characterize river outflow and sediment dispersal during this time, this RAPID project will survey flow properties, sediment concentrations, and the distribution of fluid muds near the river mouth and on the shallow shelf. In addition, cores will be collected in the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound to explore the potential for developing a paleo record of Copper River discharge, which is expected to vary with climate conditions. This work will take advantage of a historic snowfall season to better understand the effects of climate perturbations on discharge and sedimentation patterns in an ecologically important high-latitude region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the week of January 18, 2012, 6.1 m of snow fell in Cordova, Alaska at the foot of the Chugach Mountain Range, and cumulative snowfall during the 2011-2012 period of December through February was twice the highest previously recorded in observations extending back to 1950.  The town of Cordova declared a state of emergency, as the extraordinary event collapsed buildings and stranded a population used to normally heavy winter snows.  The high winter precipitation for the Chugach in 2012 was related to a northerly position of the jet stream and stationary Aleutian low pressure system, which also generated warm conditions throughout much of the continental United States, and has been cited as a harbinger of present and future climate change.  The subsequent spring melt yielded unusually high water and sediment spring discharge for the nearby Copper River (which drains the Chugach), potentially altering the annual delivery cycle of suspended sediments and solutes of this large and ecologically important subarctic river into the Gulf of Alaska and adjacent Prince William Sound (PWS).   In an effort to characterize the spring river outflow from the record 2012 winter snowfall, and to explore developing historical Copper River discharge records within the sedimentary archive of PWS, the PIs obtained NSF RAPID funds to conduct a limited field effort in June-July 2012.  Because of the vagaries of field work in the Gulf of Alaska and surrounding areas using locally available platforms, funding was requested only to support the sampling effort.  Following a successful field program that oversaw the collection of water column and seabed samples and observations, we have produced some preliminary results on a subset of the samples as described below.  The preliminary analyses from our RAPID response cruise in June 2012 provide evidence of a remarkable sedimentary archive within the sediments of PWS.  Extraordinarily high sediment accumulation rates with sub-annual signal preservation suggest the potential for establishing an unprecedented high-resolution record of climate change, paleoseismicity and paleovolcanism in this climatically sensitive and geologically active area. The two end-member cores we analyzed provide clear evidence for annual and potentially sub-annual variations in Copper River and PWS inputs, and document a turbidite layer suspected to have been triggered by the Great Alaskan Earthquake of 1964, as well as probable signals of ash fallout from major volcanic eruptions.  This study points to the future opportunity to obtain longer-term (10,000 years) records within the thick sedimentary sequences that have accumulated in Prince William Sound since the last Ice Age.  Such records will help our understanding of recent climate change within the context of natural variability.  Because these sedimentary sequences also record evidence of prior earthquake activity, they are also key to our assessment of earthquake hazards in south central Alaska.
