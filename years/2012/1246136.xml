<AbstractNarration>The availability and growing use of high-performance heterogeneous computing and storage components by scientists across university campuses has led to realization that the general-purpose campus network offers neither the capacity nor the capabilities necessary for  data-intensive research project. This project designs, builds and maintains a new network at the  University of Oregon (UO) campus called Bridging Open Networks for  Scientific Applications and Innovation (BONSAI). BONSAI is designed as a high-performance science network providing high end-to-end throughput and unique capabilities between five interconnected UO facilities, as well as computing resources located at other institutions throughout Internet2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project primarily focuses on the following five major tasks:(1) Creating a Science DMZ platform among major computing facilities &lt;br/&gt;across UO; (2) Adding a new 10Gbps network circuit between the UO and Internet2; (3) Implementing and operating Software-Defined Networking(SDN) technologies throughout the network; (4) Promoting the development of IPv6- and service-aware scientific applications, and (5) Socializing the use of the UO's membership to the InCommon federation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BONSAI also serves as a testbed for experimental research on new networking technologies (e.g.,SDN) and facilitates to support data-intensive applications (e.g., visualization), including their translation for educational purposes. This project will directly impact teaching and training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers by providing access to advanced computing infrastructure and networking capabilities.  Finally, the project will significantly advance the broader access and dissemination of UO research results for advancing scientific and technological understanding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project designs and builds a new dedicated network for scientific computing at the University of Oregon (UO) campus called Bridging Open Networks for Scientific Applications and Innovation (BONSAI). The BONSAI network enables researchers across the campus (or even at other research institutions) to effectively access computational resources, storage space and visualization capabilities at UO.  The BONSAI network also has high-bandwidth connectivity to Internet2 which enables UO researchers to effectively leverage the services offered by the DYNES project.  This in turn magnifies the value of significant recent and planned investments by the UO (funded by NSF and other agencies) in computing and storage resources UO, and significantly improves their research productivity. This project has achieved the following five major tasks: (i) Creating a Science DMZ platform among major computing facilities across UO campus which includes two OerfSONAR nodes, (ii) Adding a new 10Gbps circuit between the UO and Internet2, (iii) Implementing and operating Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technologies throughout the network, (iv) Promoting the development of IPv6- and service-aware scientific applications, and (v) Socializing the use of the UO's membership to the InCommon federation.  BONSAI is a dedicated high-speed network that interconnects several computing facilities on UO campus with the domain scientists making use of these facilities.  BONSAI network also provides the underpinnings for collaboration with external research facilities by taking advantage of resources offered remotely and giving UO researchers the ability to make local computing resources available to their external collaborators. Additionally, BONSAI network serves as a testbed for experimental research on new networking technologies (e.g. SDN) and facilitates to support data-intensive applications (e.g. visualization), including their translation for educational purposes.  More broadly, the BONSAI project directly impacts teaching and training opportunities that involve undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers by providing access to advanced computing infrastructure and networking capabilities.  Finally, the BONSAI network significantly advances the broader access and dissemination of UO research results for advancing scientific and technological understanding.
