<AbstractNarration>This proposal provides funding for the first GREPSEC: Underrepresented Groups in Security Research workshop, which will be affiliated with the annual IEEE Symposium on Research in Security &amp; Privacy, in May 2013, in San Francisco CA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USC/ISI will organize a day-and-a-half long workshop for women and underrepresented minorities in computer security and privacy. The workshop will be held May 18-19, 2013. This is the weekend before the IEEE Computer Society's Security and Privacy Symposium, the premier conference in security, and this workshop will be co-located in San Francisco, California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goal of the workshop is to increase the number of women and underrepresented minorities in computer security research. Security is a wide field, encompassing network security, operating system security, language-based security, forensics, privacy, as well as legal and policy issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the organizers is to encourage PhD students who are female and from underrepresented groups to choose security as their field of specialization.  Their approach is to show the wide range of problems within the field and how women and underrepresented groups are working towards solving those problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The program and other information about the workshop can be found at:  http://www.ieee-security.org/grepsec/grepsec1/  The formal part of the meeting focused on technical areas. Researchers from academia and industry presented current security and privacy research. The students ranged from first-year graduate students with burgeoning interests in security and privacy to students close to completing their PhDs in the field.

The NSF grant provided funding to assist 27 US-based students to attend the GREPSEC workshop. The amount of support provided to each student was on average $1200.  This amount covered a portion of the studentÆs travel (economy airfare) and lodging for two nights and conference registration. Some of the speakers had travel covered by their institution; in some cases, we funded hotel and/or flights for the speaker or organizer. Selection Process  The recipients of the travel awards were selected by PI Terry Benzel, Susan Landau, and Hilarie Orman.   The program was open to women and members of underrepresented groups.  Priority was given to:  Advanced graduate students in security or privacy research;  Members of underrepresented groups who had a clear interest in security or privacy research; Beginning graduate students with an interest in security or privacy research.  Coordination with other Grants  The CRA-W/CDC program in discipline-specific workshops provided $17,000 to support the workshop.    Microsoft Research donated $5,000, which was used towards travel grants for students from non US-based institutions.   USC-ISI helped coordinate the disbursement of funds to the students from all three granting institutions in accordance with the terms of each grant.  Statistics  The combined funds from the three grants provided funding for 27 domestic and 4 international students from 23 institutions.  Grants were offered to 28 women, of whom 25 attended the workshop, and 10 members of underrepresented groups, of whom 7 attended the workshop.  The attendees included six men.  A total of 94 applications were received from 5...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
