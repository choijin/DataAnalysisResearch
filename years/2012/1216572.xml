<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V Atlantic Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel operated by Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The R/V Atlantic Explorer is a general-purpose research ship owned and operated by the&lt;br/&gt;Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS). BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the island of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research. The RV Atlantic Explorer has 157 days funded in 2012 and 150 days in 2011. All 157 days are NSF science days. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation Equipment: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) FERRUPS UPCS system $17,000&lt;br/&gt;2) Upgrades for the shipboard IP/Data network $16,400&lt;br/&gt;3) Bottom Finding Pinger $15,600&lt;br/&gt;                          TOTAL  $49,000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

The system is needed to protect sensitive NSF funded ships equipment.   2) Upgrades for the shipboard IP/Data network $16,400              The 3 new Dell R210 1U rack-mount servers, with the MS Server 2008 operating system, are modest yet powerful and scalable enough to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. The new servers will replace our primary network and email servers and allow us to expand our capability with a dedicated data server.

It is rated to 10,000 meters that is suited for use in full Atlantic Ocean depth.  A bottom finding pinger, used in conjunction with a standard 12 kHz shipboard bathymetric recorder can be used to monitor the height off bottom of instruments or sampling equipment being lowered through the water column. The instrument can be used effectively for positioning of CTD instrumentation, fishing nets, coring tools, water bottles or other items where accurate vertical positioning relative to the bottom is required. Future projects under consideration will directly benefit from a pinger for deep go-floÆs and CTD work close to the bottom in 4500m of water.
