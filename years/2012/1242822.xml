<AbstractNarration>The Tebenkof Bay Project was funded by the National Science Foundation as part of PI Herbert Maschner's dissertation research. The project resulted in Maschner's PhD dissertation (1992), contributed directly to Ames and Maschner's book "The Peoples of the Northwest Coast (1999)," and a special section published in (1991). Data from this research was used in 16 articles and chapters, and dozens of conference presentations.  As part of this project, over 75 boxes of midden remains, including nearly 100,000 fish bones, were collected. In recent years a number of new science research initiatives in ancient DNA, stable isotopes, elemental analysis, and fisheries studies have requested samples from this collection.  However, in order to be fully useful for these new techniques, the collection needs to have an updated catalog and archival storage system.  This project provides support for cataloging the collection, creating the metadata to facilitate access, and preparing the collection to be returned to Alaska and stored at the Museum of the North where the data can be easily accessed by scientists and interested Alaska Native community members.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Tebenkof Bay Archaeological Project was conducted between 1988 and 1991 as a dissertation research project. The goal of the research was to investigate the causes and consequences of the development of large villages and hierarchical political groups among the prehistoric peoples of southeast Alaska. Key to this investigation was the collection of large samples of midden remains &ndash; shells and bones of the animals harvested by these ancient peoples. These samples provided the key data to investigate long-term changes in how the prehistoric peoples of the region interacted with their environments and with each other. Thousands of fish, bird, and mammal bones, and hundreds of pounds of shellfish remains, were analyzed in the course of this research project. Between 1992 and 2012, the samples collected during this project were housed in laboratories directed by Herbert Maschner. As part of a legacy project to return to Alaska the samples collected during this research, funding was requested to organize, catalogue, and return to Alaska all archaeological remains from this project. The samples will be returned to Alaska in May, 2014 where they will be curated at the Museum of the North. It is important that archaeological samples be stored in the state where they originate so that the public, indigenous peoples, and relevant scholars have access to these legacy collections.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/21/2014<br>      Modified by: Herbert&nbsp;Maschner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
