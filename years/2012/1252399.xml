<AbstractNarration>Previous studies of problem solving in physics have primarily focused on students and experts solving textbook-like exercises containing a single concept that can be typically completed by simply searching for and manipulating in-chapter equations. These tasks often habituate students to formula-based algorithms and have limited impact on promoting expert-like heuristic problem solving. This project proposes to investigate and improve student skills in solving synthesis problems in introductory physics, that is: problems that require a joint application of multiple physics concepts including those that are taught in different chapters or at significantly different times in the course. Differing from the traditional textbook exercises and closer to real-world situations, these synthesis problems cannot be easily solved by using formula-based ?plug-and-chug? approaches but rather require students to recognize and be able to coordinate multiple key concepts in order to reach a successful solution. Built on the well-established framework of analogical reasoning, this project seeks to (1) identify and characterize students? and experts? approaches to synthesis problems in physics, (2) evaluate and compare various methods of analogical reasoning aimed at promoting student synthesis problem solving skills, and (3) field test the most successful method in physics classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project directly targets undergraduate students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) who are enrolled in college-level introductory physics courses. The synthesis materials and analogical interventions investigated in the project will reach thousands of STEM learners across the nation to most effectively increase their problem solving skills. The project outcomes, including research-validated curricular materials, will be disseminated via publications, national and international presentations, workshops and online resources. These results will not only help improve physics education at the tertiary level but will also have bearing on our knowledge of problem solving and STEM education in general.</AbstractNarration>

Our work generates a significant impact on the research into teaching physics problem solving. Thousands of university students taking introductory and intermediate level physics courses, including underrepresented STEM learners, first-generation college attendees, and international students, have used our synthesis materials and received different types of research-based interventions.
