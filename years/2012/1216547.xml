<AbstractNarration>Variational methods with non-quadratic penalty terms (such as those associated with total variation or sparsity constraints) are extremely effective solution methods for the resolution of sharp features of nonsmooth solutions to applied inverse problems.  Unfortunately, such globally-defined methods are often associated with large computational costs, a situation made even worse by the scale of the underlying problem (e.g., large imaging data sets).   Using their expertise in methods of generalized local regularization, the investigator and her colleagues develop localized non-quadratic regularization methods for ill-posed inverse problems as a way to reduce computational costs while still maintaining the sharp resolution of solutions.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of these new methods include problems of image deblurring, nonlinear autoconvolution, blind deconvolution, fractional integration/differentiation, and inverse and backward heat conduction. The methods developed by the investigator and her colleagues lead to faster, less computationally-intensive techniques for the accurate reconstruction of pictures in a wide number of applications, from satellite image gathering, biomedical imaging (CT scans, PET scans, etc.), to geophysical exploration.  The improved methods enable the analysis of more data in a shorter amount of time,  and with less overall expense.  In addition to imaging applications, these new methods are also applicable to the problem of determining hidden cracks and weaknesses in structures and materials, and the detection of ozone levels in the atmostphere, as well as to problems arising in the analysis of nano-structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The solution of an inverse problem is often an important part of the modeling process for real applications in science and engineering.  The inverse problems studied in this project arise in a number of practical situations including medical tomography (CT scan, X-ray, etc.), geophyscial exploration, and astronomical imaging.    The main difficulty one faces when solving an inverse problem is lack of continuous dependence on data, meaning that small errors in the measurements needed in models for applications can lead to drastic changes in the behavior of model solutions.  This is not behavior that appears in the real world, but is rather a consequence of the mathematical modeling process associated with the real application.   To handle this instability, regularization methods used to solve inverse problems are designed in such a way as to incorporate minimal information about the errors into the process of determining a physically-relevant solution.  In the process, however, important information about the solution can be lost.   In this project the PI has developed new regularization methods for the solution of inverse problems, methods which are based on looking at small local regions of the problem and synthesizing this local information back into a single global solution.  Due to the local nature of the methods, there is the potential to (1) greatly speed up the computational algorithms used to solve such problems as well as to (2) better resolve sharp features in solutions, an issue of importance in imaging applications.     The main outcomes of this project involve the development of techniques to address (2) above via the combination of local methods with known techniques for the resolution of sharp features in solutions; while improved resolution was observed using this approach, it was often at the expense of a slow-down in the resulting algorithm. The PI also developed three new classes of local methods in which a fast filtering technique for solutions was implemented; using these methods we were able to address the issue in (1) above.  The techniques and understanding developed over the course of this project will play an important role in the long-term research program of the PI and her colleagues and students.
