<AbstractNarration>Computing increasingly permeates daily lives, yet few appreciate the growing presence of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) in common computing activities; e.g., modern laptops' processors contain multiple cores and special-purpose devices such as graphics processors (GPUs).  With increasing availability of powerful PDC technology, familiarity with single-processor computers and sequential computing no longer constitutes computer literacy.  Technological developments point to the need for a broad-based skill set in PDC at all levels of higher education in disciplines such as Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and the related computational disciplines.  The rapid changes in technology challenge educators to decide what to teach and how to teach it.  Students and employers face similar challenges in characterizing "basic" expertise in computing.  The PIs are addressing these challenges via a project devoted to creating and sustaining curricular and educational infrastructure to facilitate the teaching of PDC topics in undergraduate computer-related curricula.  The goal is for every graduating student to become skilled in PDC technology, hence be prepared to enter tomorrow's workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project embodies multiple synergistic activities that develop:  flexible PDC curricula for a spectrum of academic programs and institutions; mechanisms that help individuals maintain currency; instructional materials for PDC-related topics; experience-based guidelines for injecting PDC into curricula.  A signature activity is competitions for early adopters of PDC curricula (winners receive seed funds, equipment donations from industry) and workshops and training sessions to foster awareness and adoption of PDC curricula.  Feedback from early adopters and coordination with the ACM/IEEE 2013 CS Curriculum Taskforce steers future development of both the PDC curricular guidelines and of strategies for deploying PDC material within computing curricula at a larger scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by CISE, OCI, and EHR/DUE.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has focused on four synergistic areas of activities.  1. The development of curricular guidelines on parallel and distributed computing (PDC) that are flexible enough for a broad range of programs and institutions. The overriding goal is to prepare undergraduates to deal with emerging computer technologies and the applications that they enable.  We have collaborated with all stakeholders (educators, students, researchers, authors, industry, governments, funding agencies, professional societies and task forces) to maintain the currency of our guidelines and to facilitate their adoption.  2.  (a) Organize and administer competitions for Early Adopters of our PDC curricular guidelines; winners receive stipends, equipment, etc.). We thereby evaluate our guidelines and develop avenues for their improvement --- in addition to fostering the inclusion of PDC in computer-related core undergraduate curricula.  (b) Organize dedicated workshops, special sessions, tutorials, and training sessions at professional conferences, both to foster awareness and adoption of our curricular guidelines and to nurture a vibrant international community of academics committed to teaching PDC-related topics.  (a) Our Early Adopter competitions have produced roughly 140 academics worldwide, who are creatively incorporating PDC-oriented materials into their courses.  (b) We have initiated three series of education-oriented workshops that are held annually in conjunction with three select research-oriented conferences. This has already created the foundation for the desired "vibrant international community", with a few hundred participating academics.  3. Develop, collect, and synthesize pedagogical and instructional materials for teaching PDC-related curricular topics, including slides, course modules, tutorials, lectures, books, and tools for testing and evaluation.  We have published: journal articles describing our curricular guidelines; special issues in high-quality journals dedicated to our education-oriented workshops; one edited book (with another in preparation) containing articles contributed by an international collection of academics, providing guidance to potential instructors and students in PDC-related courses.  4. Facilitate access to state-of-the-art hardware and software resources for PDC-related instruction and training by instructors and students worldwide in the following areas:  Hardware architectures multicores, many cores, shared and distributed memories, high-end machines (in collaboration with NSF-funded national infrastructures, industry, and labs); Program development environments, compilers, debuggers, and performance monitoring and enhancement tools; Sample programs and "industrial-strength" PDC software.   The computing resources we have developed thus far allow students and faculty at all institutions --- including those with under-represented populations and limited funding --- to participate in leading-edge developments in comuter technology.  We hope to extend the scope of these resources and maintain their currency.       Last Modified: 11/30/2016       Submitted by: Arnold L Rosenberg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
