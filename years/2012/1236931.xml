<AbstractNarration>Network theory has provided novel concepts and analytical tools for understanding how actors can leverage privileged access to others' expertise to make sound decisions.  But to date it has focused on the social ties that comprise social communities.  By identifying communities through network patterns of attention, instead of through patterns of direct soical network linkages, this project will identify cognitive communities, thereby reorienting network analysis from its traditional focus on social ties.  To do so, a dataset will be constructed on the stock market coverage of more than 19,000 analysts for more than 16,000 companies listed on the major US stock exchange markets, during the period 1983-2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intial hypotheses will be examined on how members of a relatively closed cognitive community performs in solving complex but local problems, how actors spanning structural holes perform solving less complex but more distant problems, and how actors occupying a structural fold of overlapping cohesive communities peform in solveing the most complex distant problems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will shed light on how attention allocation in markets affects cognition and how the social distribution of attention gives an edge to some actors.  Because the reports of analysts are a key ingredient in the trading decisions of market actors, this analysis will provide new lenses to understand how abnormal fluctuations in market prices originate, and ultimately lead to financial bubbles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our study of structures of attention extends the work in social network analysis about the micro processes of opinion formation by opening new research questions related to the neglected role of attention to events. Social network analysis has made important contributions to the study of opinion formation. Much of that research starts by asking the question Who is interacting with whom? Some network analysts, however, are shifting from an interactionist framework to highlight instead how social behavior can be informed by the indirect "social" relations that emerge through patterns of mutual attention (White 1981). In so doing, they are turning the question to Who is paying attention to whom?   To further develop the potential of an attention network approach, our analysis turned the question yet again to ask Who is paying attention to what? In today?s financial markets, but increasingly also in many other domains of social life, actors are virtually linked through their common (screen-mediated) attention to unfolding events (Knorr-Cetina and Bruegger 2002). To more fully understand how opinions and agreement are formed in social contexts, we thus proposed that network analysis should not only focus on personal ties but also examine the networks in which people have ties to (and through) objects, events, and situations.  Our major finding indicates that the temporality and intensity of attention affect valuation.  We asked: Who pays attention to what, when, and with how much intensity? And how do the resulting patterns affect how actors process new information and update beliefs? In financial markets, as in many other social domains, actors pay attention to a multitude of events. The resulting patterns give rise to a network of attention in which actors are linked to events. We study how location in such a network shapes valuation.  We propose an event network analysis that conceptualizes cognitive proximity between actors as a function of the different temporality of tie activation and the uneven intensity of tie strength across the events in the actors? portfolios of attention. The temporal sequence of attention activations, we argue, determines the contingent availability of attended issues. Because issues that have been recently attended will be more cognitively available than issues that were attended less recently, we expect that the cognitive distance between two actors will be lower the more recently they have paid attention to the same issues and the less recently they have paid attention to different ones.
