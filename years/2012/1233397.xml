<AbstractNarration>Determining the conditions for the outbreak, spread, and extinction of an infectious disease is an important public health problem. Global eradication of an infectious disease has rarely been achieved, but it continues to be a public health goal for many diseases. More commonly, one can observe local disease extinction, or fade out, followed by a reintroduction of the disease from other regions through a migratory effect. In general, extinction occurs in populations undergoing stochastic effects owing to random transitions. The origins of stochasticity may be internal to the system or may arise from the external environment. Small population size, low contact frequency for frequency-dependent transmission, competition for resources and evolutionary pressure, as well as heterogeneity in populations and transmission, may all be determining factors for extinction to occur. The possibility of an extinction event is affected by the nature and strength of the stochastic noise, as well as other factors, including outbreak amplitude and seasonal phase occurrence. For large populations, the intensity of internal population noise is generally small. However, a rare, large fluctuation can occur with non-zero probability and the system may be able to reach the extinct state. The research objective is to study the dynamics of disease spread and extinction using stochastic metapopulation models that consist of coupled regions or patches.  A master equation formalism will be used to understand the disease dynamics and to find the path that maximizes the probability of disease extinction. The  results will enable one to speed up disease extinction through the use of control methods including vaccination and quarantine programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is highly multidisciplinary, and involves dynamical systems, stochastic processes, statistical mechanics, and control theory. The mathematical tools that will be developed will provide new ways of analyzing and confirming numerical results. In addition, the analysis will lead to the prediction of novel information and system behavior, and will provide for improved understanding of infectious disease outbreak, spread, and extinction processes. In particular, this new understanding of disease dynamics will enable the development of optimal control methods to lessen disease outbreak and spread. The proposal includes carefully planned projects that will involve and support undergraduate and graduate students in leading-edge research. Significantly, the student population at Montclair State University, and in particular, the Department of Mathematical Sciences, includes a substantial proportion who are members of groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines (including women and minorities) and the research program will leverage existing programs directed to these students. The outcome of the research will be disseminated through seminars, presentations at meetings, and publications in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project involved the theoretical and computational study of the dynamics of disease outbreak, spread, and extinction using stochastic (random) models where the stochasticity is due to the random interactions of individuals in a population. The research has established new techniques for the analysis of rare events in epidemiology, and has provided a framework for testing control (vaccine/quarantine) methods.  Important outcomes from the project include:  Intervention Control: We have shown how intervention control in a stochastic disease model modulates the average extinction times as a function of population size and rate of infection spread. In particular, our results show an exponential improvement in extinction times. We have also discovered the regimes where random treatment yields an exponential improvement in extinction times over the application of strictly periodic intervention. A major implication of the work is that in order to eliminate infectious diseases with limited availability of resources, it is better to increase the pool of individuals reached by the treatment, rather than increase its frequency.

We also considered the problem of the extinction rate in the presence of delay, which required a significant extension of both the analytical theory and the Monte Carlo simulation technique, as it is necessary to consider large rare fluctuations induced by a singular multiplicative noise. Additionally, we addressed the onset of scaling behavior of the switching and extinction rate.    Optimal Path Computation: In stochastic systems, one is often interested in finding the optimal path that maximizes the probability of escape from a metastable state or of switching between metastable states. Even for simple systems, it may be impossible to find an analytic form of the optimal path, and in high-dimensional systems, this is almost always the case. We have formulated a constructive methodology that is used to compute the optimal path numerically. The method utilizes finite-time Lyapunov exponents, statistical selection criteria, and a Newton-based iterative minimizing scheme.   Ebola Virus Disease (EVD):  We considered a stochastic EVD model, and studied the  disease outbreak and extinction dynamics in the context of random infection events that are attributed to human interaction with the animal reservoir. We computed the optimal path to disease extinction and studied the mechanism of disease outbreak. One may use perturbations to our model to determine relative sensitivity to changes in human behavior and to disease control strategies. With these tools one could predict the relative effectiveness of disease control measures. Given appropriate cost functions for the implementation of the different control measures, one could minimize the mean time to extinction given a finite set of resources, thus developing an optimal strategy.    Inference of Unobserved Epidemic Infections:  We have developed a new method to infer unobserved epidemic sub-populations by exploiting the synchronization properties of multi-strain epidemic models.  A model for dengue fever is driven by simulated data from secondary infective populations.  Primary infective populations in the driven system synchronize to the correct values from the driver system.  Most hospital cases of dengue are secondary infections, so this method provides a way to deduce unobserved primary infection levels.  We have derived center manifold equations that relate the driven system to the driver system and thus motivates the use of synchronization to predict unobserved primary infectives. Synchronization stability between primary and secondary infections is demonstrated through numerical measurements of conditional Lyapunov exponents and through time series simulations.  Stochastic Cycling: We considered the basic switching phenomena for a population of coupled epidemic models with immigration. Simulations revealed the possibility of extinction and recovery of a disease from one sub-population before global extinction, a behavior we call cycling. To gain an intuition about the interaction of multiple switching events in a network of several deterministically stable steady states, we designed a one-dimensional example based on population ecology.  We derived a novel analytical result for the mean time to extinction by considering the probability of stochastic switching events and their associated transition times.   The results obtained from these studies form the basis for improved understanding of the outbreak, spread, and extinction processes in epidemiology as well as related rare events in other applications including ecology, virology, optical devices, fluid mechanics, and geosciences.  Outcomes from the research project were presented at conferences and seminars, and were published in refereed scientific journals including SIAM Review, Journal of the Royal Society Interface, Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, Chaos Journal, Biomass &amp; Bioenergy, Ricerche di Matematica, Physical Review E, and PLoS One.  The project supported six undergraduate students, two masters students, and a doctoral student. The students were taught a variety of skills, including theoretical and computational methods, reading and understanding the existing scientific literature, writing, and presenting their work. These skills will be beneficial to them in their future careers.       Last Modified: 12/12/2017       Submitted by: Eric Forgoston]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
