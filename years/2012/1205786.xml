<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1205786, Principal Investigator: Ismar Volic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insert abstract here for an award recommendation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is a better understanding of the topology of knot and link spaces as well as more general embedding spaces.  The principal investigator proposes to use techniques such as calculus of functors, cosimplicial spaces, operads, and configuration space integrals to prove results about homology and homotopy of knots, links, homotopy links, and braids in Euclidean spaces of various dimensions.  In particular, these proposed projects include a program to describe the rational homotopy type of these spaces; to combine configuration space integrals with the theory of Milnor invariants; and to better understand, if not complete resolve, of the issue of the separation of knots and links by finite type invariants. Moreover, the principal investigator plans to unify the various ways in which operads appear in the applications of calculus of functors in knot theory and further the understanding and uses of configuration space integrals.  Some of his long-term projects will attempt to connect calculus of functors point of view in embedding theory to Khovanov homology as well as to the study of embeddings of surfaces and the mapping class group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knot and link spaces represent some of the most interesting objects of study in topology because they are easy to define and visualize and because they are of interest to physicists and chemists. Some fundamental questions about knots, such as their classification, or construction of efficient ways of telling them apart, still generate a wealth of exciting research.  The principal investigator's proposed work intends to bring us closer to answering these questions.  Furthermore, the techniques he plans to use are quite general and point to new connections between topology, geometry, combinatorics, and physics.  These connections will potentially help answer several important conjectures about the structure of knot and link spaces and introduce new points of view in algebraic topology in general.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the goals of topology and geometry is to devise ways of telling topological objects apart in an efficient way.   Even if two objects appear different, such as a circle and a square, they may be the same from the topological point of view since one can be deformed into the other (as the circle can be deformed into the square).   A topologist's job is to develop fast and definitive ways of telling topological spaces apart.  Such ways are called invariants.  An invariant assigns a mathematical object, possibly as simple as a number, but often much more complicated and even very abstract, to each topological object.  The defining property of an invariant is that if its value comes out to be different for two spaces, then we know that they are different.   Some of the most interesting topological objects are knots and links  &mdash; DNA and molecules can  be knotted, fluid flow can exhibit knotting behavior, certain phenomena in string theory can be modeled by knots, etc.  Because of the many appearances of knots in various fields, the need for defining and studying knot invariants is more pressing than almost anywhere else in geometry and topology.   In this research project, the PI defined some new knot and link invariants and contributed to our understanding of some existing ones.  More specifically, the PI studied finite type and Milnor invariants of knots and links.  He applied a new tool, called calculus of functors, to his investigation, and this approach yielded new insights into the inner structure of these invariants as well as into the topological behavior of the collection of all knots.  He also extended finite type invariants to the setting of certain special kinds of links, called homotopy string links, as well as vector fields.  His work has consequences in topology, geometry, and physics, and has resulted in the publication of several articles as well as a book aimed at graduate students and researchers on the topic of calculus of functors.  The PIÃ†s work bridges gaps between various fields of mathematics as well as physics.  Such interdisciplinary research is exciting and often opens new and unexpected avenues of investigation.  Indeed, this was the case for the results the PI established, and he looks forward to continuing to pursue his research in the various new directions that have opened up as a result of his work.
