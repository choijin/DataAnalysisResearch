<AbstractNarration>Malware, especially botnets, have become the main source of most attacks and malicious activities on Internet. Bots communicate with each other and Command &amp; Control servers to coordinate their malicious activities. This project is developing new techniques and tools to detect malicious activities and botnets through analyzing their communication channels. This project plans to investigate mechanisms for detecting these communication channels through several novel mechanisms: (i) through a graph analysis of social contacts, (ii) analyzing graph properties of communication to decipher Peer to peer communication properties of bots and (iii) machine learning based approaches to analyzing network traffic. The automation required to propagate malicious contents and malware will result in different behavior than human behavior in these communication channels. We expect the generated names, content, the time of contacts and communication, the social graph structures to be sufficiently different to enable us to develop techniques for detection of malicious entities. Our work focuses on developing robust techniques that are hard to evade or limit the botnet functions when they try to evade the detection mechanisms. Developed analysis tools will help in detecting botnets in networks and malicious entities in social networks. Educational impact will include training graduate and undergraduate students with valuable research skills while advancing the state of the art in network security and traffic analysis, contributing to the technology workforce. We will publish our results and enable technology transfer to industry.</AbstractNarration>

Based on the social honeypot measurement analysis, we evaluated our  new guidelines for building effective social honeypots by implementing  "advanced" honeypots. Particularly, within the same time period,using  those advanced honeypots can trap spammers around 26 times faster than  using"traditional" honeypots. According to our evaluation, our new  sampling/inference strategies could ef?ciently sample/infer over 17,000  spam accounts, with a considerably high "Hit Ratio" (about 0.6 correct  spam account per sampled/inferred account).   Our measurement shows that for different spammers, their spamming  infrastructures are typically different, although sometimes with some  overlap. We design NEIGHBORWATCHER, a comment spam inference system that  exploits spammers? spamming infrastructure information to infer comment  spam. At its core, NEIGHBORWATCHER runs a graph-based algorithm to  characterize the spamming neighbor relationship, and reports a spam link  when the same link also appears in the harbor?s clique neighbors.
