<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1219610&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Minnesota Duluth&lt;br/&gt;PI:   R. Ricketts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) item for the R/V BLUE HERON; namely up-grades to the vessel?s winch wire monitoring system.  This item will enhance safety on deck and provide greatly improved science support capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The University of Minnesota supports federally-funded scientific research on the Great Lakes and routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to the marine sciences.  The R/V BLUE HERON is scheduled to complete over 30 NSF sponsored days in 2012.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Minnesota Duluth purchased additional equipment for its winch wire monitoring system on the research vessel Blue Heron using funds provided by the National Science Foundation in grant OCE-1219610 æSupport Equipment, RV Blue Heron 2012Æ.  The additional equipment is required to ensure that the various winches on board the vessel deploy scientific equipment in a safe manner.  The additional equipment included upgrades to our current running line tensiometers, an additional running line tensiometer, and three displays so crew members and members of the scientific party can determine wire tension during deployment of a piece of scientific gear.     Equipment purchased for the RV Blue Heron is used by researchers and educators that use the vessel.  Therefore, the equipment is available to all users of the vessel, from scientists funded by the National Science Foundation to University of Minnesota classes that take students out on the vessel to learn about oceanographic research.  The equipment purchased using funds from this grant has not been installed on the vessel yet, but will be installed during the R/V Blue HeronÆs 2015-16 winter lay-up period.  The equipment will be available for future NSF-funded projects on board the vessel as well as state funded cruises such as E. BrownÆs Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources funded project æEvaluating Lake Superior's Health in a Changing WorldÆ, and R. Ricketts and T. HrabikÆs Minnesota Department of Natural Resources funded project æLake Superior Hydroacoustics ProjectÆ as well as multiple University of Minnesota funded educational cruises.
