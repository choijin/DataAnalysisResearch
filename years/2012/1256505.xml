<AbstractNarration>This catalyst self-assessment project will document the current use of evidence-based instructional practices in undergraduate STEM courses at Western Michigan University (WMU). WMU is a Carnegie classification Research Extensive University with a student population of 25,000. This project will involve all STEM instructors in the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at WMU (N=634). This includes full-time faculty (N=268 tenured or tenure track and N=18 not tenure track), part-time instructors (N=65), and graduate student teaching assistants (N=283). During Phase 1, instructors will be surveyed regarding: i) their most commonly used teaching and learning approaches, ii) their perceptions of the teaching environment (i.e., climate) within their departments and the university, and iii) the networks of colleagues with whom they discuss issues related to teaching and learning. Self-reported use of teaching approaches will be supplemented by observations of a subset of faculty by trained raters (using the RTOP instrument). A research collaboration social network will also be constructed for these instructors. During Phase 2, a subset of departments (N=3) will engage in collaborative self- and case-studies with the research team to address those barriers and challenges to instructional change most noted in the literature. Data collection will include observations of teaching as well as interviews with instructors and students. Particular emphasis will be placed on the foundational courses offered by the department that have high attrition rates and are required for further study in the discipline or are prerequisites for other programs of study. These data will set a foundation for WMU to plan and implement institution-wide, but contextually targeted, change strategies to support instructor use of evidence-based instruction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit This project combines several previously separate methods related to teaching practices in higher education: self-report of practices, survey of teaching climate, social network related to teaching, and teaching observations. As recommended by the research literature, the project team is multi-level and multi-disciplinary, representing three communities of scholars concerned with STEM change: two active disciplinary-based science education researchers, the WMU director of faculty development, the WMU Provost and the WMU Dean of the Graduate College. All members of the project team have significant prior experience with STEM education reforms. The proposed study includes not only full-time faculty, but also part-time instructors and graduate students. These last two groups are often not involved in projects like this, but they provide significant and important instructional roles at WMU (and many other institutions), particularly in foundational courses. These groups must be included for institutional change efforts to be truly comprehensive. Finally, this project will measure the influences on instructors, including both the organizational influence and personal influences through networks of relationships. These influences have not been examined to the extent necessary to support the development of evidence-based change strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts This project is designed to build the foundation for increased use of evidence-based instruction at WMU. This will improve instructional quality in STEM subjects and reduce student attrition from STEM fields, and is also expected to improve student engagement, thus improving degree completion rates overall. The project therefore will impact students beyond STEM majors, and departments and programs throughout the institution. In addition to serving the needs of WMU, this project will provide a model for other institutions beginning similar processes. The types of data collection methods proposed are not difficult to use, but have been used not at all (social network analysis) or very little (teaching climate) in higher education institutions. The leaders at all higher education institutions want to improve STEM instruction. Increased institutional use of the data collection tools used in this study will help other institutions to better understand the foundation from which they have to work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The outcomes and findings of this project will support change agents seeking to increase the use of evidence-based instructional practices in undergraduate STEM courses. Evidence-based instructional practices have been shown to increase student learning outcomes and decrease failure rates. While positively affecting all students, these practices have also been shown to have a disproportionately positive effect on traditionally underrepresented students in STEM. The project resulted in the development of two new survey instruments and two research findings. Both the instruments and the research findings will allow researchers and change agents to be more effective in their work of improving undergraduate STEM education.   Two new survey instruments: Instrument 1. The Postsecondary Instructional Practices Survey (PIPS) The Postsecondary Instructional Practices Survey (PIPS) is designed to measure the instructional practices of postsecondary instructors from any discipline. This allows researchers and change agents to understand current conditions as well as to track changes due to an intervention. The PIPS has 24 instructional practice statements and 9 demographic questions. Users calculate PIPS scores by an intuitive proportion-based scoring convention. Factor analyses from 72 departments at 4 institutions (N=827) support a 2- or 5-factor solution for the PIPS; both models include all 24 instructional practice items and have good model fit statistics. Instrument 2. The Survey of Climate for Instructional Improvement (SCII) The Survey of Climate for Instructional Improvement (SCII) is designed to measure five aspects of organizational climate in postsecondary settings. This is important because climate is known to influence employee behavior in a wide variety of settings. Thus, climate for instructional improvement can be expected to influence the use of evidence-based instructional practices. The SCII has 30 Likert-scale items and 1 open response question. Survey responses from 713 instructors at four institutions indicate that the instrument is reliable and has the potential to differentiate among institutions, departments, and certain demographic variables with different perceptions of organizational climate features, including leadership, collegiality, resources, respect for teaching, and organizational support. Two Research Findings Finding 1. There is a relationship between self-reported and observed instructional practices Observations are often thought to be the gold standard for the  measurement of instructional practices. However, we have shown that the more cost- and time-efficient method of self-report is meaningful if done appropriately.  We compared results from our PIPS instrument (self-report of instructional practices) and the Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol (TDOP) instrument (direct observation of instructional practices) for 37 observations of 13 instructors.

We published a journal article that provides a detailed description and evaluation of the instruments, identifies gaps in the literature, and provides suggestions for proper instrument selection, use, and development based on these findings.
