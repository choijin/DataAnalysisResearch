<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to devise high-speed single-photon sources that are single mode, wavelength versatile, compact, scalable, and room-temperature operable for use in modern quantum-optics applications. A fundamentally new approach for losslessly managing the spatio-temporal states of single photons will be developed using the concept of quantum erasers and its applications in various optical systems, including fibers and crystalline waveguides, will be studied in detail. The approach will be implemented in a fiber-based system to demonstrate a high purity, telecommunications band, single-photon source whose production rate is potentially orders of magnitude higher than the state-of-the-art single-photon sources of comparable purity.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to use quantum erasers made from quantum-frequency-conversion devices to accomplish three crucial tasks for heralding pure single photons in a single step: (a) eliminating inherent quantum correlation between the photon pairs, (b) losslessly tailoring the heralded single photons into the optimal spatio-temporal modes for use in various applications, and (c) boosting the single-photon production efficiency by the naturally-matched use of higher-efficiency frequency-up-conversion detection. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are: 1) it will develop an enabling technology for transitioning to practice many single-photon-based applications that otherwise will remain in a research laboratory, particularly those that harness the existing low-loss fiber telecommunications infrastructure; 2) it will be a cross-disciplinary research activity for the students and postdocs, whose training will span a bridge between the fundamental science of quantum optics and the classical arena of optical engineering, thereby providing them a competitive advantage in the global photonics marketplace.</AbstractNarration>
