<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)  led by Professors Jeffrey D. Evanseck and Jeffry D. A. Madura, both at Duquesne University. The principal investigators will renew their novel REU Site to continue its impact on the careers and education of undergraduates from underrepresented populations and from institutions with limited research infrastructure. Duquesne's model of undergraduate research builds research teams, where seven student-faculty pairs recruited from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (LSAMP), and Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUI) are integrated with nationally recognized and extramurally funded research groups from Duquesne University. The objective is to deliver a quality undergraduate research experience that motivates students and faculty to achieve their highest academic performance and prepare them for scientific research and discovery. The core idea is to establish meaningful, year-around, and long-term research collaborations driven by the need for academic productivity and excellence in undergraduate training. The model is envisioned to perpetuate itself, where invested collaborations ultimately mature to independent funding, and are replaced by new partnerships between the host institution and other participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis is that strong financial and infrastructure support of research collaborations will invigorate HBCU, LSAMP, and PUI faculty, who will in turn directly impact students and learning environments at their home institutions. Duquesne faculty will train students, and gain immeasurably from the research expansion. REU students will have meaningful and novel chemical research experiences with broad scientific themes, such as nanotechnology, homeland security, pharmaceutical drug design, forensic sciences and chemical biology. Each student will work directly with two faculty mentors in the laboratory (home institution and Duquesne), and consult with a theoretical faculty liaison from Duquesne, since each REU project is supplemented by well-defined computational components to expand the students' experience. Duquesne has extraordinary resources, NSF-funded facilities, established research programs in molecular modeling, and a proven record in student placement and strong partnerships. The students will be trained to use state-of-the-art instrumentation to complement their experimental research and build invaluable skill sets. The activities planned support the intent of the REU Program by using meaningful research experiences to attract and retain the nation's diverse student talent pool, which will have the consequence of enhancing and diversifying the U.S. workforce by adding experts in the fields of chemistry or biochemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We have been successful in accomplishing our goals in the &ldquo;Integrated Computational and Experimental REU Site&rdquo; grant (CHE-1263279) at Duquesne University. Specifically, we have created <strong>(1) research opportunities with regional impact</strong> in exciting and broad scientific themes, such as nanotechnology, homeland security, advanced instrumentation, forensic sciences, pharmaceutical drug design and chemical biology to make significant advances in chemical research and discovery. Provided research opportunities for underrepresented students, female scientists, and those who might not otherwise have the opportunity of a research experience, particularly those from institutions where research programs are limited in the Pittsburgh region. Next, we have <strong>(2) enhanced scholarly production </strong>for those in the Pittsburgh region. We promote and emphasize the need for presentation and publication for both faculty and students. Publication builds student resumes, advances faculty careers, increases the chance of students joining the U.S. workforce, and is one avenue that justifies the NSF/REU program. Third, we <strong>(3) provided training on advanced instrumentation</strong>. Hands-on experience and training of students is delivered by academic and industrial experts on the fundamentals of molecular modeling, and the use of state-of-the-art computational facilities and modern software to advance experimental research. Specialized workshops were offered in conjunction in literature searching, theory and computation, nuclear magnetic spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, surface chemistry, and light spectroscopy. Next, we <strong>(4) enriched student communication skills</strong>. A unique effort that trains students how to <em>speak </em>and <em>write </em>"like a chemist" has been integrated into the entire ten-week summer research experience based upon an implementation of the scientific method. Students gave oral and written presentations every other week coinciding with the principal steps of the scientific method. Fifth, we <strong>(5) deepen student&rsquo;s awareness of ethical behavior</strong>. An ethics component was offered to the students to address an ethical issue. The experience concluded with the presentation of a critical assessment of the ethical issue chosen by the group, along with an invited expert keynote speaker at the annual regional ethics symposium. All students had the opportunity of presenting their research on an ethical topic at the final Pittsburgh Regional Ethics Symposium at Duquesne University with more than 100 student abstracts, 16 team oral presentations and a keynote speaker. Finally, we <strong>(6) offered career development and networking opportunities</strong>. Provide professional development through exposure to world-renowned industrial experts from Gaussian (Doug Fox), SGI, CCG, BioSolveIt, and academic faculty, weekly seminar program, and travel to national ACS meetings.
