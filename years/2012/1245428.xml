<AbstractNarration>This project provides a significant upgrade to the campus Local and Wide Area Networks at Colorado State University to support large data flows for research. Specifically, a research infrastructure component is added to the campus network, encompassing 40 gigabit per second connections to research projects on campus with large data transport needs. Dynamic routing is implemented over the Internet2 network to allow network capacity to be reserved for specific large data flows. Additional network capacity is provided to the Front Range GigaPoP where Internet2, National Lambda Rail, and commodity internet access are provided, to accommodate the dynamic traffic as well as all other research traffic requiring large data transport. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific projects with large data transport needs that benefit from the project are: 1) innovative engineering and scientific design of Extreme Ultraviolet Lasers at nanoscale (huge data sets, frequently produced and shared with external collaborators), 2) world-class ultra-high resolution, multi-physics climate modeling (huge data sets, transported regularly to and from HPC centers), 3) innovative data collection and dissemination of Internet traffic exhibiting malware patterns (huge, shared data sets, shared internationally), 4) two complementary next-generation climate modeling projects involving comprehensive, regional ecosystem analysis (huge, multi-faceted data sets, shared regionally and worldwide), and 5) state-of-the-art genomic analysis for pre-clinical drug design (huge and numerous data sets). However, the entire community of users benefits from added network capacity for dynamic and other research traffic that frees up capacity on the generic network.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding from this NSF grant for upgrading our networking infrastructure allowed CSU to:  Expand its Local Area Network (LAN) backbone from a 1 Gig to 10 Gigs. This upgrade was not able to be funded with institutional resources, and was much needed to accommodate the growth in traffic that we had experienced over time. Expand its Wide Area Network (WAN) with an approximate doubling in capacity, including a direct 10 Gig wave to the University of Colorado at Boulder, which will be housing the joint High-Performance Computing system for the Rocky Mountain Association for Computing Consortium.  Establish a research LAN dedicated to ultrahigh-speed applications. This new approach to networking allowed us to recover needed capacity to our users in buildings by moving high-bandwidth devices out of those buildings (where they cuased extreme network congestion) onto the Research LAN, where the ultrahigh capacity needs for these devices can be accommodated. This change was transformational in supporting our research environment. Together with our Regional Optical Network provider, the FRGP, experiment with Software Defined Networking, in the national venue. Although this did not pan out as well as we would have liked, it yielded information valuable to the national networking community. Deploy Globus, allowing our researchers granluar control of access to their data sets, and facilitating huge file transfers between and among other Globus sites. This technology is now being expanded to extend to our Dspace digital repository that contains published data sets from research projects, and from submitted theses and dissertations. Implement perfSONAR network measurement devices at strategic locations on our network, to identify network bottlenecks to attend to. Enhance professionsld evelopment for our network engineers who attended various training sessions, each of which significantly elevated their expertise to facilitate deployment and operations of our new networking architecture. Provide needed, dedicated capacity to seven signature researchers to anable and suport their research in the areas of: extreme ultraviolet lasers, atmospheric science modelling, documenting the effects of climate change in Mongolia, novel techniques for detecting malware on the internet, modeling climate change in diverse ecosystems, advanced modeling techniques in preclinical drug development, and high-performance computing.   Currently, CSU's advanced networking infrastructure supports its educational and research mission with ample capacity and headroom, where previously it had not.  We are very grateful for this award that positions our networking infrastructure well into the future.       Last Modified: 02/05/2016       Submitted by: Patrick J Burns]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
