<AbstractNarration>Emotions are pervasive to human life and interactions. They are particularly important to economics as they influence choices at several levels, impact well-being, and shape communication in many markets. While economists have started to realize the importance of emotions, it is not clear yet why and how much individuals value expressing them and what kind of expression they favor. Neither do we know the costs or benefits associated with allowing people to express their emotions. In this proposal the PI will conduct a sequence of laboratory experiments that modify bargaining environments in which a disadvantaged party potentially has the option to express their emotions, either verbally or through an action that has monetary consequences to the party responsible for the disadvantage.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Negotiations are commonplace in politics, business and interpersonal relations.  Findings from this research may provide us with additional insights into the negotiation process to the extent that the setting involves opportunities for expression beyond those involving purely informational exchange.</AbstractNarration>

Our experimental treatments vary whether the verbal message can be directly sent to the other member in the pair (the one that took the money) or to some independent (and anonymous) third party.&nbsp; We find that while people are willing to pay to send verbal messages even to unaffected and independent third parties, this willingness to pay is lower than for messages that are aimed and read by the other partner in the pair, i.e. the one that took the money. Through these differential treatment effects we can establish that extrinsic as well as intrinsic motivations form the basis of the valuation for expression. Furthermore, participants who were able to express report a smaller decrease in their subjective well-being.<!--?xml:namespace prefix = "o" ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /--></span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Our findings are useful for the design of institutions.
