<AbstractNarration>This action funds Clint Duncan Frye of Kansas State University to conduct a research project, entitled "Developing materials to convert directly heat into electricity," during the summer of 2012 at the National Institute for Materials Science in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.  The host scientist is Takao Mori.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the investigation of the thermoelectric properties of various boron compounds. Materials prepared at Kansas State University will be characterized at the National Institute of Materials Science to assess their potential to convert heat into electricity and produce cutting-edge knowledge about the synthesis of new compounds and crystals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this grant was to help facilitate academic collaboration between U.S.  and Japanese researchers while fostering personal and professional relationships by sending American students to study and research at Japanese institutions.  Description of Research:       Thermoelectric devices are devices that use a temperature gradient to produce a voltage; that is, they can essentially convert heat directly into conventional electricity that can be used in familiar, everyday appliances. In fact, due to thermodynamic inefficiencies in most power producing systems, excess heat is generated and must be dissipated. This heat, which is usually just released to the surroundings, is wasted energy that could be harnessed to generate useable electricity and increase the overall efficiency of systems such as electrical power plants or even car engines.       While many materials produce a voltage when one side is hotter than another, here boron compounds have been studied because of their peculiar properties. First, borides generally have extremely high melting points (many above 2000 &deg;C!) and have been demonstrated to have good thermoelectric performance at temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius. Second, some borides exhibit near immunity to radiation damage that would destroy the crystalline structure of most semiconductors, making these compounds well suited to high radiation environments such as space. Third, many of these compounds are also resistant to chemical attack.       Icosahedral boron arsenide, B12As2, is a prime example of a boride with a high melting point, extreme radiation resistance, and chemical stability. Single crystals of B12As2 were synthesized at the home institution for thermoelectric characterization at the host institution, the National Institute for Materials Science. Since thermoelectric characterization has not been performed on bulk crystals of this material, these measurements are essential to evaluating the potential performance of the material as a thermoelectric which may be used in harsh environments.  Description of Research Results:   The Seebeck coefficient, a measure of the voltage generated due to a given temperature gradient, was measured from 100 &deg;C to 400 &deg;C. For thermoelectric materials, higher values of the Seebeck coefficient are desired since a larger voltage is created by a smaller temperature gradient. For two representative B12As2 crystals, the maximum Seebeck coefficients were achieved at 400 &deg;C with high values of 477 and 660 microvolts per Celsius degree of temperature difference (&mu;V/K), higher than most semiconductors and showing promise for use in devices. A manuscript is being prepared to publish these results in a letter to the Journal of the Physical Society of Japan.  Cultural Experience:    Despite the short time, my experiences in Japan have opened my eyes both scientifically and culturally. Often your own culture is invisible until you are immersed into another. Awareness of something so fundamental to the way that you live is not only enriching but also an asset in communication. My relationships with international students at my home institution will be strengthened through my experience in Japan.       The land and environment of Japan is beautiful unto itself, but it is the warm and generous people that make Japan so special. Wherever I visited, friends and strangers both were patient, giving, and always lent a helping hand, even when I was too shy to ask. Spending a weekend with a host family was inspiring as I was able to live as the Japanese do in a Japanese home. Even though the stay was only for a couple of days, I felt at home and as a part of the family. I was touched so deeply that I will serve as a host family in the future with hopes to make others feel as welcome in my country as I did in Japan.
