<AbstractNarration>This project presents a software system to have the smartphone itself deal with the abnormal battery drain (ABD) issues that are caused by 'battery bugs' in smartphone applications or system software as well as by battery-related configuration errors and environmental changes. The proposed system architecture contains four subsystems, namely information collection, data analysis, diagnosis, and resolution, to self-detect, self-diagnose, and self-recover with little user intervention if possible when ABD events happen. Various technical methods, including machine learning and statistical approaches, will be investigated to achieve the design goal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The past few years have witnessed an evolutionary change in the smartphone ecosystem. Smartphones have gone from closed platforms containing only pre-installed applications to open platforms hosting a variety of third- party applications. Unfortunately, this change has also led to a rapid increase in Abnormal Battery Drain (ABD) problems that can be caused by software defects or miscon- figuration. Such issues can drain a fully-charged battery within a couple of hours, and can potentially affect a significant number of users.   This project has produced several techniques and tools to address this important challenge.   We have released a tool on Android platform called eDoctor, a practical tool that helps regular users troubleshoot abnormal battery drain issues on smartphones. eDoctor leverages the concept of execution phases to capture an app?s time-varying behavior, which can then be used to identify an abnormal app. Based on the result of a diagnosis, eDoctor suggests the most ap- propriate repair solution to users. To evaluate eDoctor?s effectiveness, we conducted both in-lab experiments and a controlled user study with 31 participants and 17 real- world ABD issues together with 4 injected issues in 19 apps. The experimental results show that eDoctor can suc- cessfully diagnose 47 out of the 50 use cases while impos- ing no more than 1.5% of power overhead.
