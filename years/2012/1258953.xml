The NSF CBET Grantee Conference provides the opportunity for building more effective and collaborative relationships amongst the community of CBET grantees and Program Directors. The conference is designed to enable awardees to share their technical achievements with NSF Program Directors and also to learn about current (and/or new) NSF/CBET programs, practices, and supplemental funding mechanisms.

The Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division is a major element of the Engineering (ENG) Directorate and critical to the Engineering DirectorateÆs mission at the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Project Outcomes:  At the 2012 CBET Grantees Conference I presented a poster of the work to date on my project as part of the General Poster Session.  During the poster session I was able to network with numerous other researchers in the catalysis area.  I was also offered the opportunity to have an open discussion about my research directly with my program chair.  I participated in the Town Hall Session for the Catalysis and Biocatalysis Session.  As part of this session, the participants worked with NSF personnel to discuss/develop a new open submission window.  Finally, I participated in the General Sessions  to gain more infomartion about other programs in CBET, hear the program directors discuss future directions in the programs, and learn about other funding opportunities within NSF.  As part of this conference, I met and networked with other researchers performing similar research that were not funded by my program.  I also met numerous other researchers that had graduated from my almas mater.  Finally, this conference resulted in subsequent discussion with another university about an open faculty position for an endowed chair.
