<AbstractNarration>The project entitled - Self-Assessment Study of the Use of Evidence-based Instructional Practices in Engineering - will conduct a self-study to determine what fraction of courses and instructors use evidence-based instructional practices, how frequently such practices are used and how the practices are distributed across the undergraduate engineering courses at Pennsylvania State University. The research consists of two phases: 1) a focus on the use of evidence-based practices in courses taught by the faculty in the student's home department, and 2) a focus on large enrollment courses such as Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics. The research design incorporates a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will lay the foundation for future efforts to implement evidence-based practices more widely within undergraduate engineering programs. The project proposes to begin a cooperation between the College of Engineering and the College of Science to impact large enrollment courses offered in both Colleges. The project will engage administrative leaders to understand their awareness of evidence-based practices, how they are supporting the use of such practices, and what they see as barriers to wider use of such practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For decades, educational scholars have studied how to improve learning of students from kindergarten to college.  These scholars have identified numerous teaching and learning methods that improve learning and have developed evidence that the methods are effective.  Such methods are sometimes referred to as "evidence-based instructional practices."  Unfortunately, the use of these evidence-based practices is not as widespread as is desired.  In fact, many government and industrial organizations have pointed to the need for increased use of evidence-based practices to ensure that U.S. students are well educated.  Education of students in engineering has received strong emphasis because of the importance that engineering plays in economic development.  This project focused on understanding what evidence-based instructional practices are being used in the College of Engineering at Penn State and what barriers exist for wider use of such practices.  The results of the study serve as the foundation for new initiatives at Penn State to increase the use of evidence-based practices.  The project gathered data from four different sources: documents that instructors create to inform students about the course goals, content, and assessments; surveys of students; surveys of instructors; and interviews with instructors and administrators.   Data from these four sources show that some evidence-based practices are commonly used in engineering education at Penn State.  In particular, students are frequently asked to work in teams and to do real-world design projects.   Unfortunately, the study also showed that most faculty members use such evidence-based practices without fully understanding how to implement the practices to ensure that they achieve optimum effectiveness.  The study also revealed a number of barriers to the wider use of evidence-based practices including lack of resources and lack of incentives.  The project team is working to raise the level of awareness of evidence-based instructional practices among engineering instructors and administrators at Penn State in order to increase the use of such practices.  The team is also discussing its findings with other engineering educators so that the results of the study can help those educators improve teaching and learning in their engineering programs.  Increasing the use of evidence-based instructional practices in undergraduate engineering programs will lead to enhanced knowledge and skills of the graduates, which will have a positive impact on their ability to succeed in their careers to the benefit of society.
