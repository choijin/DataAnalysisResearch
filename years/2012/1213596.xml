<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor George A. O'Doherty of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Northeastern University will explore the development of methods for the de novo synthesis of natural and unnatural oligosaccharide structural motifs.  While there exist many chemical and biochemical methods for the construction and isolation of the most common oligosaccharide motifs, there is a dearth of methods for oligosaccharide made up of unnatural sugars.  The O'Doherty group plans to develop innovative methods to address this need.  The planned approach revolves around the use of asymmetric and diastereoselective catalytic reactions for the highly stereoselective construction of oligosaccharide motifs.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This work could lead to the discovery of new methods for the efficient synthesis of oligosaccharides that are difficult to obtain.  It is expected that these new methods will allow for a more environmentally benign access to these important structural motifs.  In addition, the development of these approaches will enable further biological study of an important class of biomolecules, which in turn could lead to new therapies for the treatment of a myriad of carbohydrate related diseases.  In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students from a wide range of backgrounds (e.g., high school, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, including students from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary of Outcomes: During the funding period since the end of the previous NSF support (July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015), 14 publications were published that acknowledge It is also worth noting that ten current/former undergraduate students were authors on seven articles.      Summary of Results: The OÃ†Doherty research group has been developing new methods for the de novo synthesis of natural and unnatural structures, with a particular focus on the synthesis of biologically active natural products with carbohydrate motifs. Our overarching synthetic goal is to stereoselectively assemble molecular complexity at a practical level to enable medicinal and biological studies.  a) De novo Carbohydrate Synthesis: We have been able to expand the de novo synthesis of mono-saccharides to di-, tri- and oligosaccharide and related natural products.  Key to the success of this approach is the development of a mild palladium catalyzed glycosylation in combination with the discovery of a highly enantioselective approach to pyranones from acylfurans via Noyori chemistry. The Pd-p-allyl catalyzed glycosylation reaction is both general and highly stereospecific using the C-2/C-3 p-bond as the anomeric directing group. An important advantage of this approach is its use of the enone functionality as "atom-less protecting groups" for various mono-, di- and triol functionality. The approach has been expanded to include a cyclitol installation reaction and an acyclic sugar installation reaction. A key advantage of this de novo methodology is that the Pd-catalyzed glycosylation does not require the ring oxygen to stabilize the carbocation intermediate. While there are many approaches to cyclitol sugars, these procedures are lacking in terms of practicality.  b) De Novo Natural Product Synthesis:  The utility of this de novo concept can be seen in its application for synthesis of various natural product structural motifs.
