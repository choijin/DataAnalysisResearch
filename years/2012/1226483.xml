<AbstractNarration>Creating Tools to Map Global Network Structures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The project aims to advance methodological, descriptive, and theoretical knowledge of variations in&lt;br/&gt;human societies on a global scale. Methodologically, the project will develop accessible data collection,&lt;br/&gt;management, and analysis tools for mapping network topology at the national level. In addition, the project&lt;br/&gt;will develop statistically valid and efficient methods for comparing social networks that differ in size &lt;br/&gt;and density. &lt;br/&gt;    Descriptively, as the first comparative mapping of global social networks, the project will provide &lt;br/&gt;a more detailed and comprehensive picture of the similarities and differences in patterns of&lt;br/&gt;social interaction across countries with diverse cultures, political systems, mobility patterns, and&lt;br/&gt;levels of economic development. &lt;br/&gt;    Theoretically, the project will address fundamental questions about social and structural differences &lt;br/&gt;between countries with different network topologies. The project will draw upon widely used cross-national&lt;br/&gt;measures of individualism and collectivism to test hypothesized structural differences between the US, UK, China &lt;br/&gt;and Korea. The findings will catalyze theoretical and methodological dialog between network&lt;br/&gt;scientists in disciplines that emphasize universals (e.g. statistical mechanics)and variations (e.g. &lt;br/&gt;cross-cultural studies in sociology and anthropology).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;    This project will have broad applications: 1)for the spread of pathogens and public health countermeasures,&lt;br/&gt;2) for policy research on the economic and cultural correlates of the "digital divide",3) for market&lt;br/&gt;research on the diffusion of innovations, 4) for social movement research on "domino effects" like those&lt;br/&gt;observed in the cascading collapse of the former Soviet Union and more recently in the Arab Spring,&lt;br/&gt;and 5) comparative studies of social capital and economic development. Computer scientists will benefit&lt;br/&gt;from comparative data that may be helpful for tailoring the design of online social network&lt;br/&gt;sites. Network scientists will have access to a rich new source of social network data on a global scale. Finally, the&lt;br/&gt;development and dissemination of effective methods to collect, manage, analyze, and compare&lt;br/&gt;multiple networks of hundreds of millions of nodes will constitute a significant contribution to the&lt;br/&gt;social science community, especially when coupled with technical education and training of social&lt;br/&gt;science undergraduate and graduate students to effectively utilize research tools and&lt;br/&gt;distributed/parallel computing frameworks for analyzing very large datasets.</AbstractNarration>
