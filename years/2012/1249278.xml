<AbstractNarration>The product the team aims to bring to market is a cloud-based video encoding and transcoding service with superior performance, flexibility and security features. Customers using this service would upload video files through a web portal (or API) for encoding/transcoding into their choice of formats and bit-rates suitable for display on mobile devices. The differentiating features of the planned cloud video product include: (a) fast encoding/transcoding speed with superior video quality, (b) excellent cost/performance, and (c) the ability to support a wide variety of input and output video formats. Implementation of the proposed cloud service will employ distributed computing technologies such as Map/Reduce and Hadoop to achieve significant parallelism in video processing, resulting in efficient use of computing resources and faster processing time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cloud video prototype to be developed in this project is expected to result in a commercial service with significant revenue potential. The product will simplify video encoding and transcoding for a variety of enterprises including content producers, broadcasters and mobile service providers, by providing on-demand and low-cost video conversion services that currently require on-site equipment with related capital costs. If successful, the cloud video technology will thus enable improved and lower cost mobile content delivery benefiting a broad cross section of Internet and wireless end-users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This I-Corps project was aimed at early-stage technology development and commercialization of a cloud-based video encoding and transcoding product with superior performance, flexibility and security features. The project was carried out during the period 7/1/2012 to 6/30/2013 with the goal of moving the cloud video technology under consideration from proof-of-concept laboratory stage to early commercialization with user trials of a prototype product.  The I-Corps grant supported a number of activities leading up to product commercialization, including an entrepreneurship training program conducted by the Ross Business School at the University of Michigan, product concept refinement, initial customer engagement and market development, and prototype technology development.   The major outcomes of this project are:  Participation in the I-Corps training program during the period July-Aug 2012, leading to a well-defined product concept, a preliminary business plan and strategy for market entry based on meetings with over 75 potential customers Formation of a team and incorporation of a startup company, Zipreel Inc., in Sept. 2012.  Successful negotiation of technology commercialization rights agreement between Zipreel and Rutgers University (the host institution for the I-Corps project). Development of the cloud video product prototype to be used in customer trials during the first quarter of 2014. Awarded a $150K Phase I NSF SBIR grant entitled "Zipreel: High Performance Cloud Processing Platform for Internet and Mobile Video ", (IIP-1315523) for further development of the technology and initial commercialization.       Based on these positive results from the I-Corps project, Zipreel Inc. is now an early-stage commercial entity actively working on further development of the technology and market for cloud video services.  Next steps for the company are product trials with customers identified during the course of this I-Corps project, further technology development using the recently obtained NSF SBIR funding, continued business model development leading to external venture investments as needed for faster growth.
