<AbstractNarration>The overarching goal of this award is to quantitatively investigate lightning and energetic particle precipitation from the Earth?s radiation belts using the extremely and very low frequency (ELF/VLF, ~5 Hz?32 kHz) observations on the Antarctic continent. A coordinated effort will fully characterize individual lightning return strokes occurring in the Northern hemisphere while simultaneously observing the associated ELF/VLF radio atmospheric (sferic) in the Antarctic (and other global locations). A special effort will focus on a class of large-amplitude ELF sferics known as Q-bursts in order to quantify global ionospheric conditions and the characteristics of the causative lightning flash. Narrowband VLF observations of lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP) will be simultaneously conducted in the Northern and Southern hemispheres in order to validate a new LEP model that accounts for the lightning current waveform and return stroke speed. Furthermore, this program critically evaluates whether rocket-triggered lightning may be detected in the Antarctic, allowing for controlled broadband ELF/VLF propagation studies, and whether it may produce LEP in the conjugate hemisphere. The broader impacts of this award are in identifying direct effects of space weather events for the studies by atmospheric and space electricity research communities. The project introduces a new platform from which to conduct controlled lightning-related ELF/VLF experiments using rocket-triggered lightning in Florida, it provides real-time access to experimental observations via the Internet, and it exposes the program to youths through the operation of VLF receivers at high schools in the United States. The dissemination of program results also takes the form of refereed journal publications and conference presentations. The project will train graduate students with the development and operation of the deployed instruments, as well as with space weather science investigations. Use of these data to validate space weather models can provide benefit to society as a whole.</AbstractNarration>

These observations are being used to show that the properties of the lightning channel can change significantly between return strokes, affecting the magnitude of the radio wave launched around the world.    2) We successfully detected a large number of conjugate LEP events.  We detected over 50 high quality observations of LEP events in the northern and southern hemispheres simultaneously.  We performed a statistical analysis of these events to determine the distribution of event timing and other properties.    3) We determined that many reported observations of Q-bursts since the 1990's are most likely observations of N-bursts &ndash; none of the observations have corresponding VLF observations to show a lack of signal in the VLF band.
