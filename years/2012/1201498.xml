<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal for support of projects in parts of operator theory and functional analysis mostly related to Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) and engineering system theory. Semidefinite programming, based on LMIs, is one of the main developments in optimization over the previous 15 years with applications ranging through most quantitative areas of science. A main thrust of this proposal is: what is the scope of semidefinite programming? Problems treatable with LMIs are convex, but conversely which convex problems are treatable with LMIs? With collaborators the principal investigator is currently making significant advances on the main aspects of this problem. Special emphasis goes to LMI problems motivated by systems engineering. While numerics for LMIs, is hotly pursued there is no systematic theory for simplifying or analyzing matrix inequalities algebraically. Major parts of this proposal are  to develop such a theory. This produces a rich body of elegant problems in functional analysis including those described as follows. A symmetric noncommutative polynomial is called "free positive" provided that all of its values when evaluated on matrices is a positive semi-definite matrix. "Free convexity" is defined analogously. The set of all matrices solving a noncommutative polynomial inequality is called a "free semialgebraic set." Linear Matrix Inequalities concern conditions making  a given linear pencil take positive semidefinite values. 1. Which sets are the set of all solutions to some LMI? 2. Can one change variables to achieve free convexity? 3. Find the  convex hull of a  semialgebraic set? These can be built as projections of certain convex sets, as was analysed by J. Nie and the investigator. Free convex hulls are very intriguing. 4. Noncommutative real algebraic geometry: In another direction, started by Hilbert's 17th problem, are algebraic certificates  equivalent to statements like one polynomial is positive where another one is positive? The development of noncommutative analogs of this are going well and considerable work is in progress. 5. A cornerstone of classical real algebraic geometry is that projections of semialgebraic sets are semialgebraic. Recent theorems (by the investigator and collaborators) imply this is (overwhelmingly) false in the matricial world, producing a barrage of questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work bears on, semidefinite programming, a type of convex optimization found in many branches of science and engineering. In particular what one sees in linear systems engineering and control are problems with matrix unknowns. Simplifying physical problems and converting them to convex ones is currently done (in thousands of papers) by ad hoc algebraic tricks. The goal in the proposal is to develop a theory (a noncommutative real algebraic geometry) which might be used to systematize this. In addition the investigator's group are the main providers of software (called NCAlgebra) for performing general noncommuting algebra calculations in the software program Mathematica. An emphasis now is on algorithms for treating noncommutative inequalities. Also the group does numerical optimization based on a floor of noncommutative algebra calculation. The project will engage graduate and some undergraduate students in summer research and computational projects. This lab experience with applications will broaden the training of students, many of whom get degrees in pure mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Optimization is one of the areas most critical to modern  technology, since one is always trying to minimize cost or  maximize performance, safety, output etc, etc..  It can be thought of in two parts: convex optimization and non convex optimization. The concept of a  convex function is illustrated by a cup; it has  unique  lowest point (minimum), while for non convex problems one would think of a mountain range with many valleys,hence  many lowest points (local minima). Computer algorithms are good at finding one or a few local minimum but a  huge issue is  out of all the local minima  finding the lowest (global)  one. For convex problems all local minima are global which means that computer runs do not report a false minimum. Of course in technology the number of variables is huge, so all that is available to the designer are algebraic formulas (not pictures); thus the cup and mountain metaphors are  misleadingly simple. There are two big  classes of convex optimization problems solvable on a computer:classical linear programing  and (within the last 20 years)the more widely applicable Linear Matrix Inequalities LMIs(the core of Semi Definite Programming SDP). This grant concerned  many aspects of LMIs.  What is the  scope of LMI techniques: problems treatable with  LMIs are convex, but conversely which convex problems are treatable with LMIs?  With collaborators the PI sketched out the currently believed road map for this problem. This grant moves to the next issues.   What one sees in linear systems engineering and control are problems with matrix unknowns and specifications which are presented as noncommutative polynomials. Much of the grant focuses on these. Abbreviate noncommutative by nc.  NCALGEBRA A biproduct and a tool for  the PI's research is  software, called NCAlgebra,  performing general noncommuting algebra calculations in Mathematica. It is the main tool running under Mathematica for doing nc calculationsand it is free to the public.Under this grant there were significant improvements; very notably the package for numerically solving LMIs was added. This is the only LMI solver  we know running  under Mathematica.  The PI has a group of  (mostly graduate) students in the summer who docomputer experiments (mostly with NCAlgebra) and/or   present research papers to our summer group.  Funding from this grant provided core support.    LINEAR MATRIX INEQUALITIES On the basic convex vs LMI representable issue: Every 'matrix convex set' C defined as the solutions to a  nc polynomial inequality has a LMI representation. (Here the variables entering the LMI are matrices.) This was  proved to hold for  C defined by nc rational functions.   A set which is not convex has a "convex hull", the smallest convex setcontaining it. This is much sought after.   We gave a construction of a sequence C(d) of LMI domains in increasingly many variables  whose projections PC(d)  are successively finer  outer approximations of thematrix convex hull of a given  free semialgebraic set. It is based on nc analogs of moments and Hanke matrices.  Approximation is possibly the best that  can be done in general.    The LMI inclusion problem is:  Given two LMIs A(X) &gt;0 and B(Y)&gt;0,when  does A(X) &gt;0 imply B(X) &gt;0?   We showed how to give an approximate solution, called a relaxation, by using matrix unknowns.In the process  this introduced the powerful  operator technique of complete positivity to this type of SDP.   NC REAL ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY Classical real algebraic geometry RAG  develops a theory of polynomialsand much of it concerns inequalities based on evaluating them on tuples of real  numbers. Much of the grant concerns  noncommutative polynomials and properties when evaluated on tuples of matrices (of all sizes). This new (freely) noncommutative real algebraic geometry often behaves much more rigidly than classical RAG.   At the core of algebraic geometry lies the Nullstellensatzes.For ideals of polynomials over  complex numbers is Hilbert's NullStellensatzfrom about 1890.
