<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PIs will investigate the relationship between mechanical properties of the cell and physiological response, using bioluminescence as a fast reporter of mechanosensitivity. Specific questions to be addressed are: (1) What are the mechanical properties of the cell? (2) How is mechanosensitivity related to the mechanical properties of the cell? and (3) What is the role of the cytoskeleton in determining the mechanical properties of cells and their physiological sensitivity? These issues will be studied in three species of dinoflagellates using atomic force microscopy to measure the elasticity of living cells and apply quantified mechanical stress to cells, microfluidics to subject cells to known levels of fluid shear stress, and laser confocal microscopy coupled with fluorescent probes to visualize the cytoskeleton. Pharmacological treatments that disrupt the cytoskeleton will be examined for their effect on cell elasticity and mechanosensitivity. This collaborative project applies advanced methods of physics, material science, and microfluidic technology to characterize the mechanical properties of the cell and the relationship to physiological sensitivity. The goal of the project is to enhance the value of dinoflagellate bioluminescence as a reporter of mechanical stress for applications in both the biological and physical sciences. This project will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups and advances discovery and understanding by providing internship opportunities to these undergraduate students through UCSD internship programs, the opportunity for a Ph.D. graduate student in the physical sciences to work in an interdisciplinary setting, and for two undergraduate students to participate as REU interns. The project advances discovery and understanding by contributing to the professional development of middle and high school science teachers by developing course materials through the Scripps Classroom Connection Summer Institute in partnership with COSEE CA, and providing demonstration kits of dinoflagellate bioluminescence to their students. Project results will be broadly disseminated through established scientific venues as well as education and public outreach activities through the Birch Aquarium at Scripps.</AbstractNarration>

Eukaryotic cells are structurally sophisticated and can sense mechanical stimuli and respond to them, changing their physiology, gene expression, structural properties, and motility. Cell structure and mechanics play a role in the sensing and transduction of the mechanical stimuli and cellular responses to them. Planktonic marine protozoa dinoflagellates, which are unicellular organisms ~50 microns in size, respond to mechanical stresses in thier special way, by emitting flashes of luminescent light. This bioluminescent response is very rapid, occurring on 10 millisecond (ms) time scale, making it both a practical tool to visualize hydrodynamic stresses in flows and an appealing model to study cellular mechano-sensitivity and mechano-transduction. In this work, we tested the responses of individual dinoflagellates of the species <em>Lingulodinium polyedrum </em>to an abrupt exposure to hydrodynamic shear flow with a large shear stress. To this end, we designed and built a novel experimental system, which included a microfluidic device, a flow-driving setup, and a video-microscopy system with two cameras and a laser. This system made it possible to expose dinoflagellates to shear stress on a 10 ms scale, reliably detect luminescence flashes of rapidly moving cells with 5 ms resolution in time, and account for all cell passing through the field of view, whether luminescent or not. With this system, we established, for the first time, that as many as 40% of individual dinoflagellates exposed to hydrodynamic shear stress produce luminescent flashes after as short as 10 ms of exposure. In addition to providing quantitative data on the rate of mechanotranduction and biochemical response in cells, this result has a practical value for the visualization of flows using luminescent dinoflagellates. Notably, when the microtubule cytoskeleton of dinoflagellates was disrupted (with a drug oryzalin), only 23% of them flashed in response to shear stress, and the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (with a drug &nbsp;lantrunculin B) caused the proportion of the flashing cells to drop to 13%. These experiments showed that both microtubule and actin cytoskeletons play major roles in the mechanosensing of <em>Lingulodinium polyedrum</em> dinoflagellates.
