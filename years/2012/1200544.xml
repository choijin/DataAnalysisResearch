<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for an academic/industrial collaboration to optimize the heterogeneous structure, size and composition of silver and silver-metal composite nanoparticles for photovoltaic manufacture. The project will include synthesis of homogenous alloy and core-shell composite nanoparticles by solution phase and electrodeposition methods as well as structural and functional characterization of nanoparticles using combined techniques, including aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electronic Microscopy and synchrotron-based Extended X?ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. These particles will be used to prepare screen-printable conductive inks.  The inks will be optimized for printing onto silicon wafers and formation of conductive layers by low-temperature fusing. The nanoparticle synthesis technology will be scaled-up and optimized for efficient large scale production in a continuous stirred tank reactor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal contacts are essential components of silicon photovoltaic cells, and their formation is a major efficiency-limiting and cost-determining step in solar cell processing. Screen printing has been adopted as a rapid, cost-effective, and simple technique to print silver contacts in large-volume photovoltaic cell production. However, the thin film fired or frit silver inks used in current processes contain large silver powders, which require high-temperature fusion to produce a conductive layer, resulting in a loss of efficiency. The proposed nanoparticles inks will enable lower-temperature fusing processes, better uniformity, and higher conductivity than the current powders used in frit ink. This project will be carried out in partnership with Conductive Compounds LLC, a manufacturer of conductive materials including screen printable conductive inks. If successful the research will result in cost-effective nanoparticle-based inks.  The project outcome will directly support the nation?s effort to diversify its energy supply and help to reduce the global carbon footprint. Curricula based on the research results will be produced and internships will be provided for students at Conductive Compounds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work was a collaboration between researchers in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of New Hampshire and a New Hampshire based small business, Conductive Compounds. The objective was to develop screen printable conductive inks based on nanotechnology.  The primary application is intended to be screen printing of current collectors on solar voltaic panels. However, the inks should be suitable for screen printing of a range of electrical circuits including flexible circuits for consumer appliances.   In the course of the project, we discovered that silver nanowires give the inks certain very desirable flow properties.

Our studies on the fluid behavior of these inks was published in the Journal of Nanoparticle Research. The flow studies constitute an original contribution to the field of nanofluids.  We conducted extensive development work on the production of silver nanowires.

Our studies of nanowire production included an optimization study. Our work on batch and continuous reactors as well as the optimization study were published in three papers the Electrochemical Society Journal of Solid State Science and Technology.  The results of the project have been used for curriculum materials for a new elective chemical engineering course at UNH developed by the co-PI (Teng).  The course, CHE 706/806 Electrochemical methods for energy applications, has been offered since the spring of 2014 for junior, senior and graduate students. So far, the PI has offered this course in 2014, 2015 and 2017 with a total enrollment of more than 100.  This course has been listed as required for the energy within the chemical engineering major.   The PhD student supported by the grant has produced four refereed publications based on her results. In addition, the undergraduate students working in the labs of both the PI (Barkey)  and the co-PI (Teng) have disseminated results through conference presentations, including North American Catalysis Society meeting and the UNH Undergraduate Research Conference.
