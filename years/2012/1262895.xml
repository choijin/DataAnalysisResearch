<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual focus of this REU/RET Site, supported by the NSF Division of Materials Research and NSF Engineering Directorate is the fundamental study and application of biomaterials and bio-inspired engineering. Students and teachers will participate in research and educational projects that range from developing fundamental understanding of how biomaterials form and perform in nature, to designing and characterizing the use of new materials in soft and adaptive robotic or assistive devices. Projects will have a strong focus on learning from nature - how to interpret sophisticated functionalities and approximate these functionalities by modifying, manipulating or creating new materials. Projects are organized around 3 central themes:&lt;br/&gt;1. Nano- and microscale structures for biology and medicine&lt;br/&gt;2. Tunable materials for tissue engineering and drug delivery &lt;br/&gt;3. Materials and strategies for soft and adaptive robotics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will contribute to ongoing research projects that combine experiment with theory and/or simulation in the study and design of interfaces between cells and surfaces; tunable structures, gels and networks; drug delivery systems; tissue culture scaffolds; and multi-functional biomaterials such as photonic and electronic biomaterials. K-12 teachers and community college faculty will work with faculty and students to translate this research into classroom and laboratory activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The theme for the REU Site: Biomaterials Research Initiative Dedicated to Gate Way Experiences at Harvard University is the interplay of materials science and bioengineering via 3 themes: (1) the study and design of microscopic structures for biology and medicine;  (2) tunable and responsive materials for tissue engineering and drug delivery; and (3) soft and adaptive robotics. The topics are chosen to appeal to a wide population of students who are at early stages of their academic development, and who have limited awareness of career paths.  The REU Site at Harvard will have a strong emphasis on students with little or no previous research experience. The program includes recruitment and support for students from underrepresented groups, students at non-research intensive institutions, and non-traditional students who have re-entered college, in particular veterans of the armed forces. In addition, teachers and faculty from highly diverse local K-12 schools and community college will work with faculty and students to develop hands-on classroom and laboratory activities designed to introduce students to current research in biomaterials and bio-inspired engineering. The Site's professional development activities will have a strong focus on scientific communication skills and innovation. This work is supported by the NSF Division of Materials Research and NSF Engineering Directorate.</AbstractNarration>
