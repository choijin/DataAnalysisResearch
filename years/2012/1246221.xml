<AbstractNarration>This research study "Veterans in STEM: Critical Analysis of the Factors Affecting Pathways to STEM Careers for Veterans Experiencing Disabilities" is being conducted in response to the NSF's Research in Disabilities Education (RDE) program solicitation (NSF 12-542) for the RDE-Broadening Participation Research in STEM Education Level 1 (RDE-BPR1) track.  The RDE-BPR1 track targets fundamental learning and educational research, early-stage studies, and design and development research. RDE-BPR1 projects enhance the understanding of the basic underlying issues affecting differential learning, participation, persistence and graduation rates of postsecondary students with disabilities in STEM education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study focuses on broadening participation in STEM of veterans challenged by disabilities acquired due to experiences of combat trauma.  Due to experiences of combat trauma, veterans often experience an array of challenges associated with post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury such as learning, memory, sensory, or communication challenges. The target population of this study is veterans and student veterans experiencing these challenges, which are often "invisible" or unrecognized during the transition from military to civilian life. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed project is to investigate the critical factors impacting learning, participation, persistence, and graduation for veterans with disabilities pursuing undergraduate STEM degrees. The proposal targets one primary research question: What are the critical factors reported by veterans with invisible disabilities influencing their decisions to enroll and persist in STEM post-secondary undergraduate programs?  Through a social ecological framework, this study is designed to investigate veteran-specific variables. Using fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM), a methodology that applies fuzzy set theory making causal cognitive maps computable, the data from the subjects will provide a clear image of the multiple dimensions (e.g., characteristics, timing, and intensity) influencing veterans with disabilities succeeding in STEM. The interdependencies, as well as measures of direct and indirect effects will be computable, displayed, and validated by the subjects. Data collection involves interviews with subjects who include (a) veterans with disabilities in STEM, and (b) veterans transitioning between military service and college. Data is being sampled from a national population of subjects.  In the interview process, causal cognitive maps are being created and relationships between identified variables are given quantifiable direction and weight. In the final phase, the maps are integrated qualitatively and quantitatively to result in a network of the direct and indirect relationships between influencing variables.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes an independent and external evaluation,  plans to disseminate the results and findings from the study to a broad research audience and the public, and a plan to expand the subject pool beyond veterans with disabilities in future studies that will address contextual variables in which student veterans  with disabilities in, and interested in STEM, operate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Veterans in STEM study focused on a primary research question of, "What are the critical factors reported by veterans with invisible disabilities influencing their decisions to enroll and persist in STEM post-secondary undergraduate programs?"   This study sought to describe, from the perspective of veterans, the lingering effects of combat trauma, which can pose ongoing and dramatic challenges for student veterans such as difficulty with memory, communication, attention, processing detailed information, and emotional stability.  However, as noted below, these were not primary factors identified by veterans.  Rather, these were underlying attributes among many of the factors.    Sixty-nine individuals, representing military veterans as well as service men and women preparing to transition to civilian status participated in the study.  Participants reported fifteen home states representing East and West Coasts, Hawaii, Midwest, South, and New England regions of the country.  The methodology used to answer the research question was fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM).  Through an interview process, researchers gathered causal cognitive maps from participants describing their perspectives and insights (factors) leading to their personal success in STEM education and the pathway to STEM careers.  After an extensive process of data review, cleaning, and validation, individual veteran maps were mathematically integrated to form an overall model.  In post-hoc analysis, the maps representing veterans prior to transition out of the military and maps of veterans in their STEM education were analyzed and compared.   The model results show a complex array of factors representing higher education, employers, community services, and personal factors interwoven and having an impact on veteran success.  The final overall model contained 55 factors and 518 connections.   Most prominent in the overall model were the following factors:     Education Funding (veteran-specific) Personal Factors Military Provided Transition Training (TAP) College Peer Connections (veteran-specific) Job Search/Placement Support Personal/ Family Resources Centralized College Resources (veteran-specific) Internship Education Benefits Advising Financial Stability VA (Veterans Administration) Services      Examining the model differences between pre and post transition veterans show logicial priorities, based on the types of current experiences as well as their stage in planning for their future.  The integrated model of veterans pre-transition from the military identified the following prominent factors.   Personal Factors Military      Provided Transition Training Education      Funding (for veterans specifically) Internship Personal/      Family Resources Financial      Stability Job      Search/Placement Support Convenient      Course Options Comprehensive      Academic Supports STEM      Industry/College Collaboration College Veteran-Peer Connections    The integrated model of veterans post-transition from the military identify the following prominent factors.  Education Funding (for veterans specifically) College Veteran-Peer Connections  Personal      Factors Job      Search/Placement Support Centralized      College Resources (for veterans specifically) Internship Personal/      Family Resources Military      Training Transfer Credits Job      Preparation Resources Family/Friend/Community      Support Financial      Stability Community      Veteran-Peer Connection  VA      Services Industry/Military      Collaboration (for veterans specifically) Education      Benefits Advising Health      Services (for veterans specifically)   Using the developed model, researchers were able to run scenarios.  Scenarios are hypothesized "what-if" situations that allows stakeholders to experiment with strategies for  program development and improvements by testing their experiment in the model environment.  After much scenario testing, researcher first concluded that factors from the personal/community category emerged strongly in all of the scenarios. The issues of transitioning from military to civilian life are important and often urgent for veterans.  Even when factors from this category are not activated (not mentioned in the sets of recommendations), the application of the full array of other services and supports have an effect on the personal factors.

Lastly, factors pertained to ongoing services or supports like mentoring as opposed to one-time events, showed more impact on veteran success.  Single events such as a job fair or an orientation course show lower impact than ongoing systems or services such as centralized college resources and college peer connections.    Recommendations  When applying the model to strategic decision-making, stakeholders should begin with an accurate representation of the current array of available services and support for the veteran population of focus.  This will establish a baseline status.  From that point, stakeholders should strategically consider targetted areas for improvement that enhance current services, are systemically feasible, and are likely to address the overall well-being of veterans, as non-traditional students in STEM education working toward STEM employment.  When a purposeful approach to strategic planning is used and applied as a hypothetical scenario to the model, the model will yield reliable results to inform next steps for improving veteran success.
