<AbstractNarration>This action funds Daisy A. Segovia of John Jay College of Criminal Justice to conduct a research project, entitled "The relationship between memory control and suppressing thoughts about traumatic events," during the summer of 2012 at Victoria University of Wellington in Wellington.  The host scientist is Maryanne Garry, PhD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is advancing knowledge of what factors explain and predict people's recovery from trauma. Experiencing a traumatic event can lead some individuals to develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. One of the main symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is the occurrence of unwanted, intrusive thoughts of the traumatic event. Research has shown that controlling unwanted memories of trauma requires the ability to manipulate information. This study investigates the relationship between memory control and suppressing thoughts about traumatic events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is advancing knowledge on what factors affect peopleÆs perception of the standard of proof in criminal court trials. In adversarial systems, such as the one in the USA, NZ etc, beyond a reasonable doubt is the standard of proof for criminal trials in criminal trials. However, legal professionals and researchers have had difficulty trying to define this concept. Definitions vary largely from judge to judge and from state to state, but often, jurors only receive a vague instruction &ndash; which is usually ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
