<AbstractNarration>In this project, the principal investigator and his assistants are working on a framework for achieving&lt;br/&gt;scalability and sustainability in three-dimensional wireless sensor network deployments. The objective is&lt;br/&gt;to study the design of energy-efficient three-dimensional k-covered wireless sensor networks, where each&lt;br/&gt;point in a field of interest is covered by at least k heterogeneous sensors, in the presence of obstacles&lt;br/&gt;and mobile events in the field. This study is based on Baxter's factorization of Ornstein-Zernike equation,&lt;br/&gt;the pair-connectedness theory, and potential fields to solve the problem of joint k-coverage, duty-cycling,&lt;br/&gt;and data forwarding in three-dimensional heterogeneous wireless sensor networks with a goal to achieve&lt;br/&gt;sustainable and scalable deployments. The principal investigator plans to evaluate the performance of this&lt;br/&gt;framework through simulation using a network simulator, such as TOSSIM, and implementation using a test-bed of sensors, such as MICAz motes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has significant impact on its field and the society. It has a rich plan for the integration&lt;br/&gt;of research and education through the development of curriculum and resources for teaching to a wide range of undergraduate and graduate students. Based on the results of this project, the principal investigator plans to develop a set of networking courses. Also, the principal investigator has a plan to recruit, train, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students including women and members of underrepresented minority groups. Furthermore, this project allows the principal investigator mentor K-12 teachers and high-school students through research seminars. It helps the principal investigator attract and recruit students to pursue science careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Preliminary work was done to propose an efficient, optimized, and generic framework (ASCEND) for 3D sensor deployments while achieving sustainability and scalability.  When fully complete, this research will be able to promote the usage of advanced mathematical analyses and results in the design and deployment of such networks. ASCEND can be used as a model for the design and development of a wide range of real-world applications of national importance, such as border surveillance.  The proposed framework, ASCEND, will assist the network designers in addressing all the problems and challenges in the design, deployment, and maintenance of 3D heterogeneous connected wireless sensor networks.  The research findings were implemented and shared in a graduate-level course, Wireless Sensor Networks in Winter 2019.  This course is a medium to train an undergraduate students who investigated the problem of sensor node localization in both 2D and 3D wireless sensor networks.  To disseminate the research, results from this project have been disseminated through publications in high-quality journals, such as ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (ACM TOSN), IEEE Transactions on Computers (IEEE TC), and Elsevier Computer Networks (Elsevier COMNET).  In addition, three book chapter proposals have been accepted for publication.  The PI has also given invited talks in research colloquia organized by the hosting departments, such as Department of Computing Technology, School of Computer Science and Mathematics, Marist College, November 14, 2014; and Department of Computer Science and Information Systems Engineering, College of Arts and Sciences, Fort Hays State University, February 13, 2015.
