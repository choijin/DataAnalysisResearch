<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to develop advanced computational approaches to develop a fundamental and detailed understanding of multiphase fluids in confined nanopores, especially in carbon nanotubes. If successful, the results of this research should potentially clarify what are some of the issues associated with the usage of CNTs as nano-pores in such critical applications as desalination, hydrogen storage, DNA transport, and CO2 sequestration.</AbstractNarration>
