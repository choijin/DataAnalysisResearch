<AbstractNarration>The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) contains one of the largest invertebrate paleontology collections in the world, estimated at 4.8 million specimen lots. This award provides funds to rehabilitate part of that collection - the Foraminifera and Ostracoda Microfossil Collection which contains unique and scientifically valuable specimens. The collection is important because of its broad range, making it possible to study the diversity of these organisms and their distribution geographically, and over geologic time. The collection is at risk due to suboptimal storage and lack of databasing. Specimens will be identified, rehoused, conserved and catalogued. Data associated with specimens will be made available to the public and researchers via the online database, along with digital images of over 1,000 specimens and CT-scan images of 50 specimens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The improvements to this collection will enhance its utility and accessibility for researchers and students. Correctly identified and curated specimens will be used in evolutionary studies and in research in which foraminifera are used to evaluate the impacts of present and past climate change on ecosystems. Student interns supported by this grant will be trained in collection and data management and in specimen identification. Specimens will be highlighted for exhibit display and for use in AMNH's educational activities for K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>
