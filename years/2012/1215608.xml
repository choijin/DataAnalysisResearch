<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project concerns applying Illumina's Solexa deep-sequencing technology as a read-out for yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens. The proposed research arose from the recognition that the principal limitation of Y2H screening is the lack of a true large-scale readout for the screening results. Applying Illumina's deep-sequencing methodology to comprehensively analyze pooled Y2H strains will effectively supplant the time- and labor-intensive sequencing of individual clones required by conventional approaches. Further, a tailored scoring scheme will allow use of quantitative statistical analysis to determine the significance of the Y2H readouts. Hence, this particular enhancement of deep-sequencing technology will not only vastly increase the throughput of Y2H screens (1,000-10,000 fold), but will also provide high confidence in identification of true positive results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this research will be a strong shift towards using Y2H and related procedures for screening. Once this Y2H screening technology is established, researchers, using tools and workflows set up for transcriptome analysis, will be able to identify and elucidate the intricate networks of protein-protein interactions that underlie essentially all pathologies and complex diseases. Commercial applications will target academic and industrial labs that wish to explore the biological context of drug targets and oncogenes. Compared with conventional Y2H methods, the proposed approach will deliver superior results at a much lower cost. While the business opportunity for Quintara for genomics applications is very large, the real benefits will accrue to the research community and human health.</AbstractNarration>

We established a pipeline with distinct experimental and computational steps that we can now provide to customers, thereby improving and accelerating their research projects (see Figure 1).

In its classical implementation, the direct physical interaction between two proteins (bait and prey) in yeast reconstitutes a functional transcription factor that drives the expression of reporter genes, which in turn enables the selection of interacting protein pairs from a large background of non-interacting proteins. Taking advantage of the two distinct yeast haplotypes means that large combinations of bait and preys can be generated rapidly by yeast mating. Hence, Y2H is a rapid and cost-effective way to explore PPI networks and to study direct binary PPIs. Figure 2 provides a schematic illustration of the Y2H method.  In conventional Y2H screens, sequences of interacting proteins are identified by Sanger sequencing, one individual clone at a time, which severely limits the throughput of the assay. Replacing conventional Sanger sequencing with NGS allows for massively increased screening capacity and results in greatly reduced costs for identifying PPIs. Moreover, we apply a comprehensive screening and scoring scheme that allows the use of quantitative statistics to prioritize the results and exclude false positives, which used to be a major pitfall in conventional Y2H. Our pipeline will also apply specialized bioinformatics algorithms to enable quick comparisons across datasets and easy access to related experimental results. Figure 3 compares the results of conventional Y2H methods with our NGS-Y2H technique.  During Phase I/IB, the experimental and computational procedures for NGS-Y2H were validated with collaborators in two distinct fields of research: cancer research (Dr. Jian-Hua Mao, Lawrence Berkeley Labs) and hearing disorders and deafness (Dr. Ulrich Mueller, Scripps). In the cancer project, we performed NGS-Y2H screens with a human tumor suppressor protein (Fbox/WD repeat-containing protein 7) using Illumina HiSeq and Affymetrix microarrays as readouts. We identified ~200 novel potential interaction partners for FBXW7, which may have important and decisive roles in tumorigenesis or metastasis. In the hearing disorders and deafness project, we found interesting connections between proteins that are believed to underlie hearing deficiencies and hearing loss. Hence, our NGS-Y2H approach produced a wealth of relevant data that can be crucial for a better understanding of these diseases.  We expect that using our NGS-Y2H method to explore PPI networks will become an important addition to the existing palette of NGS applications in genomics....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
