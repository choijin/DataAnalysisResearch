<AbstractNarration>Ranging from the low-energy phenomena of cosmology to the highest energy of stellar jets, neutrinos are a fundamental ingredient of the universe that we observe, and offer unique windows into its mysteries.  The purpose of this project is a theoretical study of these windows.  Part of the research will be on neutrinos from core collapse supernovae: how these neutrinos are affected by flavor oscillations, and what their detection will teach us about the physics that takes place at extremely high density near the collapsed core.  High-energy neutrino emission will also be investigated as a way to explore the physics of particle accelerators in our galaxy and beyond, with focus on propagation effects and detectability at present and future neutrino telescopes.  Another area of study will be the physics of neutrinos in the early universe, how they connect to the nature of the dark matter, and how they can possibly reveal the existence of new particles and forces.  This project will contribute to the ongoing transition to a new phase of neutrino physics, characterized by new, more powerful experiments and by a deeper understanding of the neutrino phenomenology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being based at a large public university, the project will benefit young scientists through educational activities and direct involvement in research.  Specifically, the grant will support a postdoc and a graduate student, thus offering them an opportunity to enter the  field, and join a new generation of neutrino physicists that will sustain the new phase of discoveries ahead.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This a project in theoretical physics, centered on the properties of the most elusive of elementary particles, the neutrinos. The Earth receives neutrino from many astrophysical objects, as well as from the early phases of the evolution of the universe. These neutrinos are very useful messengers, carrying information on several physical phenomena that take place in stars and in the universe.  The project has three main themes: neutrinos from collapsing stars (supernovae), cosmic high energy neutrinos from still mysterious astrophysical jets, and very low energy neutrinos from the early universe.  On collapsing stars, extensive work was done to produce realistic, detailed predictions of the neutrino flux produced by a star in the days and hours before the star's core become unstable and collapses under its own weight.
