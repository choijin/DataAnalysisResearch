<AbstractNarration>The proposed center seeks to establish a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) addressing broadband wireless access and applications. The center will focus on four areas: 1) enabling sharing up to many GHz of spectrum using technological advances and enabling platforms such as spectrum trading and auctions, and millimeter wave communications; 2) co-existence of heterogeneous devices (e.g. radar and communication systems); 3) providing connectivity for new applications such as wireless devices in the hospitals of the future, bringing wireless into the hospital in novel ways; and (d) improving electronic warfare technologies that address national-security issues.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new center addresses an area of critical economic and has the potential to support development of broadband wireless as a platform for innovation as addressed in the White House PCAST Report.  The proposed center has the potential to link a diverse set of member companies across the broadband industry sector with university discovery in this area.  Moreover, the center participants have a history of start-up initiation, and the opportunity from new starts to leverage the ecosystem created by the center is significant.   The center plans to impact students via their conduct of center research, curriculum development and REU site development.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The study sought to answer the following questions (i) Can MS disease progression be characterized with long-term deployment of inertial sensors "in the wild"? (ii) What is the tradeoff between sensing fidelity and clinical significance, an what does this imply in terms of long-term deployment? (iii) Do 'objective' measurements (accelerations) correlate to perceived symptoms, and to what extend do self-reported symptoms and inertial measurements compliment each other? (iv) Does the display o motion capture and symptom-tracking data lead to improved communication between patients and their caregivers?  Answers to these questions are of interest specifically in the design and evaluation of advanced diagnostics and treatments for MS, and also generally in the area of wireless Health, which is increasingly reliant on broadband wireless access.  IN another MITRE-related project, in conjunction with ongoing efforts at UVA on predictive analytics and remote patient monitoring, we initiated a project on evaluation design tradeoffs in remote vital sign monitoring in ambulatory patients.  After an extensive review of medical-grade sensors that support third-party software development, we have identified the zephyr BioPatch as an all-purpose wireless health device that mearse (i) raw (single-lead) ECG with 10 bit resolution at 250Hz: (ii) derivative assessments of R-to-R intervals (per beat), heart arte; and respiratory rate; (iii) 3-axis accelerometer data; (iv) posture; and (iv) core and skin temperature - all of which can be aggregated on an external device in real time via Bluetooth.  We have developed (i) an Android application (the Ambulatory Response Monitor (ARMOR) that uses the Zephyr API to collect, store, and display these data on a smartphone with a simple user interface and (ii) a PHP website hosted on the Microsoft Azure cloud that receives the various data streams as packets framed by the Android app and displays the data in near real time (e.g. the website can re-fresh the last 10 seconds of raw ECG every 3 seconds with low latency).  This sensor-Android-PHP system is intended to serve as a general-purpose platform for (i) developing new use cases remote monitoring in either hospital-based or home settings and (ii) exploring tradeoffs between resource utilization and the fidelity of medical data.
