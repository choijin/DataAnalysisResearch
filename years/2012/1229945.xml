<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the viability of an electrochemical device for separation and compression of hydrogen from low-pressure mixed gas streams that are critical for industrial gas and energy applications.  Previous studies have shown that hydrogen derived from reformation of hydrocarbons produces a gas stream rich in CO2, CO and H2.  It has been well- documented that low-temperature electrodes similar to those used in these devices are often contaminated by carbon monoxide, negatively affecting their operation. While state-of-the-art solutions rely upon implementation of advanced catalysts or high temperature membranes, these solutions are not viable for systems having significant levels of CO in the feed stream. Specifically the project will focus on solving electrode contamination issues through a series of design modifications; allowing the system to operate continually at high efficiency.  Research efforts will leverage results from a fluids transport model to optimize the cell and system design. Laboratory cells will be constructed and evaluated  over  a  range  of  operational  parameters  to  develop  a  better  understanding  of  the performance  improvement  associated  with  this  approach.  This  program  will  culminate  in  the construction of a fully-integrated system package that will be tested and validated with real-world reformate chemistries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the fact that depletion of fossil fuel reserves and a global requirement for the development of a sustainable economy, the prospect of hydrogen-based  energy  is  of  growing  importance.     Production,  purification  and  compression  of hydrogen represent key technical challenges for the implementation of a hydrogen economy, especially in the transportation sector where new sources and modes of delivery of hydrogen are needed. These technologies must be robust, efficient, and cost effective in order to have value in meeting our energy needs. Since hydrogen energy markets are emerging, viable product solutions must meet near-term industrial needs as a commercial bridge toward low-cost energy products. The current market for hydrogen is large and growing, with the vast majority of hydrogen produced from hydrocarbon sources resulting  in  gas  streams  containing  appreciable  quantities  of  CO  and  CO2   and  hydrogen.  Current methods for separation and compression of hydrogen are very expensive and these costs are passed to the end-user. Successful development of the proposed technology will integrate the separation and compression functions, and expand the applicability of this device to separation of reformate and other mixed gas streams in a low-cost configuration which offers significant commercial appeal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has advanced electrochemical hydrogen separation and compression technology in making it more robust relative to specific impurities present in the feed stream.  Electrochemical separation is a process wherein an electrochemical cell is used to oxidize hydrogen at the anode and evolve it at the cathode.  The technique allows hydrogen to be separated from a gas mixture, purified and compressed to high pressure.  Sustainable Innovations has developed cells that facilitate compression of the hydrogen to pressures of greater than 12,000 psi in a single electrochemical step.   This research focused on the development of a means of addressing a common impurity in the hydrogen feed stream - carbon monoxide.  The research program developed carbon monoxide tolerant electrochemical cells that filter out this impurity and others.  Further efforts scaled the hardware to a fully-integrated prototype system.  This system was used to conduct parametric mapping of the effects of impurity concentration, feed flow, hydrogen demand, outlet pressure requirement, operating temperature, and other important system design parameters.  This series of parametric tests yielded a model that can be used for ongoing commercial design efforts.   The research activity was also centered around the evaluation of key operational parameters concerning a 100 kg/dy commercial scale system.  important factors including contaminant loading and up-time performance were characterized in order to support future and ongoing commercial efforts.
