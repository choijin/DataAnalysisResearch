<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Mark Ediger of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and his graduate research students will explore the dynamics of vapor-deposited glasses and liquids. The recent discovery that highly stable glasses can be prepared by physical vapor deposition has prompted many questions about the mechanism by which these materials are prepared and what their ultimate properties might be. The research will involve advanced characterization tools including nanocalorimetry and, in collaboration with Professor Ranko Richert of Arizona State University, dielectric spectroscopy measurements. The researchers will directly probe mobility at the surface of glasses and use this to understand how stable glasses are formed.  They will investigate the extent to which surface mobility can be eliminated by coatings.  The researchers will attempt to use dielectric relaxation to quantify the very small amounts of mobility in highly stable glasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The glassy state of matter is ubiquitous in nature, and also has a number of useful technological applications, from the fabrication of better structural materials to the development of organic electronics and improved formulations for pharmaceuticals. Besides the broader technological impacts of the research being supported, Prof. Ediger and his student colleagues will continue their involvement in the University of Wisconsin - Madison's PEOPLE Program, providing educational enrichment in the summer for high school juniors from groups under-represented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In a glassy solid, molecules do not pack with regular order like they do in crystals. As a result, different ways of preparing glasses will yield solids with different properties.  This project studied the properties of organic glasses prepared by vapor deposition.  Films with thicknesses between 200 nanometers and 15 microns were prepared by vapor deposition and their properties were measured by nanocalorimetry and dielectric spectroscopy.  We found that varying the temperature of the substrate during deposition was the key parameter for controlling the glass properties.  At the optimal substrate temperature, internal relaxation processes inside the glass could be substantially suppressed.  We also explored the role of molecular structure in determining the stability of glasses prepared by vapor deposition.  While many organic molecules form highly stable glasses by this route, several alcohols do not, and we attribute this result to lower mobility at the surface of alcohol glasses.  Vapor-deposited organic glasses are used in devices such as cell phone displays and this research provides new findings relevant for optimizing the performance of these devices. Personnel supported by this project worked with the University of Wisconsin-Madison?s PEOPLE program to prepare high school students from under-represented groups for college. Each summer, a three week course was provided for a total of 45 high school students.
