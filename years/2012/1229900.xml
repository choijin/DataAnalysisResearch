<AbstractNarration>This project is about assessing the vulnerability of small farmers in the face of environmental change and economic transformation, with a focus on improving the resilience of rural agricultural communities.  Traditional farmers in various places around the world are faced with multiple stressors arising from both environmental change and changing regional economic conditions.  One of the key factors in creating and overcoming this vulnerability is the access to and use of water. Accordingly, this study will answer two primary research questions: 1) what vulnerability do farmers face as a combined result of environmental change and economic restructuring? and 2) what role do different water delivery systems have in enhancing the resilience of small-scale agriculture in the face of uncertainty and change?  These questions will be examined in southwestern Jamaica, a region with extensive smallholder food production for the domestic market.  The project will engage a mixed methods research design that combines the collection and analysis of environmental data with a qualitative investigation of farmer knowledge, perception, and adaptation to changing regional economic conditions.  The study builds on prior research in Jamaica, which demonstrated that farmers experience stress from environmental change and market instability, a condition that has been described in the literature as 'double exposure.'  This study aims to document the nature of these stresses, and also to investigate the role played by different water management strategies in building resilience.  The results should add significantly to theories of vulnerability and resilience, and also contribute to a better understanding of environmental change adaptation in rural agricultural communities throughout the Caribbean and other developing regions.  As such, this work addresses important questions that are of interest to scholars and policy-makers who work at the intersection of economic development and environmental change and sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to teaching, training, and learning in several ways.  Learning opportunities for students at both the University of North Carolina at Wilmington (UNC-W) and East Carolina University (ECU) and the University of the West Indies (UWI) at Mona will be enhanced through the development of two courses. One of these will be a summer field course for UNC-W and ECU students focused on environmental change and sustainable development, which will be coordinated with the curricular offerings at UWI.  The second will be a collaborative, online course on environmental change, open to students on all three campuses, and run through an innovative 'global classroom' videoconference facility.  The installation of instruments for the environmental data collection will enhance the infrastructure for research in Jamaica and provide important opportunities for long-term monitoring and capacity building.  Finally, the proposed project has significant potential benefits to society.  Results from this work will be shared with the Jamaican research community and policy-makers, who have stressed to us the importance of developing a better understanding of regional environmental conditions.  Insights from this study can help to inform assessments of vulnerability and resilience for other small island developing states in the Caribbean, and can assist in the development of adaptation strategies in a region that is expected to experience disruptions from both environmental change and global economic restructuring in the coming years.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Scientific predictions suggest that global climate change may have a significant impact on agricultural production and rural livelihoods around the world.&nbsp; Given this, studies that shed light on the challenges and potential adaptions of farmers in particular locales are valuable.&nbsp; The goal of this study was to assess the vulnerability of Caribbean small farmers to climate shocks and market dynamics, and to evaluate the role of water management strategies in enhancing agricultural resilience.&nbsp; Our case study focused on St. Elizabeth Parish from 2013 to 2015.&nbsp; We utilized a novel, mixed-methods research design that included more than 100 interviews with farmers and the collection of meteorological data from 15 case study farms.&nbsp; Interviews sought to document the significant challenges, concerns, and sources of stress faced by farmers over the course of a typical growing season.&nbsp; Environmental conditions on case study farms were monitored over a two-year period using a network of rain gauges, thermometers, and soil moisture probes, and the perceptions and actions of case study farmers were recorded during bi-weekly phone surveys.&nbsp; Data derived from our fieldwork have produced a number of valuable insights:</p> <p>&bull; Farmers in St. Elizabeth Parish are experiencing climate change and are particularly sensitive to an increase in climatic variability, which disrupts traditional crop calendars and agricultural practices.&nbsp; During the summers of both 2014 and 2015, the region experienced severe drought (Image 1), allowing us to assess its impact on farmers and to document local adaptation strategies that may increase community resilience in the face of climate change.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; Farmers in this semi-arid region have developed unique cultivation practices and cropping calendars to deal with climate hazards. &nbsp;The wide range of microclimates in this region can affect farmer resilience, with farmers at higher elevations somewhat more protected from the impacts of large-scale drought than lower elevation farmers (Image 3).&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; The prices that farmers receive for their crops are highly volatile, and local marketing and distribution networks are often unreliable, in part because of a reliance on local middle-men, or &lsquo;higglers&rsquo;.&nbsp; Because of Jamaica&rsquo;s small domestic market, most crops experience periods of glut or scarcity, with corresponding price swings.&nbsp; For many farmers, price is a more important consideration than environmental conditions when devising planting strategies, which are typically oriented around trying to &lsquo;catch the crop&rsquo; when the price is high. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; In response to increased uncertainty related to climate, marketing and price, farmers are undertaking ad hoc forms of adaptation.&nbsp; Adaptation measures most often take the form of different crop choices, cultivation practices, water management strategies and marketing and distribution arrangements.</p> <p>&bull; Climate change appears to be making water an increasingly crucial resource.&nbsp; However, the ability of different farmers to access and deploy irrigation systems is highly variable.&nbsp; Larger farmers with greater stores of social and financial capital are often able to acquire water, and thereby time their crop to receive a high price.&nbsp; Smaller, resource-poor farmers are more dependent upon rainfall and tend to plant concurrently, increasing the odds of produce gluts and low prices (Image 2). &nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it appears from our work that climate change may increase the disparities between relatively wealthy and resource-poor farmers.</p> <p>&bull; The difficulties experienced by small farmers, we believe, has led to a sense of fatalism among traditional cultivators.&nbsp; Greater collective organization would seem likely to insulate farmers from some of the climate and price volatility and enhance resilience, but we found that farmers were very autonomous in their decision making and did not have the mindset of cooperation.&nbsp; In fact, some viewed an environmental shock or hazard (e.g., a drought or hurricane) as the best opportunity to catch a high price, indicating that a successful crop was tied to their neighboring farmers&rsquo; failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; Climate change is providing an opening for new models of agriculture, particularly more modern and technologically sophisticated growing methods.&nbsp; Greenhouse cultivation, which has expanded rapidly in the Caribbean in recent years, is one of the more notable example.&nbsp; However, our research suggests that new capital-intensive farming methods may benefit only the wealthiest farmers.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; Through preliminary field work on other islands, we have found that the climate-farmer-market interactions outlined here appear to typify the greater Caribbean.&nbsp; There is a need, therefore, to develop adaptation strategies that are appropriate for, and available to, traditional small farmers across the wider Caribbean region.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; Although the traditional farming model in the Caribbean is somewhat distinctive, results from our research may have important implications for agriculture in the United States.&nbsp; Island nations are bellwether sites for examining the potential impacts of climate change, and the lessons we have learned about the uneven impacts and adaptation strategies employed in the Caribbean may help US policy-makers to ameliorate the potential economic impacts of environmental stress for American farmers, and enhance US food security in an increasingly uncertain growing environment.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Emil&nbsp;J&nbsp;Popke</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1229900/1229900_10207012_1480360523698_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1229900/1229900_10207012_1480360523698_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Drought"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1229900/1229900_10207012_1480360523698_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Drought"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A field of cabbages stressed by drought, summer of 2014.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alex Moulton</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Emil&nbsp;J&nbsp;Popke</div> <div class="imageTitle">Drought</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1229900/1229900_10207012_1479412554538_picture-01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1229900/1229900_10207012_1479412554538_picture-01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Prices"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1229900/1229900_10207012_1479412554538_picture-01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Prices"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tomato prices per pound (dots)as reported by farmers during the study period.
