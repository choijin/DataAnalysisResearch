<AbstractNarration>This multifaceted project, with core partners including Virginia community colleges, the Virginia Space Grant Consortium, and the Virginia Geospatial Extension Program, is supporting the preparation of a regional workforce skilled in geospatial technologies (GST), which enhance the collection, analysis, and interpretation of spatial data. Activities include 1) collaborative development of GST courses, pathways and curricula aligned with the Department of Labor's Geospatial Technology Competency Model, 2) GST program enhancement through intensive faculty professional development and mentoring, 3) creation of courses in advanced GST available to community college students throughout the state, and 4) development of mobile GST applications for education. Partnering community colleges are implementing strategies to increase student enrollment and diversity in GST programs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a growing demand for spatial analysis applications and solutions, fueled by the increasing availability of spatial data and software tools for their analysis. GST is a rapidly expanding industry that cuts across nearly every discipline and sector of the U.S. economy.  The project is directly addressing these advanced technological workforce needs in the Virginia region. Moreover, the updated and innovative GST courses, pathways, and professional development are advancing the field and serving as models for others. Project materials and resources are being shared statewide and nationally through Virginia Community College System and the GeoTech Center web portals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Expanding Geospatial Technician Education Through Virginia&rsquo;s Community Colleges (GeoTEd) project increased the number of trained geospatial technicians working in Virginia and the six-state region and contributed resources and expertise that supported national workforce development efforts in this area. GeoTEd partners included: Virginia Space Grant Consortium (VSGC), Thomas Nelson Community College (TNCC), Southwest Virginia Community Colleges, Virginia Western Community College, the Virginia Community College System (VCCS), and Virginia Tech. This unique NSF-ATE project targeted the six-state region with the development of workforce development programs, pathways, and resources offered at the community college level. Geospatial technology (GST) (includes geographic information systems, global positioning systems, remote sensing and similar technologies) is still an emerging technology, but the integration of these technologies into nearly every employment sector was really just beginning in 2012 when GeoTEd was first awarded. GeoTEd was the third project grant awarded to this team to develop the GST workforce and followed two successful statewide efforts that began in 2007.</p> <p>Given that almost every component of our daily lives has a spatial element, from the location-based services provided by our mobile devices to the provider of our utilities, to the route we take to our workplace or classroom; GST has a broad and cross-cutting impact on nearly every sector of the economy and every education discipline. The project team conducted a DACUM (Developing a Curriculum) panel consisting of working geospatial professionals to identify the duties and tasks for an entry level Geospatial Technician. The final DACUM chart served as the guide for all project components to ensure workforce alignment. &nbsp;</p> <p>GeoTEd developed new courses and pathways that aligned with the DACUM and with the specific workforce needs of employers in each college&rsquo;s region. These pathways served as models and were distributed nationally. GeoTEd provided intensive faculty professional development to faculty including hands-on experience working with real-world geospatial tools, software, and data to solve real problems. Faculty attendees returned to their colleges and integrated GST content reaching hundreds of students. GeoTEd faculty provided mentoring and active support to the attendees and continues to mentor beyond the life of the project.</p> <p>GeoTEd developed online GST courses that were offered through the VCCS Shared Services program allowing one college to offer a course statewide where any student could enroll. &nbsp;GeoTEd also offered a unique service learning course in partnership with NASA Langley Research Center. GeoTEd students and faculty completed field work at NASA Langley to perform a tree inventory and analysis as part of a GST three-credit course. VSGC is still placing GST interns at NASA Langley.</p> <p>GeoTEd faculty created and led a GST Virtual Internship for students as a pilot project. Students took old historic maps from the Williamsburg, Virginia area and digitized them to support the needs of the City. The project established Virtual Internships as a viable option for experience. GeoTEd also created a mobile app which allows visitors to a campus to get walking directions to navigate the campus.</p> <p>Near the end of the project period, the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) emerged as a valuable GST data collection tool. The GeoTEd team researched, developed, and integrated UAS into GST courses and pathways and also developed a pilot service learning course integrating UAS. The students used UAS and GIS to conduct a sea level rise study for NASA Wallops Flight Facility.&nbsp;The students completed four-days of fieldwork where they planned and conducted UAS missions, analyzed data, and prepared a report for NASA assessing the effectiveness of using UAS for sea level rise research and phragmites detection. GeoTEd also developed and offered several high school teacher professional development workshops to further support integration into education. Outreach events such as GIS Day, student-focused hands-on events, and competitions were also supported.</p> <p>The partnering community colleges represented rural and urban areas, and a target area of a six-state region allowed the project to broaden the participation of many groups in GST. GeoTEd completed accomplishments well beyond the stated objectives. This success directly led to the team being awarded another project grant focusing on the UAS technician workforce. GeoTEd trained 45 faculty from six states and an additional 50 high school teachers with intensive, hands-on workshops, mentoring, and follow-up support over three years to increase the geospatial knowledge base of educators. GeoTEd resulted in the implementation of more than 20 new geospatial courses and 12 new pathways. GeoTEd partnered with two NASA Centers to provide new fieldwork courses allowing students to gain hands-on experience. The project has impacted an estimated 10,000 students and hundreds of faculty from nearly every discipline through all the products and outputs of the project. The impact on underrepresented and underserved students was significant and demonstrated that the integration of emerging technologies can be a strong recruitment tool in reaching all populations for careers in STEM.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/19/2017<br>      Modified by: Chris&nbsp;N&nbsp;Carter</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205110/1205110_10217704_1513710579407_2013JUNE_GeoTedInstitute_8912--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205110/1205110_10217704_1513710579407_2013JUNE_GeoTedInstitute_8912--rgov-800width.jpg" title="GeoTEd faculty in the field"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205110/1205110_10217704_1513710579407_2013JUNE_GeoTedInstitute_8912--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="GeoTEd faculty in the field"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">GeoTEd faculty conducting fieldwork at Mountain Lake, Va. as part of the faculty Institute</div> <div class="imageCredit">VSGC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chris&nbsp;N&nbsp;Carter</div> <div class="imageTitle">GeoTEd faculty in the field</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205110/1205110_10217704_1513699771964_DJI_0044--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205110/1205110_10217704_1513699771964_DJI_0044--rgov-800width.jpg" title="drone image"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205110/1205110_10217704_1513699771964_DJI_0044--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="drone image"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Image captured by a drone during a GeoTEd service learning mission</div> <div class="imageCredit">VSGC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chris&nbsp;N&nbsp;Carter</div> <div class="imageTitle">drone image</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205110/1205110_10217704_1513699343349_IMG_1008--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205110/1205110_10217704_1513699343349_IMG_1008--rgov-800width.jpg" title="GeoTEd students at NASA Langley"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205110/1205110_10217704_1513699343349_IMG_1008--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="GeoTEd students at NASA Langley"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Group photo of GeoTEd students following GIS fieldwork at NASA Langley Research Center</div> <div class="imageCredit">VSGC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chris&nbsp;N&nbsp;Carter</div> <div class="imageTitle">GeoTEd students at NASA Langley</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205110/1205110_10217704_1513699543359_NASAWFFstem_uas01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205110/1205110_10217704_1513699543359_NASAWFFstem_uas01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="GeoTEd students at UAS mission at NASA Wallops"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205110/1205110_10217704_1513699543359_NASAWFFstem_uas01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="GeoTEd students at UAS mission at NASA Wallops"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">GeoTEd students, faculty, and NASA personnel preparing for first-ever small UAS autonomous mission at NASA Wallops Flight Facility.
