<AbstractNarration>This grant provides student travel and subsistence for the Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS), which provides an important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study theoretical topics related to programming languages and methods/verification. The students who attend are from a large number of countries. The NSF support ensures participation of US students while paying attention to underrepresented groups. The broader impacts are include building international community and cooperation in foundational research areas, and enhancing education of students with exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers.</AbstractNarration>
