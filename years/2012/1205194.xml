<AbstractNarration>The goal of the Partnership for Education and Research in Materials (PREM) between Jackson State University (JSU) and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is to establish a permanent and collaborative research environment and educational structure in the area of biomaterials science. A well-defined target is to increase recruitment, retention and degree attainment of JSU students-especially in doctoral degree programs. This PREM project will build upon an existing and growing relationship between JSU and the UCSB. One of the most exciting and outstanding features of the PREM is the development of a truly synergistic relationship between Jackson State and UCSB. As a result, the impact of the PREM on the MRL at UCSB and the greater UCSB campus will be as great as the PREM's impact on the developing area of materials research at JSU. The PREM will allow JSU to become a leader in materials research, while at the same time establishing strong educational ties between JSU and UCSB. In terms of human resources, the PREM program will provide an opportunity for the Materials Research Laboratory at UCSB to engage with some of the best minority students in the country and through exposure to the research and teaching environment at UCSB, inspire the students to doctoral degrees in Materials. The materials research objective will focus on the development and application of new materials. Specifically, they will focus on three research subprojects that are characterized by cutting-edge world-class research and a highly collaborative research environment between JSU and UCSB. The mission of this project is to develop: 1) Magnetically/Mechanically-Active Hybrid Biomolecular Gels, 2) Multifunctional Nanostructured Materials, and 3) Theoretical and Experimental Understanding of Biophysicochemical Interactions at the Nanobio Interface.  The research is of fundamental scientific interest as well as a crucial component in the development of state-of-the-art devices and sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critical to the success of this PREM will be the establishment of infrastructure for the education, training and mentoring of minority students and postdoctoral fellows through formal courses, workshops and laboratory rotations. The spectrum of activities planned in this collaboration include the development of a Two-year Masters program at JSU which a strong focus in Materials coupled to a Bridges to the Doctorate at UCSB program. Establishment of a collaborative undergraduate Materials Science Interns program as well as active and hands-on undergraduate and graduate courses to prepare minority students for future generation scientist will also be a major focus. This PREM will also play an important role in the larger framework of the JSU College of Science, Engineering, and Technology by attracting students from School of Engineering and other departments and by promoting inter-departmental collaboration between faculty members.  The PREM will continue its community outreach program, Nanodays, at both the Mississippi Museum of Natural Sciences and the Memphis Zoo.</AbstractNarration>
