<AbstractNarration>Many emerging quantum information technologies require access to some form of quantum entanglement in order to operate. Understanding what is needed and what is possible to achieve with these technologies is frustrated by the large number of types of multiparticle entanglement that could be produced. The role of multiparticle quantum entanglement as a resource and the proliferation of entanglement types with increasing particle numbers motivate a program of classification. A good classification scheme provides a framework for understanding properties of and relationships among quantum states, puts interesting states in a context, and introduces concepts that allow explanation and interpretation of new findings. The goals of this research are to produce such a classification scheme, and to use the resulting knowledge about the structure of quantum states in applications of interest in quantum computation, communication, and cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a framework and a language in which to articulate the needs and resources of quantum information processing tasks, and will therefore be of use to researchers trying to make these tasks a reality. A second broader impact of this project is direct influence on the scientific careers of promising young students. Undergraduates will participate as research assistants who will carry out computational experiments, write computer code to generate examples and test hypotheses, and prove special cases of broad conjectures. Engagement in research teaches the process of intellectual inquiry and discovery in a way that classroom work alone cannot achieve. This project will strengthen the research environment at Lebanon Valley College by supporting students in research activities including presentations at scientific meetings and publications in scientific journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The prospect of harnessing quantum mechanical systems to process information promises spectacular applications. These include encrypted communication with fundamentally new levels of security, computing machines that will outperform existing supercomputers, and improved measurement devices that will probe new physical realms.  Development of these new technologies is the realm of quantum information science (QIS). At the core of QIS theory, properties of quantum states such as entanglement provide resources that enable quantum machines to surpass the classical limitations of existing modern computers and communication devices. Entanglement and other non-local properties are easy to define, but difficult to study. For example, types of entanglement proliferate exponentially with increasing number of particles that make up the quantum system. These considerations motivate the need for a classification program that identifies and quantifies entanglement. Such a program should elucidate structural aspects of the space of entanglement types in a way that leads to understanding why and how particular states serve as resources for applications.       The principal investigators have achieved promising results using mathematical techniques to pursue a study of local symmetry&mdash; operations on individual quantum bits that leave a global state unchanged. Local symmetry detects characteristic properties of quantum states and distinguishes entanglement classes that appear particularly important for known quantum information protocols.         In the course of this project, we have advanced our program of analyzing entanglement via local symmetry with published results on the structure and entanglement types of  symmetric states (these are quantum states that are invariant under exchanges of subsystems) and hypergraph states (hypergraph states show promise for useful applications and simplified engineering for their manipulation). We have also established a multi-party distributed entanglement verification protocol for the important class of Werner states; such protocols will be important for establishing security in future quantum computer networks.        The chief broader impact of this project has been direct influence on the scientific careers of promising young students.  Undergraduates participated as research assistants who carried out computational experiments, wrote computer code to generate examples and test hypotheses, and proved special cases of broad conjectures.  Engagement in research teaches the process of intellectual inquiry and discovery in a way that classroom work alone cannot achieve.  All students presented their work at scientific meetings and four students became co&minus;authors on publications in scientific journals.
