<AbstractNarration>A large body of evidence now indicates that about 80%  of the matter in the universe is of a new type, known as dark matter.  A variety of experimental and observational techniques from high energy physics, astrophysics and  cosmology have been brought to bear on the study of this new type of matter.  But in order to correctly interpret the data from these many different experiments, it is necessary to develop a theoretical framework for understanding dark matter. The PI's work will focus on developing the connection between new theoretical dark matter models and data.  The PI will explore how data from many different experiments can together be used to test non-standard models of dark matter, and how new models of dark matter can be used to explain the data.  A focus will be on the study of isospin-violating dark matter, WIMPless dark matter, asymmetric dark matter, and on the use of neutrino detectors to search for dark matter.  The Broader Impact of this proposal will be the communication of these and other exciting developments at the frontier of fundamental physics to the broader Hawaii community, particularly at the high school level.  The PI's efforts will be focused on participation in the QuarkNet program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Jason Kumar has completed research on Novel Dark Matter Models and Detection Strategies, funded by an NSF CAREER grant.  The search for dark matter, which is thought to compose about 80% of the matter in the Universe, is one of the most rapidly developing topics in high-energy physics.  A variety of current and upcoming experiments are searching for evidence of dark matter interactions, but although intriguing anomalies in the data have been found, dark matter has thus far eluded unambiguous detection.  Over the 5 year award period, Kumar has addressed this problem with a two-pronged approach: he has studied new theoretical models for dark matter which can produce unexpected signals that can potentially explain anomalies in the data, and he has studied new strategies for detecting dark matter.  The broader impact of Kumar's activities has been to introduce high school students in Hawaii to cutting-edge results in high-energy physics research through his participation in the QuarkNet program.  Kumar's work has shown that a new theoretical models for dark matter, including WIMPless dark matter and Isospin-Violating Dark Matter, can provide unexpected signals at direct detection experiments (which look for the effects of dark matter scattering against ordinary matter), indirect detection experiments (which look for the effects of dark matter particles annihilating in the cosmos) and at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (which attempts to create dark matter by colliding together ordinary matter).  This work widens the set of signatures which these experiments can look for as signs of dark matter interactions.   Kumar's work has also demonstrated that neutrino detectors, such as the upcoming DUNE experiment, can use their data in new ways to search for evidence of dark matter interactions.  New MeV-range gamma-ray observatories in development can also play an important role in the search for dark matter, potentially observing unique signatures unavailable to other types of experiments.  This work has helped make the scientific case for further development of these experiments, and may help shape their desgin and analysis strategies.  Kumar's activities with QuarkNet have helped connect Hawaii high school students and teachers with high energy physics.  The focal point of this connection has been a series of Masterclasses, in which high school students have had a chance to perform an analysis of real data from international experiments, in order to get a feel for what frontier research in this field is like.  Kumar has been able to arrange for the participation of professional physicists, from the mainland US and from abroad, in order to help connect Hawaii high school students to the larger international physics community.
