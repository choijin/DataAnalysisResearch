<AbstractNarration>This IRES award entitled U.S.-U.K. IRES: Future Electric Transportation Systems (FETS) at the University of Nottingham, England, U.K.supports international research experiences for U.S. engineering students from Virginia Tech. For each of three years, five students (2 graduate and 3 undergraduate students) will participate in an intensive ten week research experience with two of the University of Nottingham?s internationally recognized research groups:  the Power Electronics, Machines and Control Research Group (PEMC) and the Human Factors Research Group (HFRG). Participants will investigate next generation electrical power systems for environmentally-friendly transport systems and the human factors issues that accompany their use and adoption. &lt;br/&gt;This ten week program will consist of two phases. The first phase will consist of three pre-departure workshops plus three weeks of mentorship and research preparation at Virginia Tech to orient students to the experience and the mentors and faculty they will work with. The second phase will consist of seven weeks at the University of Nottingham engaged in concentrated research with the PEMC or HGRG. Students will focus on three main research areas: power electronic systems in transportation, human factors and the acceptance of electronic drive systems, and the interface of power electronics and human factors. Students will work collaboratively as part of a large team including faculty, Ph.D. students, and postdoctoral research fellows who will act as mentors. &lt;br/&gt;Among the broader impacts of this IRES program are the promotion of international, interdisciplinary research collaborations that foster innovative technical leaders capable of creating and effectively integrating electric transportation systems into our society. As an international research experience for students, the IRES-FETS program promotes and grows international research collaborations between the U.S. and the U.K.; creates natural mentorships in engineering for undergraduate and graduate students; and involves undergraduates in an active research environment with graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty in areas of research with national and international implications for energy and environment. These extensive field research experiences for undergraduates will also help to increase the success of these students in graduate programs in engineering fields.</AbstractNarration>
