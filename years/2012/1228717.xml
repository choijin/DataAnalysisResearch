<AbstractNarration>For nearly 40 years, the United States has faced a critical problem: increasing demand for energy has outstripped the ability of the systems and markets that supply power. Today, a variety of promising new technologies offer a solution to this problem. Clean, renewable power generation, such as solar and wind are increasingly available. Hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles offer greater energy efficiency in transportation. The power grid that manages the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power, however, was designed and constructed in the 1960?s and is ill-suited to handle these emerging energy technologies. Operating the electrical grid using power sources with random and uncertain availability, like solar and wind, requires new sensing and control methods. Widespread use of plug-in/hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) will not only require far greater power capacity, but will also radically change the peak usage profile, with large evening demand that cannot be shifted. To address this problem, our current power grid must be upgraded with a control system that uses the full power of modern sensor and computing technology to increase efficiency. This new power grid, with an integrated, modern IT control plane is commonly referred to as the Smart Grid, which uses distributed control, customer integration and market based control mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is critical to build security features into this Smart Grid from the beginning to ensure fairness, to provide warnings of misuse, to provide control algorithms that minimize damage from malicious behavior, and most importantly, to provide robustness and high-availability of power delivery even in the presence of bad-faith actors. This project develops methods to achieve security in power and market delivery. This entails a study of economic market models with stability as one objective but also in consideration of new sources of power and usage, both on the producer and the consumer sides. To achieve security, the following techniques are used synergistically: vulnerability discovery by formal analysis; on-line monitoring, anomaly and specification-based intrusion detection; and recovery and reconstitution by feedback control.  Unique to this project, it is emphasized that the security enhancements take place at both the market level and the system level, requiring separate state-estimation models. These seemingly disparate domains are unified through mapping functions among the states of the respective models. By integrating the two control models, future Smart Grids can detect and respond to activity, either malicious or caused by natural disturbances, that threaten either level; the unification of the models permits the investigation of attacks that possibly impact both levels. Results of this work would lead to a secure and reliable Smart Grid architecture that is robust in the face of attacks on both the power delivery and market control systems. The inherent cross-disciplinary nature of the research will educate future researchers to be conversant in both cyber-security and associated economic issues, through co-advising between the departments of Computer Science and Economics at both UC Davis and Pennsylvania State University and through course modules developed under this work, again involving both campuses.  Results will be transitioned to partnership with PG&amp;E, SMUD, the West Davis Village, and other utilities in California, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        Purely financial transactions, known as virtual bids, were introduced to allow electricity market participants (including energy traders that do not hold generation assets or serve load) to exploit arbitrage opportunities arising from expected price differences between day-ahead and real-time energy markets, and represent a common feature of wholesale electricity markets. More specifically, virtual demand (supply) bids are financial positions for the purchase (sale) of energy in the day-ahead market, which are settled with a countervailing offer to sell (buy) in the real-time market without the bidder taking title to physical electricity. Virtual bids clear with generation and load bids in the day-ahead market, and may set the day-ahead locational marginal price.           Virtual bids have interactions with other elements of the electricity market design. For instance, they could be used to move day-ahead electricity prices in a direction that enhances the value of financial transmission rights (FTRs), which are financial contracts to hedge against the risk of volatile day- ahead congestion charges due to transmission capacity con- straints between two nodes in the network (a source and a sink). The value of the FTR is proportional to the difference between the day-ahead prices at the two nodes defined in the contract. The possibility that virtual bids may be used strategically to enhance the value of FTRs is discussed in and has come under intense scrutiny in recent years.    A multi-player hypergame model was developed in which virtual bidders who can make good predictions on day-ahead and real-time clearing prices would help converge the prices between these two markets. In one experiment, the DA clearing price in the absence of virtual bidding was about $11.14. After introduced virtual bidding, the average DA market clearing price over the 50 trials was about $11.75, which is closer to the assumed RT market clearing price, $12 (where the RT price is an arbitrarily-chosen value which is different from the clearing price in the absence of virtual bidding). The model developed in this probject is able to accommodate FTRs as an additional source of revenue for the traders, and reflects the fact that a market participant holding a large (and unknown to other players) FTR position would have an incentive to place uneconomic virtual bids to enhance the value of its financial position.           Regulators are confronted with the challenge of distinguishing between competitive market outcomes and unacceptable market behavior that distorts price signals. Therefore, an effective and accurate uneconomic bidding detection mechanism is needed. This project considered two detection mechanisms, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE - in which we first assume a normal-to abnormal change point, then find that point by maximizing the likelihood ratio between change hypothesis  and null hypothesis, next detect whether the real change happened or not according to the metrics associated with the maximized likelihood ratio), and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (in which we build a distribution based on the sample points inside the current sampling window, then calculate the KL divergence of this distribution from the distribution under null hypothesis we acquired priori, and make anomaly detection according to the divergence), and unveil the importance between specificity and sensitivity of the detection mechanism.          Uneconomic bidding is detected by setting a threshold for MLE or KL divergence and an alert if those measurements exceed the threshold. However, a trade-off exists between specificity and sensitivity. A higher threshold leads to a higher specificity and lower sensitivity; conversely. Further, the larger the FTR position is, the more abruptly day-ahead clearing prices would change, and the more easily we can detect the anomaly.       Future work will consider how to correlate specific FTR positions with detected noneconomic bidding patterns. How renewables may be incorporated into electricity markets was studied was also studied in this project, as well as emerging important and growing demand sectors, specifically electric vehicle charging and cloud computing. Future work will also consider related security issues.   Intellectual merits: Detection of noneconomic bidding is a novel problem. In particular, formulation and analsys of the hypergame model of nominal virtual bidding behavior was challenging.   Broader impacts: Securing electricity markets from manipulation will lead to a more robust and affordable power system. Through this project, our computer science graduate students were exposed to cross-disciplinary concepts of economics, security and power systems.
