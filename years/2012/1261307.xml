<AbstractNarration>The workshop on Quantum Information Science in Computer and Natural Sciences is being organized by the Physics Frontier Center at the Joint Quantum Institute of the University of Maryland to help the Computer and Natural Sciences community become aware of the possibilities of developments in Quantum Information Science. This is in connection with the recent program solicitation from the National Science Foundation NSF 12-540 CISE-MPS Interdisciplinary Faculty Program in Quantum Information Science. The workshop plans to have about 65 participants from academic institutions of the United States including 15 speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this workshop stems from the potential to connect people in the computer sciences and other areas of MPS with leading researches in Quantum Information in a favorable environment to foster collaboration, including spending sabbaticals at the QI primary centers in the United States. This will help fulfill the United States National Science and Technology Council report A Federal Vision for Quantum Information Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of this activity include the multiplicative effect that the participants, when returning to their institutions, will have for the expansion of Quantum Information Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The grant NSF 1261307 supported two workshops on Quantum Information Science (QIS) organized by the University of Maryland at College Park. They were: "QIS in Computer and Natural Sciences" in the Fall of 2012 and "Quantum Information and Computer Science" in the Spring of 2014. Intellectual merit: The purpose of the two workshops has been to help the Computer and Natural Sciences community become aware of the possibilities of developments in Quantum Information Science.  The first workshop, organized by the Physics Frontier Center of the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI) at the University of Maryland (UMD) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) aimed to attract computer scientist and other scientists, not currently involved in Quantum Information, to begin research efforts in QIS with the primary goal of creating a few more active research efforts that support Quantum Information Theory.  The second workshop aimed to attract computer scientist, physicists, and cryptographers, including both students and senior scientists. It was organized by the new center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS) at the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS), which is associated with the JQI of UMD and NIST to help the quantum computer science community become aware of the new center, and for the new center to gain information useful in establishing the direction of its programs, and for disseminating recent research advances in quantum information and computer science.  Broader Impacts:  A total of more than 200 participants, coming from government, academia and the private sector listened to talks, presented posters, and enjoyed the possibility of  interacting in this environment. They all became aware of the efforts on Quantum Information Science in the need of future development of the field.
