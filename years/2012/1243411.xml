<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in  the Tenth East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium (ECOAS), to be held at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, on October 6-7, 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be the tenth annual meeting in the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium series. The first meeting in the series was held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, in the fall of 2003, and since then meetings have been held each Fall. The focus of the meetings is on operator algebras and noncommutative geometry, with applications to a wide range of areas from number theory to quantum physics. In addition to facilitating interaction between researchers in the field, the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposia are forums in which young researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the Eastern region of the United States can acquaint themselves with current issues at the forefront of research, present their own work, and interact with senior mathematicians in the field.</AbstractNarration>

The conference allowed the young researchers to network with senior researchers and with one another, thereby helping to foster future collaborations and providing the type of exposure that is often crucial to a successful job search. The knowledge disseminated through the talks and interactions at this conference has far-reaching consequences to several other areas of mathematics, such as harmonic analysis, operator theory, geometric group theory; as well as to several areas of physics, such as quantum mechanics and quantum information theory. The weekend format made it easy for several mathematicians from other fields to also participate, thus increasing the visibility of the field of operator algebras.
