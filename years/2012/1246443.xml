<AbstractNarration>Modern scientific research often involves the marshaling of very large data sets through extensive processing pipelines before usable information can be extracted. Examples of this type of data-intensive research include the near real-time analysis of time-varying medical images, decoding the genetic structure of diverse biological systems, simulating the merger of binary star systems, modeling complex flow structures in chemical reaction tanks, and determining how to effectively interact with extraordinarily high-resolution lunar and planetary data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CADIS project provides the critical networking infrastructure that enables this wide range of data-intensive research activities at Louisiana State University (LSU). CADIS links high-performance computer systems located on campus and at other state and national facilities to a new state-of-the-art building at LSU -- the Louisiana Digital Media Center (LDMC).  Serving as a center for diverse, data-intensive research activities, the LDMC houses high resolution display technologies and custom visualization systems and is dedicated to digital computation, media production, and advanced teaching methods. CADIS enhances student learning experiences by facilitating the use of actual data sets from experimental instruments and large-scale computational simulations, and the classroom application of novel visualization methods. CADIS also is expected to open new opportunities for collaboration between LSU researchers and the growing digital media industry across Louisiana.</AbstractNarration>
