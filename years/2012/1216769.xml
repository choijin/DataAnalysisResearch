<AbstractNarration>Online homework help forums exist, but there is no good way, right now, for students to know whether they are getting good advice or not. The innovations here are to take advantage of the fact that many students participating in online homework forums want to give each other good advice and almost all want to do well on their homework. Taking advantage of participants' want to give good advice, these PIs propose to provide scaffolding that will encourage and aid good explanations of the how-tos and whys of worked-out-problem examples students are sharing. Taking advantage of participants' want to get their own homework right, the PIs propose a simple approach to helping them learn to judge the quality of help they receive. The innovation is quite simple; it includes providing users of a homework site a template for sharing answers and a rating rubric that has them reflect on what made a worked-out answer to a question useful to them. The PIs are carrying out a set of experimental studies in a quasi-authentic homework forum to address several issues: How can we help students judge the quality of solutions that are shared? How can we help sharers present better quality worked examples? There is learning to be had for both kinds of participants. The work builds on research on what makes worked-out examples helpful and on what is known about the value of self-explanations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One way middle school and high school students get help with homework is through online homework forums. The most popular current online homework forums hold repositories of worked-out examples that those needing homework help can use as analogues as they work on their own homework problems. But students who go to these sites for help cannot know if the worked examples they are looking at are done well or not, and simply solving one's own homework problem the way someone else solved an analogous problem does not guarantee learning. This project is developing a way to help students who seek help from these forums to know whether a worked example is done well and to promote the best learning possible from worked examples. The worked-example literature reports that structuring worked examples according to the steps in working them out, the goals being addressed in each step, and the means of addressing each goal promotes learning better than structuring worked examples in other ways or note structuring them at all. This project, therefore, is developing a way to encourage and help those who are entering worked examples to structure their examples so that those seeking to learn will get get the most from their answers. The self-explanation literature suggests that such structuring will also allow those offering worked examples to deepen their understanding and capabilities as they work towards presenting their worked examples to others in an organized way. This project is developing a means of helping those who offer worked examples to structure them for promoting learning and a means of helping those who are using those worked examples to know if a worked example is likely to be trustworthy and learn well from the worked example, and it is investigating the benefits to both those offering examples and those using them of using a structured approach. Eventually, such help could be incorporated into the real-life help forums themselves.</AbstractNarration>

More specifically, we examined two ways in which studentsÆ perceive the quality of help they receive and communicate this information to the helpers.     When using a general rating system (e.g., rating a solution on a 4-point scale), students are not necessarily very discerning regarding the quality of the help they receive in authentic worked example homework help forums.

Drawing from previous research, we chose the number of steps shown in the solution and the detail of an accompanying alternative way of arriving at the final answer as features to investigate.     Confidence  How a student rates the helpfulness of a worked example may well depend on how confident the student is that they can solve similar problems and, conversely, the quality of a worked example may influence the confidence a student has in solving similar problems. Thus, our goal was to explore the relationship between confidence and perception of quality.       Modeling  Finally, how closely a student uses a worked example as a model may serve as an indicator of how the student perceives its quality. For example, if a student appreciates the way a worked example is broken down into steps, then this characteristic may be mimicked in the studentÆs subsequent problem solving attempts. One goal of our project was therefore to explore which features of a quality worked example (e.g., labeling and diagrams) were appropriated by students in their own work on similar problems.      First, our hypothesis regarding the superiority of the multi-dimensional rating system was not substantiated. We were hoping to find that drawing attention to specific features of a solution (e.g., the number of steps it contained) would lead to students providing different overall ratings of quality than students who only provided an overall rating for the quality of a solution.

However, student ratings continued to be high relative to ours. In other words, they were still too generous with their ratings, even on specific solution features.     We were also interested in looking at written feedback and how student comments corresponded to solution quality.  In order to assign each solution an overall quality index, we weighted the two dimensions (level of steps and level of check) equally. We found that both positive and negative feedback are significant and the overall effect is large.
