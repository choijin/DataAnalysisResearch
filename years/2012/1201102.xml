<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to understand and exploit the role of heterogeneities in creating unique fracture properties.  While the study of brittle fracture has a long history, an understanding of the relation between microstructure and overall toughness is incomplete.   Recent work has shown that there are exceptional opportunities to dramatically affect toughness by exploiting well-defined complex heterogeneities.   Specifically, preliminary work suggests that well-designed heterogeneities can dramatically enhance the overall toughness, and introduce a significant asymmetry where the resistance of a crack front propagating from left to right is different from that of a crack front propagating from right to left.  Simultaneously, emerging methods of materials synthesis including digital manufacturing and self-assembly are creating an extraordinary new ability to synthesize materials and components with arbitrarily complex but precise heterogeneities.  The proposed research will build on this by systematically examining critical issues in a series of idealized but increasingly complex configurations.  A range of theoretical, overall characterization and advanced in-situ methods are proposed.   The results of these studies will be used to design and synthesize complex microstructures using rapid prototyping.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the grant will enable the design and synthesis of materials with prescribed toughness as well as fail-safe components where a crack -- if it were to occur -- could either be pinned in traps or be deflected into regions where it causes minimal damage.   This project will train a doctoral student in a highly collaborative setting that combines theory, computation and experiment.  This project will also create research opportunity for an undergraduate student each summer.  The results of the research proposed here will be actively incorporated into the curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of this project is a new definition of the effective toughness of heterogeneous media.  Most materials in nature and in engineering practice are heterogeneous, and the properties we measure at the engineering scale are the result of complex physics at smaler scales.  An important challenge is to predict the overall or effective properties at the engineering scale given the microstructure and properties at smaller scales.  This is well-understood in properties like elastic modulus, but remains open in phenomena like fracture.  This project introduced a notion of `surfing boundary conditions' and used it to provide a robust definition of effective toughness.  It then used this definition to demonstrate computationally that the effective toughness can be quite different from -- and in fact much higher than -- those of the constituent materials.  Thus it provides a pathway for designing new materials with superior toughness while retaining stiffness and strength.  The project also provided numerous insights into adhesive strength.  The broader impact of this project are manifold.  Mechanical properties of materials are critical, and this project provides a pathway for improving mechanical properties.  It provided for the training of one post-doctoral scholar, one graduate student and four undergraduate researchers.  It resulted in six journal publications with others in preparation, as well as one patent application.          Last Modified: 01/01/2016       Submitted by: Kaushik Bhattacharya]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
