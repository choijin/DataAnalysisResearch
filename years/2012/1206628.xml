<AbstractNarration>NSF funds will be used to support (registration and travel) the attendance of junior and early career scientists at the 2012 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar on Research at High Pressure. The biennial GRC brings together world experts and young scientists in a broad range of fields - condensed matter physics, chemistry, engineering, geoscience and biology - to discuss open questions in behaviour of materials at high density, to disseminate the latest theoretical and experimental research results, and to hear of the latest experimental facilities available around the world. For the first time in its 50-year history, the 2012 meeting will have an associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), beginning immediately prior to the GRC, where graduate students and early career scientists can come together in a highly-stimulating environment to discuss their current research, and build informal networks with their peers. To cement the relationship between the GRS and GRC, the four invited discussion leaders at the GRS will give talks at a special first-day GRC session devoted to "Young Investigators". Further sessions will be devoted to high-density hydrogen, new facilities, and new frontiers. The format of the GRC will include formal presentations by experts, followed by extensive time devoted to questions, free-ranging discussions and "brainstorming". A selection of the most exciting poster submissions is made close to the start date of the conference, and the presenters are allocated "Invited Poster" status, and given 5-minute presentations to "advertise" their work. The 2012 GRC will provide an ideal environment for advanced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to present and exchange their latest ideas and results, and to hear and explore the latest theoretical and experimental methods in high-pressure science. Members of underrepresented groups have been recruited as conference speakers to provide role models and potential mentors for the young scientists who will participate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[           The Gordon Research Conference on HIGH PRESSURE, RESEARCH AT      was held at the University of New England, Biddeford, Maine, June 24- 29, 2012. The Conference was well-attended with 137 participants (attendees list attached). The attendees represented the spectrum of endeavor in this field coming from academia, industry, and government laboratories, both U.S. and foreign scientists, senior researchers, young investigators, and students. Of the 137 attendees, 40 voluntarily responded to a general inquiry regarding ethnicity which appears on our registration forms. Of the 40 respondents, 18% were Minorities &ndash; 3% Hispanic, 15% Asian and 0% African American. Approximately 23% of the participants at the 2012 meeting were women.           In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.          Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
