<AbstractNarration>New evidence from early fossil humans suggests that, in some respects, these hominins more closely resembled the earliest fossil apes than any modern ape. While such findings substantially impact our understanding of early hominin adaptive morphology, their precise implications remain unclear because the original ecological conditions in which these features evolved is poorly documented. To address this problem, this project will answer the following three research questions: What are the regional patterns of environmental change and the site-specific habitats associated with the earliest fossil apes? How does the morphology of early apes relate to the environmental contexts in which they lived? How do early ape adaptations inform our understanding of later ape and human evolution? These questions will be answered by establishing a multi-disciplinary, multi-national collaboration to initiate new paleontological field research at all of the early fossil ape localities in East Africa. For the first time, new fossil and data collection will be coordinated across nearly a dozen Kenyan sites near Kisingiri, Tinderet, West Turkana, and Buluk, and a similar number of Ugandan sites at Napak, Moroto, and Bukwa. In addition to surveys and excavation, a series of geological, ecological, and taphonomic analyses will be used to understand the age, environment, and setting of each locality. New fossils will be subjected to rigorous morphological analyses to determine their evolutionary and adaptive significance. Unlike previous studies, which have focused on individual localities, this regional approach to understanding ancient ecosystems will track environmental variations over the time and space of early ape evolution, making it possible to relate specific habitat types with primate adaptive morphology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The origin and early diversification of the ape-human lineage represents a fundamental shift in primate body plans, and is therefore an integral resource for interpreting the later evolution of apes and humans. For decades, most researchers have studied human origins through the lens of modern ape and human characteristics, marginalizing a large and diverse body of evidence from their ancient ape predecessors. This project represents an important and substantive step toward fully integrating our knowledge of living and fossil apes and humans. Moreover, coordinating a project of this breadth - using the same methods and protocols across all of the relevant fossil sites - will allow data to be synthesized on a scale not previously possible, setting new benchmarks for conducting future field projects. This project will thus model a collaborative approach that will be more productive and beneficial to the discipline of paleoanthropology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also generates substantial broader impacts. A critical component of the grant is the training of US and East Africa graduate and US undergraduate students in the discipline of paleoanthropology. The project also includes the National Museums of Kenya as a full collaborative scientific partner in the proposed research. A well-established partnership between University of Michigan, Makerere University and the National Museum (Uganda) will be fostered by this grant, helping to train staff and students in Uganda on field and analytical techniques. Finally, a digital database cataloging all the fossils and data collected from all of the localities will be made freely available after the conclusion of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Certain key features found in humans, such as upright posture, enhanced limb joint mobility, a more specialized diet, more advanced cranial anatomy, large body size and extended development, first appear in fossil apes from Africa ~20 million years ago.  However, there is no clear understanding of why these features first evolved.  This research project was aimed at increasing our understanding of why our earliest known ape relatives first evolved features that later came to be pivotal to the origin of humans.  To do so, our team established a multinational, multidisciplinary collaboration to fully develop a detailed understanding of the ages, environments, ecologies and inter-relationships among all known fossil sites from the Early Miocene (21-17 million years ago) in East Africa (Kenya and Uganda). Importantly, researchers from five different teams in East Africa agreed to visit one another?s sites and share all findings so that results could be standardized, and so that a more complete, regional picture of ape evolution could be gained. This approach generated significant collaborations and intellectual infrastructure, involved National Museums in both Kenya and Uganda, and modeled a new mode of productive and interactive (as opposed to siloed) paleoanthropological research.  The contextual data has enabled us to test hypotheses about the adaptive significance of features relevant to the evolution of later species of apes and, importantly, to the origin of humans.  A major finding of the study is that early ape environments are much more heterogeneous than previously proposed.  This inference is based on analysis of fossil bones, microscopic plant remains, and chemical signatures preserved in ancient soils and in the teeth of the fossil species.  In total, the different geobiochemical, pedogenic, lithofacies and taphonomic approaches indicate that, unlike modern apes, who mostly live in closed canopy forests, Early Miocene apes were living in seasonal woodlands and more open canopy forests with grassland components.  This is surprising because it suggests that some features, such as locomotor agility and upright postures, evolved not in dense forest, but in more open woodland contexts.  In addition, since early apes, unlike modern apes, lived in environments that were more open and seasonal, it broadens our conceptions of what sorts of selection pressures the last common ancestor of apes and humans might have been exposed to.  As the project?s data collection phase concluded, a workshop was held at the National Museums of Kenya, in which the research teams presented their findings to one another and to outside experts so that all new and previously collected fossils and environmental data could be examined and discussed together.  In this way, a consensus on ape evolutionary history in the early Miocene was built.  Eight graduate students and two undergraduates from USA, Uganda and Kenya participated in field research in Uganda, with data from this work being incorporated into their research projects. Faculty and students from Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda and staff from the Uganda National Museum also received support and training through this grant. Researchers and colleagues from the Uganda Museum also erected signposts to protect the sites, and participated in community outreach at the fossil sites to educate local community members about the values of preserving the sites. Twenty-eight scientific papers have been given at scientific conferences, and a digital data base has been established that catalogues all Uganda fossils collected through this project.
