<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to introduce a family of crystal-like metamaterials with adaptively relaxed cell symmetry (ARCS) and demonstrate their applicability as tunable acoustic manipulators. The virtue of ARCS crystals lies in their ability to operate in relatively low-frequency regimes, where the performance of wave management methodologies relying exclusively on phononic bandgaps is compromised. The investigation of the ARCS concept will be conducted using a prototype honeycomb with a periodic population of beam resonators instrumented with patches of piezoelectric material. The cell symmetry is relaxed through the modulation of the local effective stiffness of a selected cluster of resonators, which results in the establishment of a non uniform distribution of effective mechanical properties in the medium. The property tuning is enforced through the activation of appropriate sequences of piezoelectric elements of the activation cluster, according to the desired degree of symmetry relaxation. The investigation will be verified by a set of experiments performed using a 3D scanning laser vibrometer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will provide a strategy to achieve versatile acoustic control devices that are immune to some major drawbacks that affect metamaterials based approaches, such as passivity and drastic frequency limitations. The technological applications that would greatly benefit from the ARCS concept include isolation systems, mechanical filters and directional actuators and sensors. The methodology for laser-enabled wave reconstruction that will be specifically developed for this work will provide new general protocols for the experimental characterization of synthetic structural materials at large. This work will open new avenues for research in energy harvesting, towards the design of fully autonomous wave control devices. It will also provide a platform and implement a plan to realize partnerships with local middle and high schools for thematic projects aimed at promoting science and engineering among children and teenagers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this project, we have explored theoretically and implemented experimentally a body of strategies for vibrations and wave control involving a class of structural materials known as cellular metamaterials (or alternatively cellular phononic crystals or lattice materials). These materials, which consist of periodic networks of thin beam elements, are primarily appealing, from an engineering standpoint, for their lightweight characteristics. Moreover, they are endowed with intrinsic wave manipulation capabilities, which have been the object of substantial research efforts in recent years. These capabilities include mechanical bandgap filtering, i.e., the ability to impede the propagation of excitations characterized by certain frequency contents, and wave directionality, i.e., the ability to channel the energy of a propagating excitation along specific frequency-dependent directions. These characteristics make cellular materials appealing for vibration and sound isolation, acoustic cloaking, seismic shielding and for the design of directional smart actuators and sensors. Our objective has been to devise techniques to endow cellular metamaterials with tunability characteristics, i.e., to turn them from passive systems with a fixed set of properties into re-programmable devices whose dynamic behavior can be actively adjusted and tailored to potentially evolving operating conditions. We have been especially interested in tuning strategies aimed at relaxing the intrinsic directional landscape of these materials, which is typically characterized by high degrees of symmetry, with the objective of arbitrarily energizing (or de-denergizing) selected regions of the material.</p> <p>We have tackled these goals through an approach that leverages electromechanical coupling mechanisms obtained using piezoelectric patches and electric shunts. Our strategies involve i) incorporating piezoelectric patches (i.e., thin wafers of piezoelectric materials) in the lattice domain; ii) connecting the patches to electric circuits to form so-called electric shunts. By &ldquo;shunting&rdquo; the piezo patches, one can de facto modify the effective mechanical properties of the underlying structure, thus indirectly tuning its dynamic response. While the shunting approach has been used before in the context of vibration control for the suppression of vibration modes in beams, here we have systematically investigated the application of this paradigm for the control of elastic waves, both in one-dimensional waveguides and in complex cellular media. We have explored two types of shunts. The first involves so-called negative-capacitance circuits, which allow stiffening or softening selected portions of the structural domain; for this approach, we have demonstrated via simulations that it is possible to obtain pronounced wave beaming and symmetry relaxation in cellular structures at low frequencies. A schematic of this method and snapshots of the wave steering results are reported in Fig. 1. The second strategy involves resistor-inductor (RL) shunts, which allow to realize electromechanical resonators. We have demonstrated that, by tuning the resonators to resonate at prescribed frequencies, it is possible to distill these frequencies from a traveling wave, thereby realizing tunable mechanical filters. We have experimentally realized RL shunts and successfully applied them to 1D structures (Fig. 2), where we have realized broadband filters called rainbow traps, and in lattice materials (Fig. 3), where we have been able to successfully achieve spatial energy control and directivity correction. In parallel, we have explored alternative wave control strategies involving other forms of electromechanical coupling, e.g., using soft and foldable resonant elements made of electroactive polymers.</p> <p>Throughout the life of the project, we have strived to deploy a vigorous outreach plan and, more importantly, to provide a longer lasting contribution in the form of outreach tools to be used in future outreach efforts in the fields of metamaterials. This vision has inspired us to device an experimental platform to conduct tests on metamaterial specimens in a way that allows for easy-to-assemble experiments and easy-to-visualize fruition of the results. We have found out that, through arrangements of Lego<sup>&reg;</sup> bricks on a board, we can realize a variety of metamaterial configurations that are simultaneously cheap, rapid to fabricate and highly reconfigurable. Thanks to its reconfigurability, this platform is ideal for proof of concept experiments, as it allows for agile testing and comparison of multiple configurations. We have used this platform to demonstrate a variety of wave control phenomena (Fig. 4), including demonstrations of rainbow trapping effects, which provided a valuable mechanical counterpart to our work on shunts. We have put the didactic effectiveness of this platform to the test by deploying it in outreach events organized in partnership with a local high school. The outreach initiatives have been carried out as two-day events of lectures, Q&amp;A sessions and hands-on demonstration sessions in which PI, graduate and undergraduate students brought to the school testing equipment and Lego<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;brick specimen and performed a variety of live demonstrations. Finally, the results of our research have been immediately put to use in the classroom, both in the form of new teaching material for a graduate course on wave propagation, as well as in the form of problems and datasets for an undergraduate class on numerical methods.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1266089/1266089_10245298_1498750732737_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1266089/1266089_10245298_1498750732737_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Steering"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1266089/1266089_10245298_1498750732737_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Steering"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Energy steering in microstructured honeycomb lattice with negative capacitance shunts</div> <div class="imageCredit">Steering</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</div> <div class="imageTitle">Steering</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1266089/1266089_10245298_1498750775127_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1266089/1266089_10245298_1498750775127_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Rainbow"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1266089/1266089_10245298_1498750775127_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Rainbow"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Wave control in waveguide with multiple resistive-inductive shunts</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rainbow</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</div> <div class="imageTitle">Rainbow</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1266089/1266089_10245298_1498750863346_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1266089/1266089_10245298_1498750863346_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Directivity"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1266089/1266089_10245298_1498750863346_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Directivity"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Demonstration of directivity correction in 2D lattice material with resistive-inductive shunts</div> <div class="imageCredit">Directivity</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</div> <div class="imageTitle">Directivity</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1266089/1266089_10245298_1498751219260_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1266089/1266089_10245298_1498751219260_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MLogo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1266089/1266089_10245298_1498751219260_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MLogo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bandgap effects in arbitrarily shaped stubbed plate metamaterials</div> <div class="imageCredit">MLogo</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</div> <div class="imageTitle">MLogo</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
