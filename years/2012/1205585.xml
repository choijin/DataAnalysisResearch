<AbstractNarration>Gravitational-wave (GW) searches using LIGO's landmark fifth and sixth science runs have led to major observational results, including astrophysical constraints that have begun to surpass those from electromagnetic or particle observations.  Preparations for the start of the advanced detector era are now eagerly underway, with LIGO, Virgo and GEO600 in a transition period and new interferometers under construction.  These advanced detectors, expected to come on-line starting around 2015, will be ~10 times more sensitive, searching a volume of the Universe ~1000 times larger than at present, virtually guaranteeing the first detection of GWs.  This award supports research in areas that are relevant to LIGO data analysis during this transition period, and that will build the foundation for techniques required in the advanced detector era: (i) searches for a cosmological or astrophysical GW background, (ii) statistical searches for GWs from gamma-ray bursts, (iii) developing new methods to search for GWs from supernovae, and (iv) detector characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project will improve our sensitivity to GW backgrounds using the most recent data from both the LIGO and Virgo detectors.  The second will develop methods to optimally use the information contained in the electromagnetic or particle signature of an astrophysical event (such as gamma-ray data from NASA missions like Swift and Fermi) in GW searches.  The third will explore methods to enhance the sensitivity of searches involving GWs from weak sources like supernovae, and the fourth will look into the detector data to characterize low-frequency non-stationary noise and track possible instrumental artefacts as well.  The graduate students supported by this grant will receive direct training in GW data analysis, thus adding to the growing community of researchers in this field.  Since the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) is an Hispanic serving institution, the research activities will expose students who are traditionally under-represented in the areas of science and technology to forefront scientific research.  On-going major outreach programs at UTB will be able to leverage this research, creating awareness among high-school students about exciting scientific projects such as LIGO.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by extreme events in the universe is expected to revolutionize our understanding of astrophysics and cosmology.  Gravitational waves will give us a picture of the universe complementary to that from traditional electromagnetic astronomy.  Although GWs have not yet been directly detected, with improved detectors like Advanced LIGO starting observation runs before the end of this year, detections should soon become common-place.  NSF grant 1205585 supported the development of new techniques to help in our search for GWs.  Specifically, we worked on projects related to: (i) stochastic GW backgrounds, (ii) gamma-ray bursts, (iii) detection strategies for supernovae, and (iv) tools to better understand the noise produced by the detectors.  (i) A stochastic background of GWs is basically a GW "confusion noise" produced by either a large number of independent and unresolved astrophysical sources, or by GWs left-over from the Big Bang.  The direct detection of a stochastic background of cosmological origin would give us a picture of the universe mere fractions of a second after the Big Bang---a "holy grail" of GW astronomy.  Previous searches for stochastic GWs have been conducted using pairs of physically separated detectors, for which correlated instrumental and/or environmental noise could be safely ignored.  However, for this project, we analyzed data from the two co-located LIGO Hanford detectors, which have a greater sensitivity to stochastic GWs, but which suffer from correlated noise due to the common local environment.  We developed novel noise identification and mitigation techniques that allowed us to address the complications arising from correlated environmental noise, setting a limit on the strength of the GW background almost 200 times better than previous limits in the same frequency band.  (ii) An astrophysical trigger is an event from a non-GW detector (e.g., a gamma-ray burst observed by the Swift or FERMI satellites) that is expected to have a GW counterpart.  Although observing a trigger means that there is a potential GW signal in the data from a GW detector, the signal may not be strong enough to stand out on its own from the detector noise.  To overcome this problem, one can combine GW data associated with multiple triggers to see if there is an excess signal associated with the set of triggers as a whole.  Such an analysis, called a population study, has already been applied to LIGO data for a multi-gamma-ray burst analysis.  For this project, we developed a new approach in which data from both GW and non-GW detectors are optimally combined into one joint analysis.  Several issues with earlier population study methods are addressed systematically and nearly automatically in the new method. The method is computationally intensive and many problems had to be solved before arriving at an algorithm that can be run on high-performance computing facilities in a reasonable time.  (iii) Supernovae in our universe are potential sources of GWs that can be detected in a network of GW detectors like LIGO and Virgo.  Core-collapse supernovae are rare, but the associated gravitational radiation is likely to carry profuse information about the underlying processes driving the supernovae.  Calculations based on analytic models predict GW energies within the detection range of the Advanced LIGO detectors, out to tens of Mpc for certain types of signals.  For supernovae, however, the corresponding distances are much less.  Thus, methods that can improve the sensitivity of searches for GWs from supernovae are desirable, especially in the advanced detector era.  We developed a new analysis pipeline, based on a method of noise reduction, that showed significant improvement in detection statistics.  (iv) The LIGO project is an example of "big science", with the detectors generating raw data at the rate of several gigabytes per week.  With such large data sets, we must reso...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
