<AbstractNarration>Networking research on Internet Quality of Service techniques has resulted in standards that have been widely incorporated into routers. And yet, use of Quality of Service practices is very limited. Internet Service Providers have implemented Quality of Service practices to support their own voice and video services, but do not offer Quality of Service techniques to their subscribers for use by any other Internet applications. Internet Service Providers have not incorporated Quality of Service practices into their agreements with other Internet Service Providers, and hence Quality of Service techniques are not available across the Internet. The limited deployment of Quality of Service practices has ignited vigorous debate over Net Neutrality, one of the most contentious telecommunications public policy issues in decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address the lack of availability of Quality of Service techniques widely across the Internet. It will adopt an interdisciplinary approach that integrates network architecture, economics, and law. The project will have three goals. First, it will create and analyze network architecture and economic models that can give insight into when an Internet Service Provider will choose to offer Quality of Service techniques to application providers other than itself.  Second, it will consider how communications law may affect the development of Quality of Service practices. Third, it will illustrate potential technical and economic arrangements between users, Internet Service Providers, and application-providers that could enable widespread deployment of Quality of Service practices in a manner consistent with new laws regulating traffic management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hoped that the results will encourage the widespread deployment of Quality of Service practices and thus enable further development of novel Internet applications. The research will also encourage interdisciplinary teaching of networking technology, economics, and law through further development of a novel undergraduate course on The Internet and Public Policy. The research, if successful, will inform ISPs and regulators, and potentially improve both the functional character of the Internet and the revenue opportunities of the ISPs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We proposed a model of how an Internet Service Provider (ISP) may set tier prices, tier rates, and network capacity by considering both technical and economic issues.   The complex ISP profit maximization problem can be decomposed by the ISP, where the engineering department sets network capacity, the marketing department sets tier prices, and they jointly set tier rates.  This model may support research that depends on an understanding of tier designs.  We considered a monopoly ISP that maximizes profit by setting tier prices, tier rates, network capacity, data caps, and overage charges.  The ISP will increase the premium tier rate, and decrease the basic tier rate and premium tier price, when data caps are used to maximize profit.  The ISP will set smaller caps and higher overage charges than when caps are used only to ensure that heavy users pay for their usage.  These results may be used by policymakers to address the public policy debate over usage-based pricing and data caps.  We proposed an ISP duopoly competition model.  ISPs will set higher overage charges and lower data caps under profit-maximizing caps than under heavy-users caps.  The DSL ISP is likely to maintain flat rate pricing while the cable ISP can increase profit by shifting to usage-based pricing.  These changes in pricing and tier rates can shift market share from the DSL ISP to the cable ISP.  Light to moderate users are likely to have higher surpluses while moderate to heavy users are likely to have lower surpluses.  This research may be used by policymakers to address the public policy debate over data caps.  We modeled the impact of different quality-of-service (QoS) pricing strategies on the competition between an ISPs? integrated services and an over-the-top (OTT) content provider.  The price for QoS when sold to the OTT content provider may be higher than when sold directly to users.  The broadband provider may charge a higher price for QoS than is social welfare maximizing.  Social welfare may be higher if QoS is sold to users than if it is sold to content providers.  This research may be used by policymakers to address the public policy debate over net neutrality.  We analyzed how data caps may be evaluated under the FCC?s 2015 Open Internet Order.  Data caps intended to recover the cost of heavy usage may qualify as reasonable network management.  A mobile broadband heavy-users cap is likely to satisfy the general conduct rule due to positive effects on consumer choice and on innovation, investment, and broadband deployment.  A fixed broadband heavy-users cap is likely to violate the general conduct rule due to negative effects on consumer choice and on innovation, investment, and broadband deployment.  A mobile broadband profit-maximizing cap might satisfy the general conduct rule, but only if the benefits from increasing broadband provider investment and deployment outweigh the harms from disadvantaging an edge provider?s ability to offer high-volume content and from corresponding reduced edge provider investment and innovation.  A fixed broadband profit-maximizing cap is likely to violate the general conduct rule, due to negative effects on consumer choice, on competition, and on innovation, investment, and broadband deployment.  Finally, data caps whose purpose is to protect incumbent pay-television services are similarly likely to violate the general conduct rule.  This research may be used by policymakers to address the public policy debate over data caps.  We analyzed how zero-rating and associated throttling practices of ISPs may be evaluated under the FCC?s 2015 Open Internet Order.  An associated throttling practice might qualify as reasonable network management, depending on whether it has a primarily technical network management justification, whether application-specific throttling is technically justified and sufficiently tailored, and the amount of control an end user may exercise over the practice.  Application-agnostic zero-rating practices are likely allowed under the general conduct rule if and only if they are reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory.  Class based zero-rating practices would be evaluated by comparing the harm of application-specificity to competitive harms and benefits.  Edge provider-based zero-rating would likely be prohibited due to the amount of application-specificity and anti-competitive effects.  Affiliated zero-rating would likely be allowed if and only if there is a reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory underlying zero-rating practice.  Sponsored data programs would likely be allowed if the price charged is reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory.  Zero-rating of affiliated content would likely be allowed if there is an underlying such sponsored data program and if the price charged to edge providers does not unreasonably exceed the economic net cost to the broadband provider.  In contrast, zero-rating and throttling of video streaming would likely be prohibited under the no-throttling rule, and free mobile Internet access to specific edge providers would likely be prohibited under the general conduct rule.  This research may be used by policymakers to address the public policy debate over zero-rating.       Last Modified: 11/30/2018       Submitted by: Scott Jordan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
