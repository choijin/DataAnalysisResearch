<AbstractNarration>A three-week long summer graduate program on "Algebraic Geometry for Applications" will take place in Georgia Institute of Technology from June 18 to July 6, 2012. The program will focus on Polynomial Optimization and Real Algebraic Geometry, Computer Algebra and Numerical Algebraic Geometry, Tropical Geometry, and their applications. Institute for Mathematics and Applications (IMA) provides funding for IMA participating institutions. The supplemental NSF funding will be used to cover students from non-participating institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Techniques and algorithmic methods from algebraic geometry have been making an impact on applied mathematics and engineering in recent years. With large computations now possible due to the growing power of modern computers and vast availability of computational resources, the applied mathematics community is opening up to the machinery of algebra. This summer program is aimed at preparing the next generation of mathematicians in the area of applied algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information see https://sites.google.com/site/imaaga2012</AbstractNarration>
