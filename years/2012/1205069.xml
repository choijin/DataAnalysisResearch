<AbstractNarration>Space-based observations of the Earth that yield digital data have increased dramatically in recent years and are relevant to a wide range of national and international issues. Advances in data availability and processing software are enabling analysis and application of such observations by Remote Sensing Technicians, an occupational code approved by the U.S. Department of Labor in 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Integrated Geospatial Education and Technology Training: Remote Sensing (iGETT-RS) project represents a collaboration among the National Council for Geographic Education, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the U.S. Geological Survey Remote Sensing Program, the Environmental Systems Research Institute, and ITT Visual Information Solutions. The project is preparing 36 geospatial educators to develop integrated geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing courses, curricula and programs at 32 two-year colleges, two high schools and two universities. During summer institutes and the academic year, faculty are participating in a community of practice to learn remote-sensing science, integrate remote sensing and GIS, and develop teaching skills and programs across diverse STEM disciplines and at diverse institutions. Peer-tested teaching resources are being widely disseminated to other institutions through a project website, further broadening the impact of the project. Project outcomes include industry-relevant training to meet the growing national need for remote-sensing technicians, as well as workforce needs in other high-growth geospatial industries.</AbstractNarration>

The project accomplished this goal by:   providing 18 months of professional development for 34 GIS instructors from 20 states, enabling them to integrate remote sensing with GIS in existing courses and develop new remote sensing courses developing on-line teaching resources designed specifically for technician-level geospatial education     The project was based on several developments that presented a unique opportunity to impact geospatial education.  The cost of remotely sensed data and images was no longer prohibitive for many workforce applications and most educational purposes after 2008, when the results from four decades of Landsat missions became available without cost. Other sources of data and images also soon became more readily accessible.  Analysis of remotely sensed data and images previously required skills typically acquired only by professionals with higher degrees. Beginning in 2010, however, major software advances made it increasingly feasible for technicians to use both data and images in many workforce applications, especially when integrated with GIS.   As a result, the U.S. Department of Labor approved a new Occupational Code for Remote Sensing Technicians as well as a Geospatial Technology Competency Model, which in 2010 identified this job category and described the required competencies.   This would have made two-year colleges well-positioned to address the workforce needs for technical-level remote sensing skills at affordable costs, but for the lack of trained instructors and appropriate educational materials. Addressing these issues was the purpose of the project.   Specific outcomes:  Two cohorts of GIS instructors participated in the project for a period of 18 months.

All of the participants have integrated remote sensing into their courses, and 68 percent had developed or were developing new remote sensing courses within a year of completing the project.   Intellectual Merit  The project advanced knowledge by enabling the participants to teach technician-level students remote sensing skills that were previously taught almost exclusively at higher levels of education. These students will be able to use remotely sensed data and images separately or integrated with GIS in order to address real world issues related to land use and land cover in many different workforce contexts.
