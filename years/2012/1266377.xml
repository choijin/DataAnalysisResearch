<AbstractNarration>University of California-Los Angeles &lt;br/&gt;http://www.cein.ucla.edu/new/index.php&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institutional Partners:&lt;br/&gt;Columbia University &lt;br/&gt;Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;University of Bremen&lt;br/&gt;University of California-Davis&lt;br/&gt;University of California-Riverside &lt;br/&gt;University of California-Santa Barbara&lt;br/&gt;University of New Mexico&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas-El Paso &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award continues funding of a Center to conduct research and education on the interactions of nanomaterials with living systems and with the abiotic environment.  The goals of this Center are to develop a predictive understanding of biological and ecological toxicology for nanomaterials, and of their transport and transformation in the environment.  This Center engages a highly interdisciplinary, multi-institutional team in an integrated research program to determine how the physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials determine their environmental impacts from the cellular scale to that of entire ecosystems.  The research approach promises to be transformative to the science of ecotoxicology by combining high throughput screening assays with computational and physiological modeling to predict impacts at higher levels of biological organization.  The Center will unite the fields of engineering, chemistry, physics, materials science, cell biology, ecology, toxicology, computer modeling, and risk assessment to establish the foundations of a new scientific discipline: environmental nanotoxicology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on nanomaterials and development of nanotechnology is expanding rapidly and producing discoveries that promise to benefit the nation?s economy, and improve our ability to live sustainably on earth.  There is now a critical need to reduce uncertainty about the possible negative consequences of nanomaterials in the environment, while at the same time providing guidelines for their safe design to prevent environmental and toxicological hazards.  This Center addresses this societal need by developing a scientific framework of risk prediction that is paradigm-shifting in its potential to keep pace with the commercial expansion of nanotechnology.  Another impact of the Center will be development of human resources for the academic community, industry and government by training the next generation of nano-scale scientists, engineers, and regulators to anticipate and mitigate potential future environmental hazards of nanotechnology.  Partnerships with other centers will act as powerful portals for the dissemination and integration of research findings to the scientific, educational, and industrial communities, both nationally and internationally.  This Center will contribute to a network of nanotechnology centers that serve the national needs and expand representation and access to this research and knowledge network through programs directed at California colleges serving underrepresented groups.  Outreach activities, including a journalist?scientist communication program, will serve to inform both experts and the public at large about the safety issues surrounding nanotechnology and how to safely produce, use, and dispose of nanomaterials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The UC Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (UC CEIN) was funded with a vision of developing a multidisciplinary approach to conduct research, knowledge acquisition, education, and outreach to ensure the responsible use and safe implementation of nanotechnology in the environment. To carry out its mission, the UC CEIN prioritized the development of environmental decision-making tools that consider the importance of engineered nanomaterial (ENM) physicochemical properties in determining environmental fate, transport, exposure, and hazard generation across a wide spectrum of nano/bio interfaces in cells, bacteria, organisms, communities and ecosystems.

Coupled with our computational analysis tools and fate and transport modeling, this allowed environmental impact analysis of broad material categories, including the use of these data for safety assessment, safer design, and regulatory decision-making. These research activities were combined with educational and outreach programs that inform the public, students, federal and state agencies and policy makers, as well as industrial stakeholders of the impact of the UC CEIN’s research on the safe implementation of nanotechnology in the environment.  Collectively, these activities defined an evidence-based approach to nanotechnology environmental health and safety (nano-EHS) for society.    Specific Center research accomplishments are too vast to summarize here, but the integrated approach the Center adopted to study large numbers of nanomaterial libraries is a key accomplishment in itself.  Researchers vastly expanded understanding of the role of physicochemical properties of ENMs in hazard generation and exposure, and provided the scientific community with tools and capabilities that were not widely available and/or validated previously. Key highlights included: development of predictive toxicological paradigms premised on adverse outcome pathways to assess the potential for biological injury; conduct hazard ranking and tiered risk assessment of several hundred ENMs to guide nano-EHS decision making and inform the scope of the ecological research conducted by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems researchers;   discovery of vital quantitative information on the fate and transport of ENMs and their life cycle implications allowing for the development of methods to measure and estimate exposure concentrations across environmental media (e.g., freshwater, estuaries, coastal planes, wastewater streams, and terrestrial systems); use of fate and transport data to develop experiments to understand potential ENM hazards in the terrestrial and aquatic environments, including how to assess and predict impacts to microbial colonies, to learn how food production and food quality may be impacted by ENMs used in farming and industrial applications, how to mitigate agricultural impacts related to these exposures, and determining the effects of ENMs on sentinel aquatic organisms which can be translated to impacts on vital ecosystems services.   Data generated across the Center informed development of an advanced nanoinformatics modeling platform to provide environmental impact assessment based on classes of nanomaterials; this modeling platform can conduct case studies to elucidate the potential impacts of ENMs based on their physicochemical characteristics under various exposure scenarios.  These publicly available modeling tools utilize machine learning and statistical methods to integrate this vast body of knowledge regarding bio-activity and environmental distribution of ENMs to analyze large quantities of ENM toxicity data to develop sophisticated hazard ranking tools.  The Alternative Testing Strategies (ATS) developed by the UC CEIN have gained recognition among the regulatory and policy communities, and ATS has been widely incorporated into regulatory decision frameworks.   UC CEIN focused on placing our research in a societal context, translating the findings to multiple stakeholder audiences, and engaging in the creation of educational materials that will continue to educate the next generation of nanoscientists and the public.   UC CEIN generated research has been used to engage national and international thought leaders in nano EHS policy and governance.  Our education team had considerable impact on knowledge development and dissemination in the area of Environmental Nanotechnology, designing programs, courses, and teaching materials from the K-12 level to undergraduate and graduate course levels.   The Center’s public programs fostered broad participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences.  By providing a quality interdisciplinary education and career development/mentoring skills to our graduate student and postdoctoral trainees, UC CEIN contributed to  workforce development for nano EHS around the world.  During the renewal period, more than 50 graduate students and postdocs completed their training, many of them accepting postdoctoral or faculty positions in the US and abroad, where they are building on the tools and knowledge generated by the Center, while others have joined the regulatory agencies and industry, where their expertise will help to ensure the safe implementation of nanotechnology.
