<AbstractNarration>University of Washington doctoral candidate Joyce LeCompte-Mastenbrook, supervised by Dr. Stevan Harrell, will undertake research on the relationship between indigenous traditional food movements using public lands and external management of those lands. Advocates for increasing use of traditional foods recognize a strong link between cultural disruption, alienation from the land, contemporary dietary practices, and high rates of metabolic diseases in Native communities. Devolution of decision-making within land management agencies appears to have fostered increasing collaborative and co-management agreements between tribes and public land managers on lands comprising treaty-reserved food gathering areas. The goal of this project is to understand the effects of cross-cultural collaborations between Native communities and land management agencies on the paradigms, policies, and practices of each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will undertake 12 months of research among the Coast Salish tribes of Washington State and the federal land managers responsible for the lands being used by those tribes. The researcher will gather data with a mix of social science methods including participant observation; documentation of Coast Salish indigenous environmental knowledge; formal and informal interviewing; cultural domain analysis; Thematic Apperception Tests;  and analysis of archival records. The research is important because it will contribute to theories of under what circumstances policies that promote cultural diversity are compatible with policies that promote biological diversity. Findings also will fill gaps in the ethnography of the Pacific Northwest Coast peoples. This award also supports cross-cultural collaborations and communication, and the education of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

Today, the harvest and consumption of traditional plant foods like big huckleberry are increasingly recognized as crucial to addressing the many contemporary health problems facing Native communities. Public lands including those managed by the United States Forest Service (USFS) play an increasingly important role in providing these foods, yet throughout the plantÆs range in the Pacific Northwest, forest policy is such that current land management strategies are focused on one kind of biodiversity at the expense of another ("old-growth" v. "early seral"), within the context of a poorly understood historical ecological dynamic and limited funding. Thus, tribal members are concerned about the effects of current land management practices on the productivity and accessibility of big huckleberry.   I conducted field work with two federally recognized tribes and USFS staff in Washington State to better understand factors contributing to tribal members concerns about big huckleberry management, as well as the structural, institutional and epistemological factors that influence the outcomes of projects between each tribe and the USFS. My study focused particularly on barriers to the reintroduction of prescribed burning. While tribal members and some agency staff recognize that intentional burning of huckleberry habitats is a form of "traditional resource management" (TRM) historically practiced by tribes that is essential to the well-being of big huckleberry, prescribed burning for this purpose is rarely realized on public lands, even when there is a stated desire to do so.

The preliminary results of this project point to three broad categories of factors that influenced the outcomes of the two case studies: 1) shifting power dynamics between the USFS and tribes, 2) Specific histories of interaction between the USFS and tribes, and 3) mental models of the historical role of anthropogenic fire as a form of disturbance in west side forests.
