<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to students and other young researchers for travel and accommodation to the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2012 to be held at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, June 26-July 1, 2012.  The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) is held annually and is considered to be the premier conference in Machine Learning.  The students funded via this grant will be selected by a peer review process based on their financial need and alignment of research areas. The student selection process will also take into consideration goals of broadening participation, both to traditionally underrepresented groups and to students whose institutions may have limited machine learning resources. The students will get an opportunity to network with experts in the area and gain valuable insights into the cutting edge of Machine Learning research. These student scholarships are very important for encouraging student participation in this premier conference and for shaping the future of the field as a whole.</AbstractNarration>
