<AbstractNarration>This two year full scale development project builds on a proof of concept EAGER award. The EAGER award resulted in web-based summaries of peer reviewed STEM education research articles for ISE professionals. The project team will make field-requested adjustments to the Relating Research to Practice (RR2P) Web Resource for ISE Professionals; implement two workshops; and produce 200 briefs and 25-30 synthesis papers. The team members will work closely with CAISE regarding selection of research papers and topics of new synthesis papers. CAISE will make available the synthesis papers during convenings, forums, and other events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RR2P will help build capacity across the ISE field by bringing research to ISE educators, administrators, and others in an accessible manner as well as involving ISE practitioners in the process of selecting topics of interest for the briefs and papers and the manner in which content is disseminated. The project deliverables have potential for building capacity across the ISE field in terms of increasing awareness and understanding of research-based discoveries and increasing effectiveness of teaching and learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The Problem and the Opportunity  Because young people spend more than 80% of their waking hours outside of the classroom, their time in structured out-of-school programs (e.g., afterschool, community-based, museums, online gaming) can profoundly shape how they develop and pursue interests in science.  Many leading scientists cite out-of-school experiences as the key driver for generating their lifelong love of science.    The informal science education (ISE) field is comprised of a range of professionals who design and lead such experiences for school-aged children.  These educators, unlike their counterparts in classrooms, have widely varying degrees of professional preparation.  Some have PhDs.  Some were once classroom teachers.  Others are fresh out of college.  Generally, informal science educators are driven by a deep passion for their subject matter (e.g., animal life, astronomy, community-based environmental projects) and for sharing their enthusiasm with others.  A passion for the subject matter is a critical foundation for good teaching, but a lack of formal pedagogical training sometimes means that ISE educators may be less familiar with current educational research that could be relevant to their work.  For example, thereÃ†s a growing body of research examining how science can be taught in ways that more effectively engage girls and students from low-income and ethnic minority communities.  But this research is usually housed in expensive academic databases and is often cloaked in technical language that can make it hard to understand without special training. It thus remains largely inaccessible.     RelatingResearchtoPractice.Org  To address this problem, the Relating Research to Practice project developed a web resource to make current, relevant educational research freely available to educators working in ISE settings.  (The website is used by school and also afterschool educators as well.)  The website contains:  Over 300 Research Briefs, each a 1-2 page summary of a single peer-reviewed research study, highlighting the findings and their relevance to ISE. Over a Dozen Research and Policy Reports that may be important for ISE educators to know about, such as documents synthesizing educational policies or strategies. Ten Research Synthesis Documents to support staff development conversations about research-based findings and implications organized around large themes tied to problems of practice, such as how to support gender equity or how to build relationships between school and out-of-school.     Briefs are written to model how to engage with research with a critical perspective, noting both limitations of the study and possible implications for practice.  Briefs also highlight the theoretical orientation that guided the questions and methods described in the study.  The website is searchable and sortable.  Visitors can create "bookshelves" where they save Research Briefs and Reports they want to return to later.  A monthly email digest alerts users to new content that is loaded.  An external evaluation of the Relating Research to Practice project found that the vast majority of users (89%) rated the website quality highly.  Almost the same number (88%) stated that the resources were clear and accessible, and 79% stated that the resource was valuable to their work.  Users reported that they referenced the website in order to access original studies, to share research findings with colleagues, and to inform their design of project plans and proposals.     Broader Impacts  Over the three years of this project, the Relating Research to Practice website received over 138,000 page views.  Additionally it was integrated into the fieldÃ†s main professional development resource for informal science educators &ndash; informalsci.org, operated by the Center for the Advancement of Informal Science Education.  Furthermore, to support the fieldÃ†s efforts in broadening participation in STEM learning and...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
