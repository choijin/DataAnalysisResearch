<AbstractNarration>This award will support a new collaboration between the principal investigator and researchers from Chile (Diego Salazar and Andres Troncoso, University of Chile) and Spain (Cesar Parcero-Oubina, U. of Santiago de Compostela, Spain) to study irrigation agriculture in pre-colonial Chile.  The highlands of the Atacama Desert were conquered by the Inca in the 15th century to take control of the mineral wealth of the region.  It is hypothesized that the changes in administration and population distribution were accompanied by the reorganization and expansion of irrigation agriculture to provision laborers and other personnel.  It is further suggested that the appropriation of water and the new emphasis on tributary production would have resulted in the reorganization of local communities, as existing economic and social relations were transformed by increasing state control. In order to test these ideas, the international research team will initiate data collection in the Atacama region, including (1) detailed mapping of the study sites and associated fields and canals, with systematic observations of surface artifacts and architecture to detect changes in water management, field systems, and site organization through time, (2) geological survey to assess the geomorphic and hydrological contexts of the canal systems, (3) collection of samples from the canals and fields to test dating techniques, and (4) collection of archaeobotanical samples at both sites to assess the preservation of crops and associated wild plants and to begin their identification. &lt;br/&gt;Participating researchers will bring complementary skills and training to this international and interdisciplinary effort.  The collaborators from Chile and Spain, funded by other sources, will direct the site mapping and study of surface remains.  U.S. scientists will direct the geological reconnaissance and the collection of samples for dating and botanical analysis.  Students from the U.S. and Chile will participate and work together in all stages of the research.&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate how economic decisions made at distant centers of power affect the landscapes and lives of local farmers, particularly where water is a scarce resource.  Archaeology provides a long-term, historical perspective on the relationship between water, land, politics, and society.  The research will also contribute to Inca archaeology and to comparative studies of ancient empires.  The award will catalyze a long-term, international and interdisciplinary collaboration between scholars from Chile, the U.S. and Spain, and their students.  At the University of New Mexico, a Hispanic-Serving Institution with a large enrollment of Hispanic and Native Americans, students will receive training and mentoring opportunities through the project, and will work closely with their international peers.  Research results will be shared with local descendant communities and will be broadly disseminated to the general public and to professional audiences in both English and Spanish.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF support launched an international, collaborative archaeological project with researchers from the United States, Chile, and Spain that investigated agriculture, water management, society and politics in the hyperarid, high-altitude Atacama Desert of northern Chile.  In the study area, beginning around A.D. 1000 farmers built and cultivated stone-walled terraces at the site of Topa&iacute;n that they irrigated with carefully designed canals that carried water from distant springs, enabling them to feed themselves and their families over centuries.   When the Inka conquered this region in circa A.D. 1400, they developed an entirely new area for farming at a site called Paniri.  The presence of foreign pottery and introduced agricultural technologies at Paniri suggest that colonists may have been brought in to farm these fields, whose crops likely fed imperial officials and state workers as well as local residents.  In addition to research at Topa&iacute;n and Paniri, project archaeologists also investigated the site of Turi, an important local settlement that was taken over and reorganized by the Inka.    Project participants also included geologists, soil scientists, botanists, and other specialists in reconstructing ancient environments, to understand how farmers managed crops, soil, and water in this challenging environment.  To date, much of the project?s archaeological research has been based on architecture and artifacts on the surface of the study sites, which are remarkably well preserved and highly visible due to the area?s aridity.  This work has included creating detailed maps and 3D models using low-cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), a technology with that is increasingly being used to document and study ancient sites.  Intellectual Merit:  The collaborative research supported by this grant has demonstrated how ancient Andean farmers turned a marginal, hyperarid desert lands into productive agricultural fields, and how their lives and farming landscapes changed when they were pulled into the Inka Empire.  The results contribute to archaeology and to studies arid land management, and to a broader understanding of the relationship of politics to land use.  Broader Impacts:  The project has contributed to the development of international science in the US.  It provided training opportunities for American students who worked alongside their peers from other countries, laying the groundwork for future international collaborations.  The project results have been widely disseminated through academic and public lectures and publications.  They have also been incorporated into the teaching of the project PI, a researcher at the University of New Mexico, a Hispanic-Serving Institution with a strong tradition of Latin American scholarship.
