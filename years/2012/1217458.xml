<AbstractNarration>This award explores connections between the computational complexity of approximate counting problems and phase transitions in Statistical Physics models.  Recent work implies that the computational complexity of approximately counting weighted independent sets in general graphs undergoes a phase transition that coincides with a classical Statistical Physics phase transition on trees.  PI will explore whether such connections hold in other settings, for example, the well-studied Ising model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another main theme in this research are improved techniques for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which are often used in algorithms for randomly sampling from and approximately counting the size of large sets of combinatorial objects.  This research has applications in a variety of fields which rely on MCMC algorithms, including Statistical Physics and Bayesian inference of phylogeny in Evolutionary Biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is a beautiful connection between phase transitions in statistical physics and the computational complexity of approximate counting problems.  The counting problems of interest correspond to estimating the cardinality of a collection of combinatorial objects of an input graph, such as k-colorings or independent sets.  Results of Weitz (2006) and Sly (2009) established, roughly speaking, a connection between efficient algorithms for approximate counting on a general class of graphs being equivalent to the system on a simple, regular tree having decay of correlations.  In this project we enhanced the intractibility side of the picture, in particular, when the correlations persisted the counting problem is intractable, even to approximate within an exponential factor.  We strengthened this picture for the case of the hard-core gas model corresponding to weighted independent sets and extended it to other models such as colorings.  Our work presented new tools for the analysis of random regular (bipartite) graphs.  In addition, we presented new results for the convergence properties of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms and their connections to statistical physics phase transitions.  This project enhanced connections between theoretical computer science, statistical physics, and discrete mathematics.  The PI co-organized workshops on these broad topics which helped strengthen these interdisciplinary connections.  The project funded the research of a PhD student at Georgia Tech.
