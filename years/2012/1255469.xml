<AbstractNarration>The extragalactic universe is abundant with sources that are associated with the most powerful persistent phenomenon in the universe: accreting supermassive black holes that form Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Numerous AGN launch relativistic twin jets of plasma from the immediate vicinity of their black holes which, when oriented close to the line of sight to the observer, give rise to a class of AGN named blazars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations by the Fermi satellite and ground based imaging Cerenkov telescopes show that many blazars are prodigious sources of gamma-rays at tera-electronvolt (TeV) energies. Their impact on the energetics of the universe, however, has previously been thought to be slim since their luminous output is a minor component of the total radiative power in the universe. However, recent work by the PI and his collaborators suggest that TeV blazars are, in fact, remarkable sources of energy. By studying pair beams (electron-positron pairs that are produced when photons from TeV blazars meet extragalactic background light photons) the PI argues that blazars are the dominant heat source in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at redshifts 2-3. This would have substantial implications for the evolution of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will perform a detailed analysis of the cosmological implications of TeV blazars, which will touch on many different areas of astrophysics: from linear plasma instabilties, to weak turbulence and thermalization, to thermodynamics of the IGM, and to the formation of galaxies and clusters. He will (1) investigate the plasma physics of ultrarelativistic pair beams, (2) set blazar heating in a cosmological context, and (3) explore the implications of his work for the structure formation of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will disseminate his research to a broad audience in numerous ways. First, he will reimagine introductory physics classes at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM), by combining traditional lectures with online video lessons and exercises. He will also work closely with the Astronomy Club at UWM by recruiting undergraduates and high school teachers for semester and summer research projects. Finally, the PI will perform public outreach by producing and giving public lectures through the Astrobreak series at the nearby Manfred Olson planetarium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As part of this grant, we studied the physics and cosmological impact of heating from TeV pair beams from TeV blazars.  TeV blazars are a name given to a class of accreting supermassive black holes that emit radiation at the highest energies seen in the universe.  The photon that they emit are in the trillions of electron volts; hence, the name TeV.  At these energies these photons will hit other photon emitted by stars and produce an electron-positron pair that has enormous kinetic energy.  These pairs end up plowing through the sea of microwave photons left over from the Big Bang (the cosmic microwave background) and kick them up to gamma rays.  Hence, when we observe TeV blazars, we should see a halo of gamma-ray around them.  Thus, it was a great surprise that after over a decade of looking for these halos that they remain undetected.   We suggested that the reason is that these pairs self-excite electic and magnetic fields that drain the energy from the pairs before they can produced gamma rays off the microwave photons.  We studied the physics of this plasma instability and probed the effects of this damping of energy in the thermal history of the universe and its observational consequences.  We have developed an extensive study of this plasma instability and shows that it should robustly work inspite of possible ways by which this instability can be shut off.  We also studied the effect of this heating on observational consequences in the formation of galaxies and the intergalactic medium.  In spite of the power of this heating, which is the dominant form of heating in the present and recent past, it observational effects turn out to be surprisingly muted.    We also developed a innovative way of strengthening STEM instruction in the context of a college lecture course.  Introductory physics is a necessary and important course for students in science and technology.  For instance, future doctors, engineers, chemists, pharmacists, etc must take this class at some point.  These classes have a intimidating reputation and so many people in the STEM pipeline drop out before or after this class.  There is a good reason for this.  Solving physics and math problems is a skill, a skill that can only be hone with good practice.  However, the traditional classroom focus on lectures (watching) rather than solving (doing).  After all, no great athlete became great watching from the stands.  As part of this grant, we have develop a number of online video tutorials that coupled with similarly looking homework provide crucial help and insight to students to learn to solve physics and math problems.  It becomes more of a coach to show students the how of solving problems.  It has been used to great effect at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and it is available to the public at www.physicstips.org.
