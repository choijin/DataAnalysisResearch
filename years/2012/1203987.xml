<AbstractNarration>The award is cover partial travel support to approximately 40 US participants to attend the "IPY 2012: From Knowledge to Action Conference," International Polar Year (IPY) conference to be held in April 2012 in Montreal, Canada. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on results and best practices from the IPY 2007-2008 activities, the conference will bring together over 2,000 Arctic and Antarctic researchers, policy- and decision-makers, and interested parties from academia, industry, non-government, education, Arctic communities, and circumpolar indigenous peoples. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In awarding the travel funds, preference will be given to applicants from under-represented groups, young scientists, and students; those presenting oral and/or posters at the conference; and those that are actively involved in research related to the program theme. Travel support will also be offered to a small number of educators who are actively engaged in presenting information on polar studies in their classrooms. In addition, selection for travel-grant awards will be based on disciplinary balance, geographical location, interest in polar-related activities, a balance of Antarctic and Arctic participation, financial need, and the ability to assume some of the travel costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funds were requested to support US participation in the IPY 2012 From Knowledge to Action Conference held in April 2012.  This IPY Conference featured the latest polar research results from global leaders in Arctic and Antarctic science as the third and final conference of IPY 2007-2008, the "From Knowledge to Action Conference" was held in Montr&eacute;al, Canada from April 22-27, 2012.  A selection committee of three people (Elena Sparrow, Tohru Saito and Larry Hinzman, all from the International Arctic Research Center) evaluated the travel grant applications.  All grant applications were mainly ranked based upon the responses to the following questions.   They are:  1.   Briefly describe your previous activities in polar-regions.  2.  Briefly describe the research/academic activity that you will present with a clear discussion on the relevance to IPY    (Have you already submitted an abstract to the conference?    yes____   no____)  3.  Briefly describe how your participation will benefit the conference. My participation in the workshop will include:  4.  Briefly describe how participation in the conference will benefit you  5.  Briefly describe any special circumstances or other considerations that you would like the selection committee to consider?  Most emphasis was placed upon the responses to 1-4.   Not all people responded to #5, so that question was evaluated secondarily or to determine funding amount.  Highest priority was given to young researchers.  All awardees were active participants in the conference, meaning an abstract must have been submitted to the conference.  We placed highest priority on those who were playing an organizing role in the conference, such as serving as a session convener, but we also applied higher preference to those who stated specific interactions they had scheduled at the meeting already in place.  In addition, selections were made based on disciplinary balance, geographical location, interests in polar related activities, Antarctic/Arctic balance, need, and ability to assume some of the travel costs.   Sixty-four people received travel funds to support their airfare, lodging and registration fees.  There were two undergraduate students, seventeen graduate students, six PhD Candidates, five PhD, seven post docs, fifteen school educators and twelve science professionals who received travel funding.  For some Young researchers and students this was their first large-scale international science conference and the travel funds enabled them to engage in an international conference and learn about the different research fields.  For post docs and PhD students it provided an opportunity to meet their peers in different institutions and fields to start networking to further their research careers.   The teachers and other educators who attended the Polar Teachers Conference as well as the Montreal IPY Science Conference received some research training as they participated in the many different polar science research sessions as well as the education outreach and communication sessions that all included different kinds of research methods used in both conducting and communicating polar science. The educators also participated in the historic formation of the Polar Educators International (PEI) organization, the action item in this "From Knowledge to Action" conference.
