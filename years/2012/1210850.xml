<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this Materials World Network project is to study spectral properties of spin waves in metallic ferromagnetic nanostructures in the presence of pure spin currents from spin Hall effect. For these studies, a series of experiments that employ on-chip ferromagnetic resonance and near-field Brillouin light scattering will be carried out. These measurements will focus on understanding of the effect of geometric confinement on nonlinear spin wave interactions and the effect of spin currents on spin wave dispersion and damping in ferromagnetic nanowires. These phenomena will be studied both experimentally and theoretically, and the research program will foster international collaboration and student exchange between US (UC Irvine) and German (University of Duisburg-Essen and University of Muenster) academic institutions. The fundamental understanding of the effect of pure spin currents on spin waves gained through this program will contribute to innovation in the emerging field of magnonics - a spin based energy efficient processing of information. This project will expose a number of high-school, undergraduate and graduate students to nanoscience and will prepare specialists for the US electronics and magnetic recording industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;When the size of a magnetic material is reduced down to a few millionths of a millimeter, it acquires new scientifically interesting and technologically important properties. For example, familiar electric currents in such materials can create pure magnetic currents that flow perpendicular to the electric currents. Furthermore, magnetic waves in such materials can be used for transmitting and processing information in analogy to the familiar electric signals that carry information in computers and cell phones. The main advantage of the magnetic waves over the electric signals is their low energy compared to the energy of electrons in electric circuits. Thus, circuits that use magnetic waves to carry information and pure magnetic currents to process information should offer significant energy savings desired in mobile electronic devices. The purpose of this Materials World Network project is to understand how pure magnetic currents interact with magnetic waves and to find energy-efficient ways to manipulate magnetic waves with pure magnetic currents. This research will advance our fundamental understanding of magnetism and will enable the development of energy-efficient magnetic circuits. This project will expose a number of high-school, undergraduate and graduate students to nanoscience and will prepare specialists for the US electronics and magnetic recording industries. This research program will also foster international collaboration and student exchange between US (UC Irvine) and German (University of Duisburg-Essen and University of Muenster) academic institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Condensed Matter Physics program and the Office of Special Programs in the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>
