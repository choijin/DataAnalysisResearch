<AbstractNarration>This workshop activity gathers US and India researchers to explore collaboration opportunities in Computational and Data-Enabled Science &amp; Engineering (CDS&amp;E). The overall goal is to eventually establish a virtual institute as a coordinating entity for ongoing research and joint collaborations. The workshop is co-located with the International Conference on High Performance Computing (HiPC) in Bengaluru, India. Intellectual merit and broader impact are noted as in the outcomes that will focus on paths forward for joint research activities and identification of effective models for lasting and powerful collaborative research among US and India.</AbstractNarration>
