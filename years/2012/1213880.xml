<AbstractNarration>Based on the funding from Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program (CSDM) program, Prof. Sivaguru Jayaraman's group at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND will carry out studies pertaining to light induced enantiospecific chiral transfer in solution. Synthesizing chiral compounds with high stereoselectivity during light induced transformations provides an opportunity to develop sustainable strategies with minimal impact on the environment. As part of the investigation the PI will pursue new strategies for stereocontrol in photoreactions to gain a fundamental understanding of interaction of light with matter coupled with an intricate control over molecular reactivity, dynamics and non-bonding interactions to enhance stereoselectivity in the photoproducts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project development plan seamlessly integrates scientific research, educational training, and public outreach. Students involved in the proposed investigations will learn both traditional techniques to characterize and evaluate asymmetric induction during enantiospecific phototransformations and modern spectroscopic methods and characterization techniques to assess excited state reactivity. The PI plans to engage local high school students through the PICNICS (Parents Involvement with Children, Nurturing Intellectual Curiosity in Science) outreach program that he has developed at North Dakota. The aim of the outreach program is to provide a cutting edge research environment to high school students there by encouraging them to look up to science and math as career paths.</AbstractNarration>

These research findings were disseminated in top-tier peer-reviewed chemistry journals. In addition, reviews were written on the topic to highlight the use of atropisomers in chemical systems. Both students and the PI presented findings from the projects in various conferences both nationally and internationally. The findings were well received by the scientific community as evidenced by the awards and recognition given to students who carried out the proposed research and the PI who directed the research program.<strong> </strong>The highly interdisciplinary nature of the completed research projects, enabled students to gain expertise in the fields&rsquo; of<em> </em>chiral photochemistry, photocatalysis and supramolecular photochemistry and to impact other fields such as host-guest (e.g., molecular recognition) and materials science (e.g., use of organized assemblies). The integrated research and training activities facilitated students not only to gain scientific expertise but also achieve professional development. This was achieved through activities that integrated scientific research with the educational goals of teaching, training and learning. The PI&rsquo;s program successfully recruited and supervised students from underrepresented groups (African-American student; US citizen and three female students). Three students completed their doctoral investigation and received their degree during the award period. The program also trained undergraduate students that included students from underrepresented groups. The research program also trained high school students who came to NDSU via the Governor school program.
