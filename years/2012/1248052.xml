<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Transforming Undergraduate Education in STEM Program in the Division of Undergraduate Education and the Discovery Research K12 Program in the Division of Research on Learning in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources; the Geography and Spatial Sciences Program in the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences in the Directorate for Social and Behavioral Sciences; and the Cyberlearning program in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a research program to promote and study effective strategies and habits of mind for understanding complex geospatial data using interactive visualization tools, and to generate and test design strategies for such tools in three contexts: an online data access website, interactive museum exhibit, and social science classrooms. All three research sites will utilize geographic information system (GIS) visualization tools to give learners access to geospatially-referenced historical U. S. Census data for examining changing populations across space and time. These complex data tools are increasingly used in different disciplines and in multiple aspects of everyday life.  However, how learners interact with them is still poorly understood. The three research sites will strategically employ multiple, coordinated research methods, including design-experimentation, machine-learning analyses, multimodal interaction analyses, and grounded-theory generation of hypotheses. The outcomes of these empirical studies, coordinated across three contexts, will be used for iterative generation and evaluation of design strategies to promote effective reasoning with complex data for learners in each of these learning environments.  This project also will build a coherent, interdisciplinary understanding of representational fluency for complex geospatial data across learning contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The merit of this research program derives from its fundamental interdisciplinarity, combining research methods, concepts, and design expertise from Sociology, Computer Science, the Learning Sciences, and GIS design and large-scale implementation, in the service of addressing pressing questions about how people learn with social-scientific data. Because the proposed research does not fit neatly within any single academic discipline, it is an ideal match for the goals of the INSPIRE program. The conceptual and methodological diversity of this project contributes to its potentially transformative nature, as a model for cross-discipline collaboration in transforming status-quo approaches to studying data visualization and the design of learning environments.  The collaborating investigators, as active members of multiple research communities and regular contributors to the work of educational practitioners, are uniquely situated to effectively translate empirical research findings into accessible designs and professional development opportunities across multiple communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed project has the potential to have substantial impact due to the exceptional scale of dissemination currently realized by the Social Explorer project and related installations at the New York Science Museum, as well as the diversity of audiences for design-based research conducted in these three contexts (museum, classroom and web-based learning environments). In addition, the core of the research is the archive of historical U. S. Census data, which is central to research practices across social science disciplines, as well as popular news media, and is also highly relevant to people's understandings of our society.</AbstractNarration>

All three research sites used geographic information system (GIS) visualization tools to give learners access to historical U. S. Census data for examining changing populations across space and time.</p> <p>Our work generated a list of 6 areas of core competence, mapped to learning standards at the secondary and post-secondary levels, that are needed to interpret this type of data: Data Literacies, STEM Inquiry Practices, Representational Fluency, Spatial Reasoning, Statistical Reasoning, and Sociological Reasoning. We found that many overlapping core competencies are needed to make sense of geospatial data via an interactive data visualization tool. For example, in order to make sense of how a minority group&rsquo;s population changed differently in two different cities over time, users need to be able to frame the question as a comparison of two conditions (a STEM Inquiry Practice skill); select the location and scale for viewing the geographical regions (a Spatial Reasoning skill); choose a visualization type that can reveal the desired quantitative information (which requires Data Literacy and Statistical Reasoning Skills); read the representation to make the comparison (a Representational Fluency skill); and link the observed difference to potential population drivers like job availability (a Sociological Reasoning skill). &nbsp;These core competencies were used to shape 23 online curriculum activities shared via <a href="http://americanmigrations.uic.edu/ and http://ammig.gisforhistory.org/">http://americanmigrations.uic.edu/ and http://ammig.gisforhistory.org/</a>, and curricula under development for deployment in courses published by Pearson and Oxford University Press. &nbsp;</p> <p>Inspecting complex data requires learners to make a series of actions &ndash; what we have dubbed &ldquo;interactions-with-data.&rdquo; We applied a form of data mining known as sequential pattern analysis to log files from an online interactive geospatial visualization tool, <em><a href="http://www.socialexplorer.com/">Social Explorer</a></em>, to identify several characteristic interactions-with-data. By viewing interactions-with-data as &ldquo;conversations&rdquo; between the human and the system, we are better positioned to redesign human-data interaction interfaces to make those &ldquo;conversations&rdquo; more efficient and more effective. These findings have directly impacted the design of the <em>Social Explorer</em> interface, and add to the discussion of how log data can be mined to improve education.&nbsp;</p> <div> <p>Learners in social settings don&rsquo;t only have &ldquo;conversations&rdquo; with data &ndash; they also have conversations with each other about data. One arm of this project supported a collaborative human-data interaction exhibit at the New York Hall of Science. For this exhibit, we developed a methodology, Framed Guessability, for designing ways for visitors to manipulate data visualizations using movements of their bodies. We hypothesized that using body-based gestures would better support both visitor-visitor interactions and visitor interactions-with-data. We confirmed that our methodology generated more discoverable control gestures than existing methods. We also found that many of the elicited gestures were rooted in embodied metaphors - like physically moving forward and backward to move the year of the dataset forward and backward in the time &ndash; which implies that designers of interactions-with-data should strategically use embodied metaphors. &nbsp;A subsequent study revealed that the size of the gestures didn&rsquo;t provide any added benefits: visitors manipulating the data via a touch interface gestures did just as well as those making the gestures with their whole bodies, implying that metaphor is more important than kinesthesia. To study the effectiveness of our human-data interaction interfaces, we also developed the Scoring Qualitative Informal Learning Dialogue (SQuILD) method for measuring museum learning talk, which has already been adopted by other projects studying interactive museum exhibits.</p> <p>The results of this work have impacted thousands of learners in classes and in the museum and have impacted nearly a million learners virtually. In the classroom strand, this includes over 100 teachers who have participated in workshops, design teams or research studies; 164 K-12 students who have been participants in research studies, and hundreds more who have been in classrooms enacting related curriculum units; 94 university students who have been research participants, and hundreds more who have been in courses in which the migrations materials were used. More than 500 visitors used the <em>CoCensus</em> exhibit at the New York Hall of Science during data collection for this grant.
