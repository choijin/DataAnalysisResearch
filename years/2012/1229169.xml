<AbstractNarration>The CLEAR-VMI research group seeks support to study the following objectives: (1) development of a low nitrogen genetically enhanced biomass species for use as a reduced nutrient emission alternative energy production fuel source; (2) elemental characterization of low nitrogen biomass species to develop full-scale emission predictions; (3) real-time laboratory and field level emission analysis of enhanced biomass species for determination and validation of reduced atmospheric nitrogen loads; and (4) three-dimensional community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) modeling of measured biomass emissions to quantify resulting nitrogen deposition within the Chesapeake Bay. Also, as an educational component, our group seeks to enhance the professional presentation and communication skills of our student researchers through an added rhetorical development objective. Experiments will involve the development of a genetically modified biomass capable of producing low nitrogen (N) emissions. Through accelerated stem senescence, the CLEAR group proposes to remobilize N to the seeds, creating a more nutritious crop yield for consumption and leaving low N content stems and leaves for use in alternative power and fuel production.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the 2012 - 2013 academic year, our research group utilized the NSF MRI grant to purchase the following instruments to enable the development and implementation of the Clean Energy and Air Resources (CLEAR) lab at Virginia Military Institute:  1. LECO CHNS 628 - Elemental Determinator (CHNSO)  This device characterizes various biomass species prior to thermochemical conversion. Biomass fuel characterizations can predict possible pre-cursor emissions associated with the biomass. Characterizations can also determine the elemental make-up of the biomass for biomass optimization in both development and conversion. A picture of the CHNS-628 purchased is included with this report.  2. Horiba PG-350 Emissions Analyzer  The PG-350 performs real-time measurements of the emissions created during thermochemical conversion of the various forms of biomass. It is important to develop a real-time emissions profile of various biomass in order to follow EPA regulated protocol once pilot scale systems designed in the lab are scaled for production. Also, a real-time emissions profile provides us with details about how our reduced nitrogen biomass is actually performing. A picture of the PG-350 purchased is included with this report.  Project outcomes to date are as follows:   1. The enhancement of graduate- and undergraduate-level education by providing hands-on research experiences involving clean energy production, air quality instruction and biofuel development technologies.   - Multiple experiments as well as in class instruction have taken place surrounding the use of the equipment purchased through this MRI grant. Experiments include - elemental analysis of camelidae manure biomass, elemental analysis of reduced nitrogen soybean for thermochemical biofuel creation and elemental analysis of poultry litter biomass for package plant optimization in central Virginia. All experiments have included emissions analysis.  2. Laboratory scale development of technologies that will provide students the experiences to enhance their professional readiness.  - Students have practiced multiple experimental techniques, and are learning the art of laboratory protocol and professionalism. Students are also working with industry professionals to analyze organic biomass produced through various industrial or agricultural processes.  3. Improved research practices that produce better informed science and engineering graduates, capable of making substantive contributions to sustainable fuel source development and alternative power production.  - Students are constantly learning research etiquette and experimental protocol techniques to better prepare them for a professional career and the professional oath of an engineer (ethics). Experiments have proven successful thus far, providing substantive knowledge to the field of clean energy engineering and air quality.  4. Students who hold a better understanding of the reduction of the negative effects of nitrogen deposition within local estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay.  - Future deposition modeling experiments will provide additional information on the effects of reduced nitrogen biomass on local water bodies affected by those emissions. Preliminary results show favorable conditions for reduced N concentrations in biomass conversion technologies.  5. The development of organic biomass capable of producing less nutrient emissions of nitrogen (N) by remobilizing N to the leaves of the biomass, thus increasing N return to soils for future improved fertility, resulting in a net positive impact to the earth.  - Biomass development has been underway for more than a year now. As the analysis continues, so does the enhancement of the genetically modified, reduced N biomass (soybean).  6. The creation of high quality biomass fuels capable of reduced emissions from both their production and use. Reduced N biomass will reduce current nutrient emission trends, allowing for atmospheric and Bay/estuary/tributary revit...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
