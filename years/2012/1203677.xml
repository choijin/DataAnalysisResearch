<AbstractNarration>This project will generalize an existing two-dimensional computer code to three dimensions.  The generalized code will then be used to attack several significant scientific problems associated with the dynamics of Earth's magnetotail: (1) understanding the dynamics of bursty bulk flows and interchange oscillations; (2) analysis of the ballooning instability in the plasma sheet; (3) assessment of the accuracy with which global codes solve their differential equations; and (4) theoretical estimation of the effect of a cross-tail directed magnetic guide-field on plasma motion that results from patchy magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail. The project will provide better quantitative understanding of Pi2 oscillations, which accompany both substorms and bursty bulk flows, and of other oscillations that appear in MHD simulations. It will provide an alternative computational picture of the ballooning instability, providing insight into its nonlinear development. It will enable rigorous testing of the accuracy with which large-scale 3D codes, which are used widely in magnetospheric physics, solve their differential equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the topic of the evolution of plasma flows in the magnetotail during magnetic substorms.  The project will support a graduate student, who will be given the opportunity to personally develop, code, and apply a new computer code to address a set of scientific questions.  At the end of the project, the resulting code will be made available for use by members of the broader space physics community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             This report is intended to outline the progress and outcome of development for the Thin Filament Code (TFC). The TFC is a multi-purpose executable that performs thin filament simulations on a set of background data that represents a magnetospheric configuration in 2D.  Simulations are performed in sets called parameter sweeps that vary one or more input parameters over a specified range.  The executable can perform an automated sweep over one float parameter during a single runtime execution.  The executable includes command line inputs and an extensible configuration file format giving a high level of versatility.  The command line features include input parameters, file directory options, and initialization file inputs that can be used for model coupling and scheduling of large sets of runs.  Simulations performed in a given set are independent of one another.              The TFC includes several other models for building background configurations.  At the time of writing, various empirically-based Tsyganenko magnetic field models are included.   The code also includes and empirical density model along with the The Global Core Plasmasphere Model v2.4  is also included as a density model of the inner magnetosphere.  Additional models can easily be linked in and used with the code provided that the source code is available for the TFC.  In order to run accurate simulations on background data the magnetic field and plasma pressure must be in force balance.  A 2D version of the Magneto-Friction code equilibrium code  is included that will automatically process and apply the force balance condition to the background data set.  This allows parameter sweeps over background field configurations.   In order to use the product, contact Aaron Schutza at ams7@rice.edu for binary files built from source provided you have a Unix compliant shell.  A user manual is also available. Using the product on MS Windows can be achieved through emulation using Cygwin or through a virtual machine.  In the coming months Windows 10 will have a fully featured subsystem for linux that gives fill compatibility with no performance compromises.
