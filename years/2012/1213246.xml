<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Huw M. Davies of the Department of Chemistry at Emory University will explore the development of new synthetic methods using donor/acceptor carbenoids as the key intermediates. While rhodium catalysts are well established for this type of chemistry, this study will define the new synthetic opportunities that exist when silver and gold are used as catalysts. The project will also expand the range of viable donor groups that can be employed in this chemistry with a particular emphasis on the stereoselective synthesis of novel amino acids. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The new synthetic methodologies developed during these studies could become enabling technologies that will impact other fields of science such as pharmaceutical and materials science. The program will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as the key reactions can be conducted with extremely low catalyst loadings and nitrogen gas is the only by-product.  In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major research activities involved experimental organic synthesis laboratory work directed towards developing new methods of synthesis.  New practical synthetic methods in organic synthesis have the potential to have a broad impact on many industries, such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and smart materials.  The methods developed in this project are catalytic and control the three dimensional shape of the resulting products, resulting in the conversion of readily available starting materials to products with much greater synthetic complexity.  This research program is directed towards the development of two new synthetic methodologies related to donor/acceptor carbenoids. The first project was directed towards the use of triazoles to expand the range of available donor/acceptor carbenoids.  The second project was directed towards the use of silver and gold catalysts to develop new types of reactions that were not possible using the more conventional rhodium-catalyzed processes. During the course of this research program, two book chapters, one review and eleven peer-reviewed research papers were published, six of which were published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Seven of the papers have already been cited over 50 times and three have been cited over 100 times (as of October 1, 2016).  Five of the papers are ranked as "highly cited" by Science Citation Index. The research environment is ideal for students interested in research careers in the pharmaceutical industry, and three of the students involved in the projects have completed their doctorates and are now working in the pharmaceutical industry.
