<AbstractNarration>Discovering how genomes change as populations diverge is essential to understanding how species arise. When populations begin to diverge most of their genomes will often remain very similar, except for those regions that are responsible for adaptive differences between the populations. As populations become increasingly isolated from each other during the speciation process, their genomes also become increasingly different from each other, particularly at regions that underlie adaptive or reproductive differences between the populations. Yet researchers know little about how, why, and where differences actually accumulate across the genome. This collaborative project will leverage recent advances in genome sequencing technology and the frequent hybridization between divergent races and species of Heliconius butterflies to assemble a moving picture of how genomes change over time and test specific hypotheses about what causes genomes to change in certain ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide one of the most comprehensive examinations of the genomic consequences of speciation. With this knowledge, researchers will begin to understand the type of genetic changes that lead to the origin of new species. The use of cutting edge genome sequencing technology, along with the expertise of the collaborative research team, will lead to the development of new analytical tools and methods that will be broadly useful to scientific community. Training and outreach workshops will provide unique opportunities for students, teachers, and researchers to gain hands-on experience in how genomics can be used to study the amazing diversity found in nature.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Understanding how new species and traits arise in nature is of fundamental importance to evolutionary biology. We leverage the amazing diversity on <em>Heliconius</em> butterfly wings and genome sequencing to identify narrow genomic regions responsible for major differences in wing coloration. Through a massive, international collaborative effort we sequenced over 100 <em>Heliconius</em> genomes and reconstructed the history of color pattern evolution of one of most iconic modern adaptive radiations. A deeper look into patterns of divergence across these genomes revealed that these regions controlling color patterns, as well as sex chromosomes, were playing a large role in drign species differences. However, across the rest of the butterfly genomes, we found that genetic differences between races or species were simply associated with how often they hybridized. Through these data we were able to reconstruct how and why the genomes of <em>Heliconius</em> butterflies across South and Central America diverged over millions of years. These findings will serve as a textbook example of the type of genetic changes that underlie the origin of novel adaptive traits and new species in natural populations.</p> <p>Through this research, several undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs and faculty members improved and developed a broad range of skills in evolutionary genetics and computational biology. Through workshops, we introduced population genomic techniques to researchers across the life sciences. Through international collaborations and the University of Puerto Rico, the project successfully recruited and trained several latin undergraduate and graduate students to promote diversity in biological sciences. And through &ldquo;Butterfly Roadshow&rdquo; outreach events we captivated the interest elementary students in effort to recruit the next generation of STEM researchers. Collectively, the outreach and education activities for this project reached a broad audience that will leave a long lasting impact on the students and researchers of Mississippi and Puerto Rico.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/22/2017<br>      Modified by: Brian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Counterman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257839/1257839_10235441_1498101162479_6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257839/1257839_10235441_1498101162479_6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Postman Heliconius"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257839/1257839_10235441_1498101162479_6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Postman Heliconius"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">"Postman" or "red banded color pattern of Heliconius</div> <div class="imageCredit">Riccardo Papa</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Counterman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Postman Heliconius</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257839/1257839_10235441_1498101054475_8--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257839/1257839_10235441_1498101054475_8--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Rayed Heliconius"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257839/1257839_10235441_1498101054475_8--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Rayed Heliconius"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">"Rayed" color pattern of Heliconius</div> <div class="imageCredit">Riccardo Papa</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Counterman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Rayed Heliconius</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257839/1257839_10235441_1498100953278_5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257839/1257839_10235441_1498100953278_5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Heliconius"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257839/1257839_10235441_1498100953278_5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Heliconius"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Looking into the eyes of a butterfly.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Riccardo Papa</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Counterman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Heliconius</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257839/1257839_10235441_1498101325410_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257839/1257839_10235441_1498101325410_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Genome wide divergence"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257839/1257839_10235441_1498101325410_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Genome wide divergence"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Plots of genomic divergence between hybridizing races and species of Heliconius.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Steven Van Belleghem</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Counterman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Genome wide divergence</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
