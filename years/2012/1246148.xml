<AbstractNarration>1245659/Petrenko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to use the Taylor Glacier, Antarctica, ablation zone to collect ice samples for a range of paleoenvironmental studies. A record of carbon-14 of atmospheric methane (14CH4) will be obtained for the last deglaciation and the Early Holocene, together with a supporting record of CH4 stable isotopes. In-situ cosmogenic 14C content and partitioning of 14C between different species (14CH4, C-14 carbon monoxide (14CO) and C-14 carbon dioxide (14CO2)) will be determined with unprecedented precision in ice from the surface down to ~67 m. Further age-mapping of the ablating ice stratigraphy will take place using a combination of CH4, CO2, &amp;#948;18O of oxygen gas and H2O stable isotopes. High precision, high-resolution records of CO2, &amp;#948;13C of CO2, nitrous oxide (N2O) and N2O isotopes will be obtained for the last deglaciation and intervals during the last glacial period. The potential of 14CO2 and Krypton-81 (81Kr) as absolute dating tools for glacial ice will be investigated. The intellectual merit of proposed work includes the fact that the response of natural methane sources to continuing global warming is uncertain, and available evidence is insufficient to rule out the possibility of catastrophic releases from large 14C-depleted reservoirs such as CH4 clathrates and permafrost. The proposed paleoatmospheric 14CH4 record will improve our understanding of the possible magnitude and timing of CH4 release from these reservoirs during a large climatic warming. A thorough understanding of in-situ cosmogenic 14C in glacial ice (production rates by different mechanisms and partitioning between species) is currently lacking. Such an understanding will likely enable the use of in-situ 14CO in ice at accumulation sites as a reliable, uncomplicated tracer of the past cosmic ray flux and possibly past solar activity, as well as the use of 14CO2 at both ice accumulation and ice ablation sites as an absolute dating tool. Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the natural carbon cycle, as well as in its responses to global climate change. The proposed high-resolution, high-precision records of &amp;#948;13C of CO2 would provide new information on carbon cycle changes both during times of rising CO2 in a warming climate and falling CO2 in a cooling climate. N2O is an important greenhouse gas that increased by ~30% during the last deglaciation. The causes of this increase are still largely uncertain, and the proposed high-precision record of N2O concentration and isotopes would provide further insights into N2O source changes in a warming world. The broader impacts of proposed work include an improvement in our understanding of the response of these greenhouse gas budgets to global warming and inform societally important model projections of future climate change. The continued age-mapping of Taylor Glacier ablation ice will add value to this high-quality, easily accessible archive of natural environmental variability. Establishing 14CO as a robust new tracer for past cosmic ray flux would inform paleoclimate studies and constitute a valuable contribution to the study of the societally important issue of climate change. The proposed work will contribute to the development of new laboratory and field analytical systems. The data from the study will be made available to the scientific community and the broad public through the NSIDC and NOAA Paleoclimatology data centers. 1 graduate student each will be trained at UR, OSU and SIO, and the work will contribute to the training of a postdoc at OSU. 3 UR undergraduates will be involved in fieldwork and research. The work will support a new, junior UR faculty member, Petrenko. All PIs have a strong history of and commitment to scientific outreach in the forms of media interviews, participation in filming of field projects, as well as speaking to schools and the public about their research, and will continue these activities as part of the proposed work.  This award has field work in Antarctica.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project developed Taylor Glacier, Antarctica, as an archive of ancient ice for studies requiring larger volumes of old ice than can be obtained from conventional ice cores.&nbsp; At Taylor Glacier, ice covering the last 150,000 years is found at the surface, because of the gradual sublimation and melting of the ice as it makes its way down into Taylor Valley.&nbsp; This unique attribute makes it possible to sample thousands of kilograms of ice easily and quickly at the surface of the glacier.&nbsp; In order to map the pattern of ages across the glacier, a "horizontal ice core" was cut with chainsaws into the surface at a depth of about 1 m, and several thousand spot samples from 4 m depth were taken.&nbsp; These samples were analyzed for atmospheric gases and for dust content to obtain the age of the ice.&nbsp;&nbsp; The resulting age map, really a sort of geological map, was then used to take thousands of kilograms of ice for carbon-14 measurements, in collaboration with Dr. Vasilii Petrenko of the University of Rochester.&nbsp; These carbon-14 measurements revealed that atmospheric methane did not come from ice-like deposits of methane known as methane hydrates, during a period at the end of the last ice age (11,600 years ago) when atmospheric methane concentration shot up by 50% in less than a century.&nbsp; This is an important finding, because it shows that methane hydrates are unlikely to contribute to atmospheric methane concentrations in the future, as humans continue to warm the planet.&nbsp; This is "good news", in the sense that this finding indicates that we don't have to worry about a "methane explosion" coming from permafrost and deep-sea sediments as the world warms, which was previously a concern (methane is a potent greenhouse gas and would warm the world even more than it already is warming).&nbsp; The likely explanation for why this methane hydrate did not make it to the atmosphere, even though it did probably melt, is that the methane got consumed by microbes in soil before it ever made it out of the soil to the atmosphere.&nbsp; These methane-eating microbes are abundant in aerated soils worldwide and are apparently very efficient scavengers of methane!</p> <p>A second major outcome of this project was the deduction of the temperature of the ocean during the last interglacial period 125,000 years ago.&nbsp; Ice of this age is found down near the snout of Taylor Glacier, and we took large-volume ice samples from this area back to the laboratory, for measurement of the noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon.&nbsp; These atmospheric gases serve as a kind of "thermometer" for the ocean, because of the fact that krypton and xenon dissolve in the ocean, and they are more soluble in cold water than warm water.&nbsp; These noble gases don't have any significant sources or sinks to the ocean-atmosphere system, so the total number of noble gas atoms in the ocean-atmosphere system is constant over time.&nbsp; Therefore, a warming of the ocean must cause an outgassing and an increase in the atmospheric gas abundance that is precisely related to the increase in ocean temperature.&nbsp; This second project is the PhD thesis of Sarah Shackleton.&nbsp; She found that the temperature of the ocean was about 1-2 degrees C warmer than present during the hottest part of the last interglacial period, about 128,000 years ago.&nbsp; This is a time when sea level was about 6-9 m higher than present, and when the planet was 2-3 degrees C warmer than present, so it is often thought of as an analog for where we are headed in coming centuries.&nbsp; These findings indicate that the much higher sea level of that time cannot have been due to thermal expansion of seawater, because the temperature was only slightly warmer than today.&nbsp; Therefore, the increase in sea level must have been caused instead by melting of land-based glaciers.&nbsp; In general terms, this finding reinforces other findings that glaciers will melt in coming centuries, causing sea level rise that has the potential to impact cities, harbors, low-lying island nations, and much more.</p> <p>The broader impacts of this project included the education of one doctoral student, Sarah Shackleton, and the providing of useful scientific evidence to society concerning the possible consequences of future global warming.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/28/2017<br>      Modified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;P&nbsp;Severinghaus</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246148/1246148_10264638_1514510731163_VasTGphoto--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246148/1246148_10264638_1514510731163_VasTGphoto--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Loading ice cores"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246148/1246148_10264638_1514510731163_VasTGphoto--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Loading ice cores"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image shows our ice melting procedure for gas extraction at Taylor Glacier, Antarctica.
