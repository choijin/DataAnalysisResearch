<AbstractNarration>University of Minnesota proposes to support technical services on R/V Blue Heron, an 86? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated by the UM Duluth Large Lakes Observatory as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  They request support for basic services only. They will provide one technician on each lake-going research project of R/V Blue Heron to support lacustrine research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. All users (or the appropriate funding agencies) share support for basic technical services on the vessel equally, with NSF paying a share of technical support costs based on fractional usage of the vessel during the year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project 'Oceanographic Technical Support, R/V Blue Heron 2012-2014' (OCE 1219153) provided technical support for 12 NSF funded research projects that used the University of Minnesota's research vessel, the R/V Blue Heron, for projects on the North American Great Lakes.  These projects ranged in subject from studying decreasing ice on Lake Superior, the fate of nitrate in the Great Lake system, and the impact of currents on Lakes Michigan and Superior, to testing experimental equipment and training the next generation of scientists.     The R/V Blue Heron is an 85' former fishing trawler that is outfitted with state-of-the-art research equipment.  She is a member of the U.S academic research fleet's umbrella organization - UNOLS (University National Oceanographic Laboratory System) - and is the only member of UNOLS on the Great Lakes.  The vessel not only supports NSF funded projects but also projects funded by NOAA, the state of Minnesota and the University of Minnesota.  The vessel primarily works with researchers in biology, chemistry, geology and physics but also works with educators to ensure that undergraduate and graduate students get a first-hand appreciation of field work on large bodies of water.     As a result of the work undertaken on the R/V Blue Heron, researchers have published their findings in at least 40 peer-reviewed articles.  Their work has been presented in talks and on posters in numerous professional meetings.  Funds from this award have ensured that the marine technical staff of the vessel is well trained and that the scientific equipment on board the ship is maintained at the high level that is expected for scientific equipment in the academic research fleet.     Over 5,000 post secondary, secondary and elementary students, and members of the community have toured the vessel as part of our Science on Deck events or other dock-side tours during the period of this award.  These events ensure that members of the public have a better understanding of the R/V Blue Heron and the work that researchers funded by NSF do onboard the vessel.  Additionally, numerous T.V. and radio segments as well as print articles have been published during the last six years about work done on the R/V Blue Heron.  We feel that this outreach is important part of our mission.            Last Modified: 11/15/2018       Submitted by: Richard D Ricketts]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
