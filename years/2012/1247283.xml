<AbstractNarration>This project proposes to develop and study an intervention with 9th and 4th graders, with the goal of promoting motivation for science learning. The research is based on theories of growth vs. fixed mindsets. The interventions focus on promoting growth mindsets in students regarding science learning, with units on brain plasticity (the brain changes as a result of effort and experience) and scientists' struggle stories (science is not just done with little effort by geniuses). Delivery of the information will be through multi-media materials.  The research design involves random assignment of students within classroom to treatment and control conditions to assess the potential impact of the interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the U.S. trailing many countries in science literacy, understanding both the psychological obstacles to better performance and pedagogical solutions to these obstacles is of the utmost importance to ensuring improved science outcomes.  This research will address this issue by developing and systematically testing interventions available to educators to support science learning in the classroom that focuses on changing children's beliefs about what success in science requires (effort vs being innately gifted).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project demonstrates that exposure to scientist struggle stories can promote academic achievement and persistence in science. These benefits can be garnered even when classroom teachers implement the intervention. This has important educational implications because it shows that we are on our way towards developing intervention materials that can create positive effects without researchers needing to be involved. Some of the project findings also led to less endorsement of the belief that scientists must be exceptionally talented and a greater endorsement of the belief that scientists need to work hard in order to become successful. Given prior research suggesting that these patterns of beliefs are associated with more adaptive outcomes, these findings are important. These findings provide both theoretical insight and important future directions for research. Some of the results in this research confirm that the intervention used produced a positive effect on beliefs that struggle is a necessary component of scientists? achievement. With this confirmation at the forefront, the Education for Persistence and Innovation Center at Columbia University?s Teachers College was launched as a direct result of the research that was synthesized throughout this 5-year NSF grant. With the intent of continuing the research and developing instructional material, EPIC aims to further this line of research into the effects certain beliefs have on students? motivation to persist and achieve in STEM fields.
