<AbstractNarration>This project involves high school, two-year college, business and industry, and 4-year university educator partners in developing a mathematics course for high school seniors with the overarching goal of improving student readiness for technical degree programs. Ongoing activities include intensive math teacher professional development workshops, and seminars and learning communities to insure implementation of the course. Partner high schools are committed to incorporating this course into their offerings and actively recruiting appropriate students for it.  The course aligns with Common Core State Standards1 and Ohio's Mathematical Expectations for College Readiness and features a focus on actively engaging students in gathering, representing, analyzing, and interpreting data through activities that emphasize application of mathematics in STEM fields.  The project learns from, builds upon, and expands upon a similar approach, the Skills Gap program,  supported some years ago by the state of Ohio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Technologies, including graphing calculators, sensors, interfaces, and computer software, are extending students' abilities to gather and analyze data. The course is collaboratively designed by a group of STEM faculty, resource teachers, and first cohort teachers (to include former "Skills Gap" teachers) with input from business and industry.  The high school teachers involved are participating in intensive and sustained professional development, including a two-week summer institute prior to implementation and ongoing monthly workshops during implementation. Teachers are learning: mathematical concepts by applying mathematics in STEM contexts; pedagogical strategies that enhance critical thinking and problem solving skills; effective use of technologies in teaching mathematics; and an array of assessment strategies including performance-based assessments.   Anticipated outcomes include: improved high school student and teacher understanding of mathematical applications in technical fields; enhanced high school mathematics teacher pedagogical practice; recruitment of students into technical programs; and decreased numbers of students requiring remediation in college mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: A professional learning community of participating teachers and project faculty is being formed and teacher awareness of STEM technical careers and resources available for improving STEM teaching and learning is being enhanced.  It is anticipated that at least 24 high schools with 40-48 teachers will participate in the project serving at least 1,200 students during the funding period.  Overall results are being disseminated through secondary and two-year college mathematics professional associations  the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), and the Ohio state affiliate of AMATYC (OhioMATYC).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             Since 2013, this project has impacted mathematics learning of over 1600 high school students through curriculum development and professional development of 55 high school math teachers, as well as college student learning through professional development of 16 college math faculty. The main project activities of mathematical modeling, curriculum development and implementation, and teacher and faculty professional development have resulted in enhanced knowledge of mathematics and mathematical modeling for teachers, faculty, and their students through implementation of project curricula and teaching practices.     A main goal of the project was to enhance high school math learning through curriculum and course development and teacher professional development in order to better prepare students for college level mathematics.  The project-developed senior math course "Math Modeling in STEM" is aligned with Common Core State Standards and standards for College Readiness. The developed "experimental" math modeling activities actively engage students in applications of mathematics that involve designing experiments; gathering, representing, analyzing, and interpreting data; and creating and evaluating math models. Technologies, including graphing calculators and data-gathering sensors, extend students? abilities to gather and analyze data in constructing math models.  About 40 mathematical modeling activities were developed for the course, many using data-gathering probes and most utilizing graphing calculators.  Online resources were utilized to address differences in students? mathematics proficiencies.     The senior course was run in 19 predominantly rural school districts, involving 37 teachers in intensive, substantive, sustained professional development in order to teach the course effectively.  As part of the professional development, teachers participated in business and industry visits, an intensive two-week summer institute, and academic year meetings and classroom visits.  As a result of the professional development, teachers significantly improved their understanding of math modeling and STEM contexts and applications, as well as their abilities to utilize technologies.  Furthermore, teacher self-efficacy significantly increased and teachers? dispositions toward teaching and learning shifted toward research-based teaching practices.  While teaching the math modeling course, teachers? practices supported more student discourse and interaction when compared to their prior teaching practices in more traditional math courses, as measured with the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol.                 The target student population was students who had not intended to go to college but had basic algebra proficiency. Since the rural partner schools are often too small to support more than two math tracks, college-bound and not college-bound, the student population who took the course did not have the proficiency in basic algebra expected. In fact, 70% of student participants during two years (N=500 from 2013-2015) placed at the pre-algebra level on a Compass Math Placement exam given prior to the math-modeling course. The Compass Math Placement Test was utilized until 2016 in many colleges to place students in their first college math class.   Even with low math preparation, 79% of the students taking the "Math Modeling in STEM" course during this period raised their Algebra domain score or placed in domain higher than Algebra.              Since the Compass test is quite traditional, and the math modeling course quite non-traditional, additional measures of student learning were used.  A basic math modeling exam and technology (graphing calculator) exam were given in pre/post format, with student gains of 50% and 46% respectively.  A performance assessment in which students designed an experiment to address a problem situation, gathered data, and developed, used and implemented a math model was also given, with good results.     Due to the success of the math modeling course and the uniqueness of the experimental math modeling activities, a one week professional development institute for both high school math teachers and college math faculty was held in summer 2015 with 34 participants to disseminate the project?s practices and curricular resources.  Through these teachers and faculty, the project?s activities have been incorporated into many high school classes and college math classes.     The "Math Modeling in STEM" course to date is still taught at 18 schools in northwestern Ohio. Several new schools have adopted the course, while several original partner schools have integrated the math modeling activities into Algebra II courses. Colleges and universities have included the activities in their College Algebra courses, as well as other courses, and students have responded positively to active engagement.  The participating math teachers and faculty have significantly improved not only their math knowledge, but also their knowledge of STEM contexts and applications and of teaching methods to support high-engagement student learning.  This project has had significant impact on teachers and faculty and their students and has developed a valuable curriculum resource of experimental math modeling activities that should have a lasting and expanding effect on high school and college math teaching and learning.
