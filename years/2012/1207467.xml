<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The potential impact of nanoscale materials on emerging applications is immense, with the possibility of producing disruptive new technological advances in areas as diverse as alternative energy, computing, and medicine.  "Bottom-up" chemical methods that begin with molecular building blocks are ideal routes to nanoscale materials because they, in principal, are extremely versatile and permit the design and synthesis of arbitrary nanostructures.  Despite several decades of research, we have very little mechanistic understanding of how certain molecular entities react to form nanostructures.  All of the variables contributing to the formation of a particular nanostructure complicate this problem and make it impossible to design synthetic strategies apriori.  This empiricism is due to the lack of in-situ information of how nanostructure nucleation and growth (isotropic or anisotropic) is influenced by the chemical and physical environment.  The proposed research supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program will address the problem outlined above by developing the most thorough molecular-level understanding of nanostructure synthesis to date utilizing a versatile droplet-based microfluidic platform that can mimic bulk synthetic procedures and produce indistinguishable droplets within which nanostructure-forming reactions occur.  The integrated device will be interfaced with synchrotron x-ray radiation for in-situ, real-time absorption and scattering measurements.  We will utilize the microfluidic device to answer fundamental mechanistic unknowns regarding the influence of intrinsic/extrinsic anions on the rate of reduction and nucleation-growth during the formation of spherical transition metal nanoparticles (NPs), shape-controlled growth of Pt NPs and Au nanorods with a particular emphasis on capturing the initial chemical reactions that induce isotropic-to-anisotropic transformation. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The results of this proposal will provide valuable information to develop continuous reactors for high-throughput production of nanostructures of any arbitrary size, shape and composition.  The educational outreach of this proposal is to provide opportunity to graduate students, and undergraduates - especially those from underrepresented groups - to participate in fundamental research in nanoscience, microfabrication and synchrotron-based characterization.  It is estimated that 1 in 100 children in the United States have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis.  In Centre County, Pennsylvania, a non-profit, human services organization, NHS runs an after-school program - Stepping Stones - for ASD individuals between the ages of 8-14.  The PI and his group will take the lead on developing simple and visually stimulating science lessons as part of "Science Tuesdays".  Individuals diagnosed with ASD are sensory learners and our science lessons will be primarily accomplished through visual demonstrations enabling student participation which encourages social interaction with their peers, the PI and his graduate students.  Visual experiments that cover concepts relevant to the proposed work (including solubility, supersaturation, nucleation and crystallography) include growing rock candy and cloud formation.  These lessons will be recorded and disseminated via YouTube and through live demonstrations at the National Autism Conference held annually on the campus of the Pennsylvania State University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanoscience is a potentially transformative science that may benefit technologies ranging from medicine, energy generation and storage, information storage due to their unique chemical and physical properties which derive from their inherently large surface-to-volume ratio.  A potential roadblock to widespread adoption of nano-sized materials across multiple technologies is the inherit challenges associated with apriori design and scale-up.  In order to address the design issue, we proposed that a microfluidic platform interfaced with various light sources for structural and chemical characterization in real time allows for the development of kinetic-based mechanistic models for nanostructure growth.  We have developed a microfluidic platform interfaced with synchrotron-based x-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the influence of halide ions on transition metal nanoparticles which find applications in energy conversion (catalysis) and storage (batteries), while UV-Vis spectroscopy was combined with millifluidic channel systems to understand the kinetics of chalcogenide nanoparticle growth, which have applications in solar energy conversion.  We designed a high-temperature and organic solvent compatibility microfluidic platform to examine the influence of growth additives (inorganic acids, organic ligands) and metal precursor identity in real time, where spatial positions on a single platform probes the extent of reaction.  From this platform, we experimentally determined along with the use of first-principle density functional theory calculations that halide-covered surfaces form dense monolayer to multilayer adlayers that accept solvated metal species leading to growth, while predominantly oxygen or hydroxide particles do not experience additional growth and solvated metal species nucleate to form new particles.  The source &ndash; endogenous or exogenous &ndash; of the halide ions has little mechanistic consequence due to rapid ligand exchange.  For chalcogenide nanoparticle growth, we determined with a combined microfluidic and UV-Vis spectroscopic approach the dynamics of size-focusing was complex with both particles dissolving through an Ostwald ripening process and large particles partially dissolving; the latter appeared to be influenced by the identity of the ligands used during synthesis.  We additionally extended the use of our micro/millifluidic platform to the synthesis of cyclic organic carbonates demonstrating the ability to spatially deliver incompatible reagents enable the synthesis of chemicals and materials that can?t be accomplished in traditional batch processes.  Micro to millifluidic devices interfaced with appropriate analytical techniques allow for the elucidation of nanoscale reaction mechanisms and their associated kinetics in a transport limitation free set-up allowing for rigorous assessment of kinetics and dynamics during growth.
