<AbstractNarration>****Technical abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual impact of the understanding of superfluid 3He extends across many fields in Physics. The program funded in this proposal will combine the field of nanofluidics with low temperature physics, to expose new size effects in a quantum fluid. By examination of the flow behavior of the quantum fluid the researchers seek to understand the influence of surface roughness on quantum transport. They will characterize the surface roughness necessary to allow the fluid to be locked to the surface or to slip at the surface. The surface roughness should also add quantifiable disorder to the quantum fluid. In planned experiments, the effect of confinement on the phase diagram will be examined with a view to exposing new (perhaps even handed or chiral) phases. The compressibility of 3He will allow the length scale of the coherence length to be pressure-tuned. By combining low temperatures and nano fabrication, two graduate students and several undergraduates will be exposed to the exciting training ground that has prepared scientists for lead roles in academia and high-technology industries. The proposed research will expose the stability of the superfluid order parameter to confinement, and look for new forms of superfluid under confinement on the way to a quantum phase transition where the superfluidity is extinguished. Such new superfluids might be of interest in quantum computation, and  exposing in new types of vorticity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Many of our everyday devices (think of cellphones, computers) originate from fundamental advances engendered by condensed matter research. In turn, future advances will rely on exploration of new regimes presently accessible only in a laboratory environment. The research to be conducted in this program will examine the special properties of superfluid 3He when confined in ultra small engineered cavities less than a thousandth of a millimeter tall, marking the transition from bulk 3 dimensional behavior to a new 2 dimensional regime. The flow of helium in these cavities should be dominated by the roughness of the surface and will slip if the surface is too smooth, or will be locked to the surface if the roughness is "just right". By examining flow, the researchers hope to better understand how quantum (as opposed to classical) fluids are different from each other. Quantum fluids display a "graininess" rather than a continuous behavior, and this quantum behavior is emphasized in reduced dimensions because the "grain" size increases. The reduced size will also be exploited in other ways to demonstrate new types of superfluid states that may show handedness like a spinning top. By combining low temperatures and nano fabrication, two graduate students and several undergraduates will be exposed to the exciting training ground that has prepared scientists for lead roles in academia and high-technology industries. The project will test what size range is relevant for the transformation from ordinary 3 Dimensional behavior to 2 Dimensional behavior.</AbstractNarration>

We successfully   demonstrated precise (few hundred nm tall by cm sized) cavities (Fig. 1) that were   feature free (had no support pillars) that allowed us to examine boundaries   between different phases of the superfluid (distinguished by their unique   symmetries). &nbsp;We also demonstrated the   use of high precision torsion pendulum devices mated to these cavities that   allowed us to study the transformation between these phases. The pristine   environment and smooth surfaces allowed the phase boundary to move continuously   without hindrance. On the other hand, the nucleation of the more stable phase   at low temperature remains a mystery. The understanding of how this phase   nucleates a seed and then displaces the less favored phase is not yet at hand.   The dynamics of this transformation (that is thought to have parallels with   the evolution of the early universe) is worthy of pursuit. We also examined   the properties of 3He confined in a highly anisotropic dilute aerogel (published   in Nature Communications) and found evidence for a phase of 3He not seen in   bulk samples (Fig. 2). We demonstrated the compatibility of the glass-silicon and   all-silicon cell construction for low temperature studies using magnetic   resonance techniques using sensitive superconducting detectors. New types of   ultra-small (50 nm x 50 nm cross section) resonant structures (nanowires) were   developed for use as detectors of the strength of the superfluid pairing at   low temperatures (published in Nano Letters see Fig. 3). This technology can find   numerous applications in the future from medical imaging to the study of   flow.</p> <p>At Cornell, our experiments   (published in Nature Communications) showed remarkably small &ldquo;supercooling&rdquo; &ndash;   overcooling of the high temperature superfluid state. No evidence of an   expected &ldquo;striped state&rdquo; was seen (Fig. 4). However, magnetic resonance experiments in   the UK on cells fabricated at Cornell showed evidence for a &ldquo;polka-dot&rdquo; state   that was unanticipated but related to the &ldquo;stripe state&rdquo;. These experiments   demonstrate that although bulk 3He is very well understood, confined 3He and   its interaction with even pristine surfaces is still new territory. Thus we   believe that insights gained from our research on the influence of disorder   and surfaces will have significance for the understanding of the behavior of   exotically paired electron systems where exerting such control is difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The broader impacts of the   research were numerous. We advanced the state of the art significantly in   terms of small magnetic signal detection, detection of small inertial mass   contributions, large aspect ratio structures and surface preparation for   nanofluidic devices. Our students and postdocs have benefited from   international collaborations with Royal Holloway in the UK. The grant   resulted in several high profile publications, contributing to the scientific   literature and adding to the knowledge base. One recent Ph.D. transitioned   from academia to industry (Corning Research), and the second to a post doc in   a national laboratory (NIST). A post doc is now a researcher at Aalto   University in Helsinki, Finland, and a second short term post doc is now a   researcher at the Technion in Israel. An undergrad student is now at Cornell   pursuing a Ph.D. in theoretical Physics after having been awarded a prestigious   NSF Graduate Fellowship. As part of our continuing outreach we are also   working with colleagues to implement magnetic cooling apparatus elsewhere   (NASA Goddard). &nbsp;Thus the program contributed   to the scientific infrastructure through education and training of personnel,   additions to the scientific literature, encouragement of the pursuit of STEM   literacy, through applications of current technology (nuclear cooling) and   for future advances where nanotechnology and flow will be utilized.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/10/2018<br>      Modified by: Jeevak&nbsp;M&nbsp;Parpia</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202991/1202991_10169911_1531228693450_FigfromRSI--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202991/1202991_10169911_1531228693450_FigfromRSI--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202991/1202991_10169911_1531228693450_FigfromRSI--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Shows (a) a schematic of a glass to silicon cell (b) a bonded silicon-glass cell torsion oscillator cell "head" for inertial measurements (c) a silicon glass cell for magnetic resonance experiments</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nikolay Zhelev</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeevak&nbsp;M&nbsp;Parpia</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202991/1202991_10169911_1531228849852_ThumbnailNCommAerogel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202991/1202991_10169911_1531228849852_ThumbnailNCommAerogel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202991/1202991_10169911_1531228849852_ThumbnailNCommAerogel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Shows the observed phase transitions when cooling (top) and while warming observed with a torsion pendulum for 3He confined in a highly anisotropic aerogel.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nikolay Zhelev</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeevak&nbsp;M&nbsp;Parpia</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202991/1202991_10169911_1531229062282_ImageNanoLetters--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202991/1202991_10169911_1531229062282_ImageNanoLetters--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202991/1202991_10169911_1531229062282_ImageNanoLetters--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(a) Suspended nanowire over silicon.
