<AbstractNarration>Environmental governance requires participation by people and their local, state and national governments, and decisions have implications across jurisdictions.  Cooperation across multiple disciplines from the social and natural and physical sciences is necessary to inform our understanding of how to make decisions based in the best scientific evidence.  Yet although environmental systems are of interest across the sciences, and require analysis from multiple sciences, scientists often do not have the collaborations in place concerning how best to research questions of how people constitute, interact with and govern their behavior within complex environmental systems. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This project supports a workshop that will develop collaborations across sciences concerning people's participation in choices about governing environmental systems, addressing governing choices and frameworks across scales of governments.  Participants will include engineers, social scientists, and natural and physical scientists from multiple disciplines, all with research priorities concerning governing environmental systems.  The workshop will develop collaborations and frameworks in common for understanding how to explain variation in governing strategies.  In doing so, it will contribute to the development of concepts across the sciences.  In addition, the project's broader impacts will include contributing to policymaking for governments, and training students in issues concerning scientific collaboration as well as environmental sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under this proposal, a "Climate Change Governance: Law, Risk Management, and Decision Making" workshop was held. The main purpose of the workshop was to focus attention on the challenge climate change poses for governance as understood in the social sciences and legal scholarship. The primary goal of the workshop was to bring together a diverse group of interdisciplinary scholars to share perspectives on climate change governance in order to promote a deeper appreciation of points of convergence and to identify knowledge gaps across disciplines. Three workshop themes were used to guide workshop activities:  The construction and alignment of modes of governance across differing societal levels or "scales" from individual to community, community to region, region to nation, and nations to global institutions.  The fragmentation of contemporary "expert knowledge" on climate change and governance and the associated lack of interaction and sharing across disciplines and what amount to intellectual "silos." The lack of social scienceÃ†s presence in addressing and planning for climate change through an understanding of the preferred and available governance options.     As a result of workshop discussions, attendees developed research teams around three main knowledge gaps:  1) the need for comparative analysis across metropolitan areas and cities, including building a cross-state database of mandates and policy responses. We know very little about the optimization of metropolitan governance with respect to climate change;  2) identifying those conditions under which climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies might be mutually reinforcing. This knowledge gap includes asking how climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies identified, prioritized, and identifying scale issues, and time frames, particularly at the rural/urban interface and in areas such agroforestry, and finally  3) identifying how tools such as participatory mapping can be used to help model the changing climate. In this area, there is a need to understand how the shift from participatory mapping to e-participatory mapping can be used to model global comment and how will the new tools of SMS-based polling and participatory mapping change the relationship between people, their land and water.
