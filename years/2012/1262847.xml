<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) Site led by Professors Terence A. Nile and Penelope J. Pynes, both at the University of Carolina- Greensboro (UNCG). The REU Site entitled "Multi-site, Multi-institutional International REU Program" will train 10 undergraduate students for an 8 week summer research experiences  at the Universities of Bath, Bristol and Cardiff in the United Kingdom (UK). The participants will be recruited after their sophomore and junior years with at least half (50%) from underrepresented groups. While providing students with a first class international experience, the program will give students, especially those from smaller institutions, the opportunity to undertake cutting edge research in synthetic chemistry at well-equipped major research universities. Thus, the multi-site, multi-institutional REU site will provide an international undergraduate research experience (IURE) for students from the US at three institutions in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of the award involves working closely with the students supported by the REU Site to find additional research experiences, both on and off their campuses, as they progress through their undergraduate degree programs. A document will be prepared that summarizes the procedures necessary for a successful program of this type and it will be used this internally to facilitate similar programs in other disciplines at UNCG. This information will be submitted for publication in the Council of Undergraduate Research journal and presented at regional and national meetings of undergraduate research organizations.</AbstractNarration>
