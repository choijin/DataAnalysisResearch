<AbstractNarration>This award is in direct support of Research Vessel Clifford A. Barnes, and is funded in order to conduct NSF peer-reviewed oceanographic research in Calendar Year 2012. R/V Clifford A. Barnes is owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by the University of Washington.  The ship works primarily in the sheltered waters of Western Washington, British Columbia, including Puget Sound and Lake Washington. In 2012, R/V Clifford A. Barnes plans to operate 124 days, of which 89 days will be in direct support of NSF research. This is a five-year cooperative agreement, and funding for the years 2013-2016 will be re-negotiated and evaluated based on the number of days at sea in support of peer-reviewed sea-going NSF-funded research. R/V Clifford A. Barnes is operated as a member of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).  The University of Washington remains committed to managing this facility in a safe, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible manner.</AbstractNarration>
