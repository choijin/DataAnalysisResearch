<AbstractNarration>This award will support the analysis of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) in driven diffusive systems. Physical systems of interest in this general class are typically modeled either deterministically by diffusive nonlinear evolution equations or stochastically by certain types of Markov processes. The NESS referred to here differ from the equilibria of linear dynamics or the invariant measures of detailed balance in that the non-equilibrium steady states exhibit phase separation (often driven by boundary dynamics), spontaneous symmetry breaking and/or long range correlations away from critical transitions. Specific contexts to be explored include the strong bending regime of striped pattern formation, spatial random partitions, and random matrix ensembles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-equilibrium steady states are typical for a number of physical systems and models, including defect condensation in pattern forming systems driven far from threshold, classical molecule formation, a system of interacting Bose particles, shaken granular gasses, infinite allele models, network formation by preferential attachment or rewiring, stochastic growth models and two-dimensional quantum gravity. The award will support research approaches on the behavior of such systems that uses deterministic (non-random) as well as stochastic (random) techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the primary goals of mathematical physics (and more broadly areas of applied mathematics relevant for biology or even the social sciences) is to understand how the fundamental microscopic processes of the underlying physical (or biological or social) systems manifest themselves in the complex macroscopic behaviors of such systems that we see in the laboratory or even in the world around us.     Classical thermodynamics or equilibrium statistical mechanics does a wonderful job of describing how macroscopic stationary states, such as the solid, liquid and vapor states of water, arise from the underlying molecular microstructure, depending on extensive parameters.     However many important physical processes take place outside of equilibrium. Physical examples of this include situations where there is a dynamic flow of particles or heat such as in chemical reactions or in the formation of defects, condensates and singularities. Most biological or social processes by their nature are non-equilibrium. At this time there is no general formalism for non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Hence thinking about concrete non-equilibrium models, even those that are somewhat simplified, is of value.     The projects for this award were focused in three concrete areas.     The first of these concerned models of aggregate formation that can be applied, for instance, to systems of interacting Bose particles, shaken granular gasses or infinite allele models in biology that violate standard principles of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The PI and his collaborators have given a complete classification of models of this type, known as random permutations with general cycle weights, as well as a description of their asymptotic behavior as the size of the permutations grow. In addition they have extended this classification and description to heavy&ndash;tailed distributions. A heavy tailed distribution is one for which the tail decay of the distribution is sub-exponential. Such distributions have attracted a greater popular interest recently due to recent financial upheavals and statistical observations such as, "the top 1% of a population owns 40 % of its collective wealth", which seem to lie outside predictions based on the central limit theorem.        The second project concerned growth models of stochastic networks in random environments. These are models applicable to neural networks as well as models of the internet.
