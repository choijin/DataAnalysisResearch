<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Brian M. Stoltz of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology will investigate the origins of high enantioselectivity in an important asymmetric catalytic alkylation reaction discovered in his laboratory, and apply the knowledge gained toward the development of a broad platform for enantioselective transition metal enolate functionalization chemistry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work described could provide unprecedented access to simple chemical building-blocks containing stereogenic centers, and could be widely adopted by synthetic chemists in both academia and industry.  This unique collection of tools could enable chemists to push beyond the state-of-the-art in applying such technologies to compounds and substances that are beyond the scope of the current methods.   In addition to the on-site, laboratory science described in this grant, the science proposed herein will directly impact the education of scientists at the California Institute of Technology, while the skill set and expertise they gain will broadly impact society-at-large as they too move on to productive careers in academia, industry, and government.  Finally, ongoing teaching and outreach efforts with young students (K-6) will impact the lives and decisions of the next generation of students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The science of synthesis and the evolution of new fundamental reactions are invaluable to many scientific endeavors.  For example, the fields of medicinal chemistry, bioorganic chemistry, molecular biology, inorganic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, and physical organic chemistry depend greatly on the basic ability to synthesize new compounds.  Fundamentally, chemistry possesses the power to manipulate the elements for the preparation of specific arrays of atoms in a predictable and reliable fashion.  As synthetic chemists, our capacity to construct molecules with exquisite precision is unique in the sciences.  Any development that enhances our ability to assemble compounds more efficiently will have a direct impact on the aforementioned disciplines in a meaningful and quantitative manner.  In a broader sense, innovative chemical synthesis continues to profoundly benefit biology and human medicine, largely through medicinal chemistry and process research and development.  We have been deeply engaged in a multipronged scientific study to 1) Investigate the Mechanistic underpinnings and develop methodological Extensions of the Enantioselective Palladium-Catalyzed Decarboxylative Allylic Alkylation, 2) Develop Mild Functionalization Reactions of Prochiral Enolates, and 3) implement rapid approaches to the synthesis of complex molecules, taking advantage of newly developed prochiral enolate chemistry.  Advances toward these goals has furthered our understanding of organic reactivity and increased our technological capabilities in synthesis, which has served as a cornerstone enabling technology and field unto itself.  Through the course of the project, numerous students have received valuable training in both accomplishing practical chemistry and in utilization of the scientific method to solve complex problems. These students will be better prepared to enter diverse fields in which analytical and critical evaluation of evidence serve as the primary currency.  In addition to the on-site, laboratory science pursued under this award, our research group is also committed to the early scientific training of future generations.  We have continued our ongoing teaching and outreach efforts with the broader community that are envisioned to impact the lives and decisions of the next generation of students.
