<AbstractNarration>This NSF MRI award funds the acquisition of a state-of-the-art rock triaxial testing system, which is the centerpiece of the Geo-Mechanics and Geo-Imaging laboratory at the University of North Florida.  The testing system couples hydrological, geophysical, and mechanical (static and dynamic compression) testing capabilities under triaxial conditions. The rock triaxial testing system augments existing specimen preparation equipment, pre-test characterization equipment, index test equipment, and acoustic emission monitoring equipment to create a unique experimental rock characterization facility at a predominately undergraduate institution. Projects to be supported by the testing system include characterization of the properties and behavior of brittle macroporous materials; addressing technical issues that will allow engineers to design economic; sustainable subsurface infrastructure in weathered Florida limestone; and developing knowledge that will allow engineers, scientists, and policy makers to assess the potential for geologic carbon sequestration in the state of Florida. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The triaxial testing system supports cutting edge instruction, education, and research in geological material characterization at the University of North Florida.  Possessing this unique experimental characterization system enhances numerous multidisciplinary collaborative research projects with researchers within and outside of the state of Florida.  Experimental data generated using the rock triaxial testing system is disseminated to researchers and educators using a dedicated web-based digital library. Beyond students, faculty and researchers, the broader community which benefits from this system includes high school students who participate in outreach activities within the University of North Florida's School of Engineering and state policy makers who decide upon state endeavors into geologic carbon sequestration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to acquire a state-of-the-art rock triaxial testing system for research, education, and training of both undergraduate and graduate students in experimental rock characterization at the University of North Florida. The system has been installed in the Geo-Mechanics and Geo-Imaging Laboratory. Calibration of the various components and training of the first generation of users has been completed.  The testing system has been and continues to be used in undergraduate education, outreach activities to under-represented minorities in engineering, and to attract incoming freshmen to engineering. Undergraduate students conduct compression tests on weathered Florida limestone as part of their first geotechnical engineering course. The Geo-Mechanics and Geo-Imaging Laboratory is part of the UNF School of Engineering laboratory tour which showcases active research laboratories to potential university donors, incoming freshmen, and for outreach activities.  The most important function this system serves is research activities in the area of experimental rock characterization. Thus far, the system has been used to characterize concrete from a mass concrete wharf structure, characterize metamorphic rock for a drilled shaft foundation associated with a bridge rehabilitation project, and characterizing weathered limestone from central Florida.  Current research includes linking surface characteristics to strength and stiffness of weathered limestones and multi-stage triaxial testing to determine design parameters for construction in weathered limestone.  Most undergraduate teaching universities, like the University of North Florida, are not fortunate enough to have such research equipment.  In order to disseminate test results for educational purposes, a website has been developed (www.geo-laboratory.com).  The website presents an overview of the Geo-Mechanics and Geo-Imaging Laboratory and also provides a portal to contact the PI to obtain test result information.
