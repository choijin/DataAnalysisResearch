<AbstractNarration>The ultracentrifuge that is requested with this proposal is an essential piece of equipment for research characterizing and bioengineering light sensitive proteins from cyanobacteria. It is necessary to separate proteins from the E.coli expression system that are used for bioengineering proteins. The focus of The Spiller Lab is to engineer a small, bright red fluorescent protein tag for in vivo microscopy. Undergraduate, post baccalaureate and glide-year students at Mills College are engaged in the laboratory work. They gain research experience and expertise, while participating in leading edge research. Another goal of Spiller Lab is to encourage young women to pursue scientific careers. Spiller Lab was awarded a NSF-CBET-0967965 grant in April 2010 to fund this research. An ultracentrifuge is one of the critical pieces of equipment for this project. The Spiller Lab is currently working on a leading-edge research project in collaboration with Center for Biophotonics Science and Technology (CBST), University of California, Davis. They are using PCR, and E.coli expression system, to capture, characterize and purify GAF domains from the five (5) class II (blue/green) cyanobacteriochromes.</AbstractNarration>

This acquisition met specific objectives with the addition of this ultracentrifuge to our laboratory equipment. For example, our researchers and students can now separate our engineered protein from the&nbsp;<em>E.coli&nbsp;</em>cells, which produce it for us. The&nbsp;<em>E.coli&nbsp;</em>has been transfected with our&nbsp;engineered&nbsp;DNA plasmid. The plasmid has the genetic sequence to&nbsp;instruct&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>E.coli&nbsp;</em>bacteria to make engineered red fluorescent tag. The bacteria can be thought of as microscopic factories, which transcribe and translate the engineered DNA into its protein form. The Beckman Coulter Optima MAX-XP Ultracentrifuge facilitates the&nbsp;separation&nbsp;of our engineered red fluorescent protein tag from the <em>E.coli&rsquo;s&nbsp;</em>insoluble<em> </em>cellular debris. The Beckman Coulter Optima MAX-XP Ultracentrifuge spins bacterial cellular debris out of macerated <em>E.coli</em>. With this new equipment we separate our desired protein into the soluble supernatant. In conjunction with a protein purification system, the supernatant from centrifugation flows over chitin columns and size exclusion columns to purify it away from other soluble components of the supernatant. With this new laboratory equipment we have been able to move our research objectives forward toward constructing a red fluorescent-tagged actin and a red fluorescent-tagged tubulin plasmid vector. We also have a possible candidate for an additional tag from a different&nbsp;<em>T. elongatus&nbsp;?gene</em> (tlr0924).&nbsp;The cyanobacteriochrome&nbsp;<em>T. elongatus&nbsp;</em> gene family has 5 candidate genes that may be useful for their ability to fluoresce red wavelengths in&nbsp;the&nbsp;660nm to 700nm range. The ultracentrifuge can be used in the&nbsp;on-going project. In addition, the red fluorescent tag itself is a very interesting protein. Our pet name for it is SmuRF protein (Small unexpected Red Fluorescent). Currently, collaboration is underway with for an X-ray crystallography project with researchers and students from University of California Berkeley and The Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories (LBNL) to crystalize the small bioengineered red fluorescent protein moiety. Successful X-ray crystallography would reveal the structural characteristics that make SmuRF a red light fluorescing molecule. The equipment will be shared with our collaborators and other Mills Faculty for our common goals to train undergraduate researchers, and with outside collaborators to crystallize and determine the structure of the bioengineered protein that we have engineered and isolated at Mills. Protein purification is a very important part of the crystallization process, and ultracentrifugation streamlines purification. The project provided opportunities for training and professional development for Mills students. These students gained experience with a cutting edge research project in a well-equipped laboratory. Mills undergraduates participated in many poster sessions at national society meetings and at Mills College. If they go into scientific research in an academic or business or an industrial setting they will have relevant training.</p> <p>Susan C.
