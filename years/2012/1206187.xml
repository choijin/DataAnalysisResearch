<AbstractNarration>This research project addresses mechanisms underlying the strong interaction of subatomic physics in terms of the confined quarks and gluons described by that part of the Standard Model known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  We implement a continuum nonperturbative approach based on the Dyson-Schwinger equations of QCD which preserves the short distance renormalization group behavior of perturbative QCD while the infrared domain is described by one parameter to generate the empirical amount of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.  The latter phenomenon is the source for the generation of at least 98% of the mass of known stable matter in the universe, and it guides the development of our theoretical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will analyze and interpret information about the quark and gluon structure of sub-atomic particles produced by the Jefferson Laboratory at Newport News Virginia (JLab), and provide predictions for the experiments anticipated from the upgrade currently being undertaken.  Theoretical work of this type informs and motivates a portfolio of fundamental physics programs at sub-atomic physics laboratories across the world.  Specific  physics issues addressed include parton distributions of the pion and kaon mesons, the transition or generalized parton distributions of the pion and kaon mesons, the elastic and transition form factors of pions for a complete range of momentum transfer, and an extension to nucleon parton distributions, and their ratios.  We anticipate a by-product will be a new understanding of the mass scale for transition from non-perturbative to perturbative dynamics  in the pion charge form factor.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the program include the cross-fertilization of nuclear and particle physics, a return on the investment in the experimental facilities at JLab and RHIC, and integration of research and education through  the research training of graduate students in connection with undergraduate teaching.  The interactions of graduate students with scientists who are prominent nationally and internationally is a contribution to the nation's infrastructure for research and education.  The PI uses examples from this research program to illustrate key elements of core graduate classes in Quantum Mechanics and Nuclear and Particle Physics.  The PI supervises an informal seminar course for graduate students and postdoctoral associates to discuss and present aspects of QCD and field theory that underly this research program.  The collaboration with overseas colleagues will enhance  international cooperation in science research and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research addressed mechanisms underlying the physics of strongly interacting sub-atomic particles (hadrons) in terms of the confined quarks and gluons of the quantum field theory called Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)---a part of the Standard Model of fundamental physics at the smallest distance scales.  The employed non-perturbative  approach was based on the Dyson-Schwinger equations of QCD.  The program was designed to guide the analysis and interpretation of information about the quark and gluon structure of hadrons produced by the Jefferson Laboratory at Newport News Virginia (JLab), and provide predictions for the experiments anticipated from the upgrade currently being undertaken.   Theoretical work of this type informs and motivates a portfolio of fundamental physics programs at sub-atomic physics laboratories across the world.  Specific advances in scientific understanding produced by this research program include the following.    For the first time, the parton distribution amplitudes of the pion and kaon meson, at a scale directly relevant to experiment, were calculated in a manner directly related to QCD.   In that work, the role of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (the principal mass generating mechanism for visible stable matter of the universe), was demonstrated.  In the case of the kaon, the asymmetry of the distribution amplitude refects the violation of flavor symmetry as significantly modulated by dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.  This result informs the analysis of high energy scattering experiments that can only reveal new physics if the amplitudes for familar particles like the kaon are reliably known.      In another work, we have provided a comparison of the many moments of these distribution amplitudes with those two or three moments obtained from direct lattice implementations of QCD.  We show how to use the insight from our approach to deduce the full continuous function from the limited number of lattice moments.  Our investigation of the electromagnetic charge  form factor of the pion has pioneered a new calculational algorithm that for the first time allows theoretical results for a complete range of momentum transfer, while maintaining a direct relationship with QCD.  This work exposes a flaw in previous expectations of the magnitude this form factor should acquire at the maximum momentum transfer curently obtainable in experiment.     A by-product is a new understanding of the mass scale for transition from non-perturbative to perturbative dynamics  in hadron form factors.     The research has also produced an analysis of basic features of the quark parton distribution functions that arise in deep inelastic scattering from the pion. This work was designed to act as a prelude to a more detailed future analysis of the parton distribution functions of the nucleon.   We have shown that a bell-shaped curve always results from a description of the pion that is limited to just a dressed quark and dressed anti-quark.    The work then deduced the basic change to the momentum balance sheet if a virtual one-pion loop dressing is allowed.   Such a mechanism is an effective representation of basic quark-loop effects from the quantum vacuum inside hadrons.     The above research results were published as 6 papers in refereed journals.   Broader impacts of the program include the cross-fertilization of nuclear and particle physics, a return on the investment in the experimental facilities at Jefferson Laboratory at Newport News Virginia and the Relativistic Heavy-ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and integration of research and education through the research training of graduate students in connection with undergraduate teaching.
