<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project supports a workshop focused on the professional development and networking of Principal Investigators (PIs) who have active National Science Foundation (NSF) grants from the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research. The goals of workshop are to: (1) educate PIs about the NSF proposal submission, review, award, oversight and management processes; (2) provide an environment for researchers within the field of ceramics to collaborate and share information about their research projects; (3) improve communication about research accomplishments; (4) address key issues in the field; and (5) engage PIs in discussions to improve processes to help the American Ceramic Society (ACerS) and NSF increase the effectiveness of ceramics research.   As well, ACerS will continue to develop the website for this community (http://ceramics.org/knowledge-center/national-science-foundation/) that showcases the accomplishments of the NSF-funded researchers and educators in ceramics.  Specifically, this website links together researchers, abstracts of their NSF-funded projects, publications, press releases and other highlights. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This two-day workshop will take place June 13-14, 2012 in Arlington, Virginia.  Each participant will provide both an oral and poster presentation highlighting their research and education activities.  The core part of the workshop includes sessions about writing effective highlights; reporting requirements; delivering your opinion in proposal reviews; news about NSF merit review and funding opportunities; the Materials Genome Initiative; facilities, instrumentation and cooperation in the USA; American competitiveness and innovation; broadening participation; and the Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP).  As well, an additional discussion topic will focus on the roles and responsibilities of PIs, professional societies and government agencies. A  post-workshop tutorial will cover: aspects of NSF proposal submissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The website for the 2012 meeting will be found on this list: http://ceramics.org/meetings/event-calendar.  &lt;br/&gt;Website for 2011 Ceramics PI workshop: http://ceramics.org/knowledge-center/national-science-foundation/nsf-ceramic-materials-pi-workshop-2011-archive &lt;br/&gt;and the website for 2010 Ceramics PI workshop: http://ceramics.org/meetings/meetings-archives/nsf-ceramic-materials-pi-workshop-archive.</AbstractNarration>
