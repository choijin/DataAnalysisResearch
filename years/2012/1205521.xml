<AbstractNarration>GridIron is a computing grid resource for the Dartmouth computer science department, enabling cutting-edge research and training in a wide range of projects involving analysis of large quantities of data and search over large, complex spaces.  In computational structural biology, researchers are developing and applying methods to search protein conformation spaces, to systematically decompose the protein structure universe, and to model and design protein-protein interactions for specificity.  In computer vision, researchers are developing and applying methods to authenticate digital images and to perform large-scale image search.  Other significant areas of investigation include large-scale smartphone sensing, latency mitigation, and malware detection.  The grid is also an asset for Digital Arts projects and research, including information visualization for large data sets and real-time rendering for motion capture.  Finally, the grid supports a number of education and outreach activities, including non-major, undergraduate, and graduate courses and a summer camp for high school students.  It provides invaluable practical experience in the use of large-scale computation in solving difficult challenges in the analysis of massive data sets.</AbstractNarration>
