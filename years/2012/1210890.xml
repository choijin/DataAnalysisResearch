<AbstractNarration>This project is a systematic investigation of cooling gas and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in cool core clusters, using adaptive mesh refinement simulations to resolve all cooling instabilities down to nearly the parsec scale.  The first phase will focus only on radiative cooling, temporarily neglecting feedback in order to determine how gas cools in a cooling core.  It will consider the effect of magnetic fields and anisotropic heat conduction, and evaluate the influence of gas temperature and potential well depth on the cooling catastrophe.  The second phase will include AGN feedback, resolving down as far as the sphere of influence of the central supermassive black hole, in order to focus on different models for implementing jet-driven feedback.  Detailed predictions of the X-ray, optical and radio emission properties of the cool core will serve as the diagnostics for testing the models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities used to achieve the goals of this project will all involve training and public outreach, including a number of projects suitable for undergraduate students.  The team has a good track record in these areas, and all members will continue to be involved in local activities, including a partnership with the American Museum of Natural History to generate high-quality visualizations.  The adaptive mesh simulation code used in this study, called Enzo, is widely used by many researchers world-wide, and some effort will be invested to make it more complete, accurate and easy-to-use.  The PI will hold regular (virtual) developer meetings to help to guide code development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[X-ray clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in our universe &mdash; these huge conglomerations each contain hundreds or thousands of galaxies as large as our own Milky Way, and even larger amount of hot gas and dark matter, an unknown form of matter which, to a very good approximation, does not interact with regular matter.  The galaxies were discovered first, at least a century ago, but it is the 10 million degree hot gas that was discovered to be radiating copiously in the X-ray band.  X-ray telescopes have mapped out many of these clusters, demonstrating that there are two populations of such objects, differing in their central gas properties.  The first type have relatively dim cores (in X-ray), with central gas temperatures that are the same as the rest of the cluster, and radiate inefficiently, so that it would take more than the age of the universe for the gas in the center to radiative away its energy.  The second type are relatively bright in the core, have low central gas temperatures, and radiate efficiently, so that they are expected to cool within a short period (astronomically speaking: typically a few hundred million years).   These cool-core clusters are the focus of this project, as they pose a serious mystery to astronomers.  In particular, there are two questions: first, if the cooling time is short, why do these clusters not cool more completely, leading to the presence of large amounts of cold gas (and hence star formation).  Observations show that they typically forming stars, but at a rate ten times lower than expected.  Second, more detailed X-ray analysis demonstrates that the gas does not cool below about ten million degrees.  Previous work has convincingly demonstrated that the solution must involve energetic jets of relativistic particles driven by supermassive black holes at the centers of the clusters, as cool-core clusters invariably show the signatures of such "feedback", but the connection has been unclear. In the work funded by this grant, we have undertaken a systematic series of numerical simulations to investigate this question in detail.  Using a high-resolution gas dynamics simulation code which is self-adapting to focus the computational effort where it is required, we created a model of a cool-core cluster based on the well-studied Perseus cluster, and explored the impact of simple models which used the expected link between accretion of gas onto the black hole and the production of a relativistic jet.  We found that the cool core cluster would rapidly begin to precipitate cold gas clouds out of the hot gas, due to radiative cooling.  These clouds fell to the center of the cluster and eventually were swallowed up by the black-hole, but not before resulting in a jet of energy released by the black hole.  Initially the jet triggers more cooling by lifting cool gas up to larger radius, which it can cool and rain back down.  Eventually the jet becomes strong enough to reheat the gas through a combination of shocks and turbulence. This work has resulted in a better understanding of where and when the condensation of cold gas in X-ray clusters occurs, and how the feedback cycle from the supermassive black hole cycle occurs.  In addition, we made extensive comparison to observables, generated X-ray images of the simulated cluster, as well as images predicting the optical emission from hydrogen, which is commonly seen in cool-core clusters and traces the distribution of cold gas (two such images are shown with this report).  We have used some of the simulations to make visualizations, for educational and outreach purposes.          Last Modified: 10/14/2015       Submitted by: Greg L Bryan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
