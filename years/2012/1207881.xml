<AbstractNarration>We will develop matrix product state (MPS) codes for entangled quantum many-body systems in one spatial dimension including long-range interactions, necessary for the long-range dipole-dipole interaction inherent to ultracold molecules.  Our open source codes will be integrated into the ALPS (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations) package as part of the ALPS collaboration.   As more complex molecules approach quantum degeneracy, the number and complexity of many-body models to describe them will also increase substantially.  Additionally, searching for emergent phenomena such as quantum order requires exploration of vast parameter spaces and extrapolation using many different system sizes.  This requires us to rethink the way in which we design and dispatch simulations and collect and interpret data.  Open source tools which are to have a long term impact must be flexible to adapt to different physical degrees of freedom, different Hamiltonians, and different dynamical processes; they must be efficient to manage large parameter exploration; and they must contain powerful tools for extracting data from large simulations.  Our proposed MPS algorithms enable us to meet these challenges and be prepared for the next wave of ultracold molecular physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our creation of open source code for matrix product state (MPS) and related methods has the potential for new insights into strongly correlated systems, a standing problem in physics on which we have been able to make only a little progress so far.   Strongly correlated systems include high-temperature superconductors, an outstanding problem for energy technology as a sizeable fraction of energy resources are squandered simply in transmission lines; high-temperature materials have the potential to alleviate this loss.   MPS methods allow us to explore different models of a quantum computer, including in our main physical subject of ultracold molecules, applied to quantum computing.   Finally, the training of students in rigorous numerical techniques and high-performance parallel computing is key to success in a number of arenas in society, from the space program to global climate change to monitoring and managing nation-wide outbreaks of infectious diseases.  This award will support such training, and will support a principal investigator involved in that effort from the undergraduate through graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: For this grant we created a widely used and broadly disseminated open source code to enable rapid exploration of novel quantum materials.  Quantum computing comes in two flavors, essentially analog and digital.  While digital quantum computers are still under development, we have hundreds of analog ones, running on many physical platforms.  One may call these analog computers "quantum appliances" as they solve particular important physical quantum problems.  Our code allows one to explore and guide configurations of these quantum appliances in advance, before and while building them.  Some key theoretical questions we have addressed are what role entanglement plays in material design, and exactly how quantum things can remain on larger scales closer to our everyday experience, especially as we include dynamics.  Broader impact: There are over 700 physics programs around the country, yet they still do not include computation as a significant part of their curriculum.  We have integrated computation across the undergraduate major at the Colorado School of Mines, one of the ten largest physics programs in the US, serving as a model nationwide for a transformed physics major.  Other activities include serving as program officer for two divisions of the American Physical Society related both to scientific computing and to quantum simulators, and organizing large-scale extended programs on the subject at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics.
