<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate through the Biomaterials and Polymers Programs of the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  Partial funding from the NSF Engineering Directorate is provided through the Mechanics of Materials and Nanomanufacturing Programs of the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SYNOPSIS:  This project will create an electronic platform with the ability to resorb into the surrounding environment in a benign way, at prescribed times, and with well-defined rates.  This behavior is contrary to traditional expectations for conventional electronics, where the goal has typically been to achieve physical forms that display extended lifetimes.  The work described will develop a scientific and engineering base of knowledge on materials, manufacturing strategies, and modeling tools for a resorbable electronics technology.  This approach will enable important new classes of devices that cannot be achieved with conventional electronics.  These could include medical monitors, sensors, or actuators that fully resorb into the human body at the end of their functional life and environmental monitors that eliminate the need for collection or recovery because they decay into their surroundings in a programmed way.  Other concepts could include compostable circuits that will facilitate disposal of used electronics or circuits that incorporate strategic segments with timed transience to induce controlled transformation in electronic function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  The project combines a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary team of PIs with a distinguished record of accomplishment in biopolymer-based devices, unconventional electronics (stretchable/flexible), manufacturing and mechanical modeling.  The core intellectual content covers materials science (biological/organic/inorganic), advanced fabrication techniques, electrical engineering, and integrated circuit design, all together with theoretical modeling from the device to system levels.  Expertise in these areas will be combined to define the foundations of a resorbable electronics technology with target demonstration vehicles in digital and analog integrated circuits.  Specifically, the PIs will generate an extensive set of resorbable electronic materials and device designs and develop novel manufacturing strategies to process these materials and create functional devices.  At the same time, they will develop ad hoc analytical and computational models for resorption at the materials, device, and systems levels in order to integrate the findings and provide the necessary predictive and design tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  Successful outcomes will obviate surgeries previously required to remove temporarily implanted medical sensors and actuators, reduce the costs of recovering environmental sensors and measuring devices, and help to compost electronic devices that are consigned to landfills.  A new library of resorbable electronic components and compatible manufacturing technologies will be made available to the community.  The project will support graduate and postdoctoral training at the forefront of materials science and electronic device design.  Existing programs providing research experiences for undergraduates at Illinois and Tufts will be continued.  The topic can stimulate the inherent interest of the general public and will provide opportunities for contacts through museums and the public school system.  The Tufts site already uses the silk and silkworm aspects of this project to attract interest in these settings.  These activities will continue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we set out to examine a new approach for electronics.  Ordinarily, electronic components, such as those found in our phones or laptop computers, are made of materials that are engineered to be rigid, enclosed in sealed packaging and are mostly made of petroleum derived materials.  In this project we seeked to challenge this paradigm and investigate a new approach to manufacture a new kind of electronic circuit that (1) is largely based on benign, naturally-derived materials, (b) is not rigid but is flexible and conformal, and (3) dissolves harmlessly in the environment.  During the program?s course, we developed knowledge on the possible materials, manufacturing strategies and modeling tools for this approach.   We made extensive use of naturally derived "plastic-like" substitutes (based on naturally-derived materials from silk, for example) as carriers for electronic devices made of ultrathin silicon with thicknesses of hundreds of nanometers or less, or of entirely biocompatible magnesium.   To accomplish this research, we have combined competencies in materials (biomaterials and inorganic) science, advanced fabrication techniques, electrical engineering and integrated circuit design, all together with theoretical modeling from the device to system levels.  A complete set of resorbable materials were generated including: semiconductors, conductors, interlayer/gate dielectrics, substrates and encapsulation layers.  These were ultimately assembled in functional formats that were demonstrated to disappear harmlessly.  Computational design tools for resorbable electronics were also developed during this program to help in the design and optimization of these unconventional devices.   Analytical models were developed to account for the dissolution of the circuits and of the substrates. As an example, these models accounted for the dissolution of metal lines and dielectric layers made of materials such as silicon, silicon oxides and nitrides, magnesium, to name a few.  These tools developed to predict device performance, were validated (and found to be in good agreement) with the experimental measurements performed on prototype devices. At the onset of this research, we envisioned the possibility of enabling unique device applications in areas ranging from electronics with minimized environmental loads to those with benefits to human health because of the benign nature of the materials used. We demonstrated the use of the resorbable electronics platform in a health-related context by manufacturing a small stamp-sized device that consisted of a wireless heater made of ultrathin magnesium and silk  as an implantable device designed to eliminate infections.  A device of this kind could be implanted and turned on wirelessly through inductive coupling either eliminating the infection through heating generated by the electronic circuit or by controlling the delivery of a therapeutic payload through the electronic circuitry in the resorbable device.     Broad impacts of this work are in developing sustainable manufacturing approaches that are not dependent on traditional petrochemical resources and the associated reductions in consumption and elimination of hazardous waste streams while still being able to manufacture technological components with performance comparable to their inorganic counterparts.  While challenges still remain for scale-up and device power, these are contemporary themes that embody global significance and appeal to a global audience. People involved in the project (i.e. students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty) were exposed to interdisciplinary problems where knowledge from different fields of study had to converge to enable these unusual forms of technology.  The project has provided training and research development for multiple graduate students and postdocs that have published papers, were involved in research even in their undergraduate career, and have mentored their peers in these research projects, moving on to successful careers in academia or industry.
