<AbstractNarration>SES-1202971&lt;br/&gt;Cecilia Ridgeway and Sara Jordan-Bloch&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: How Mattering to Teachers Shapes Student Aspirations and Performance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on teacher effects and the teacher-student relationship has shown that teachers contribute in important and durable ways to how students function in school.  However, the ways in which teachers exert this important influence remains poorly understood.  This project examines the degree to which student academic outcomes depend on the students' perception that they "matter" to teachers.  In that way, this project complements extant research that focuses instead on teacher characteristics or student interpretations of teacher qualities.  The concept of mattering includes the sense that one is noticed, important, and/or needed, in this case by teachers. The project uses a mixed-method approach with data collected from ninth-graders at two large public high schools, including survey data, observational data, and interview data.  This study is grounded in social-psychological literature and links adolescent self-concept, the teacher-student relationship, and important social and academic outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This study addresses a central concern about the determinants of educational outcomes and disparities.  It intends to generate findings of interest to practitioners in education, as well as families and the general public.  Findings could also be used to inform scholarship in several disciplines, as well as future data collection efforts.  Findings may have implications for social expectations regarding the effects teachers can have on their students.  Findings may also have implications for school structure, classroom pedagogy and teaching practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While a large and steady body of literature has shown that teachers have an important and durable impact on their studentsÆ education, the ways in which they are important are still largely unknown. In this dissertation, I approach the question of how teachers influence studentsÆ outcomes in school from a unique perspective. Rather than focusing on teachersÆ characteristics, I use the concept of mattering to examine studentsÆ perceptions of their teachersÆ perceptions of them. A studentÆs perception of whether she matters to her teacher is driven by her perception that she is noticed, important, and/or needed by her teacher. Mattering is a distinctly relational concept, one in which perceptions of the other drive perceptions of the self. I ask how perceptions of mattering to teachers are instilled and manifested, and I connect these perceptions to important student outcomes, including effort, affect, misconduct, and grades. The central research questions guiding this study are: 1) How do students experience mattering to their teachers? 2) How are studentsÆ perceptions that they matter to their teachers related to studentsÆ functioning in school? and 3) What is the relationship between mattering to teachers and teacher significance? These questions are addressed by evidence collected from ninth graders at two large California public high schools (N=1001).
