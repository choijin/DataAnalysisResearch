<AbstractNarration>This award by Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program supports work by Professor Yu Xia at Purdue University to develop and validate instrumentation for implementing biomolecule ion/radical reactions on a linear ion trap mass spectrometry (MS) system.  A pulsed pyrolysis nozzle will be used to form and transfer intense radical beams to a linear ion trap, where peptide ions are stored for reactions.  The performance of the modified instrument will be tested from reactions between disulfide linked peptide ions and allyl or phenyl radicals.  It is a high risk/high reward project where efficient formation and transfer of radicals into high vacuum is a challenging task. Yet the learned knowledge will not only enable better understanding of biomolecular ion/radical reactions, but also provide a viable platform to study other gas-phase reactions important to combustion processes and atmospheric chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research and education activities emphasize the role of integrated fundamental scientific research and instrumentation, which establishes excellent training ground for both graduate and undergraduate students in analytical chemistry. Female and minority students will be mentored in this program and be participating in Purdue AGEP (Midwest Crossroads Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate) events.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding of radical-biomolecule interactions at the molecular level, is important for the development of new drugs and therapeutic procedures, but is often missing. Supported by Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program, the Xia group at the Purdue University has taken a unique approach by studying  gas-phase ion/radical reactions to attack this challenge and to enable collection of fundamental knowledge on radical attack to biomolecules. The Xia group has developed a mass spectrometry instrument for studying reactions between mass-selectively isolated ions with radical species.  This new instrument has been validated using reactions between peptide ions and carbon centered radicals.  This instrument will be continuously used to acquire a broad spectrum of fundamental knowledge on various biomolecule ion/radical reactions in future studies.   The research and education activities emphasize the role of integrated fundamental scientific research and instrumentation, which establishes excellent training ground for both graduate and undergraduate students in analytical chemistry. Female and minority students have been mentored in this program and be participating in Purdue AGEP (Midwest Crossroads Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate) events.  During the funding period, two under-represented high school students have conducted research in the Xia lab through ACS Project SEED program for an 8-week summer research.   The broader impact of the research includes the development of new capability of mass spectrometry in studying radical chemistry of biomolecules, which have implications to radical attack to biological systems.  The methods and instrumentation for biomolecules ion/radical reactions can be potentially used for studies of small molecule ion/radical reactions occurring during the combustion processes and in the interstellar bands or the upper regions in the atmosphere.
