<AbstractNarration>Carbon and nitrogen in soil, and the microorganisms that both form and degrade it, constitute a critically important natural resource. Soil organisms likely harbor the greatest biodiversity on this globe and by their decomposition activities maintain the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. In this OPUS project, hundreds of papers will be digitized for further analysis and placed on the internet for international usage. Breakthroughs in instrumentation and molecular biology are providing new ways to interpret the extensive historical data.  Analyses of all these data will lead to new interpretations on the age, chemical characteristics of soil organic matter and identities and activities of soil microorganisms.  The information will be used to produce a series of syntheses to help scientists better predict and mediate interactions between this important resource and other aspects of global change. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Soil organic matter and soil organisms form the base of the world's food and fiber production, and are equally important in rangelands as they are in forests. Improved biogeochemical models will help predict future changes and will influence management decisions.  The information gained will be especially useful to scientists, and will also be presented in formats such that news media can use to inform the general public.  Knowledge derived from this synthesis will be incorporated into the next generation of university textbooks, as well as public school curricula.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The synthesis of a scientist?s lifelong work can produce new insights and greatly assist in the greater distribution of knowledge to both scientific and general knowledge communities. This is best achieved through international publications and meeting presentations of synthesis data, hypothesis testing, and future perspectives based on basic knowledge and scientific concepts. This project involved the synthesis of 300+ personal papers, coordination with the world?s literature relative to three hypotheses, and the digitization and electronic storage for worldwide retrieval of papers for continued, international availability.  Hypothesis tested included:  The dynamics of SOM are controlled more by the extent and type of interactions with the soil matrix and by disturbance than by the intrinsic biocomplexity-recalcitrance of these materials. The soil biota are of primary importance to SOM dynamics, not because of their community      diversity, but because of their high growth potential and carbon use efficiency on labile plant    residues to produce microbial products, which interact with the soil matrix. Higher available soil N is associated with increased decomposition on short time scales, but increases SOM contents on century-millennia scales, especially SOM associated with soil minerals.     Broader Impacts:  The synthesis and review publications produced will reach a broad international audience and influence our science, teaching and society in general. These products include:  Bridging knowledge across scales in the age of global change. Differential responses of soil organic carbon fractions to warming. A textbook chapter on perspectives in soil microbiology, ecology, and biochemistry based on basic knowledge and unifying concepts. A major review publication on the nature and dynamics of soil organic matter: microbial transformations and stabilization of SOC.  A bibliography on soils as an environmental system, and A historical chapter on the evolution of ecosystem science to advance science and society in the 21st century.
