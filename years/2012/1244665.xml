<AbstractNarration>While the computing landscape is currently moving towards mobile computing, the security threats to mobile devices are also growing explosively. The prevalence of mobile devices and the significant increase of threats to their security has not been accompanied by sufficient related educational activities. Though the demand for incorporating mobile security into computing security education is on the increase nationwide, very few courses have been initiated for teaching mobile security, and there is a dearth of well-prepared available learning material providing hands-on experience. To address these national needs, this project is producing innovative mobile security labware to promote the exposure of students to these concerns and to provide them with hands-on real world relevant mobile threat analysis and protection solutions. The labware helps students to know how a mobile threat and its corresponding protections go into effect. The students experience mobile security knowledge with mobile devices and implement protection apps that are workable in practice. The broader impacts of this project are on the improvements of student learning, educational resources, faculty collaboration and development at three academic institutions in the three states Ohio, Georgia and Tennessee, and the influence on faculties in other institutions. The labware can be integrated into many computer and information security courses and will be made public and disseminated in academic community nationwide to benefit a wide range of universities and colleges that have the need for mobile security education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have developed two novel, experience-based, real world approaches to learning mobile security. We have designed two new mobile security labwares to teach mobile security in general computer science courses. These labwares aim to combine the technology of computer science and mobile development skills to provide an Android application as platform for student to learn and understand the issues of mobile security. These labwares have been tested in four computer science courses including Operating Systems, Embedded Systems, Computer Networks, and Web Programming. We have done pre- and post-evaluation of the labware in these courses and most students like being able to work with labwares and believe that the labwares would be helpful to apply their learned knowledge in class so that they could learn and understand the mobile and PC security more easily. The external evaluators also highly praised our work and suggested us several possible improvements and future directions based on the results obtained through this grant. In the future, we plan to introduce mobile security education in general computer science courses based on the experiences leaned from the project. Our goal is to integrate mobile security teaching into our curriculum seamlessly, including many other computer science courses which are related to mobile security. This project results in seven publications and two master theses.              Last Modified: 09/14/2017       Submitted by: Yi Pan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
