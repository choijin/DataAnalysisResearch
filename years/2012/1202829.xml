<AbstractNarration>High-throughput Screen to Characterize and Understand the Role of Synaptic Cell Adhesion Proteins in Neurons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many proteins control and affect the billions of connections among neurons in the brain. At the simplest level, the mapping of such neuronal interactions dictate how we learn, think, and remember. Moreover, when certain proteins are altered, neurological diseases can result ranging from learning disorders to memory impairment. This work will integrate high-throughput imaging technologies to characterize and systematically understand the role of certain synaptic cell adhesion proteins in neurons. For each protein, high-throughput microscopy methods will be used to image and quantify the cell morphology, visualize calcium signalling, and correlate the protein location with other neuronal markers having known functions. The results and broader impacts of this work may shed fundamental insight on how the brain is wired and how different neurons connect to and recognize each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The postdoctoral fellow, from a materials science and engineering background on the development and use of massively parallel scanning probe tools, will gain extensive experience in neurobiology, molecular biology, large-scale data analysis, and neurobiology in the context of imaging calcium signalling within cells. In addition to scientific training, the fellow will mentor undergraduate students in how to conduct research. Educational outreach activities such as teaching classes about recent scientific advances, writing web articles about biology intended for a non-science audience, and designing museum exhibits highlighting the intersection of biology and engineering will help engage public awareness.</AbstractNarration>
