<AbstractNarration>COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: High-resolution, multi-proxy Miocene-Pleistocene climate and environmental record from the high-elevation Zhada basin, SW Tibetan Plateau&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Timothy Shanahan, EAR-1226984, Univ. Texas Austin&lt;br/&gt;Xiaoming Wang, EAR-1227212, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will investigate the causes and effects of environmental change in the southern Tibetan Plateau.  The Tibetan Plateau figures prominently in models of Cenozoic tectonic, faunal, environmental, and paleoclimate evolution.  However, despite extensive research into these topics on the margins of the Tibetan Plateau, little research has focused on the record of environmental change on the plateau itself, and existing data from the plateau is complex and appears contradictory.  The extensive lacustrine deposits of high elevation paleolake Zhada in the Zhada Basin of southwestern Tibet contain abundant vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant fossils and preserves a valuable record of environmental change and vertebrate evolution spanning the last 9 Ma.  The proposed work seeks to use a combination of carbonate stable isotopes (e.g., d18O, d13C, delta47), molecular geochemical and stable isotopic (e.g., MBT/CBT index, d13Cwax) approaches to reconstruct the history of past climate and environmental changes on the plateau from the Zhada Basin sediments and to link these to the changes in the fossil record.  Together, these data will provide the most complete record of environmental and faunal change over this crucial period of time available for this region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the late Miocene-Pliocene, the Asian and Indian monsoons intensified, atmospheric CO2 declined, and a dramatic expansion of drought-tolerant C4 summer grasses occurred.  These changes have been widely attributed in tectonic, ecological and paleoclimate data and modeling studies to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau in association with the collision Indian and Eurasian plates.  However, recent evidence for a long-lived high-elevation plateau contradicts the hypothesis that the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau was the driver of these changes and suggests a more complex and perhaps spatially asynchronous tectonic and climatic evolution of the region.  The objective of this research project was to reconstruct changes in the hydroclimate of the southwestern Tibetan Plateau during the latest Miocene-Pliocene, in order to understand changes in uplift, the strength of the Indian Summer Monsoon and the relationships between these changes, global climate and the regional tectonic and paleoclimate evolution of the Tibetan Plateau system.  To do so, we focused on an exceptional paleolacustrine section preserved in the Zhada Basin, which previous studies had shown to have a distinctive, cyclic pattern of sedimentary packages potentially associated with Milankovitch insolation forcing. Our selection of this site was based on the evidence that it preserved a exceptionally long (e.g., 5-10 Ma), continuous and high resolution (10-50 kyr) record of terrestrial climate in a data-poor region that is influenced by the Indian Monsoon, providing a comparison to records from the East Asian monsoon, the Indian Ocean and global paleoclimate reconstructions.              Reconstructing changes in climate from the Zhada Basin sedimentary sequences required us to separate the competing influences of climate (rainfall, temperature, vegetation) and basin evolution on lake chemistry and sediment deposition.  To do so, we developed proxy records from overlapping sedimentary sections located at the margin and the center of the basin. Chronologies were generated based on magnetostratigraphy and the sections were correlated using a combination of chronostratigraphic and lithological data.  The primary techniques used to reconstruct changes in aridity were changes in the oxygen and carbon isotope composition of lacustrine carbonates and changes in sediment grain size.  A transition from a fluvial dominated system to a permanent closed-basin lake will result in an increase in lake residence time and more evaporatively enriched deep lake carbonates.  Similarly, an increase in lake volume will result in a reduction in depositional energy and a corresponding decrease in sediment grain size in the central basin. Although the isotopic changes may be complicated by changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation (associated with changes in source, temperature or monsoon strength), this can be constrained by simultaneously reconstructing oxygen isotope variations from marginal sites that have remained fluvial throughout the reconstructed interval and by using the hydrogen isotope composition of sedimentary leaf waxes, which have been shown to reliably record the composition of precipitation.  Changes in temperature were reconstructed using two approaches: the "clumped isotope" paleothermometer, an approach based on the temperature dependent "clumping" of isotopes in carbonates, and the brGDGT paleothermometer, which is based on temperature-dependent variations in the structures of acidobacteria membrane lipids preserved in the sediment record.              The two most significant transitions in our reconstruction occur at 6.0&plusmn;0.1 and 3.5&plusmn;0.1 Ma. The earlier shift is associated with the development of a major flooding surface and indicates the development of a large, permanent, closed-basin lake system in response to increases in rainfall caused by the intensification of the Indian Summer Monsoon.  At 3.5 Ma, conditions reverse and our data suggest that conditions became drier again. Increasingly arid conditions at this time occur in conjunction with paleotemperature data suggesting a decline in surface elevation at Zhada, and elsewhere on the southern Tibetan Plateau.  At the same time, paleoaridity reconstructions from sites on the Tibetan Plateau more strongly influenced by the East Asian monsoon suggest a transition to wetter conditions.  We hypothesize that this reflects a regionally asynchronous evolution of the two monsoon systems in response to regional tectonic changes. Synchronous with increased aridity, the Zhada Basin record shows an increased sensitivity to orbital (Milankovitch-scale) forcing of Indian monsoon rainfall, which we attribute to land-surface feedbacks associated with enhanced snow cover at higher elevations on the Tibetan Plateau. Together these results highlight the complex tectonic evolution of the early Tibetan Plateau and its importance for driving regional climatic and ecological changes that are not captured in more simplistic models of plateau evolution.  The project included training of two PhD students (one at the University of Texas at Austin, one at University of Houston) and several undergraduate student researchers.  It also involved collaboration with Chinese scientists.          Last Modified: 11/09/2016       Submitted by: Timothy Shanahan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
