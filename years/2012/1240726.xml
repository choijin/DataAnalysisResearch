<AbstractNarration>The objective of this EArly concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to investigate whether the software-as-a-service model is a viable option for creating sustainable cyberinfrastructure. While NSF-sponsored research projects increasingly create innovative software, few, if any, mechanisms exist to support the ongoing use, adaptation, and maintenance of such software. The ESOCS project will explore the sociological, technical, and institutional perspectives of sustainability. It aims to provide insight into: researcher buying behavior and preferences; the challenges of integrating payment mechanisms into software and university back office systems; and the legal and policy implications of operating a non-profit, for-fee service from within a university. The project will use the Globus system as an exemplar of providing IT infrastructure to the research community, tapping into the system's more than 4,000 users as a representative sample of the scientific research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results should be of interest to the many NSF constituencies who struggle with issues of software sustainability. The project will shed light on how for-fee software delivery methods can be provided in a way that is consistent with university and NSF policies, while providing a frictionless purchasing experience for researchers. Experiments with for-fee service models will address questions relating to acceptability and adoption patterns within various research communities. The for-fee service models deployed will provide valuable data and insights that may be applied to other large-scale cyberinfrastructure resource providers that face sustainability challenges when federal agency funding for these projects ends.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The primary objective of the Exploring Sustainability Options for Cyberinfrastructure Services (ESOCS) project was to explore whether software-as-a-service (SaaS) is a viable approach for creating sustainable cyberinfrastructure. We considered sociological, technical, and institutional perspectives, and attempted to discover: what services researchers feel comfortable paying for, and which not; how much will they be able to pay; how will they prefer to pay; what is involved in collecting payment for services; what technical issues arise when integrating payment mechanisms into cyberinfrastructure and into University payment mechanisms; and what are the legal and policy implications of operating a non-profit but for-fee service from within a university.    Key activities on this project included: developing a set of advanced data management capabilities and making them available to non-profit researchers using a freemium model; and engaging the non-profit research community to determine how such a model should be structured so that it can become self-sustaining.   We made a number of important observations and discoveries in the course of our work, as summarized below.    Positioning as a non-profit provider is critical to engaging with prospective users of a for-fee service. The established culture is one wherein software is considered "free", particularly when it is developed by fellow researchers. The ability of a research group to charge for software-as-a-service is, in part, made possible by positioning the group as a non-profit because it removes concerns that users may have about the groupÆs motives. This position greatly reduces the barriers to other institutions paying for the service.   Price sensitivity is tied to the breadth of applicability of the service, as well as the price itself. For a typical research computing center serving, say, 200-300 users, a $10,000/year subscription is a relatively easy purchase decision. The value proposition for the types of services we offered seems to be consistent with the total cost of ownership of commercial software with licenses prices in the $10,000-40,000 range.   Research computing resource managers and administrators are loathe to cede management or control of any aspect of their system to an external provider. Understanding how to position a for-fee offering such that it coexists within current control channels is key to adoption.   Privacy and protection of information requirements can severely limit adoption of software-as-a-service solutions. Data privacy is always a requirement at some level, but the regulations governing personal health information (PHI) are particularly challenging.   Certain technical requirements are best met by outsourcing to external service providers. This is counter to the "we can build it better ourselves" mentality that is common among academic software developers.    The sales cycle with most institutions will be longer than envisaged. As one would expect, the institution wants to see a clear demonstration of the value of the service before committing, and there is no accommodation made for software that is developed by fellow researchers.   An institutionÆs contractual requirements constrain the ability to deploy new/alternative software-as-a-service solutions. Further, existing vendor arrangements for common services within the university can be a significant hurdle to operating a for-fee service.   Our work resulted in the availability of the Globus data sharing service that allows researchers to easily share their data, directly from existing storage (e.g. campus cluster, lab server), with collaborators that may not have access to that storage resource, and without requiring that the data be moved to external storage system just for the purposes of sharing. This can be thought of a "Dropox&trade; for big research data sets". Globus sharing (and related capabilities for managing who has access to shared data) is  targeted at non-profi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
