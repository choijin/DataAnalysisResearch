<AbstractNarration>This award will support several projects that involve the mathematics of quantum mechanics.  One main goal is the development of computer algorithms for studying the quantum mechanical motion of nuclei in molecules.   Another main goal is to study adiabatic theory for weakly coupled quantum mechanical systems beyond the lifetime of a resonance.  Other goals involve the break-up of certain unstable molecules and the study of molecular resonance states.  Graduate students involved in the project will be trained in adiabatic quantum computing, quantum mechanics in random potentials, and many body scattering phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators, their collaborators, and their graduate students will use support from this award to study mathematical problems in quantum mechanics. One project will involve how to use computers efficiently when computing the quantum mechanical motion of the nuclei in reacting molecules.  Other projects will study various theoretical aspects of quantum computing.  In addition, unstable molecules and other systems with finite lifetimes will be studied.  Graduate students will receive training involving these and other aspects of quantum theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Professor Hagedorn has worked primarily in molecular quantum mechanics.  In addition, he has developed computer algorithms for studying the motions of nuclei in molecules together with Professor Caroline Lasser in Munich, Germany and Dr Vasile Gradinaru in Zurich, Switzerland. These algorithms involved the semiclassical approximation, in which the effective Planck constant wa small.  Nuclei obey this approximation because their masses are almost 2000 times larger than the mass of an electon.  Professor Elgart has primarily worked on quantum mechanics with random potentials.  Mathematicians have done much work on these problems in one space dimension, but there are many interesing problems in more than one space dimension.  Jointly, Professors Hagedorn and Elgart have worked on adiabatic approximations in quantum mechanics, including some work related to quantum computing.  Professors Hagedorn and Elgart have both advised graduate students.  In particular, Professor Hagedorn had a female MS student (Stephanie Gamble) who is continuing to work with him towards her PhD.  Ms Gamble's MS thesis involved study of a molecular ion that contained a hydrogen bond in which the hydrogen nucleus felt a double well.  Professor Hagedorn had earlier developed an alternative to the usual Born-Oppenheimer approximation for hydrogen bonded molecules together with Professor Alain Joye of Grenoble, France.  This technique allowed certain double well situations, but they did not know of any at the time.       Last Modified: 08/08/2016       Submitted by: George A Hagedorn]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
