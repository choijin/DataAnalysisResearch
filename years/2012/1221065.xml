<AbstractNarration>The RISE project is creating curriculum resources for dual language learners (DLLs) in science, technology and engineering (STE).  Participants include teachers in pre-K programs in the Boston area selected to target Hispanic and Chinese students and their families. University partners include Tufts, Rutgers, Miami, and Northern Iowa, who will work with ABCD Head Start.  An innovative feature is the incorporation of family funds of knowledge as a basis for the curriculum development. There are two research questions. 1. What are the most productive procedures for appropriate application of the full integrated RISE curriculum in Head Start classrooms serving DLL children?  2. What is the impact of the fully integrated RISE curriculum versus the comparison condition on teacher attitudes, classroom instruction, and quality, home-school relationships, and DLL children's STE knowledge and approaches to learning? In years 1 and two, 5 teachers are being supported, with 10 teachers in year 3. Participating parents are 40, 105, and 180 for years 1, 2 and 3. Professional development and mentoring is being provided for the teachers, and parent-teacher discussion groups are facilitating communication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research data is based on extensive classroom observations as well as interviews and surveys. For question 2, the project plans a quasi-experimental study of 10 RISE and 8 randomly selected comparison classrooms sampling 10 students in each classroom.  Data will be analyzed with ANCOVA. The curriculum will be based on the Massachusetts framework, one of only a few states with pre-K standards. The evaluation will monitor both the progress of the research and development and the dissemination to the target audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curriculum materials are to be posted on the Tufts University website and a commercial publisher is being sought.  Units are to be 6-12 weeks in duration, with a typical classroom engaging approximately four units.  With the growing population of DLL students and the recognition that early childhood education in STE makes significant contributions to children's education, this project has the potential for national impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Readiness through Integrative Science and Engineering</em> (RISE) is a curriculum and professional development project for preschool teachers serving dual language learners (DLLs). RISE has three main aspects: (1) science, technology, and engineering (STE) early learning; (2) home-school collaboration (HSC); and (3) a co-construction approach to curriculum development. In collaboration with Head Start teachers and parents, RISE researchers are creating standards-informed curriculum that fosters school readiness by engaging children in the explanation-seeking behavior of science and the problem-solving behavior of engineering and technology. RISE brings out-of-school contexts into classrooms by supporting joint activities and communication between parents and teachers. Through RISE's HSC activities, teachers learn to leverage communities&rsquo; and families' unique contributions to children's learning to enrich STE experiences for DLL children. To support teachers, RISE engages them in practice-based, individualized and ongoing supports, offered through workshops, coaching and peer workgroups.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit. </strong>The RISE curriculum framework rests on the Next Generation Science Standards. Science and engineering practices are explicitly linked to core concepts (&ldquo;big ideas&rdquo;) to create curriculum that invites children to explore, think, and talk about each big idea through extended learning experiences. These connected learning experiences foster deeper knowledge than comes through disconnected, one-time activities typically found in preschool classrooms. Teachers learn to move between more- and less-guided inquiry to engage children in the powerful ideas being explored. Preliminary evidence of positive teacher impacts comes from theme analysis of interviews and focus groups, teacher report, and observation. Teachers reflected on changes in their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">confidence level and attitudes toward STE</span> (e.g., &ldquo;<em>RISE made my teaching better&hellip;my understanding of science, feeling comfortable to teach it, and comfortable to take risks and build on what I already know</em>&rdquo;), their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STE teaching</span> (e.g., &ldquo;<em>we&rsquo;ve focused on fewer things but have explored them more deeply with students;</em>&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>I learned that I could point out STE concepts all throughout the day</em>;&rdquo;), and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">children&rsquo;s STE learning</span> (e.g., &ldquo;<em>The children. . . use science words [like] observe, predict, hypothesis;&rdquo; &ldquo;they learned to solve problems.&rdquo;) </em>Survey results suggest RISE teachers had more positive attitudes toward STE, and classroom observations showed that they demonstrated higher-level language modeling and offered more science learning experiences than non-RISE teachers.</p> <p>RISE HSC goes well beyond typical take-home family involvement activities. RISE teachers learn about the family routines and home and community resources that form the basis of children&rsquo;s prior STE knowledge, then incorporate those cognitive and cultural assets into curriculum.<strong> </strong>By facilitating respectful two-way exchanges, teachers better understand families&rsquo; unique contributions to children's learning, and parents come to approach teachers as partners. The RISE external evaluator wrote: <em>&ldquo;... several [teachers] noted that the RISE parent meetings allowed them to connect with parents in a more meaningful way.
