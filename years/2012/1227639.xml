<AbstractNarration>The PIs are designing, deploying, and studying learning in the context of a visually-integrated cyber exploratorium for design -- an infrastructure for collaborative visual design activities. The project is being carried out in the context of an undergraduate innovative design course, and the investigative focus is on design of and learner capabilities when using interfaces and environments for expressing ideas in visual forms that capture explicit and tacit knowledge and that can be shared and the affordances for promoting learning of ideation and collaboration around such shared representations of knowledge. The technological innovation is a cyber-infrastructure hardware framework that includes touch tablets, walls, and a wiki combined with software for sketching and diagramming and the socio-technical system around it that enables the kinds of high-end collaborative "play" needed for innovative ideation. Research centers on promoting learning in design; promoting the cognition of ideation in a social learning environment; relationships between visual thinking, imagination, and externalization; and how such a technological framework transforms creation of design knowledge and learning. Foundations are in the constructivist theory of learning, the social constructivist view of social construction of knowledge, the design of natural user interfaces (NUIs), and the view that cognition is embodied in the artifacts and affordances of the environment. The PIs are taking an ecological approach to examining the environment to understand how its combination of factors influence design learning, specifically integrative visual thinking, collaboration, and innovation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research has established the important role of exploratory "play" in the development of creativity and cognition and the central role of such exploration in ideation, especially in ideation of innovative solutions to problems and design challenges. This project leverages the possibilities inherent in natural user interfaces (NUIs) for promoting the kinds of collaborative exploration of ideas that is essential for collaborative learning, problem solving, and design. The hardware infrastructure being designed enables groups to articulate ideas visually, share them, and refine them together around a large collaborative multi-touch interface, to access those visualizations from afar and annotate them textually, and to share those ideas broadly with classmates, team-mates, and others. Such an infrastructure provides a foundation for supporting project-based and design-based learning activities in formal learning environments in ways that give all team members chances to contribute appropriately, record the contributions of team-mates for teachers and other mentors to examine, allow sharing and advice from peers, mentors, and experts, and eventually allow automatical assessment, help,and advice. The proposed infrastructure has potential to be used across all ages, in formal and informal learning environments, and in the workplace.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Our overarching goal is to create affordances and experiences for design students and designers, that enhance their ideation and collaboration. Thinking and communicating during the ideation process is primarily visual in nature, accomplished through the creation and exchanging of design sketches. To better support this process for students, we created a collaborative framework for design learning that we called "Visually-Integrated Cyber Exploratorium for Design" (V-ICED). The framework focuses on enabling design students to construct a shared understanding of design problems and solutions by engaging with each otherÆs ideas, and exploring the design space collaboratively. We introduced the concept of shared design "notebooks" in the form of tablet computers, and that of a shared "wall" in the form of a large display, that a team could use to discuss ideas with each other.    Intellectual Merit The V-ICED ecosystem provides computer support for collaborative ideation. We achieve this collaboration through a web-based framework where the work of each student is saved in a central repository, immediately accessible to their teammates. This work is also visually represented as a series of "paths", where each path &ndash; a collection of linked sketches &ndash; represents the development of an idea by one or more students. The web-based framework thus provides a means of collaboration as well as a visual representation of the development of  collaborative knowledge. We demonstrated that our model of collaboration and its representation has tremendous value in terms of storing sketches as well as group awareness for the team. We also demonstrated that the use of the V-ICED framework improves collaborative dynamics, reflected by stronger conversational turns (reciprocity), speech overlaps (synchrony), and participation equity, leading to higher ideation fluency and collaboration quality within design teams.   For design researchers, this representation and storage of collaborative design sketching augments other forms of data typically collected in design research, such as video/audio recording of design sessions, and wearable sociometric sensors. We demonstrated that the representation of collaboration provided by the V-ICED framework data can enhance design researcher's understanding of the collaborative design process. To do this, we developed a visual analytics framework that integrates this representation of collaboration and combines it with other data such as audio, video, text transcript, and sociometric data, in order to aid the design analyst in understanding design team behavior.   Broader Impacts Design is a ubiquitous activity in all product development, and every design process starts with an early and creative phase where ideas are generated, explored, elaborated, and multiplied. However, whereas prototyping, manufacturing, and even engineering are increasingly outsourced to foreign markets, innovative design remains one of the competitive edges of our nationÆs economy. In particular, there is a long-standing need to design scalable web-based collaborative sketching systems. The knowledge derived from the V-ICED project has impact for a particularly broad segment of disciplines beyond product design, including software engineering, business analytics and intelligence, and various scientific endeavors.
