<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate wall-crossing formulas for a wide class of invariants which appear in a priori different situations in mathematics and physics. Mathematically, those invariants are typically described as virtual Euler characteristics of some moduli spaces. The wall-crossing phenomenon is related to the presence of real codimension one "walls" in the space of parameters, where the invariants jump. In the case of Donaldson-Thomas invariants, the walls live in the moduli space of Bridgeland stability conditions on the ppropriate Calabi-Yau categories. Similar walls also occur in the theory of representations of quivers and cluster algebras. In mirror symmetry, walls correspond to jumps in the number of pseudo-holomorphic discs bounded by the torus fibers of an SYZ Lagrangian fibration. In supersymmetric gauge theories in physics, the number of BPS states jumps across "walls of marginal stability". The Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formulas for Donaldson-Thomas invariants thus occur in the physics literature on topics such as moduli spaces of vector ultiplets of 4-dimensional supersymmetric theories and supersymmetric black holes. Since these various wall-crossing formulas look so similar, one can ask for a common formalism. The aim of the FRG is to study the underlying "wall-crossing structures" and demonstrate hat the above-mentioned similarities are not coincidental, but rather reflect a deep underlying theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a frequently encountered situation in mathematics and physics that numerical quantities which in principle depend on various parameters actually are constant for general parameter values (they are "invariants"), but jump along certain "walls" in the parameter space. Wall-crossing formulas describe these "jumps" quantitatively. The subject of wall-crossing has recently become a very active one due to its relevance to a number of different areas of mathematics and physics. The aim of this project is to develop the concept of "wall-crossing structure" rigorously and apply it to problems both old and new in which wall-crossing formulas appear. The results arising from this project will be in demand by both the mathematics and physics communities. The FRG will also build a research community around this coordinated effort, involving a mix of junior and senior researchers, training opportunities for graduate students, and the rganization of several workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Wall-crossing phenomena, where a mathematical quantity that ought to be independent of all choices (an "invariant") exhibits discrete jumps across "walls" in the parameter space, occur in a variety of settings in modern mathematics.  The structure of wall-crossing jumps gives a unique window into subtle geometric phenomena, and can be exploited to arrive at new mathematical results.  This project has focused on wall-crossing phenomena in symplectic geometry (the geometry of phase spaces of mechanical systems) and mirror symetry (a conjectural relationship between symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry, inspired by ideas in theoretical physics).  Major progress has been accomplished on mirror symmetry for spaces defined by a single polynomial equation, whose algebraic geometry has been shown to be equivalent to the symplectic geometry of monomial functions.  This extends Kontsevich's celebrated Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture to a new setting (general affine hypersurfaces).  Second, the project has studied Lagrangian tori -- geometric objects that  arise in classical mechanics as energy surfaces for locally integrable  systems, and also play a key role in quantization.  New examples of  monotone Lagrangian tori were found in the complex projective plane and in 6-dimensional space. These come in infinite families, in sharp contrast with experts' general expectation that the very small number of previously known cases formed a complete classification. Wall-crossing formulas play a crucial role in showing that the new examples are different from the previously known ones.  The results obtained validate the idea that wall-crossing phenomena in mirror symmetry not only are a powerful computational tool to verify mirror symmetry conjectures themselves, but also can be used to find new answers to classical problems in symplectic geometry.  The project has also trained several graduate students and provided the subject matter for two PhD dissertations.  Finally, conferences held at University of Miami and UC Berkeley have  contributed to the dissemination of new ideas about the significance of  wall-crossing in modern geometry, making them accessible to a broader audience of mathematicians at the beginning of their careers, and serving as a catalyst for further progress in the field.
