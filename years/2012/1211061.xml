<AbstractNarration>This project will support a postdoctoral scholar and graduate student?s efforts to develop code dealing with tidal dissipation in binary systems, with a focus on exoplanetary systems containing hot Jupiters.  The investigators plan to do ab initio calculations of the tidal dissipation rate as a function of orbital period, mass and spin.  Results of this work will be applicable to astrophysics, planetary science and fluid dynamics.  In addition to publishing in refereed journals, the PI will make numerical results publicly available, and train a grad student and postdoctoral researcher, and carry out ?Math/Science Days? at a local middle school.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[In the last few years, the PI, with graduate students, have carried out a series of theoretical studies on dynamical tides in compact white dwarf (WD) binaries and exoplanetary systems containing hot Jupiters.  Although the properties of these two types of systems and the related applications are quite different, they can be studied with similar theoretical and numerical tools. The accomplished research consists of two parts: (1) We have systematically studied dynamical tidal excitation and dissipation of low-frequency internal waves in compact WD binaries using realistic WD models. We have calculated ab initio the tidal dissipation rate as a function of the orbital period, the WD mass and spin, and therefore determined the spin-orbit synchronization rate and the tidal luminosity prior to binary merger. The results of this research are useful for understanding the observability of pre-merger WDs and the outcome of final mergers. (2) We have studied dynamical tides in various types of host stars of hot Jupiters on an inclined orbit to understand how tidal dissipation may affect the spin-orbit misalignment angle and orbital decay. We have also study dynamical tides (including thermal tides) in hot Jupiters and explore how they may contribute to the observed planetary radius ``anomaly''.    Broader impacts: Our research is multidisciplinary in nature, involving astrophysics, planetary sciences and fluid dynamics, and thus is of interest to a broad scientific community.  We have published our research results in refereed journals and presented in appropriate scientific meetings. We have also incoporated our results into classroom teaching as well as lectures to the general public and high school students. The main funding for this proposal has been used to provide GRA support for several graduate students, who have received training in many of the multidisciplinary areas, as well as in scientific computing. We have also engaged several undergraduate students in our research.          Last Modified: 10/09/2016       Submitted by: Dong Lai]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
