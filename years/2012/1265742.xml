<AbstractNarration>This research is about obtaining a quantitative understanding of energy dissipation, interfacial structure and friction of model boundary films.  While theoretical methods have hitherto been able to provide qualitative insights into sliding friction, they have not yet been able to quantitatively describe the structure of a sliding interface and the associated friction forces.  The approach of this research will be to combine experiments in ultrahigh vacuum on well-defined model boundary films consisting of a range of isostructural alkali halides on metal substrates with molecular dynamics simulations using tailored, high-precision interaction potentials obtained from density function theory calculations of the same systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research will include an understanding of the friction properties of the boundary films that are formed by chemical reactions between lubricant additives or gas-phase lubricants at a sliding, solid-solid interface.  This fundamental understanding will underpin efforts to design effective lubricants that form films with low friction or wear, thereby resulting in energy savings and longer machine lifetimes, and benefit the United States? economy.  In addition, understanding sliding friction poses a unique experimental challenge because the processes occur at an inaccessible, sliding solid-solid interface that cannot be interrogated directly.  This means that advances in understanding such interfaces will rely on integrating experiments and theoretical methods carried out on the same systems.  Being able to achieve this for the simple systems explored in this proposal will develop the theoretical and experimental strategies for understanding more complex sliding interfaces.  Finally, the integrated experimental and theoretical approaches will provide a broad-based education for students and will involve both undergraduates and under-represented minorities.  Developments in theoretical methods and the refinement of experimental approaches over the past few decades have resulted in a fundamental shift in the way that science is carried out and will require both graduate and undergraduate education that integrates theory and experiment.  This has been emphasized in a recent special issue of Tribology Letters co-edited by the Principal Investigators of this proposal entitled ?Progress in Tribology Through Integrated Simulations and Experiments?.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit   The goal of the project has been to explore the structural and chemical changes that occur in a moving contact between two solids.  Such studies are central to understanding the friction and chemical reactions that occur in machines and engines.  However, since there are few experimental methods that can directly explore the structural and chemical properties of such solid-sold interfaces, the experimental results were analyzed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation which tracks the motions of all of the atoms in the interfacial region.  Because accurate MD simulations require a significant amount of computer time, both the MD simulations and the experiments were carried out using simplified model systems.  In addition, the experiments were carried out under vacuum to avoid deleterious effects due to the atmosphere.  The predictions of the model were then compared with the results of experiments to provide an atomic-scale understanding of the processes occurring at the interface.   This approach has been used to study how the pressure exerted on a thin film between two surfaces causes the structure of the film to evolve and cause significant changes in the frictional behavior.  The frictional force depends on how well the atoms at the interface are aligned.  If they are well aligned, or "in registry", all the atoms slide past each other simultaneously and give rise to high friction.  In contrast, if the atoms are not well aligned, or are "out of registry", the atoms slide over each other in a much more random fashion to produce much lower friction.  Our combined experimental and theoretical results reveal that the registry at the contacting interface depends critically in the force exerted on the surface where higher normal forces cause the atoms to move into registry with each other, resulting in larger friction forces.   The work has also studied the way in which chemical reactions can be induced just by two surfaces sliding against each other.  These are known as "tribochemical" reactions from the Greek word "to rub".  By combining insights from theory and experiment, it has been possible to identify examples of such tribochemical reactions and to discover detailed pathways for the chemical reactions occurring at a sliding interface and to measure the rates at which they occur.  Such results are important to understanding how lubricants function since they often operate by reacting with the contacting surfaces to form films that reduce friction and wear.   Broader Impacts   The new insight into how forces affect the chemical and structural properties of the interface between two contacting solids will improve our fundamental understanding of how lubricants operate to lower friction and wear.  Since energy losses due to friction, as well as because of the losses due to wear and equipment repair have a significant impact on the United States? economy, improving our fundamental understanding of such processes will have significant economic benefit by improving energy efficiency and reducing losses due to equipment failure.   This work has also had an impact on graduate education with and a total of five graduate students participating in the project, and well as several undergraduate students, including a visiting undergraduate from the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, India. The work has resulted in seven refereed publications and a total of 21 presentations at national and international conferences and universities, many of them invited talks.  Progress in our understanding of the fundamental aspects of friction, wear and the chemistry occurring at the interface between two solids has been brought to the attention of industrial professional and other scientists working in this area though bimonthly articles written in the magazine of the Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers (STLE) entitled "Cutting Edge".  These articles were highlighted in a recent special symposium at the STLE conference held in Denver in 2015.  We have also presented demonstration experiments for high-school students at the STLE conference that was held in Las Vegas in 2016.
