<AbstractNarration>The project proposes investigating the commercial feasibility of novel design methods and software tools that have been evolving through research in the Maryland DSPCAD Research Group at the University of Maryland.  The research has been founded on new models algorithms and design processes that expose and exploit the structure of signal processing systems in novel ways.  The research has been demonstrated also in the development of advanced prototypes that provide novel capabilities for applications in the area of software defined radio, surveillance, building energy management, and instrumentation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovation investigated in this project will enhance scientific and technological understanding; helping to rigorously integrate considerations related to usability and end use integration into formal modes and methods for design and implementation of embedded systems.  Also, the research that this project aims to transition has the potential  to bring about significant  advances in the efficiency and reliability of hardware and software for signal processing systems.  Signal processing systems have a wide applicability to a vast to a vast range of applications in the consumer electronics, enterprise data processing, healthcare, and national security.  The proposed technology transfer investigation therefore has potential to improve the quality of products and services in all these areas.  The investigated innovation will provide a unique opportunity for the Entrepreneurial Lead and PI to gain valuable knowledge and experience in customer discovery and commercialization strategy, which they will apply to their future efforts.  The project will also provide the I-Corps mentor and PI with valuable knowledge and tools that they can use to deepen the integration of innovation into research and education at the Institution.</AbstractNarration>
