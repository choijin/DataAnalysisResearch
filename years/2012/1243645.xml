<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: Mitotic spindle assembly is a highly complex and specifically orchestrated event that is necessary for cell division. It relies on a multitude of protein complexes, protein-protein interactions, and regulatory mechanisms driven by enzymatic activities. Current progress to generating a comprehensive map of the pathways that are critical for spindle assembly has been hampered by two major roadblocks. First, the complement of cell division enzymes and how they coordinate with each other to form the mitotic spindle is largely unknown. Second, there are only a limited number of chemical probes that can inhibit the function of these enzymes and can be used to define their function in an acute and temporal manner. To advance our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms required for spindle assembly and cell division, we are taking two complementary multidisciplinary approaches. First, we are characterizing 20 novel cell division enzymes identified in our proteomic and genetic screens with respect to their depletion phenotype, subcellular localization, and interacting partners. These data will be used to construct a cell division enzyme interaction network that will enable the study of mitotic enzymes as a biological system in time and space. Second, we are testing the utility of novel small molecules as chemical probes for dissecting the mechanisms of these critical cell division enzymes. This research entails the development of new research schemes, the establishment of interdisciplinary collaborations, the use of advanced technological tools and instrumentation, and the integration of data from diverse sources. This research will advance our understanding of the cellular pathways, enzyme components, and the mechanism of action of these enzymes for promoting proper cell division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This multidisciplinary research will create mentoring, educational, and training opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students from multiple fields including cell biology, chemistry, biochemistry and bioengineering. In particular women and underrepresented minorities in the sciences will be encouraged to participate. Students will receive instruction and training in advanced biochemical research methods and instrumentation through seminars and hands on training modules. This will enable students to conduct independent research, contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the mechanisms regulating cell division and to gain a lifelong appreciation of the scientific process. This research will generate large data sets and tools, which will benefit the scientific community and can be used to further understand how cells divide. All research results will be disseminated broadly in journals, as supplementary material, on our labs website, at research meetings/conferences, and at invited talks at colleges and universities. This research will benefit society by inspiring young students and enabling them to appreciate science and its importance for the advancement of our society. It will also mentor and train the next generation of highly skilled and diverse scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit: This NSF-funded research advanced our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms controlling the complex process of cell division through two complementary approaches. First, through the characterization of novel enzymes critical for proper cell division that our lab had previously identified, which included ubiquitin ligases, microtubule-severing enzymes and molecular motors like kinesins. This entailed the characterization of enzyme spatial-temporal subcellular localization, multiparametric analyses of the consequences of enzyme depletion and overexpression, the identification of interacting partners and potential substrates, the analyses of their enzymatic activities <em>in vitro</em>, and the generation of protein interaction networks to inform on enzyme cooperativity during cell division. Second, through the characterization of novel chemical probes that inhibited cell division, which could be used in an acute and temporal manner to dissect the mechanisms of cell division. This entailed the use of chemoinformatics to select diverse chemical structures likely to be inhibiting different pathways important for cell division, performing time-lapse microcopy coupled to a multiparametric analysis with respect to cell division arrest, outcome of arrest, chromatin and microtubule spindle dynamics, the use of bioinformatics for selecting key compounds to pursue and the utilization of chemical proteomic approaches to identify compound protein targets. This NSF-funded research produced 11 research publications (all from our lab). It also generated large data sets on protein interaction networks, an educational video, and developed novel computational approaches and an open access web server for defining the targets of novel chemical probes that inhibit cell division. All research products are freely available (open access) to the scientific community. Importantly, this study advanced our understanding of cell division as a biological system composed of a coordinated network of enzymatic activities in time and space.</p> <p>Broader Impacts: This multidisciplinary research created educational, mentoring, and training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from multiple fields including cell biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and bioengineering. During this funding period, 8 graduate students, 27 undergraduate students, and 2 high school students participated in this NSF-funded research. Importantly, of the 8 graduate students, 2 were women and 3 were underrepresented minorities in STEM. Similarly, of the 27 undergraduates, 22 were women, 10 were underrepresented minorities in STEM and an additional 4 were from disadvantaged backgrounds. This study also established a comprehensive program of student teaching and training through research discovery, which has advanced our scientific knowledge and stimulated the development of the next-generation of shared research and education. This in turn helped to ensure that multi-user facilities (like The Molecular Instrumentation Center Proteomics Core, the Molecular Shared Screening Resource, and the Biochemistry Instrumentation Core, which house proteomic, chemical, and biochemical instrumentation and software) remain sites of research training and mentoring for a large number of science and engineering students. The results from this study created numerous opportunities for research oral and poster presentations at meetings and conferences across the US and abroad that were aimed at engaging, educating, and inspiring a diverse audience. Finally, a major accomplishment of this research was our ability to recruit students from underrepresented groups in the sciences (minorities, women, and students from disadvantaged backgrounds) to conduct research and to mentor, train and prepare them for careers in science. This will benefit society by creating a more diverse workforce. Additionally, we have been able to inspire young science and non-science students to gain a life-long appreciation of science and its importance for the advancement of our society.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/21/2018<br>      Modified by: Jorge&nbsp;Torres</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
