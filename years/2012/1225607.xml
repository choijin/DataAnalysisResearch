<AbstractNarration>Regulation of the reproductive cycle in adult women is a dual control system involving at least eight hormones produced by the brain and the ovaries. This research project develops and analyzes differential equation models for the number of follicles (eggs) and blood levels of reproductive hormones during a woman's reproductive years from age 20 until menopause. The investigators' models already predict hormone levels that agree with data in the literature for normally cycling women, and the models have other solutions reflecting characteristics of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a leading cause of female infertility. Building on this work, the researchers will develop more complex, mechanistic models to describe a woman's cycling throughout her reproductive life and to track the "primordial pool" of follicles with which a woman is born and that continually decreases as she ages. Ad hoc techniques will be devised to estimate model parameters using data sets from multiple age groups. Model simulations will be used to predict and to study age-related and pathological changes in cycling. These include a decrease in serum inhibins, which is one of the earliest signs of reproductive aging, and erratic luteal levels of estrogen and progesterone, which may occur in women in their 40's. Tools from numerical analysis and dynamical systems, e.g., parameter identification methods, sensitivity analysis, stability theory, and bifurcation techniques, will be used to develop and to study these models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A woman's peak fertility occurs between the ages of 20 and 30. However, in North America and Europe more women are postponing childbearing until their 30's and must deal with the consequences of reduced natural fertility due to a decreasing number of follicles and changes in reproductive hormones. In addition, women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) often exhibit hormonal imbalances and insulin insensitivity. A goal of this research project is to model and study the interplay between PCOS, excess androgens, and glucose metabolism. A lifelong model for hormonal control of the female reproductive cycle may be used to predict optimal types, doses, and durations of hormonal therapies for young and aging women. In turn, given the broad consensus that hormone therapies be used at lowest doses for the shortest intervals necessary to achieve specific therapeutic aims, the impact of these modeling studies on women's health should be beneficial. This research also may advance our understanding of several types of increasingly prevalent diseases, including PCOS, infertility in general, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project describes mathematical models for hormonal regulation of the female reproductive cycle. These models are helpful for studying pathological and age-related effects on normal monthly cycles and, hence, fertility. From a study of US women conducted from 2006 to 2010, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2013) estimated&nbsp; that 6% of all women between the ages of 15 and 44 were infertile and 12% of women in the same age group suffered from impaired fertility. Although these problems increase with age, a spring 2014 report released by the National Center for Health Statistics stated that the "number of babies born to first-time mothers who are at least 35 is more than nine times higher now than it was in the early 1970s.'' In addition, life-altering disorders affect the female reproductive system including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and ovarian and breast cancers. Many of these problems are connected with impaired hormone regulation of the reproductive system. <br /><br />Hormones produced by the pituitary gland in the brain control ovarian development and ovulation. In turn, the ovaries produce hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone&nbsp; which affect the production of the pituitary hormones. This mutual regulation results in cyclical production of a number of different hormones during a month and this process can be described by mathematical equations. Our models consisting of these equations correctly predict blood levels of ovarian and pituitary hormones found in the biological literature for normally cycling women. In addition to normal monthly cycles, the models can predict other cycles which may describe&nbsp; abnormal conditions such as PCOS. <br /><br />For instance, we fit the model to two different data sets collected from normal women -- one collected on the US West Coast with higher peak estrogen than the one collected on the East Coast. Model simulations corresponding to the data with higher estrogen exhibit both normal and nonovulatory monthly cycles but simulations for the other data exhibit only normal cycles. This observation suggests that higher peak estrogen may lead to abnormal cycling. <br /><br />By adding complication to the basic model, a more detailed model reproduces monthly cycles of a woman from age 20 to age 51. Hence, this new model portrays&nbsp; behavior on the time scales of days, months and years. Model simulations reflect changes in hormone levels and in numbers of follicles (which produce eggs) that occur during that time span including the menopause transition, e.g., the continual drop in antimullerian hormone (AMH) produced by the ovaries. Model simulations suggest that treatment with AMH may slow the loss of follicles enough to provide more follicles for development later in life and to cause a delay in the onset of menopause.&nbsp; <br /><br />Clinical studies have shown that cellular insulin resistance occurs in approximately 65% of PCOS women. Resulting elevated insulin levels lead to increased ovarian testosterone production and abnormal levels of some other reproductive hormones. Model modifications include intracellular mechanisms of insulin-mediated ovarian hormone production. New model simulations indicate that as insulin levels increase menstrual cycle behavior begins to reflect PCOS characteristics, e.g., high levels of testosterone and progesterone deficiency. If insulin levels are high enough then nonovulatory cycles result.&nbsp; Further study will help us understand the relationships between the reproductive hormone system and insulin.&nbsp; <br /><br />In mammals such as cows, horses and sheep, it has been known for quite awhile that multiple follicles of ovulatory size develop during a single reproductive cycle. Because these follicles grow sequentially, they are described as follicle waves. Recently, follicle waves have been observed in normally cycling women.
