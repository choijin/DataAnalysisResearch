<AbstractNarration>Home networks are an unexplored frontier of modern communication networks. Despite the massive penetration of home networks, researchers and network operators have almost no understanding of how users configure and use them, how well they perform, and (perhaps most importantly) what types of new applications could be possible with home network infrastructure that enables easier management and more flexible application development. Many conventional network management problems become even more acute in the home, where typically unskilled or uninterested users find themselves with complex network management tasks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the advent of the U.S. Ignite program on the heels of the national broadband initiative, the United States will see increasing penetration of high-speed connectivity into homes. Access Internet Service Providers will thus be faced with an increasingly large customer base with diverse expertise and expectations. Increasingly, these ISPs are looking to innovate in "Home Area Networks" with new applications to enable remote troubleshooting, backup and data management, remote health care, energy management, and so forth. All of these applications will require an underlying network infrastructure that is flexible, extensible, and easy to manage. If successful, the applications that the team proposes to develop will help both users and Internet service providers manage their home networks better.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary  Home networks and the applications that they support are proliferating, yet our ability to manage these networks has not kept pace with this rapid rate of penetration.  As networked devices in the home continue to proliferate, and the heterogeneity of devices in a typical home network increases, home networks are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to deploy, manage, and extend.  The average user faces many hurdles in making changes to a home network configuration to accommodate newdevices, applications, or circumstances; troubleshooting in today's home networks is also nearly impossible.  Finally, despite the development of services and applications that can take advantage of high-bandwidth connectivity into the home (e.g., video, smart grid), the home network infrastructure provides scant support for managing this diverse set of applications.  We are developing the Broadband Internet Service Benchmark (BISmark) toaddress the shortcomings that currently vex both users of home networksand Internet service providers.  BISmark is a software platform to provide Internet service providers and users better intelligence about the performance of their home network.  Software running on the platform will allow users to diagnose performance problems and manage resources in their home networks.  The cornerstone of the BISmark technology is custom router firmware that helps users of home networks and network operators both monitor their network performance and define network policies (related to prioritization of network traffic, security, parental controls).  The BISmark platform represents an opportunity to develop a broad range of applications for the home that will ultimately improve ISPs' ability to provide customer care, and users' ability tomonitor and manage their home networks.    Intellectual Merit: Home networks are an unexploredfrontier of modern communication networks.  Despite the massive penetration of home networks, researchers and network operators havealmost no understanding of how users configure and use them, how well they perform, and (perhaps most importantly) what types of new applications could be possible with home network infrastructure that enables easier management and more flexible application development. Many conventional network management problems become even more acute inthe home, where typically unskilled or uninterested users find themselves with complex network management tasks.  The company that weare proposing to found will help address many of these management problems.   Broader Impact: Access Internet Service Providers will thus be faced with anincreasingly large customer base with diverse expertise and expectations.  Increasingly, these ISPs are looking to innovate in "Home Area Networks'' with new applications to enable remotetroubleshooting, backup and data management, remote health care, energymanagement, and so forth.  All of these applications will require anunderlying network infrastructure that is flexible, extensible, and easyto manage.  The applications that we propose to develop on top of the underlying BISmark platform will help both users and Internet service providers manage their home networks better.  Project Outcomes  We participated in the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program to help us assess the commercial viability of the technology behind our product, using the business model canvas as a way to understand more about the customer market, value propositions, distribution channels, and other aspects of our business model.  For five weeks, we interviewed many people in a variety of industries (focusing mostly on ISPs) to help us focus our energy towards a product that could be considered viable.  We began the program unsure of where to focus our efforts: On one hand, the technology is useful to users in home networks to help them debug the performance of their home networks and access ISPs.  On the other hand, the same technology is useful to Internet service...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
