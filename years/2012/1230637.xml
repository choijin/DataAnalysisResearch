<AbstractNarration>Program Director's Recommendation &lt;br/&gt;Center for Particulate and Surfactant Systems (CPaSS) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal # 1230367 &amp; 1230680 &lt;br/&gt;Moudgil and Somasundaran &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Partculate and Surfactant Systems (CPaSS) located at the University of Florida (lead site) and Columbia University. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will investigate foaming properties of green surfactants and the effects of presence of fine particles on foaming and frothing behavior. The primary goals of the proposal are 1)to understand physico-chemical aspects of the foaming/defoaming properties of green surfactant formulations and surface modified fine particles; 2)study the structure of surfactant films at the liquid-gas and solid-liquid interfaces; and 3)to develop efficient foaming/defoaming formulations. Experiments will involve the macroscopic measurements of foam/froth stability and a vibrational FTIR and Raman) spectroscopic study of the molecular organization of green surfactants in the liquid films of foams. A new FTIR spectroscopic method will be employed to acquire spectra of unstable bubbles. Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) computational simulation will be used to simulate the green surfactant systems. The DPD modeling will be adapted to facilitate interpretation of experimental data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this study will advance the fundamental understanding of the parameters that govern the antagonistic and synergistic effects of green surfactant formulations and their mixtures with modified fine particles on the foamability, frothing, and defoaming of the solutions and suspensions. The industries interested in the proposed fundamental studies include green surfactant producers, mineral processing, petroleum, paints and coatings industries, biochemical separation, cosmetics, personal care, and household products industries, as well as those interested in the environmental remediation. Specifically, a comprehensive understanding of the foam stability of green surfactants will lead to the development of new formulas for their applications in personal care and cosmetics products, while the knowledge about the fine particles interactions with green surfactants will lead to the development of cost effective foaming, frothing, and de-foaming systems.</AbstractNarration>
