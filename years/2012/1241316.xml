<AbstractNarration>Technical description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to partially support the 2012 International Conference on Three Dimensional (3D) Materials Science to be held July 8-12, 2012 in Seven Springs, PA. This specialty conference is organized by The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society (TMS), in collaboration with the lead conference organizer Alexis Lewis (US Naval Research Laboratory), the principal investigator (and co-organizer) George Spanos (TMS), co-organizer Marc De Graef (Carnegie Mellon University), co-organizer Henning Poulsen (Risoe National Laboratory and DTU), and co-organizer Jeff Simmons (US Air Force Research Laboratory). Additionally, an International Advisory Committee (IAC) has been assembled which includes notable scientists from eleven different countries who are working to promote the conference in their respective countries. The organizers of this conference seek to provide the premier forum for presentations of current interest and significance to the growing 3D materials science community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The format of the conference is highly conducive to interactions among students, faculty, and professional researchers, and ample time is provided in the schedule for rich discussions amongst the attendees.  An important component of the conference will be the student poster session.   Additionally, the conference program has been designed to maximize interaction among modelers, computational and image processing scientists, and experimentalists.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to partially support the 2012 International Conference on Three Dimensional (3D) Materials Science to be held July 8-12, 2012 in Seven Springs, PA.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of new technologies and products that contribute to the flourishing of human society is strongly linked to advancements in understanding of how the structure of materials contributes to their properties.  Traditionally,this understanding has been obtained from a variety of experimental approaches including advanced microscopic techniques.
