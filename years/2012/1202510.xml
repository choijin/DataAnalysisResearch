<AbstractNarration>The proposed Urban Massachusetts LSAMP (UMLSAMP), consisting of eight institutions located in the Eastern Region of the Commonwealth, will expand and scale up its existing programs that help URM students start on-track and stay on-track, thus significantly improving the probability of their successful and timely graduation. The Mid-Level Alliance will assist the participating institutions with implementing a proactive student-centered approach, which employs student learning communities as fundamental elements. The specific project goals are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-A 50% increase in the number of Black, Hispanic, and Native American students with majors in STEM fields &lt;br/&gt;-A 150% increase in the number of BS STEM degrees awarded to Black, Hispanic, and Native American students &lt;br/&gt;-A 150% increase in the number of students who successfully transfer from Alliance community colleges into BS STEM majors &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of the Mid-Level Alliance will be generated through several foundational project objectives: 1. Increase recruitment, retention and graduation rates, particularly for underrepresented students; 2. Provide LS-AMP Scholars with research and internship opportunities; 3. Promote institutionalized adoption of successful models; 4. Create synergies for STEM student success through interactions across the Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lessons learned, success stories and other programmatic outputs will be documented and disseminated through online communication channels, participation in national and international student success and STEM related conferences and workshops, and peer-reviewed publications.</AbstractNarration>

Services  Urban Mass LSAMP program started its program with a LSAMP model of services proven through data driven evaluations to have intellectual merit for increasing the retention, persistence, and graduation of underrepresented in STEM majors minority undergraduates. The Urban Mass LSAMP colleges and universities adopted the LSAMP model for customization around their campus services to enhance broader impacts for all their students but especially their underrepresented minority students.

The Urban Mass LSAMP program services included Facilitated Study Groups, Research Skills Development Workshops, and Mentored Research Experiences for undergraduates from the universities and colleges within the Alliance.  There has also been resource and talent support for special workshops and off-campus student internships from research corporations and organizations.      Achievements  Urban Mass LSAMP program alliance sites involve corporations and other STEM oriented employers in the education and training of LSAMP students through workshops and internships. As one example, UMass Boston which is a majority minority institution of higher learning has received support for its LSAMP Level 1 and Level 2 students through a substantive gift from the Sanofi Genzyme Corporation targeting its College of Science and Mathematics (CSM).  LSAMP staff were involved in the development of this partnership with UMass Boston. This partnership?s efforts have focused on four key objectives: enhancing programs related to retention and graduation rates, establishing doctoral research fellowships, establishing undergraduate research fellowships, and advancing innovative team-based undergraduate research.  Over 1,500 CSM students participated in research education and career development during the Academic Year 2016-2017 as part of a research workshop, lab placement, or research course.      Creating Knowledge     The Broader Impacts of the Alliance were generated through a number of project activities and services to meet project objectives:      Increased      recruitment, retention and graduation rates, particularly for      underrepresented students ? URM STEM enrollment for the Alliance increased      to 6,473 students in 2016 from 3,120 in the Baseline year (100% increase); URM baccalaureate degrees increased to 296 in 2016      from 114 in the Baseline year (100% increase.)   Provided LSAMP Scholars with mentored research and internship opportunities; 33 undergraduates placements into on or off campus based research labs in 2016. ?         Promoted institutionalized adoption of successful models ? every Alliance campus mainstreamed some innovative services from LSAMP whether it was FSG participation for 1-2 course credits, regular Pre-Calculus workshops to elevate math preparedness for standard STEM major course sequences, or sustained support from faculty for URM undergraduate involvement in research laboratories; ?         Created synergies for STEM student success through interactions across the Alliance.      Lessons learned, success stories and other programmatic outputs were documented and  disseminated to internal and external community members through a 5th-year program Impact Document.
