<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tactic versions of precision polyolefin materials are being prepared to define the importance of proximity of precisely placed chiral centers in a linear polymer chain. The chain-length distance between these chiral centers is of special interest. Crystallization will be examined in detail via variable temperature X-ray techniques and thermal analysis. The precision work will be extended to a systematic study of commercially prepared metallocene-generated polyethylene, since it is now possible to space branches as far apart as 75 carbons. Long-chain alkyl branches will be precisely attached far apart from each other, and the morphological structure of these materials will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The morphology of highly interactive structures, including those possessing ionic liquid entities, will be elucidated as well. Preliminary research suggests that ionic liquid entities, when placed precisely in the polymer backbone, lead to enormous inter-chain interaction in these materials. A detailed study of performance (tensile strength, shear thickening, etc.) as a function of counterion identity comprises a major part of this work. The research will be done in collaboration with expert morphology research groups in the USA, Germany, and Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the PI will synthesize water-soluble versions of these precision materials. Potential uses for water-soluble polymers are quite large. Of particular interest will be a study of ion binding in these water-soluble macromolecules. The research will begin using precision linear copolymers possessing both in-chain and grafted poly(oxyethylene) in varying amounts. The biological activity of these materials, particularly in terms of chiral response, will be measured as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better understanding of the behavior of the world's largest-volume plastic, polyethylene, comprises a major theme in this research. The PI and his group will prepare polyethylene analogues whose molecules contain branches at regular intervals, thus creating materials with precisely defined architectures.  The properties of these materials will be studied with a variety of techniques.  The research itself serves as an educational tool at both the undergraduate and graduate level, where the impact of interacting young scientists from a variety of countries is important. For example, a "Research Abroad for Graduate Students" program has been established to give students global exposure.  Included are interactions created by government institutions (such as found in Germany at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research). Further, the PI will continue to seek and educate undergraduate students who are in the "Florida Opportunity Scholars Program" and who are the first in their families to go to college.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research was conducted to better understand the chemical nature of the world's most used polymer, called polyethylene.  Our research group has a method to model this material in a manner than cannot be done in any other way. This method is an outcome of a discovery in our laboratory of a new chemical reaction many years ago.  Notable is that we can produce model structures to seek the real identity of polyethylene. Though quite old, the polymer's chemical makeup - which determines how the material behaves when used by the public - still needs advanced investigation using sophisticated preparation and analytical techniques.  We have done so.  In the process we have educated PhD chemists, Masters chemists, and undergraduate chemists.  Important to note is that every one of these people has been employed in the job they have sought; all of the undergraduates have proceeded to professional schools (such as medicine, pharmacy, or dentistry) without admission problems. Masters and PhD students have gone to industries such as Intel and DuPont; to universities as an assistant professor such as the University of New Hampshire; to postdoctoral positions at places such as Caltech, Illinois, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany.  In addition we have insured that this group of young people has remained diverse during their time with us, both in gender and in country.  The majority of our chemists are USA natives; however, we purposely bring students from foreign countries to cross-educate them in terms of culture, mostly from Europe and Turkey.  They work together for a period of 2 to 5 years, depending upon whether they seek a PhD degree or an undergraduate degree.  The Principal Investigator feels that this cultural experience is almost as important as the research done for the degree.  Further, we have sent several of the PhD students to Germany and Japan for short periods of research (1 to 6 months), where total costs were paid either by a separate NSF Travel Grant or by the country itself. Every PhD student who has done this states the experience changed their lives. Every student.  All of the specific objectives outlined in the scientific proposal have been examined, leading to our ultimate goal: to demonstrate more clearly what is needed from a scientific knowledgebase perspective to improve the function of polyethylene, the most used plastic in the world.  Though not funded directly by this project, the principal investigator is assisting a company that is producing green polyethylene from sugar cane.  It is a most interesting project and influences how we think about the work in our research laboratory. The company has hired on of our PhD chemists as well.
