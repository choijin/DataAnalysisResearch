<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to combine thin film inorganic and organic solar cells for higher conversion efficiencies (&gt;15%) and better stability. The approach is to utilize a multiple gap arrangement of inorganic and organic thin film cells, coupled with a novel photonic-plasmon structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;1. A multiple-gap cell arrangement to harvest the solar spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;2. An inorganic layer as the first, high-gap cell, to remove the damaging ultraviolet and blue photons. &lt;br/&gt;3. The use of a novel periodic photonic-plasmon structure, designed using rigorous scattering-matrix simulation, to optimize photon absorption. &lt;br/&gt;4. The use of organic materials with long wavelength absorption&lt;br/&gt;5. The use of stable contact and hole and electron-transport materials &lt;br/&gt;6. Unique measurement apparatus and analysis for degradation under varying intensities, light spectra and controlled atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;7. Utilizing easily scalable, roll-to-roll (R2R) nano-imprinting techniques for photonic-plasmonic structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The technology can be easily transferred to manufacturing using R2R techniques.  The solar panels can be molded into the structures of buildings or onto windows. The project will educate graduate and undergraduate students, mentor a post-doctoral scientist, and recruit minority and women students. The research will be incorporated into a new PV course at Iowa State. The solar cells, and a demonstration movie, will be exhibited at the Des Moines Science Center.  Simple kits to build organic cell devices will be developed for high school students. An industrial company, Lightwave Power, is the GOALI partner and they will develop manufacturing techniques.</AbstractNarration>

These properties are important for estimating the potential solar conversion efficiency of this material.  2.2 The electronic properties  such as deep defects, dielectric constant and tail state densities of the new PV material (Pb-halide perovskites), were measured for the  first time.  2.3 High efficiency solar cells were made in  both PTB7 and perovskite materials.  2.4 A new type of microlens was designed and fabricated to improve light coupling into organic solar cells.  2.5 A  new dual photonic structure was designed and fabricated to improve the light coupling into organic solar cells.  2.6 A new type of plasmonic-photonic structure was employed to significantly increase the light coupling into  thin film crystalline solar cells.  2.7 A novel organic solar cell with an inorganic heterojunction layer was fabricated which had significantly  better stability against light-induced degradation than a standard organic solar cell.     3.
