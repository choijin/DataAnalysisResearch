<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for seven students per year to participate in a summer research program in Biophysics at the University of Michigan. The site will provide incoming students with an interdisciplinary research experience at the intersection of chemistry, physics, mathematics and the life sciences. Since Biophysics is intellectually extremely diverse, the aim is not only to provide research experience in a subfield of the discipline, but also provide an overview of state-of the-art research in the field, and the experimental methods and techniques that are commonly used. Therefore, the research experience is constructed to have two components: 1) the students will be assigned to the labs that match their interest and that are run by experienced researchers to participate in innovative scientific exploration, 2) the REU students will be allowed (at their own choosing with the advice of their research mentor) to participate in hands-on exploration of biophysical methods and techniques (HEBMAT) that will introduce them to various modern experimental and computational research techniques. Thus, upon completion of the program the students will have gained exciting research experience and will have acquired a biophysical toolkit making them more successful and competitive in the scientific and academic environment. This core experience will be augmented by weekly research seminars and workshops, plus opportunities for social interactions, which will often be coordinated with other summer undergraduate research programs to broaden the students' integration into our scientific and professional communities.   This award is funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of Chemistry within NSF.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For the last 4 years, the REU program coordinated through Biophysics Program at University of Michigan has provided participating undergraduate students with a truly unique, interdisciplinary research experience at the intersection of physics, chemistry and the life sciences. Such experience is increasingly necessary as the borders between classical science disciplines become blurred. Altogether, throughout 4 years we supported 25 students that otherwise may have had limited access to research experience. Since the Biophysics reseach is cross-disciplinary, the train students originally majored in different disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology and/or neuroscience, providing them with trully interdisciplinary experience.  The programsupported following activities:  The students were assigned to the laboratories of experienced researchers that match their interest, The students attended weekly seminars presented by biophysics and physics faculty supplemented by lab tours whenever appropriate.  The students attended thematic workshops:    Laboratory safety and environmentally safe laboratory practices. Ethics and science. Preparation of scientific presentations. Graduate school:  why would one want to continue studying for another few years, how to      prepare and apply, and financial support for graduate school, etc. Preparing NSF Graduate Research Fellowship application.    The students had an option to participate in additional lab course (HEBMAT component) that would provide them additional knowledge with various advanced experimental techniques The students had an option to participate in GRE prep course   In addition students participated in a symposium on which they had to present results of their research. Overall our program allowed them to make carrier choices that will lead them on different paths of their future academic/professional lifes.
