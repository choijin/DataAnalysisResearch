<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop nanocomposite capacitor films with high energy density and low loss through the use of a unique synthesis process for high aspect ratio nanowires of previously unrealized compositions in this form.  High power capacitors are a critical energy technology, yet current state of the art materials only offer an energy density of 1.2 J/cc and have seen only marginal performance gains in the past decade.  One method to increase the energy density of the capacitor is through the use of nanocomposite that combines high breakdown strength polymers with high dielectric fillers.  Although historically nanocomposites have performed poorly in high energy density capacitors, HARP Engineering?s recent demonstration that nanowire fillers can improve the performance beyond the neat polymer is expected to produce materials that meet commercial demands while significantly reducing the capacitor size. The goal of these efforts will be to produce high energy density materials with low loss such that they meet the current demands for commercialization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lie in the development of high power capacitors which form a critical technology for power inverters, smart grids, electric drive vehicles and pulsed power systems.  However the current state of the art suffers from low energy density making them bulky and costly.  This Small Business Innovation Research effort will seek to eliminate the low energy density of current materials through the use of nanocomposites that capitalize on high aspect ratio fillers to create superior performance to the neat polymer.  The result of this research will also provide improved understanding of the structure property relationships in dielectric nanocomposites and will advance the processing science of nanowires.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ High energy density capacitors are critically important in advanced electronic devices and electric power systems.  Two general classes of high power capacitors are often considered, DC capacitors and pulsed power capacitors.  DC capacitors are a critical component of power invertors, the technology that converts direct current to alternating current in wind turbine generators, grid-tied photovoltaics, smart grids and electric drive vehicles (EDV).  Pulsed power applications include radar, lasers, rail guns, defibrillators and pace makers and require capacitors with high energy density and high discharge speed (micro to nanosecond).  These capacitors can release large amounts of electric energy in a short pulse typically less than a microsecond thus producing huge power densities.  Both of these fields often use polymer film capacitors which include biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC) and polyimides all of which offer high dielectric breakdown strength and low dielectric loss. The current state of the art is BOPP, however, itÃ†s low dielectric permittivity limits the energy density to 1-2 J/cc due to its low dielectric permittivity, thus resulting in large and costly capacitors.  For example, the capacitor in power inverter applications can occupy up to 35% of the inverter volume, contribute up to 23% of the weight and add up to 25% to the cost.  Ultimately there is no current high power capacitor that offers high energy density, high operating voltage and high efficiency.  Under this Phase I research effort HARP Engineering has sought to create ultra high energy density polymer film capacitors through the addition of high aspect ratio fillers, specifically nanowires to the polymer to form nanocomposites.  The unique addition of nanowires to the polymer leads to a significantly higher dielectric permittivity of the nanocomposite than low aspect ratio fillers, ultimately allowing improved energy density over the neat polymer.  The resulting energy density is unrivaled by commercial or research electrostatic capacitors and is two times greater than commercially available ultracapacitors from Maxwell Technologies.  When this high energy density is combined with an efficiency greater than 90% and the high breakdown field, the materials developed have clear commercialization potential.
