<AbstractNarration>How does a person learn to produce a new sound in a second language? The proposed study focuses on one possible mechanism by which a second-language learner might learn to produce a new sound: implicit imitation. Specifically, this study seeks to understand whether visual cues might facilitate implicit imitation of new sounds and thus help with developing speech production in a second language. Previous research shows that during a conversation, adults automatically and quickly converge with their interlocutors to sound more like them. In fact, this convergence occurs even when see, but do not hear the interlocutor. Not only does visual speech elicit imitation on its own, but imitation is greater for audiovisual speech than for auditory-only speech. The proposed set of experiments will examine how closely children and adults imitate the productions of unfamiliar sounds, both gesturally and acoustically, to determine whether they derive any benefit from audiovisual versus auditory exposure to the same sounds. The final component of this study will be to determine how different speaking registers can aid in imitation. The results of these experiments should add to an understanding of how the visual modality is relevant to second language learning, as well as determine the extent to which children rely on visual cues in speech processing.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Research has shown that both adults and children imitate the speech around them. This project sought to examine how aspects of the presentation of speech affect how well a person may imitate that speech. In particular, we were interested in how imitation is affected by just hearing versus seeing and hearing a talker, as well as the register of speech &ndash; whether the speech was directed to an adult or a child. The task of imitating an unfamiliar sound in these experiments is analogous to what a person learning a new language faces. We tested adults and 4- to 6-year-olds. Based on our findings, seeing and hearing a person, in a child-directed register is likely to facilitate imitation. However, this effect is different in adults and children. Adults tend to imitate irrelevant aspects of speech, like its pitch and overall duration, children tended to imitate the linguistically relevant aspects. Thus, seeing and hearing a person, in a child-directed register is likely to facilitate the acquisition of speech production in a second language. This is particularly true for children learning a second language. Our findings have implications for second language pedagogy. Additionally, the project provided an opportunity for several undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented minorities, as well as a graduate student to conduct various aspects of experimental research, team-building and mentoring. Several of the undergraduate students have since gone on to careers in rehabilitation sciences, for example Speech Pathology.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/11/2014<br>      Modified by: Megha&nbsp;Sundara</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
