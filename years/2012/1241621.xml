<AbstractNarration>Through this project, a novel photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) instrument will be developed to measure aerosol absorption throughout the UV-visible range of the spectrum. In addition, the role of charge-transfer complexes in the absorption of UV-visible light by ambient aerosols will be investigated, as will the hypothesis that this factor may be subject to change upon oxidation by O3 and OH radicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide insight into the nature of brown carbon in ambient aerosol and investigate how it may evolve through oxidation and aging. The project will also improve the state-of-the-art for determining aerosol optical properties, and for understanding the impact of carbonaceous aerosols on climate change and air quality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit This project consisted of two primary areas of endeavor: 1) designing and constructing two unique instruments for measuring the absorption of light by suspended aerosol particles, and 2) investigation of the existence and contribution of charge transfer complexes in the light-absorbing fraction of water-soluble particle extracts. The instruments that were built are state-of-the-art providing a spectral coverage unavailable with other such instruments, commercial or otherwise.  These instruments measure an absorption spectrum of aerosol particles in situ, that is suspended and not collected on filters, which can introduce artifacts.  This capability has allowed us to more accurately measure how particles interact with sunlight.  The discovery of charge transfer complexes in ambient particulate matter has expanded the community?s understanding of how and why the organic fraction of aerosols absorb sunlight.  Before this work, the existence of charge transfer complexes in aerosols had not been identified much less measured.  We have found that up to 70% of observed absorption by the water-soluble fraction of aerosols can be attributed to such charge transfer complexes.  We also discovered that there is a marked dependence of absorption on pH and that the nature of the solvent (water vs. methanol) is not significant.   Broader Impacts The results of this project has and will benefit society in a variety of ways, including by providing a more accurate representation of aerosol absorption for use in global climate models, which inform policy decisions regarding climate change and energy use.  It has also contributed by advancing instrumentation available to the field.  Through the outreach activities, this project has had an impact on middle school students and a teacher, high school students, college freshman and other undergraduates, and M.S. and Ph.D. students. The research and findings of this work has contributed to the M.S. and Ph.D. dissertations of five students, been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and been presented at national and international conferences as well as at other colleges and universities.
