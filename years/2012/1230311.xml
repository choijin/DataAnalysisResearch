<AbstractNarration>Walking for a healthy adult seems easy.  However, underlying this apparent simplicity our nervous system is performing a task of astounding complexity. Using sensory information about body movement, the nervous system coordinates the activation of dozens of muscles so that we stably and efficiently move through our environment.  For example, if our nervous system senses that our foot will strike the ground too soon, it will adjust muscle activations so we do not stumble and fall.  In this project, an interdisciplinary team of investigators aims to uncover the rules the nervous system uses to make such adjustments.  Using a general theoretical framework taken from engineering (used to understand, for example, the rhythmic control of the angle of attack of rotating helicopter blades), the method depends on gently perturbing a person's senses and body in various ways and observing how the nervous system adjusts muscle activations in response. The investigators will first test their methods on a simpler type of rhythmic movement, repetitive hitting of a virtual ball with a paddle, then extend the findings to coordination during walking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By constructing a general approach to understanding the control of rhythmic movements, including swimming in fish, flying in insects and birds, and walking in people and robots, the investigators may provide a foundation for understanding how control breaks down for people with neurological conditions such as stroke and incomplete spinal cord injury. This has the potential to advance neuromuscular rehabilitation and the design of assistive devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Co-funded by CISE and SBE]</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our nervous system controls both standing and walking using similar principles.  For both behaviors, the nervous system uses sensory information from vision, somatosensation (touch and information about our body configuration) and the vestibular system (our sense of balance). The nervous system uses this sensory information to continually detect deviations from the body?s desired configuration and position relative to the environment and to modulate the activation of dozens of muscles to correct these deviations. This complex process of neural feedback is essential to prevent falls.  System identification techniques from engineering have been widely used to characterize the properties of neural feedback for standing, leading to great insights into how our nervous system accomplishes this complex balancing task.  These techniques use small sensory perturbations (for example, small movements of the surrounding visual scene) and small mechanical perturbations (for example, small forces applied to the body) to cause small changes in the activation of muscles and the movements of the different parts of the body.  By analyzing how we respond to such experimental perturbations, we can understand how humans respond to perturbations in everyday life in order to stand without falling.  The goal of this project was extend these system identification techniques from standing to walking to gain similar insights into this complex behavior involving both balance and movement through space.  There are two challenges.  First, unlike during standing, the desired body configuration during walking varies rhythmically.  Second, perturbations can affect the underlying rhythm of walking.  For example, when we step on uneven ground, our next step may be shorter or longer in duration than average.  Building on previous work that addressed the first challenge, we developed a method that also addresses the second challenge.  This method uses experimental data to completely characterize how a person performing a rhythmic movement such as walking responds to any small sensory or mechanical perturbation.  Results have revealed a rich array of neural strategies to stabilize gait, challenging the prevailing view that the nervous system primarily modulates the activation of muscles that "push off" when our foot leaves the ground. For example, the nervous system also modulates the activation of muscles that are active when the foot lands on the ground. Understanding this aspect of neural feedback has clinical implications, since the control of such muscles is often impaired following stroke and in cerebral palsy.
