<AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to establish original results and open new research directions in stochastic analysis. A first objective is to derive new central limit theorems applying techniques of Malliavin calculus in a variety of settings including additive functionals of the fractional Brownian motion, spacial moments of the Brownian local time increments, winding number of the complex fractional Brownian motion, and diffusion approximations in a space-time Gaussian velocity field. Rates of convergence of the Kolmogorov and related distances, and convergence of probability densities will be also investigated in these problems. A second objective of the project is to study stochastic partial differential equations driven by a Gaussian noise which is white in time and it has the covariance of a fractional Brownian motion in the space variable. The existence and uniqueness of a solution, the regularity of its trajectories and its probability distribution, and Feynman-Kac formulas for the moments, are concrete goals of the project. The project also aims to establish the rate of convergence of Euler-type numerical approximation schemes for stochastic differential equations driven by a fractional Brownian motion using techniques of fractional calculus and variational properties of the fractional Brownian motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic analysis provides suitable mathematical tools to study ordinary and partial differential equations perturbed by a random noise, which are useful models in many areas of physics, telecommunications and economics. The application of these equations requires efficient numerical approximation schemes, and convenient estimates for the probability distribution of the solution. This project will make a significant progress in these topics by developing powerful mathematical techniques like the Malliavin calculus. On the other hand, the project will broaden the range of applications of Malliavin calculus, establishing new fundamental asymptotic results in probability and statistics. Motivated by applications in telecommunications and mathematical finance, the project will focus on input noises possessing long memory property such as the fractional Brownian motion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A basic result in probability theory asserts that averages of random and identically distributed samples, properly normalized, converge to the normal distribution. Starting from this fact, known as central limit theorem, the approximation of probability distributions by the normal distribution is a question of paramount importance in probability and statistics.  The study of rates of convergence and  fluctuation of the error in these approximations are central  topics that have been analyzed in the framework of this project.  For this study we have applied a new methodology based on the Malliavin calculus, which is a set of mathematical techinques that extends the classical calculus of variations in a stochastic setting. The combination of these techniques with a classical method for normal appoximation known as  Stein's method,  has allowed us to make substantial progress in the area of normal approximatinos.  The new discoveries include:  1) Uniform approximation and rate of convergence of probability densities to the normal density.  2) Quantitative limit theorems when the target distribution is a mixture of normal distributions with a random variance.  It has been observed that data coming from finance, telecommunications and other areas are not independent and exhibit a long memory property. A fundamental  model for these data is the fractional Brownian motion, which is a generalization of the classical Brownian motion. In this award the have developed the analysis of this stochastic process, obtaining the following basic outcomes:    1) Precise  rate of convergence and fluctuation of the error of numerical approximations for stochastic differential equations driven by fractional noises that have long memory.  2) Approximation of the distribution of certain additive functionals of the fractional Brownian motion by a mixture of normal laws.  Stochastic partial differential equations are random field models  that play a fundamental role in a wide range of areas of applied mathematics and mathematical physics including growth models for interfaces, turbulence in fluid dynamics and polymer models. In this award we have established new results on the mathematical properties of these models, obtaining the following outcomes:  1) Modulus of continuity for the three-dimensional wave equation driven by a colored noise.  2) Complete analysis of the heat equation driven by a multiplicative noise with a general covariance, including existence and uniqueness of solutions, modulus of continuity and intermittency properties.
