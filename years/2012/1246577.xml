<AbstractNarration>The Izmit-Duzce earthquake sequence (M=7.4, 17/08/1999; M=7.2, 12/11/1999) offers a unique&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to answer long-standing, fundamental questions about the nature of the earthquake cycle&lt;br/&gt;(mechanics of strain accumulation and release), and the rheology of the crust and upper mantle. The&lt;br/&gt;geodetic data set we are developing for these earthquakes includes both a well-determined preearthquake&lt;br/&gt;velocity field around the earthquake fault, and a network of GPS stations within the coseismic&lt;br/&gt;deformation zone (near and far field) that captured the initial, rapid, and ongoing longer-term&lt;br/&gt;postseismic deformation. This is one of the most complete geodetic records of deformation for any major&lt;br/&gt;continental earthquake anywhere in the world.&lt;br/&gt;Interpretation of the geodetic record is facilitated by detailed seismic observations before, during,&lt;br/&gt;and following the earthquake sequence, field mapping of fault offsets, satellite image (SPOT) and&lt;br/&gt;geodetic (InSAR) studies, and geologic studies of the 20th Century sequence of earthquakes that&lt;br/&gt;propagated along the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) from E to W fracturing almost the full 1200 km length&lt;br/&gt;of the fault (excluding the Marmara segment). Furthermore, the NAF has a long and well recorded&lt;br/&gt;historical seismic record extending back almost 2000 years that, along with the well-constrained&lt;br/&gt;paleoseismic record and recent geodetic observations, provides an extensive data set for testing&lt;br/&gt;earthquake models of continental faulting.&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with our Turkish partners, we propose to use an extensive catalogue of available&lt;br/&gt;GPS and InSAR data to constrain continuing deformation following the Izmit-Duzce earthquake&lt;br/&gt;sequence, and to extend our modeling effort to produce a quantitative description of the dynamics of the&lt;br/&gt;NAF system seismic cycle. The proposed research builds on our prior efforts (Ergintav et al., 2009; Hearn&lt;br/&gt;et al., 2009) that included analysis of 6.5 years of postseismic GPS observations (both continuous [CGPS]&lt;br/&gt;and survey [SGPS]) to characterize the temporal and spatial behavior of initial, and early postseismic&lt;br/&gt;motions, and dynamic modeling for the initial 2.5-year period following the earthquake sequence. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, an important new constraint on postseismic deformation is provided by recent InSAR analysis&lt;br/&gt;(Cakir et al., 2012) that requires a re-evaluation of the role of afterslip along a substantial segment of the&lt;br/&gt;coseismic fault late in the postseismic period, potentially with major implications for seismic hazards.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will provide an important set of observations on the nature&lt;br/&gt;of the earthquake cycle for a major continental strike-slip fault with direct implications for earthquake&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, estimating earthquake repeat times, crust and upper mantle rheology as a function of the state&lt;br/&gt;of stress, and interaction between earthquake processes and regional tectonics. This case study provides information on the mechanics of continental strike-slip faults in general, including the San Andreas Fault, earthquake and tsunami hazards in the greater Istanbul area, and opportunities for international scientific collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
