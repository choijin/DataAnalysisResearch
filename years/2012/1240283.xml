<AbstractNarration>This grant provides support for the EcoCAR 2: Plugging into the Future Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition.  The NSF will provide support for the ?EcoCAR 2 NSF Outstanding Faculty Advisory Awards?.  EcoCAR 2 is a new three year collegiate advanced vehicle technology engineering competition jointly sponsored by the NSF, United States Department of Energy, Natural Resources Canada, the automotive industry (General Motors)  and suppliers such as Cisco Systems, Mathworks, A123, dSPACE, Freescale Semiconductor, Caterpillar, etc.), and is managed by the Argonne National Laboratory.  This is a continuation of the highly successful educational experience for undergraduate students at US and Canadian universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This competition challenges fifteen universities across North America to explore solutions to minimize energy consumption and reduce emissions while designing comfortable, safe, road-vehicles commercially viable vehicles.  At the conclusion of each year of EcoCAR2, all fifteen teams will get together for a week long competition were they will be competing for the coveted first place trophy.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit &ndash;  To address the concerns for the environment, dependency on foreign oil and fluctuating fuel prices, the Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition (AVTC) program is designed to combine the interest of governments, industry, and academia in a single effort toward sustainable mobility.  Future vehicles for personal transportation in North America and around the world are undergoing the greatest design changes in the history of the automotive industry.  The transformation of this global industry is happening at a rate that is historically unprecedented, driven by regulations that reflect society's need for reducing the world-wide demand for oil, constraining the growth of carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation sector, and improving air quality in densely-populated urban areas. These requirements pose major challenges for the established automotive supply chain and design process.  These transformational changes in an industry, so integral to economic prosperity and personal freedom around the world, require transformational ways of approaching the design of vehicles.  AVTCs provides an opportunity for future engineers preparing to join the job market. Students are presented with unparalleled opportunity to gain a wealth of knowledge and hands-on experience to hit the ground running. AVTCs prepares a workforce capable of designing a new generation of vehicles with more advanced, innovative, and energy-efficient technology than ever before through the use of advanced powertrains and renewable fuels, as well as other new advanced vehicle technologies and innovations. Perhaps even more importantly, AVTCs gives students the experience and connections they need to help these technologies proliferate throughout the automotive industry.  Broader Impact &ndash;  The Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition (AVTC) program was established by Argonne  National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy in 1988. More than 16,500 students from  93 universities have actively participated in the program since the inception of this program. Students are working to improve actual production vehicles and learning first-hand the real-world engineering tradeoffs between performance, energy efficiency and emissions, as well as the impact of cost, safety, and consumer expectations.  They have been joined by thousands of others students over the program's history who are involved in supportive roles, as well as multidisciplinary collaborations.  The reach of the program extends globally through its Model Based Design Curriculum initiative.  The program reaches tens of thousands of K-12 students through an outreach program aimed at attracting youth into STEM careers.  Based on a 2013 study, AVTC graduates have a 100% hire rate upon graduation, 83% enter the automotive industry, and starting salaries outpace their fellow graduates by $14K/year.  Since 2008, AVTC program alumni had 115 Masters' thesis, 36 PhD dissertations, and 63 new university engineering courses based on EcoCAR content.  More than 69 patent applications have been filled from AVTC graduates and more than $760M of in-kind and cash support was donated to participating universities from 2011-2014.  53% of GM-hired AVTC alumni have credit for at least one piece of protected intellectual property within two years of working in the company.   Project Outcomes &ndash;  NSF awarded $275,000 to the support the EcoCAR 2: Plugging In to the Future Competition project in 2012, 2013, and 2014. These funds were used to support the Faculty Awards each year ($20K) and helped defray other annual competition expenses ($50K) such as rental equipment including tents, tables/chairs, restrooms and audio-visual equipment.  Additional support ($65K) was provided to support the development of Model Based Design Curriculum.  Listed below are awards and recognitions of faculty in each of the three years of the project:   In 2012:  2012 NSF Outstanding Incoming Advisor Award win...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
