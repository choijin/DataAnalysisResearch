<AbstractNarration>This proposal addresses the hardware, control and planning technologies required to achieve soft robotic systems, in order to offer inherent safety and adaptation to the human-machine systems of the future. The project is motivated by a broad range of aspects of human-robot interaction, including soft augmentation tools for safe compliant manipulation, soft exoskeletons for rehabilitation of neuromuscular disorders, or active clamping systems that can conform to arbitrary surfaces. The proposed research will address the algorithmic and device-level challenges that arise in the design of soft compliant robots capable of pose-invariant and shape-invariant grasping. A combination of algorithmic solutions to modeling, control, planning, and adaptation will lead to new soft compliant manipulators that do not need accurate geometric models for grasping. By designing soft compliant fingers and hands, new approaches to grasp planning and manipulation will be enabled. A novel composable actuation system and supporting planning and control algorithms with features inspired by natural muscle will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Soft robots are inherently low-cost. Affordable soft manipulators will enable in-home assistants for the elderly or incapacitated, but these robots must be able to manipulate the natural world as easily as people do. The next generation robot manipulators will also support new levels of factory automation, in which robots will work synergistically with humans with the ultimate goal of reducing the cost of manufacturing in the USA. The proposed soft devices will provide a new approach to assistive and rehabilitative usage of compliant robotic platforms. Their functional compliant properties will enable them to work side-by-side with human beings or as part of their bodies, to augment and improve human productivity and performance. This new wearable soft robotic technology will not only help workers perform tasks, but also improve the quality of life for many people. In addition, the PIs have a long tradition of integrating research and education by providing research training at all levels, from high-school teachers and students to undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs. A range of activities to reach out to undergraduate students, high-school communities, women and minorities is planned.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has resulted in several breakthroughs for soft co-robots. Our emphasis has been on the component level, creating new concepts for soft sensors and soft actuators that can form the basis for effective yet safe soft robots.  We have developed fluid-elastomer composite sensors for applications that require measurement of very high strains, such as wearable sensor applications. We have demonstrated these sensors in wearable applications involving measurement of complex wrist motions. This concept lends itself to wearable sensors for human-robot or human-computer interactions and control of wearable co-robots. Related, we have developed fabrication strategies to embed these sensors within soft actuators monolithically. This has been guided by the collaboration with the Rus and Correll labs and breakthroughs with their soft sensor-actuator combinations. We have created a new concept for fluidic soft yet strong actuators in collaboration with the Rus lab (see figure). This concept uses an origami-like internal "skeleton" surrounded by a soft "skin". When a vacuum is applied within the skin, the actuator contracts, guided by the fold pattern of the internal skeleton and strengthened by stress developed in the skin. In this way, we can create actuators that exceed the properties of natural muscle along many important metrics. The motion of these actuators can be programmed by choice of the fold pattern. Furthermore, the use of vacuum pressure results in actuators that are inherently soft (as opposed to fluidic actuators driven by positive pressure that are subject to potential rupture). This quality is important for co-robots and human-robot teams.   Throughout this project we have leveraged our results to promote the exciting nature of robotics (and soft robotics specifically) at outreach events aimed at broadening participation in STEM.
