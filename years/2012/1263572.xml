<AbstractNarration>Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a valvular disease in which the mitral valve does not close properly, thereby allowing blood to flow backward from the left ventricle to the left atrium of the heart. MR is among the most prevalent valve problems in the Western world. Doppler echocardiography has recently emerged as the method of choice for the non-invasive detection and evaluation of MR severity. However, due to the various color Doppler limitations, the accurate quantification of MR remains one of the major challenges in modern echocardiography. This is particularly the case with eccentric, wall-hugging regurgitant jets, known as the Coanda effect. This form of MR is currently very difficult to quantify and may lead to gross under-estimation of regurgitant volume by inexperienced cardiovascular observers. Using mathematical modeling, bifurcation analysis, and numerical simulations, combined with the in vitro experimental modeling of MR, and clinical experience, the investigators are developing a state-of-the-art tool for accurate non-invasive assessment of mitral regurgitation. The mathematical approach utilizes the most recent advances in fluid-structure interaction, modeling the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid, coupled with the motion of an elastic regurgitant orifice simulating the regurgitant valve. A bifurcation diagram providing the information about different types of MR is being developed. The in vitro model is based on a pulsatile flow loop incorporating a mock imaging chamber, which contains a regurgitant orifice simulating the flow conditions encountered in patients with MR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an exciting, new study, addressing a significant problem in the development of non-invasive diagnostic tools for the quantification of valvular regurgitation. The interdisciplinary team of investigators is developing sophisticated novel mathematics, high performance computing, and in vitro experimental tools, which, when used together, provide novel information about the severity of mitral valve regurgitation, that could not be obtained by using each individual approach separately. Based on this collaborative endeavor, detailed information about the blood flow conditions in patient regurgitant valves will be obtained, that could not be obtained by using classical 2D or even 3D echocardiography. This information will be used to quantify the severity of MR, which is the fundamental data on which surgical interventions are decided. The complementary mathematical tools, combined with the echocardiographic images, and clinical experience, support the next step in the evolution of modern 3D echocardiography for non-invasive diagnosis of pathological complex intra-cardiac flows. The broader impacts will be achieved through student education via interdisciplinary training and interdisciplinary course preparation. Two of the investigators are women, and active recruitment of women and minorities will continue. This project contributes toward building a strong partnership between academia (University of Houston) and health/medical industry (The Methodist Hospital).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The results from this project provide a new understanding of the behavior of intracardiac flows during a valvular disease known as the mitral valve regurgitation (MR). Mitral regurgitation is a disease in which the mitral valve does not close properly, thereby allowing blood to flow backward from the left ventrice to the left atrium of the heart. MR can lead to atrial arrhythmias, pulmonary artery hypertehsion, congestive heart failure, and death. MR is among the most prevalent valve problems in the western world. Doppler echocardiography has recently emerged as the method of choice for the non-invasive detection and evaluation of MR severity. However, due to the various color Doppler limitations, the accurate quantification of MR remains one of the major challenges in modern echocardiography. This is particularly the case with eccentric, wall-hugging regurgitant jets, also known as Coanda effect, which appear smaller on the echocardiographic image of MR, leading to a gross under-estimation of regulrgitant volume by inexperienced cardiovascular observers.</p> <p>To address this problem, we developed complementary <em>in silico</em> (mathematical and computational) models, and <em>in vitro</em> (experimental) models of the left atrium, the left ventricle, and several different regurgitant mitral valve orifices. Flow conditions corresponding to mild, moderate and severe MR were generated in the experimental set up at the Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center. At the same time, mathematical models of blood flow throught regurgitant orifices were generated based on the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible, viscous fluid. A model for fluid-structure interaction describing the interaction between blood flow and regulrgitant orifice was developed and implemented computationally. Using mathematical bifurcation theory, solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible, viscous fluid were investigated for symmetry breaking leading to the Coanda effect. Based on the information provided by the mathematical bifurcation theory, a regurgitant orifice was manufactured at the Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center, and the corresponding flow rate was generated in the <em>in vitro</em> set up to produce regurgitant flow exhibiting Coanda effect. Novel computational approaches were developed to simulate the corresponding moderate-to-high Reynolds number flows. Numerical simulations provided detailed information about the complex flow features of regurgitant Coanda flow in the left atrium. Echocardiographic images were obtained of the same flow and compared with the numerical simulations. The following conclusions were obtained:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Regurgitant jets associated with prolapsed mitral valves can be classified into two categories: <em>deflected jets</em> and <em>Coanda jets</em>. Deflected jets follow the direction of flow determined by the prolapsed orifice,&nbsp; while Coanda jets exhibit strong wall-hugging behavior.</p> <p>2. Coanda jets typically occur for larger orifice aspect ratios and larger Reynolds numbers, which are associated with larger regurgitant volumes.</p> <p>3. Using a single plane 2D color Doppler jet area size methodology to estimate the severity of mitral regurgitation is not a reliable tool for estimation of regurgitant volume.</p> <p>4. Regurgitant jets passing though prolapsed orifices with small aspect ratio exhibiting large regurgitant volumes, have significant 3D flow features that cannot be captured by single plane 2D color Doppler screening. <strong>Such jets</strong><strong> are more likely to be under-estimated in severity of mitral regurgitation.</strong></p> <p>5. <strong>Vortex rolls</strong> appear in the left atrium for regurgitant jets passing through orifices with larger Reynolds numbers. The smaller the orifice aspect ratio, the larger the 3D vortex roll effects. This is the first time vortex rolls have been associated with regurgitant jets in the left atrium. The role of regurgitant vortex dynamics in the left atrium (LA) on LA remodeling is completely unexplored.</p> <p>In conclusion, the work performed in this study presents the first comprehensive analysis of regurgitant mitral valve flows in a mock left atrium.&nbsp; A two-parameter study of flow showing transition to eccentric, wall-hugging Coanda jets was performed, explaining the role of orifice aspect ratio and regurgitant volume in the formation of Coanda jets <em>in vitro</em>. For the first time the role of <strong>vortex rolls</strong> on the under-estimation of regurgitant volume using 2D color Doppler echocardiography was explained. While the role of vortices in the left ventricle has been studied in the past, the identification of the presence of vortex rolls in the left atrium during regurgitation is new. It would be interesting to see if the presence of vortex rolls in the left atrium during regurgitation is associated with the known LA remodeling in patients with severe MR. Perhaps one of the goals of a successful&nbsp; mitral valve repair sould be to minimize (or optimize) LA vortex dynamics that may speed up reverse remodeling of LA.</p> <p><br />This work has introduced a new concept in clinical imaging which emphasizes that the <strong>quality</strong> and not only the <strong>quantity</strong> of regurgitant flow matters in the assessment of severity of mitral valve regurgitation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Suncica&nbsp;Canic</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263572/1263572_10281510_1514907988913_Heart_Chamber_III_large--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263572/1263572_10281510_1514907988913_Heart_Chamber_III_large--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mock Heart Chamber"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263572/1263572_10281510_1514907988913_Heart_Chamber_III_large--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mock Heart Chamber"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Anatomically correct Mock Heart Chamber simulating the left ventricle, the left atrium, and a regurgitant orifice.</div> <div class="imageCredit">The Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Institute</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Suncica&nbsp;Canic</div> <div class="imageTitle">Mock Heart Chamber</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263572/1263572_10281510_1514908229449_YEAR2_3DsimulationComparison_SHORT--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263572/1263572_10281510_1514908229449_YEAR2_3DsimulationComparison_SHORT--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Wall hugging regurgitant flow."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263572/1263572_10281510_1514908229449_YEAR2_3DsimulationComparison_SHORT--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Wall hugging regurgitant flow."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Comparison between the computationally simulated regurgitant flow (left) and echocardiographic image of the same regurgitant flow (right) corresponding to the wall-hugging Coanda effect.</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Houston and Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Suncica&nbsp;Canic</div> <div class="imageTitle">Wall hugging regurgitant flow.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263572/1263572_10281510_1514908382352_xVelocityAndMagnitude_PAPER2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263572/1263572_10281510_1514908382352_xVelocityAndMagnitude_PAPER2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Vortex Rolls in Left Atrium."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263572/1263572_10281510_1514908382352_xVelocityAndMagnitude_PAPER2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Vortex Rolls in Left Atrium."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Numerical simulation of regurgitant flow in mock left atrium showing vortex rolls.</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Houston</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Suncica&nbsp;Canic</div> <div class="imageTitle">Vortex Rolls in Left Atrium.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263572/1263572_10281510_1514908625159_FinalBifDiag--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263572/1263572_10281510_1514908625159_FinalBifDiag--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bifurcation Diagram showing Coanda effect Region"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263572/1263572_10281510_1514908625159_FinalBifDiag--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bifurcation Diagram showing Coanda effect Region"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A 2-parameter Bifurcation Diagram showing the appearance of the wall-hugging jets known as Coanda effect.</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Houston</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Suncica&nbsp;Canic</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bifurcation Diagram showing Coanda effect Region</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
