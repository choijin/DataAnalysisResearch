<AbstractNarration>The main theme of this proposal is the development of new theory and applications in the study of Markov random fields (MRFs) and other stochastic processes on networks.  One aspect involves studying dynamical processes on such systems, particularly the Glauber dynamics Markov chain. It will consider the question of universality of the cutoff phenomena at high temperatures as well pursuing a better understanding of the dynamics in the low temperature regime.  A second theme is the development of new tools for estimating the partition function of MRFs on locally tree-like graphs and inferring their local distributions. Understanding these distributions will enhance the understanding of links between phase transitions and transitions in the computational complexity of combinatorial counting, sampling and randomized optimization problems. The final topic of the proposal is to apply probabilistic theory and results for MRFs to widely used statistical estimators from phylogenetic reconstruction in computational biology and to develop new methods for detection of communities within social and other networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Markov random fields (MRFs) are models of random processes on networks which play a major role in a wide range of areas including mathematical physics, machine learning and statistics, theoretical computer science and computational evolutionary biology.  This proposal seeks to develop new theory for MRFs to better understand models, algorithms and estimators and other probabilistic techniques in these areas.  It considers the problem of how much data is needed for standard statistical procedures, such as maximum likelihood estimation, to recover the underlying evolutionary tree for a collection of species.  The proposal addresses questions from computer science about when combinatorial counting problems, such as counting the number of independent sets in a graph, become computationally intractable and how is it related to the transitions of MRFs on trees.   It also studies questions of how long it takes random processes on networks, such as the Glauber dynamics Markov chain, to reach their equilibrium distribution and how does this depend on the local interactions of the model.    Each of these questions is related to probabilistic properties of MRFs and their transitions between different phases.  The proposal focuses on development of mathematical theory with a view to better understanding these problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project had a number of significant outcomes in a range of problems involving random systems taking place within a network structure.  Our approach is mathematical, conducting basic research through proving theorems with the aim of understanding basics principles in the behaviour of large random systems.   Community detection in networks:  Many large networks contain sub-communities within them which are reflected in the structure of the network.  For example in a social network individuals may be more likely to be friends with people who share their interests, clubs, religion or political persuasion.  Our project developed theory for  when it is possible to identify communities within a network (both approximately and exactly) when the affiliations of the individuals are unknown.  We developed a range of algorithms that can be mathematically shown to be optimal in how accurately the communities are recovered.  One algorithm based on the "non-backtracking adjacency matrix" seems promising as a practical algorithm for community detection.  The mathematics used in this theory involves random matrices and the Ising model on trees, a model of magnetic systems from physics.   Random constraint satisfaction problems:  Faced with a set of constraints, the first question we might ask is whether they can all be satisfied. And then the natural follow-up question is how many ways there are to do it. For example, suppose we have a social network: one could what is the largest group of people, none of whom are friends.  In graph theory this is an independent set.  One part of this project developed a theory for the size of the largest independent set in a large random network based on heuristics developed in the field of statistical physics.  This theory applies to a range of similar problems and our work established the "Satisfiability Conjecture", a longstanding problem of how many random logical constraints could all be satisfied simultaneously.  We also developed theory for how many solutions there are in a large random system.   Dynamical random systems:  Many computer algorithms are based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo which works by repeating a simple random rule repeatedly to arrive at a complex random distribution (an every day example is shuffling cards to achieve a random order).  This also describes one way physical systems approach their equilibrium.  The mathematical theory focusses on how long the process must last until it is close enough to the desired distribution.  We developed a new method called information percolation to address the question of whether there are better states to initialize the process in.  For example for the high temperature Ising model, a model of magnetic systems, starting from a random initial configuration can approximately halve the time compared to the worst initial state.   Broader Impacts:  Network inference in community detection is important in industry, government and the social sciences and our research provides simple to implement algorithms backed by mathematical theory and estimates for the optimal rate of recovery.  The project involved the training of three graduate students and the development of a graduate course in advanced discrete probability theory.
