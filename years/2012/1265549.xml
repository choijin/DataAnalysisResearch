<AbstractNarration>This collaborative mathematics research project by Fedor Nazarov, Serguei Treil and Alexander Volberg is in the area of harmonic analysis.  Nazarov, Treil and Volberg will concentrate their efforts on several well-known hard problems in non-homogeneous harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and spectral theory. The common theme among majority of the problems is the so-called "universality" phenomenon, i.e. the fact that in many situations the boundedness of one operator (or a small collection of operators) implies that a much wider class of operators is bounded as well. Most of the problems lie in the realm of the non-homogeneous harmonic analysis, where underlying sets and measures are highly irregular. Singular integral operators with respect to singular measures and very irregular sets appear naturally in many problems of analysis. One of the motivations for the one-weight non-homogeneous case was the study of analytic capacity. The more sophisticated two-weight estimates of singular operators appear naturally in spectral theory and in the perturbation theory of self-adjoint operators. These problems are notoriously difficult, but using new techniques  recently developed by Nazarov, Treil and Volberg  and other researchers, they expect to make fundamental progress in the problems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative mathematics research project by Nazarov, Treil and Volberg is focused in the field of harmonic analysis, which is known to have fundamental applications to other disciplines, most notably to the analysis of large data sets, to image processing, and to the study of wave propagation.  The results and mathematical tools that will be developed through this project could  also have a bearing on other areas of mathematics, such as  mathematical physics, partial differential equations, probability. The project will provide a good training ground for graduate students as well as for mathematicians at the beginning of their careers.  Nazarov, Treil and Volberg anticipate an active involvement of their graduate students and postdocs in the project.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual merit:  My (and my collaborators) objectives was to build a theory of Calder\'on--Zygmind operators in the environment that was previously believed not at all suited for this goal. Examples are very bad Hausdorff measures (no regularity) in euclidean space, weights, matrix weights.  To a large extend this theory now exits and has already many achievements, such as the  solution of David--Semmes problem (Nazarov--Tolsa--Volberg), the solution of A_2 conjecture (long list of participants but finally settled by T. Hytonen), the solution of two weight Hilbert transform conjecture (raised by Nazarov--Treil--Volberg and solved by Sawyer--Shen--Uriarte-Tuero and Lacey), matrix weight theory with application to regularity of stationary processes (Treil--Volberg), sharp entropy sufficient conditions for the boundedness of simultaneously all two weight Calde\'on--Zygmund operators (Treil--Volberg), transferring these theories to metric spaces (Reznikov--Volberg, Wick--Volberg).   I consider the impact of this research as being quite significant for pure harmonic analysis. I will also add some comments about applications to Big Data at the end. In pure harmonic analysis our research of Nazarov--Treil--Volberg was concentrated mostly on Calder\'on--Zygmund operators in bad environment. It turned out that such theory can be built and it proved to be very useful.

We, ourselves, applied our theory to solve another long standing conjecture of Denjoy (almost simultaneously and independently of David--Mattila solution). In the recent time our theory inspired the full solution by Hytonen of A_2 conjecture (the first results were obtained earlier by Petermichl and Volberg), We also solved a David--Semmes conjecture in co-dimension 1 case (the case important for Partial Differential Equations (PDE) applications).  This result was recently applied by a group of 7 authors (including myself) to solve an outstanding PDE problem about the structure of harmonic measure in the most general situation (which also solved an old problem of Chris Bishop).  Our solution of David--Semmes conjecture (if pushed to other co-dimensions) potentially has an interesting application to a Big Data theory, because it allows to test whether the set of points in high dimensional space is really less dimensional by using the singular integral theory developed by us.   During this period PI Alexander Volberg published 22 papers. The main subjects of this outcome can be split to several categories: 1) there were results published in Duke Math. J. and Amer. J.

Yuditskii) solving an old Kotani--Last problem 4) and there were many results with S. Treil and F. Nazarov on two weight problem for singular integrals, 5) the main achievement of the period is the solution (with F. Nazarov and X. Tolsa) of an outstanding problem of David--Semmes (published in Acta Math.) that related the properties of a singular integral with the geometric measure properties of environment, where operator is acting; we did this in PDE important co-dimension 1 case, most of remaining cases are still open, 6) second main achievement was a series of papers of 7 au...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
