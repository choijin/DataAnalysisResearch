<AbstractNarration>The project provides international research experiences for 11 young Americans to carry out research at the interface of mathematics and the ecology of infectious and vector borne diseases with a cadre of researchers conducting interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary research at the premier private, nonprofit, research university in Colombia, Universidad de los Andes (UNIANDES). The students? projects will be driven by the study of Chagas in sylvatic communities with focus on learning the complexity of the eco-epidemiological cycle of T. cruzi while appreciating the challenges of eradicating the disease directly from world experts and on the development of models for the study of dengue epidemics in Latin America and how they differ from their counterpart in Southeast Asia. The research will be carried out in collaborations with the Center for the Study of Tropical Parasitology (CIMPAT) and the Vertebrate Evolutionary Biology Lab (EVOLVERT) at The Universidad de los Andes. Professor Juan M. Cordovez, the Director of the Research Group on Mathematical and Computational Biology (Grupo de Investigación en Biología Matemática y Computacional, BIOMAC), within the Departamento de Ingeniería Biomédica, would provide the link between Arizona State University and UNIANDES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;The training of Americans on the use of models in the study of the ecology and transmission dynamics of diseases like Dengue or Chagas is important to the US leadership role in a global economy. Our nation?s model of competitive success counts on the direct personal participation of our citizens in activities such as travel and trade that includes risks and economic opportunities associated. The project provides international research experiences for 11 young Americans to carry out research at the interface of mathematics and the ecology of infectious and vector borne diseases at the Universidad de los Andes (UNIANDES) in Colombia South America. The research will be carried out in collaborations with the Center for the Study of Tropical Parasitology (CIMPAT) and the Vertebrate Evolutionary Biology Lab (EVOLVERT) at the Universidad de los Andes. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Research Experience (IRES) in Population Dynamics and Complex Systems took place in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia for three consecutive years during the summers of 2015, 2016 and 2017. The program had three main goals for participants:  to develop high quality research projects, led by doctoral students; to participate in the preparation and implementation of an intensive course in theoretical biology; and to gain exposure to a diverse community of researchers and potential colleagues in a developing country.   Eight US participants attended the program (four students each in years one and two, with three students returning in year three to conduct advanced research projects).  IRES participants worked together in multidisciplinary teams from the United States (most from Arizona State University - ASU) and Universidad de Los Andes (Uniandes) on self-selected topics in the broad area of population dynamics.  Research included predator-prey models, foraging dynamics, the spread of the Zika virus, and competition dynamics between species.  Each team prepared a technical report and a poster for presentation.  Students also worked together to develop coursework in theoretical biology to prepare undergraduates and graduates that joined the teams but lacked the background in mathematical and computational modeling necessary for the prjoects.  The course included an introduction to dynamical systems and implementation of mathematical models to explore biological phenomena.  U.S. participants were key in developing the course and presenting lectures and labs.  Finally, attendees experienced a new and different world by participating in research (including fieldwork) in a developing country, which was very different from their current life experience.  They learned how to adapt to different cultural norms and traditions, and built strong relationships with faculty and colleagues, enriching their capacity for team building and collaborative efforts, as well as allowing tremendous personal growth.  Students lived off-campus but worked in the university setting, connecting with local students who served initially as guides and hosts, but teams quickly grew into tight, collaborative units as students become more comfortable.  The field trips were also the first exposure to actual fieldwork for most students, and the data collection process was an important and highly-valued segment of the program.  At the end of each summer, students prepared a manuscript and supporting poster that was submitted to a conference for presentation to a larger scientific community. They improved their research and communication skills while working with peers from different cultures.  Other benefits included:    Receiving exposure to the myriad facets of social and cultural immersion by working with international students and faculty in multidisciplinary groups, learning about local challenges under resource limited conditions (often very different from their own situations);    Developing collaborative skills and an appreciation for the value of a multidisciplinary approach to real-world problems;    Working in an environment that encouraged transitioning a student from dependency to being an effective collaborator in a group;    Receiving training and experience that will enhance their success in their graduate programs and future careers;    Conducting cutting-edge research, which can presented at the professional conferences and ideally submitted to peer-reviewed publications.    IRES research projects are available at https://mcmsc.asu.edu/IREStechnicalreports.              Last Modified: 01/03/2018       Submitted by: Carlos Castillo-Chavez]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
