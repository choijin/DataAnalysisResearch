<AbstractNarration>Disorder and randomness can induce very deep complexity for systems. This project studies the importance of this induced complexity on the time evolution of such systems. It thus addresses topics at the interface between mathematics and statistical physics of disordered media. The signature of complexity on the dynamics of these complex systems is seen in the fact that the evolution is very slow and trapped in regions far from equilibrium. It exhibits new characteristics like aging, and break the well established rules of fluctuation-dissipation. Nevertheless some universal features are shared by these complex systems and this project builds the foundations for understanding these universal phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This universal behavior is exhibited in very different models which  include the slow dynamics of Spin glasses, both for spherical and Ising spins, and the diffusion and transport on disordered structures like percolation clusters and random trees. One of the tools recently built (by the PI) is a new and powerful link between the study of the random energy landscapes and random matrix theory. This link will also be explored further since it enables the introduction of a new classification of different classes of complex behavior in one class of systems (the spherical spin glasses).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project has tried to advance the understanding of the following fundamental question in mathematics and physics: how are the familiar phenomena of transport and diffusion affected by strong disorder in the environment, in the landscape? How does a random walker feel the disorder or the complexity of the landscape it walks in?  Moreover, if the walker is submitted to an external force, a drift or a bias,  how does this drift interact with the complex landscape? Can the walker be trapped for very long times, or does the drift win, and if so in what time scales?  Physicists know well that the classical Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem relating the response to the diffusion, and the famous Einstein relation, are not always valid when the disorder is strong.  This question was approached in this project on two major and classical problems: the "ant in the labyrinth", i.e. random walks on random graphs, like critical percolation clusters, in high enough dimension, or for models of statistical mechanics i.e. Spin Glasses. We have achieved strong progress on both fronts. We have proven one of the important conjecture, about the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for random walks on random trees (without leaves), when the drift is strong enough, as well as the Einstein relation. We have obtained detailed information on the very slow motion induced by the disorder, through the full scaling limit of the ant in the labyrinth (with no drift) above te so-called critical dimension. This scaling limit is a very complex random process,  the BISE, i.e. the Brownian Motion on the SuperBrownian Integrated Excursion!  We have approached the understanding of the equilibrium of Spin Glasses on two fronts: first following the classical and mysterious path open by statistical physics and Giorgio Parisi, using the more recent work of mathematicians Talagrand and Panchenko. But also following an approach introduced by the PI in his recent work, based on differential geometric tools to understand the topology of the energy or Hamiltonian landscape at zero temperature and extend this information to the behavior of the Gibbs measure at low temperature.
