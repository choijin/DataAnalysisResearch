<AbstractNarration>This project will examine community response to abrupt environmental change through analysis of animal remains as they reflect subsistence practices and environmental conditions, from Tse-whit-zen, a previously excavated Lower Elwha Klallam village on the northwest coast of Washington, with occupation beginning around 2700 years ago and intensifying between about 1800-100 years ago.  This time period spans several high-magnitude earthquakes, the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climatic Anomaly, and a gradual increase in sheltered intertidal habitat.  The research team will explore how these events affected animal resources and different people within households and larger communities over time, using predictions drawn from foraging theory. The extraordinary integrity of the deposits, the detailed geoarchaeological field recording of deposits, the large and rigorously collected faunal samples from 7 time periods, and volumetrically comparable samples of birds, fish, shellfish, and mammals at Tse-whit-zen offer a high-resolution record of past human use of animal resources that is unparalleled in the North Pacific.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project will provide models, methods and results of direct relevance to scholars working on Arctic systems and processes, given the parallels and direct linkages between the Northwest Coast and areas to the north. In both regions, boat-mobile foragers with maritime subsistence focused on fish, shellfish, and marine mammals, have adapted to complex, dynamic coastlines affected by periodic environmental, geomorphic and climatic changes.  Global circulation patterns link the North Pacific and Arctic Oceans and migratory species bridge the two areas. Our project also provides an ideal comparative case study for the Global Human Ecodynamics Alliance, an NSF funded initiative developed to link Arctic Polar Ecodynamics to the broader global context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be valuable to the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe who were integrally involved in the excavation of the Tse-whit-zen site, are concerned about the future of the site and the collection. The researchers will share faunal data, publications and professional insights with tribal educators, wildlife managers, and cultural specialists involved in planning a museum. They will also be collaborating with local and state governmental agencies that will develop educational materials from our results, to meet a growing need to prepare the public for future earthquake-related events. The researchers anticipate that their work documenting fine-scale animal response to earthquakes, climate change, local shoreline change, and human exploitation strategies for several ?species of concern? (e.g. salmonids, ground fish, sea mammals) will assist current wildlife management efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      In 2004, Ciwicen (pronouncedch-WHEET-son), a traditional village of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (LEKT) in northwest Washington State, U.S.A., was excavated as part of a Washington Department of Transportation project.  Extensive excavation documented multiple plankhouses spanning the last 2,700 years and resulted in the recovery of one of the largest collections of animal remains on the North Pacific Coast.  Such bones and teeth (of mammals, fish, birds) and shellfish (from clams, mussels, etc.)  are the residue from everyday meals and ritual feasts, as well as tool making. Knowing the types of animals people relied on and that were part of their lives for thousands of years, provides insights into the human story as well as past environments.            Our NSF funded analysis of the Ciwicen animal remains and their geological context provided an important case study in Human Ecodynamics, which uses archaeological and other knowledge (from geology, history, animal biology and ecology) to study ways animals, and in turn people, are affected by environmental change over time. Our records show that Indigenous people relied on over 100 species of shellfish, fish, birds, and mammals for millennia. The village occupation spans large-magnitude earthquakes, tsunamis, periods of climate change, and changes in nearshore habitat. Close analysis of geo-cultural laying of deposits joined with over 100 radiocarbon dates (half funded from NSF) allowed for a detailed reconstruction of the environmental and human occupational history. For example, we studied how animals responded to tsunamis, which overtopped the village at least four times.  Shellfish were the most affected, followed by fish, while Impacts on mammals and birds were minimal.  Despite evidence that tsunamis affected the local environment, human populations were extremely resilient to such impacts, with evidence for house rebuilding on the same location following at least two tsunamis.               One goal was to determine how human groups socially negotiated environmental challenges.  Did tsunamis lead people from two households towards more cooperation or autonomy in the food quest?  The records for shellfish and fish show striking differences.  After one tsunami, two households show more similarity in shellfish gathering than before the tsunami, which suggests greater cooperation than before.  The fish record shows a contrary pattern, with greater autonomy in fishing practices indicated after the event than before.  The mammal bones in one house were more fragmented and more often burned than those in a second house during both periods, indicating people in one house were consistently using bone as an additive to wood fuel and/or processing bones for grease, which could have been used for a variety of practical or ritual purposes.  Occupants in one house were using greater amounts of sablefish (also called black cod, or Anoplopoma fimbria), a known prestige item, which likely shows social differences between houses as well.        The methods and models employed, and results are relevant to researchers working in the North Pacific and beyond.  Measures of sablefish and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) vertebrae allow for reconstruction of body size of ancient fish, providing information on fish populations well before industrial scale fishing.  Ciwicen residents targeted juvenile sablefish, which do not occur in the site vicinity today.  Pacific cod today are about 50 mm smaller (on average) than those from Ciwicen, likely due to intensive fishing.  Our study of mammal bone fragmentation is unique for the Pacific Northwest; results show that people intensively used bone for fuel, tool making and grease, which supported ritual activities.  Detailed investigation of sediment layers and maps of activity areas, along with the extensive catalog of radiocarbon dates, have been integrated into a Geographical Information System (GIS) database, providing powerful spatial analysis capabilities and laying the groundwork for future analyses from the vast Ciwicen artifact collection.        Our project has several broader impacts.  Analysis has revealed evidence for four earthquake/tsunami events at the site, providing more detailed knowledge about local earthquake impacts than existed before, which will help support community earthquake preparedness.  Our long-term animal record will be useful to the LEKT and state wildlife agencies seeking to restore the severely degraded Port Angeles Harbor.  Project team members have visited with tribal members at the LEKT Reservation multiple times and will continue to share all information to support tribal education and wildlife management efforts.  Tribal leaders have joined us at two professional conferences to share their perspectives about Ciwicento a wider community.  We have also presented our findings at public talks.  Dozens of undergraduate and graduate students contributed to lab analysis, resulting in five master?s theses; two of these students are pursuing their PhDs.        Project results are being assembled (open access) in a Special Issue of Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports, which will be available in summer 2018.
