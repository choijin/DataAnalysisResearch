<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1228689            PI:  Fratzl, Peter                ORG: Gordon Research Conferences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  2012 Biomineralization GRC/GRS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  Biomineralization is an important area of research at the interface of biology,&lt;br/&gt;geochemistry, materials science, and medicine.  The topic is significant for human health (covering, for example, aspects of bone and tooth diseases) as well as for engineering science by providing models for bioinspired engineering.  The conference has been designed to maximize interactions that can serve to enlighten participants from diverse backgrounds and foster new, interdisciplinary collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  The conference brings together a broad spectrum of scientists with interests in biomineralization, who work at the interfaces of biology, geochemistry, materials science, osteochondral physiology, and regenerative medicine.  The conjoined Gordon Research Seminar will enable 50 students and young career researchers to present their work and hold fruitful discussions immediately prior to the GRC.  Support for participant attendance will be provided with appropriate attention to the NSF priority of broadening participation.</AbstractNarration>

There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions.

As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
