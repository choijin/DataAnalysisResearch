<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Fukaya category is a potent tool in symplectic topology having origins both in dynamics and in string theory. In symplectic topology, it governs the behavior and intersection properties of Lagrangian submanifolds, certain dynamically interesting half-dimensional subspaces of a symplectic manifold.  In string theory the Fukaya category arises as a piece of the "open string/sector" portion of "A-model" theories, and as such fits into a family of conjectures originally arising in physics called "mirror symmetry", which predict a relationship between the "A-model" and the "B-model" theories (which are built out of complex geometry, rather than symplectic topology) on a completely different "mirror" space.    Over the course of this award, the PI has developed structures which have lead to new tools for computing Fukaya categories and studying Lagrangian submanifolds, new understanding of the role of Fukaya categories in mirror symmetry, and stronger relationships to string topology (a subfield of algebraic topology concerned with spaces of loops).  Most notably:  (a) With Perutz and Sheridan, the PI has, under suitable hypotheses and in the geometric setting of "Calabi-Yau manifolds", developed a relationship, predicted by Kontsevich in 1994, between two types of mirror symmetry conjectures, "homological mirror symmetry" (HMS), which focuses on the Fukaya category in the A-model, and "enumerative mirror symmetry", which focuses in the A-model upon counts of (rational) curves in the space; specifically, the PI, Perutz, and Sheridan showed how to use HMS to deduce enumerative mirror symmetry.  (b) Physically, the Fukaya category arises from a study of "open string" theory, meaning the study of propagation of strings with boundary.  There are corresponding mathematical "closed string" theories collectively called "Floer (and/or quantum) cohomology theories", which arise in string theory while studying propagation of closed loops, and in dynamics in the study of periodic orbits of physical systems. A general mathematical conjecture, advocated by Kontsevich and Seidel, is that "closed string theories" should (under good hypotheses) be completely calculable just from the corresponding "open string theories" via purely algebraic formulae, and no new geometry.  The PI has systematically established this expectation in different settings under hypotheses, equating various closed string theories with "Hochschild and cyclic homology theories" (the aforementioned algebraic formulae) of the Fukaya category.  (c) The PI has created and applied (with Abouzaid) new tools for studying and computing Fukaya categories associated to singularities of functions, known in the physics and mirror symmetry literature as "Landau-Ginzburg" models.    (d) "Cotangent bundles" are the basic building blocks of symplectic manifolds, and arise physically as "phase spaces" ("spaces of positions and momenta") of dynamical systems; as such they provide important testing grounds for symplectic questions at large. A broad expectation, not completely understood, is that much of the symplectic topology of a cotangent bundle should be a formal consequence of the ordinary geometry and topology of the underlying "zero section" (or "space of positions").  Along these lines, the PI (with Cohen) has promoted a partly understood relationship, between Floer homology for a cotangent bundle and an algebro-topological theory associated to the zero section known as "string topology", to a full equality of "closed string theories".   (e) An important yet difficult step in computing the Fukaya category involves finding "generators", which are fixed collections of Lagrangians which completely determine any other Lagrangian in the Fukaya category via a formal algebraic process.  The PI introduced new simplified tools for finding generators automatically, via algebraically checkable criteria (and no new geometry).  (f) The PI discovered (with Eliashberg and Lazarev) a new class of "flexible" Lagrangians which are invisible to Fukaya categories and yet existence in abundance. These Lagrangians fit nicely into a proposed dichotomy between "flexible" and "rigid" geometries in symplectic topology advocated by Eliashberg.  (g) Conversely, the PI developed and applied (with Pomerleano) a means of tightly constraining the geometric types of allowable Lagrangians in symplectic manifolds via "Gromov-Witten invariants" (a type of curve counting), without passing directly through the Fukaya category.  Over the course of the award, the PI also taught a semester-long graduate course on Fukaya categories, his area of expertise, and organized three graduate student learning workshops aimed at diverse groups of young students interested in the area. He also taught several mini-courses in his research area, organized a conference special session, and lectured in conferences and seminars domestically and abroad.
