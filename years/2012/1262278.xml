<AbstractNarration>Innovation does not happen in isolation but rather within interactive systems. Successful innovation leads to economic prosperity and national competence, but additional research is needed on the innovation process itself, particularly on interactive learning dynamics among and between major institutional actors. Emerging global collaboration in innovation of clean energy technologies presents an important opportunity for innovation systems scholarship. The recent emergence of state-led, bilateral research partnerships to develop new technologies for carbon capture and storage (CCS) raises critical research questions: In what ways and to what extent do international collaborations facilitate the innovation process of clean energy technologies? What are the national and international policy implications of the globalization of innovation in the clean energy sector? And what analytical model(s) can effectively explain and be used to evaluate this phenomenon? Using the US-China Advanced Coal Technology Consortium as a case, this research draws on two approaches: the 'functions of innovation systems', and 'resources-based perspective on research partnerships' approaches, respectively, to more deeply understand the mechanisms and effectiveness of state-led, international technology research partnerships. This field-based, doctoral dissertation research project examines the policy rationales, mechanisms and effectiveness of the Advanced Coal Technology Consortium (ACTC) of the United States-China Clean Energy Research Center, initiated by Presidents Obama and Hu in 2009. Data are gathered from Chinese and American participants in the ACTC through survey research, in-depth interviews, site visits, event participation and other available sources. Secondary, comparative analysis of China's CCS research partnerships with Australia, the European Union, Japan and the United Kingdom is included, as well. This research project will collect new data and develop models of collaborative, international technology innovation that can be used in the analysis of policy options for clean energy technology development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. Utilizing data collected in China and the United States, this project will create original analytical models that can be used to examine multi- and bilateral technology innovation partnerships, and help policymakers better understand and evaluate the strengths and limitations of international collaboration in the development of clean energy technologies. Key findings will help inform the design of effective public policy related to research and development of large-scale, low-carbon technologies and energy systems, and will help strengthen international partnerships in clean energy technology innovation.</AbstractNarration>
