<AbstractNarration>Understanding how and why some biological products come to be marketed is an important question for science and technology studiesand related fields, and for policymakers.  Much of the research on biological product commodification is carried out after commodification occurs and the products are financially marketed. Moreover, the gendered content of biological products is often understudied. This study fills those gaps by analyzing a gendered biological market in formation whose future is largely unknown. Specifically, scientists' emerging use of breast milk in the development of biomedical products and procedures, including stem cell recovery, and cancer and antibacterial treatments, is compared to informal breast milk banking and breast milk sharing to examine how financial and other markets for biological products are transformed. The study also investigates how gender shapes the commodification of biological products that are bought and sold in the biomedical sciences. Evidence is drawn from in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations with scientists, health care providers, donors, recipients, milk bank personnel and milk sharing website personnel, and from policy and other documents and websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More broadly, this study addresses socially important ethical issues involved in breast milk markets, including whether donors should be paid for breast milk, whether a profit should be made in milk banking, to what degree markets in breast milk should be regulated, and the best uses of so-called excess breast milk. Other broader impacts include policy guidance, and training a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Building upon earlier models, biomedical and technoscientific innovations are today enabling an expanding variety of human organ and tissue transfer procedures for both enhanced health and treatment purposes (Waldby and Mitchell 2006). This award enabled the Co-Primary investigator, Krista Sigurdson, to strengthen her sociology doctoral dissertation by extending her ethnographic research into four specific markets in human milk (non-profit, for profit, informal and scientific). The project tracked the dynamics of the following themes within and across these quite different markets:  1. The commercialization of milk and how it is pursued and resisted;  2. The resonance and consequences of emotions in breast feeding and breastfeeding "failure";  3. The materials and labor involved in the collection and circulation of human milk;  4. The uses of scientific and "lay" knowledge in the circulation of human milk; and  5. The diversity and consequences of the meanings given to breast milk.  A snapshot of the findings about the four markets is offered below.  1. The non-profit market in human milk: At the milk banks studied, the commercialization of milk is generally criticized. Milk banks tend to view themselves (and their milk donors) as providing a service or giving a gift to the community of babies in need. To profit from milk donations is viewed as morally wrong and paying milk donors is often seen as unsafe and/or financially unsustainable for non-profit milk banks. Milk banks also prioritize providing milk for fragile and sick babies in NICUs over distributing to community members. They largely market their product as a "medical necessity" sold to hospitals (to cover processing costs) while maintaining an anti-commercial stance.  2.

Prolacta asserts that their safety standards exceed those of non-profit milk banks which they viewed as sub par.

The scientific markets in human milk: Here, my research focuses on the use of human milk in developing anti-cancer and antibiotic therapies as well as a source of stem cells. Within these research domains, human milk is understood as a substance with limitless potential and unknown possibilities &ndash; not only in terms of its impact on nursing babies and mothers but especially as a source of raw material for biomedical innovation. While nursing mothers seem to rally behind such scientific efforts, scient...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
