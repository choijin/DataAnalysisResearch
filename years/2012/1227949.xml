<AbstractNarration>This workshop is organized by the Unidata Program Center.  The workshop will commence on July 9 -13, 2012, in Boulder, CO.  It will invite speakers to lecture and graduate students to participate in the sessions designed to improve researchers and educators handling of data. It will illustrate how it can enhance the researchers' research and the classroom curriculum.  The workshop is entitled "Navigating Earth System Science Data."  The main goals of the workshop are a) raise awareness of "Data Science" in the geoscience academic community; and b) share hands-on activities, course materials, and ideas for improving research and education.  This will be done through a series of plenary presentations, hands-on lab sessions, poster sessions, and panel discussions.</AbstractNarration>

Every three years, the ProgramÆs Users Committee, which is composed of representatives from U.S. university geoscience departments, organizes a Unidata Users Workshop to give members of this community a forum to share hands-on activities, course materials, and ideas for improving research and education.

The posters served to underscore the workshop theme and highlighted the application of geoscience data to both research and education.  Unidata Program Center staff collected participantsÆ comments during and after the workshop. The following are a sample:  I really enjoyed participating along with his talk and I can already see how I can utilize [the presenterÆs] dataset in IDV in teaching some of my classes. I want to get better at developing better models for forecasting and it was interesting to hear the speakerÆs ideas on modifying the ensembles. The speaker was very clear and his material was well presented. I really enjoyed hearing about different studentsÆ research and each student was great at explaining their project and answering questions. I had worked with NetCDF files [a data format developed by Unidata for storing scientific data] for my job but was never aware of exactly what type of file it was or the different advantages of saving in a NetCDF. Good talk! I hope there is a push to make data and tools open source and more available, and that there is a reward for groups that do that. Our group makes tools open source and documented to be available to others, but the time that it takes to do that takes away from writing papers and getting them published.   Workshop participants were exposed to a variety of available geoscience data sources, including NOAA/Earth System Research LaboratoriesÆ Global Modeling and Earth Information Systems, the NOAA Operational Model Archive and Distribution System (NOMADS), real-time datasets available through the University of WisconsinÆs Space Science and Engineering Center, and NASAÆs data distribution plans for the next generation geostationary satellites (GOES-R). Comments from the workshop indicate the data sources introduced were new to significant numbers of the participants.  Workshop speakers also introduced participants to a number of different software tools for dealing with data access, analysis, and visualization. These sessions were quite popular with the participants, and ranged from discussion of Unidata tools to other freely available technologies for scientific programming and data visualization, as well as tools for evaluating output from computer mod...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
