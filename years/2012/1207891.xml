<AbstractNarration>The development of adaptive optics (AO) hardware and techniques to correct for the aberrations introduced by the Earth's atmosphere has revolutionized astronomical imaging from the ground, recently enabling images from an 8-m telescope that exceed in resolution those possible with the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.  However, telescopes as small as ~1-m aperture also benefit from AO systems, and Dr. Christoph Baranec's "Robo-AO" instrument for the Palomar 1.5-m telescope of the California Institute of Technology is a unique, robotic and automated AO system that will have the capability of observing as many as 150 targets per night, including but not limited to a) stellar and substellar companions to other stars, b) transients requiring classification, c) transiting planet candidates, d) lensed quasars, and e) very low mass stars.  Robo-AO is a collaboration between the California Institute of Technology and the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Pune, India, and initial construction was funded, in part, by a National Science Foundation award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current proposal plans to upgrade Robo-AO with a new near-infrared science camera that will expand the field of view to greater than arc minute diameter, greatly enhance the near-infrared sensitivity and spectral coverage to a wavelength of 2.4 microns, and increase the visible-light science sky coverage by using AO-sharpened near-infrared tip-tilt guide stars.  The Robo-AO collaboration incorporates students at every level, including design, hardware and software development, and science planning.  The project also makes its detailed design and construction plans, hardware selection, and software freely available and the system has been duplicated at other small telescopes around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for the development of robotic adaptive optics is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Robo-AO is the first fully automated laser guide star (LGS) adaptive optics (AO) instrument.  It was originally developed by the California Institute of Technology and the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Pune, India, and installed on the Palomar Observatory 60-inch telescope for three years of automated science observations; partial funding for this was provided through grants from NSF.  In 2015, Robo-AO was awarded the opportunity to take over the Kitt Peak Nation Observatory 2.1m telescope, and is finishing its first year of science operations; Figure 1 shows the 2.1m telescope with the Robo-AO LGS, and Figure 2 shows the main components of Robo-AO while it was installed on the Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Robo-AO is able to observe more science targets at the diffraction limit than is feasible with any other ground based telescope, and has resulted in several groundbreaking science publications.  Robo-AO uses an ultraviolet (UV) laser to create a spot in the sky for the AO system to use as a reference spot, and has two science channels (in the visible and infrared (IR) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum) that are also used to remove the effects of the atmosphere on the lateral motion of the science object with respect to the telescope (the so-called "tip-tilt" motion).  Robo-AO was developed with a high speed EMCCD in the visible channel, and tested with an engineering IR camera, but has never had a dedicated IR camera to use.  The inclusion of a dedicated IR camera will increase the already high efficiency of the Robo-AO instrument, allowing for even more science throughput and better scientific performance.   In August and September 2014, we commissioned a brand new IR camera with the Robo-AO system. The detector was a very-low noise, high-speed (100Hz) HgCdTe Selex Avalanche PHotodiode InfraRed Array (SAPHIRA) electron avalanche photodiode (eAPD) detector. This new camera widens the spectral bandwidth of observations to near infrared wavelengths and enables deeper visible-light imaging using adaptive-optics-sharpened infrared tip-tilt sensing and correction. Figure 3 shows the camera mounted on Robo-AO at the Palomar 60-inch telescope.  On September 3, 2014, we manually observed 7 targets (an example of which is shown in Figure 4) using infrared tip-tilt correction, including one target as faint as V=18.4 (well beyond the capabilities of the Robo-AO visible camera alone), all in the space of an hour.  Producing this data used three wavebands (UV wavefront sensing, visible science imaging, and IR imaging for tip-tilt and IR science), the first time these three wavebands have been used simultaneously in adaptive optics operations.  This demonstrated the camera technology and integration of the IR camera to Robo-AO, but was a temporary installation as the camera was earmarked for other work.  Work has continued since the demonstration, with the development of a new IR camera system and further work on the Robo-AO software to integrate the camera into the fully automated operations.  The new camera is similar to the demonstration camera, with improved electronics and control systems.  The new camera will be installed on Robo-AO at Kitt Peak in November, 2016, with science operations starting soon after once the integration and commissioning procedures are completed.  The prior and upcoming experience of the Robo-AO team with the SAPHIRA detector and IR camera is important for astronomical AO, as these new detectors are likely candidates for IR wavefront sensing in the next generation of adaptive optics systems.  One of these is slated to be installed as part of the upgrade of the Keck Observatory AO system, with the Robo-AO IR camera being an integral part of the development process.  The design and integration of this camera with Robo-AO wass funded by the NSF under grant AST-1207891.                Last Modified: 09/30/2016       Submitted by: Andrew F Boden]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
