<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21 May 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1216151&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;PI:   W. Byam&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI:  [None]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests two Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment items for the University of Delaware for use aboard the R/V HUGH R. SHARP; namely a new double-articulated side A-frame and up-grades to an existing portable deck winch.  Both items will enhance safety and provide greatly improved support capabilities to a wide variety of scientific projects.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit:  The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed equipment specifically for the R/V HUGH R. SHARP.  The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit.  During operations, these vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Specifically, College of Marine and Earth Studies participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events (Coast Day), participation the MATE program, and educational cruises.  The College also hosts the UNOLS East Coast Van Pool.  The R/V HUGH R. SHARP is scheduled to support over 90 NSF-funded days in CY 2012.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Disclaimer  This Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.  Project Outcome Report SSSE 2012, Award 1216151  This is the Project Outcome Report for Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) 2012, award# 1216151, which awarded $247,715 for science support equipment aboard the R/V Hugh R. Sharp. The award included fabrication and installation of a Side Frame for deploying and recovering scientific instruments, and repairs and upgrades to the Dynacon Deck winch.   The work was completed according to specifications and within the allocated budget.  The resulting upgrades to the shipÆs scientific support capabilities is significant, including the ability to collect higher quality data with a decreased risk of a safety incident.  Major Activities:  A new A-frame was installed on the ship.  The Sharp has good flexibility for deploying scientific packages off the stern A-frame but was lacking the ability to deploy instruments over the sides of the vessel in a safe and efficient manner. The new Side Frame allows the ship to make safer and more effective side deployments and increases data quality by keeping scientific packages clear of the shipÆs wake.  The shipÆs Dynacon winch used for Scan Fish operations was overhauled and upgraded.  The Dynacon winch was purchased in 2003 and was in need of repair and upgrades to meet current UNOLS safety standards.  The winch was completely overhauled and received modifications to make it safer and more capable.  Details of the work completed, background, and funds expended can be found in the full report.          Last Modified: 09/29/2014       Submitted by: Jon Swallow]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
