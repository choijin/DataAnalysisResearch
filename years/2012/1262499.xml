<AbstractNarration>There is conflicting evidence about the capacity for scientific collectives (i.e., teams, centers) to seed grand innovations. On the one hand, sociological research convincingly argues for the "dominance of teams in the production of knowledge," particularly in the production of "high-impact" knowledge. On the other hand, research shows that many science teams, particularly the ones most prized for their diverse and distributed "dream teams" are especially prone to underachieving when it comes to publications, patents, and commercialization. This program of research investigates a large number of scientific collectives, from their initial formation to their maturity, in order to uncover the dynamic interplay between structure (i.e., how the collective is designed) and process (i.e., leadership and member interactions). Although collaboration across disciplines and units has been frequently recognized as one of the key obstacles to innovation, research is needed to determine how system design affects the multi-level processes that facilitate collaboration within and across teams and units. This research integrates psychological, organizational, and network science perspectives in a multilevel system model to detail the impact of goals, leadership, and system design on key drivers of collaboration within and across teams in innovation systems. Four empirical studies are being conducted over the course of two years in order to evaluate the impact of variations in the architecture of scientific innovation systems on resulting innovation. This research investigates scientific collectives comprised of students working across two universities, three disciplines, and two countries who must work collaboratively to solve interdisciplinary challenges in environmental sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The project develops an evidentiary-base for informing policy on how to manage scientific collaborations to foster innovation. In particular, this project will enable concrete prescriptions about the optimal integration of science and policy. The project identifies the structural and interactional building blocks of successful collaboration in scientific collective in which teams are distributed, are affected by complex social and motivational forces, and interact through virtual technology to innovate using knowledge across temporal and spatial boundaries. This project will yield greater understanding of how to improve, through design and leadership interventions, knowledge generation and policy implementation in multiteam science. A second set of broader impacts of the project concern the education of four communities: (1) future scientists, (2) science policy leaders, (3) academics, and (4) students. This project is enabling the training of future scientists who will work as part of distributed multidisciplinary international science teams. An estimated 10 PhD students and 10 research-oriented undergraduate students will have the opportunity to work directly on this research, engaging in virtual scientific collaboration. The project will create new curricula in distributed multidisciplinary teamwork at Georgia Tech aimed at computing and engineering students. At George Mason, this project will foster a continuing collaboration between instructors in the Environmental Science &amp; Policy and Psychology programs.  This collaboration has as its goal the design of integrated curricula to help students understand how to use both principles of ecology and social psychology to foster greater environmental sustainability.  Finally, the project contributes to the teamwork training of more than 2,000 Engineering, Ecology, Psychology, and Business students who will participate in this research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Urgent, important, and complex societal problems require large groups of scientists. Scientific collectives are often comprised of individuals with diverse expertise, drawn from different organizations, and working together across geographical and temporal distances. We study the organizational factors that improve the functioning and effectiveness of these groups. Large interdisciplinary groups can be designed as either "interdiscplinary teams" or "interdisciplinary multiteam systems."

The key findings are fourfold.  Theme 1: Leading interdisciplinary multiteam systems in science The first contribution of this research is in the area of leadership. Because of the diversity inherent in science teams, a recurring problem is the lack of alignment and integration across different disciplinary scientists. To overcome this fragmentation, scientific systems need to develop leadership relationships that bridge different groups working on different disciplinary aspects of the overall project.

Theme 2: Motivating interdisciplinary multiteam systems in science The second contribution of this research is in the area of motivation. We studied the determinants of individuals? effort allocation to both their disciplinary team and interdisciplinary MTS tasks.  Such individual effort and motivation is a fundamental element in fostering success in such collectives.  Our research showed that team states such as collective efficacy facilitated a more efficient allocation of individual effort.  Also, individual attributes such as personal mastery motives increased effort allocation across the project.  Taken together, these findings help elucidate the motivational dynamics operating at the individual level in teams and MTSs engaged in innovation.  Theme 3: Virtual coordination of work in interdisciplinary multiteam systems in science  The third contribution of our project is in the area of remote collaboration. We investigated the team interaction processes that enable large interdisciplinary systems to collaborate across time and space. This effort included the development of a conceptual taxonomy of teamwork process, the construction and validation of self-report instrument to use to assess these processes and an examination of the nomological network of these work processes in interdisciplinary teams. We found process sociomateriality positively influenced team performance and viability. Theme 4: Designing the teams who do interdisciplinary science The fourth, and most significant, contribution of this work was to experimentally address the question of how to best structure interdisciplinary work systems: is it better for them to work as fully-integrated interdisciplinary teams, or, should the teams work as relatively isolated components who are loosely coupled with other components? To answer this question, we assigned large interdisciplinary groups to either the "interdisciplinary team" or "interdisciplinary MTS" condition. The major hypotheses of this effort were that the rigor of discipline-based ideas and overall idea novelty would be stronger in the MTSs than in the cross-functional teams.  Findings reveal stronger disciplinary rigor and idea novelty result when the group was designed as a MTS than as a cross-functional team. The MTS structure may afford greater depth of idea exploration within different represented disciplines than cross-functional teams.
