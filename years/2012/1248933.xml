<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a Fuel Analyzer for the cement industry.  The cement market is predominantly powered by fossil fuel and in many cases they can benefit from knowing the exact composition, moisture level, and BTU of the fuel.  By accurately analyzing and characterizing the composition of the fuel, it is possible to run the kiln and operations more efficiently, while both lowering costs and reducing emissions.   This SBIR project seeks to develop technology that can be used to accurately and fully characterize cement fuel.  Phase I will involve the design of a new type of analyzer designed to measure the full composition of the fuel.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact /commercial potential of the project is a result of a better characterization of the composition of the fuel so that the fuel can be used more efficiently.  More efficient use of the fuel, which is the largest cost in a cement plan, can result in lower cost and more efficient operations.  Another benefit of using the equipment is to lower overall emissions. The impact of this technology goes beyond just cement operations.  Any operation burning extensive amount of fossil fuels can benefit from this technology due to the impact on cost, efficiently, and emissions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this NSF Phase I SBIR effort is to develop a new type of analyzer that can be used to measure the composition of  Fuel.  Currently at cement plants, the composition of the fuel is known to a specific level, but it would be beneficial if more accurate and real time information was available.   This piece of equipment will allow cement plants to determine the exact characteristics of the fuel, allowing them to more effectively use the fuel in their operations.  The characteristics include the elemental composition, as well as the BTU value of the fuel.  The Phase I work involved designing a new type of on-line analyzer specifically designed for accurate measurement of fuels, combined with hands on testing of the proposed new measurement approach.   The work was very successful in the design, and produced significant improvements to the accuracy of the fuel measurement. The result of this work, if funded in Phase II, will be a new type of analyzer specifically designed for taking very accurate measurements of the cement fuels, resulting in improved monitoring and process feedback at the cement plants.  The result of using this technology can be a significant improvement in the efficient use of fuel at the cement plant.
