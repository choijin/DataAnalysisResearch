<AbstractNarration>The Magnolia grandiFLORA project, named in honor of the official state tree and flower of Mississippi, will develop digital databases of images, labels, and georeferenced locality data for more than 250,000 vascular plant specimens from herbaria at Mississippi State University, University of Mississippi, Delta State University, University of Southern Mississippi, Gulf Coast Research Laboratory, Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, and Institute for Botanical Exploration. A web interface that allows for integrated database searches will be established through the High Performance Computing Collaboratory at Mississippi State University. Specimen imaging and label digitization will provide worldwide access to the collections, biological and geographical metadata for broad-scale studies based on plants, and a permanent back-up of specimen data in the event of natural or other disasters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting high quality data set will provide tools for plant identification and information on plant distributions in Mississippi to government agencies, researchers, and the general public. These data have applications in tracking rare and invasive species, developing environmental policy, increasing citizen knowledge of the natural history of Mississippi, and enhancing K-12 science education with interactive tools. The data will contribute to the development of a comprehensive list of plants in Mississippi and national efforts to catalog and map plant diversity. Numerous undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Herbaria are natural history collections that document plants over both time and space, that protect plant specimens, and that form the foundation for scientific studies in botany, agriculture and plant conservation.  Although Mississippi ranks in the top third to half of US states for the predicted number of plant species, documentation of our plants has been sparse and represents a major gap in our knowledge of the flora of North America.  This grant allowed all the herbaria in the state of Mississippi to upgrade and update our herbaria, to image and digitize all data associated with the specimens, and to display our collections data in one central web portal (http://sernecportal.org/portal/index.php), allowing easy access to the information and providing a fuller and more complete picture of all the plants that occur in the state.  The Pullen Herbarium of the University of Mississippi now has images and searchable data displayed for all of its &gt;80,000 plant specimens.  This information can now be accessed and utilized by researchers, educators and the general public.  The amassed data is serving as the basis for developing a more complete checklist and atlas of Mississippi plants, and can be used to address questions in ecology of invasive species, systematics and biogeography, and to develop educational materials that can be integrated into the Mississippi science education framework. The project is named Magnolia grandiFLORA in honor of the official state tree and flower of Mississippi, and to highlight the comprehensive and collaborative spirit of all the investigators involved.
