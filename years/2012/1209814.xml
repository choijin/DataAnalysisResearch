<AbstractNarration>Rivers provide fundamental ecosystem services to human societies and the environment, from delivery and purification of water supplies to eco-tourism. Successful environmental policies and effective management of freshwater resources require detailed and mechanistic knowledge of the biogeochemical processes occurring in rivers. However, understanding of the biogeochemistry of large rivers is far from complete, and there is a paucity of research on ecological processes in large rivers. Dissolved organic matter is a fundamental component of streams and rivers. In addition to being a source of nutrients for microorganisms, dissolved organic matter can influence acidity, light penetration and the concentration of oxygen and trace metals. The goal of this project is to fill knowledge gaps regarding the biogeochemistry of dissolved organic matter in large rivers, and the interactions between dissolved organic matter and microbial processes such as nutrient uptake and extracellular enzyme activity. The research will be conducted in seven large rivers in the western and midwestern United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This doctoral dissertation improvement project will contribute to a better understanding of large river ecology and river management in the U.S. The results will be presented at an international scientific meeting and published in peer-reviewed journal articles. An undergraduate student will work as a research assistant on the project and by doing so will gain valuable experience and training. Both the PI and co-PI will use the project as a demonstration or case study in the courses they teach at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Lastly, the co-PI will present results from this study at the Indiana University Women in Science Conference as a means of engaging undergraduate women who are interested in research but unsure about pursuing a career in science.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this project was to fill knowledge gaps regarding the biogeochemistry of dissolved organic matter in large rivers, and the interactions between dissolved organic matter and microbial processes such as nutrient uptake and extracellular enzyme activity.  During the summer of 2012, we sampled ten large river locations in two different biomes: the Western and Midwestern U.S.  The Midwestern rivers included the Manistee, Muskegon, Tippecanoe, Saint Joseph, and White Rivers.  The Western rivers included the North Platte, Bear, Colorado and two sites on the Green River.  At each site, samples were collected for microbial enzyme activity, as well as nutrient and dissolved organic carbon concentrations, optical properties of the dissolved organic matter, and bacterial density.
