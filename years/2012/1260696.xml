<AbstractNarration>Foraminiferal magnesium to calcium ratios (Mg/Ca) are an important and widely used tool in studies of past ocean temperatures. Recent research suggests that variations in salinity could have a greater influence on Mg/Ca paleothermometry than previously believed, with significant implications for interpretations of paleotemperature data. The magnitude of that influence, however, remains under debate. The proposed work, led by researchers at UC Santa Barbara, aims to resolve this problem using a three-pronged approach to quantify the influence of salinity on foraminiferal Mg/Ca: 1) analysis of sediment trap and core-top samples from three regions with large salinity gradients (Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and northwest Africa); 2) synthesis of available sediment trap, core-top, and plankton tow data from low latitudes; and 3) assessment of secondary diagenetic effects on foraminiferal Mg/Ca in high-salinity regions. Comparative and multivariate techniques will be used to evaluate the magnitude of the salinity influence relative to other known influences (e.g., temperature, seasonality, seafloor dissolution) on foraminiferal Mg/Ca.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will lead to increased confidence in reconstructions of past temperature and, consequently, in model assessments of climate sensitivity. Knowledge and data sharing will be facilitated by the development of a searchable foraminiferal Mg/Ca database. The project will team a senior faculty member with a junior faculty member who is a member of an underrepresented group, and will provide support for a post-doctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>

This method, which relies on the Mg/Ca ratio of fossil foraminiferal tests (microscopic shells) from marine sediment cores, allows researchers to reconstruct sea surface temperatures in the past, with the goal of understanding ocean and climate change on times scales of 1000 to 10 million years. One of the biggest uncertainties in the use of Mg/Ca paleo-thermometry is how to calibrate the method so that measured changes can be accurately converted to past temperatures. There are two major uncertainties: the first is the actual sensitivity of Mg/Ca to temperature; the second is whether secondary factors, such as seawater salinity and pH, also affect Mg/Ca and hence paleo-temperature calculation.  The major outcome of the research was to develop, with the aid of a new compilation of published data, new measurements on samples from critical regions, and a new study of samples from Hawaii, new calibrations for Mg/Ca paleo-thermometry. All of the modern foraminifera samples used in this study came from either sediment traps or plankton tows, which can be directly related to the prevailing conditions (i.e. seawater temperature, salinity and pH/carbonate ion) at the time of test (shell) formation.  The calibrations developed from this data reveal three new findings: 1) the actual sensitivity of Mg/Ca to temperature appears to be about 2/3rds of previously determined values; 2) salinity does have an influence on Mg/Ca, but with a smaller sensitivity than several previous studies; and 3) pH also has an influence on Mg/Ca, but with a large uncertainty that must be narrowed in future studies.   When the new calibrations are applied to existing tropical Mg/Ca data spanning the last Ice Age, ~20,000 years ago, the new calibrations suggest cooling similar to previous interpretations of the published data, or, for an alternative calibration relying on carbonate ion, a somewhat smaller cooling. Because tropical estimates of cooling are a critical measure of the sensitivity of the climate system, refining those changes with the new calibrations is an important goal for the paleoclimate community.
