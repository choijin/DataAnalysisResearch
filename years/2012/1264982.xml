<AbstractNarration>1264982 - Xu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to investigate, across submicron to centimeter size scales, the principle of signal processing from single synapse to multi-neuron circuitry, via a 2D free-standing optoelectronic graphene platform. The approach is to grow neurons directly on a large-area suspended graphene membrane, which is part of an ultra-sensitive graphene transistor in a liquid environment. Through graphene photoconductance measuring, patch-clamp recording, and optical imaging, the electrical, chemical, and optical changes in axons, dendrites and synapses across a neuronal circuit will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General statement:&lt;br/&gt;Neuronal activity is typically mapped using electrode arrays that stimulate neuronal cells and record their electrical responses.  This system has several limitations: the number of electrodes is typically small and placement of cells in relation to electrodes is not well defined.  This proposal will deploy novel material, grapheme, to be used as the surface for culturing neurons.  Grapheme has optoelectrical effect, meaning that electrical activity of cells may be monitored optically using a microscope.  This would circumvent limitations of electrode arrays and would allow for monitoring activity of a much larger number of neuronal cells.</AbstractNarration>
