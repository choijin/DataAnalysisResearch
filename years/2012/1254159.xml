<AbstractNarration>Blood is pumped from the heart to the capillaries through a highly branched and interconnected network known as the cardiovascular system, with vessel sizes that range from microns to centimeters and blood flow speeds that differ by a factor of 1000. Similar types of vascular networks are essential for the flow of resources in nearly all multicellular organisms, including plants (xylem networks), insects (tracheal networks), and mammals. Understanding which evolutionary principles and environmental factors drive the structure of vascular networks, and what constrains the flow through them, could help lead to a better understanding of organismic structure and function with implications for systems as diverse as forests, food webs, and even tumors. This research project will supply the data needed to directly test existing models and to develop new, more realistic models. Outputs will be new software for extracting vascular data from images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT)), a large database for vascular measurements in plants and animals, identification of branching patterns common to specific taxa or tissues, and new theory. Measurements will include vessel radii, lengths, branching ratios, and branching angles. Existing models are contradicted by some preliminary results, including asymmetric branching (two daughter vessels of different sizes and different flow) and deviations from self-similarity (similar branching patterns recurring across scales). New models will be constructed to incorporate these findings and used to predict connections between the geometry of and flow through vascular networks. A key prediction of models will be scaling exponents that describe how the number of capillaries changes with network volume. In an attempt to enable quick translation of branching geometry into predictions for flow rate, techniques will be adapted to classify vascular networks according to a suite of these characteristic scaling exponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closely integrated with these research objectives are three educational goals: 1) teach students how to use image recognition software to extract data from images across biological fields, including museum collections and labs, 2) teach students how to translate empirical results into equations and test specific, mechanistic hypotheses, and 3) motivate data sharing with the public and scientific community via websites for large, comprehensive databases that will accelerate scientific research and community outreach. High school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers will all be trained during this research. Notably, summer research experiences for three high school students will be provided for each year of the project. A critical aspect of this training is in teaching students how to combine theory and empirical data and how to disseminate research findings through publications, websites, curricular materials, and talks at professional meetings as well as outreach. The PI has experience educating and training students at all levels and will actively recruit students from under-represented groups to engage in informatics research. Publications, databases, code, and curricular materials will all be made available through websites. Together, this work will provide an example of how computer vision techniques can be used to extract data from biological images around the world.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through work funded by this grant, we have achieved all our major aims.  1.    We created Angicart software that prcoesses angiograms--images of     blood vessels inside of organisms--and extracts information and data  on vessel radius, length, connectivity, branching angles, loopy  structures, and    more. The original version only applied to branching  hierarchical    vascular trees, but we have since extended Angicart to  apply to loopy    networks and any imaging modality (MRI, CT, Clarity,  confocal).    Moreover, we are now applying these methods to neuron  morphology and    through other efforts we have obtained a large number  of plant network data    as well. 2. Based on the software development  and data collection in   the  first aim, we have tested existing  vascular theory with data,    identified shortcomings, and created new  theory to address problems    we've found to better align theory with  the realities of vascular    network. In particular, we've shown that  scaling ratios for vessel     radii--the  ratio of a child vessel to a  parent vessel-- has a central     tendencay  that matches theoretical  predictions, while analogous   scaling   ratios  for vessel lengths show  no central tendency and do not   match   theory. In  addition, we have  measured a substantial amount of    asymmetric   branching--vessels with  different sizes that share the   same  parent--in   both radii and  length. Through theoretical work, we   have  shown that asymmetry in  vessel radius has little effect on   predictions  about blood flow or  heart rate or growth so long as the   total  cross-sectional area of  vessels is conserved (known as DaVinci's   rule)  is maintained, and  data show that this tends to be the case. In    contrast, the asymmetry  in lengths do affect predictions and not  follow a   conservation law  that corresponds to theory. Through a series  of   papers, we have  created new theory to address some of these  findings. In   our papers  we have shown how to model asymmetric  branching by   perturbing off of  symmetic avreage values, how to  optimize branching   angles between  asymmetric child vessels, and how to  explore the space of    possiblilties to fill the space of the body  using asymmetric networks.    Results of this new theory show how diverse  branching patterns in    vascular networks can still lead to canonical  relationships such as    organismal metabolic rate increaing with body size  to the 3/4 exponent.    All of this naturally leads to questions about  universal classes and    equivalenece classes among biological networks.  3. To truly  understand   vascular networks, we should be able to compare   differences among types   of biologiical networks--animal versus plant,   different organs or   tissues, cancer vasulature and stroke recovery   vaculature versus healthy   vessels--and use them to categorize networks   and understand their   source and function. A result of this would   eventually be categories  that correspond to equivalence classes among   biological networks. A  natural method for categorization is   machine-learning. Machine-learning    is a powerful tool but often considered a black box. Combining    machine-learning with mechanistic theory should only make it more    effective and interpretable. Here we take a first step towards building    that bridge by using mechanistic theory about vascular networks to    choose better feature spaces (data spaces to which machine-learning    algorithms are applied). In so doing, we achieve a two-fold, mutually    reinforcing benefit: a. We achieve better results for categorizing    networks, and b. Results are much more interpretable because the    best-performing feature spaces are explicitly and naturally tied to    specific mechanisms. With more work in this direction, machine-hearing    and mechanistic theory might eventually be combined into a more    glass-box approach. For vascular networks specifically, we have shown    that feature spaces based on ratios of vessel radii--encapsulating    parent-child vessel relations, connectivity, asymmetry, and information    about blood flow--are the best at categorizing biological networks.   They  do significantly better than typical approaches that analyze the   raw  data of just the vessel radius and length, and we show that for our   data  this featrue space can be used to distinguish plant from animal  networks and plants from   non-flowering plants. Because scaling of  vessel radii is closely coupled  to properties of blood flow, this  suggests that strong functional  constraints on blood flow, metabolism,  and gorwth are instantiated in the  architecture of vessel networks in a  way that can be captured by these  scaling ratios. On the other hand,  feature spaces based on scaling  ratios of vessel lengths did a poor job  of disciminating among networks.  Because scaling ratios of vessel  lengths, are tightly tied to poperties  of how vascular networks fill  the space of the body, this suggests that  either space-filling  geometries are not a major discriminating factor  among biological  networks or that these scaling ratios do not adequately  describe the  space-filling and branching properties of real vascular  networks (point  2 above). Taking all of this work together,  it holds a future promise  that could be used for applicaitons as varied  as identifying the  optinal network strucure for growth for plants in  different  environments or quantifying growth trajectories and treatment   strategies for tumors.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/22/2019<br>      Modified by: Van&nbsp;M&nbsp;Savage</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
