<AbstractNarration>Carbon cycle models are used to assess how future carbon policy scenarios will influence atmospheric carbon pools and climate. The accuracy of those models depends on our understanding of major pathways in the carbon cycle. One such pathway, the decay of dead plant material (litter), is responsible for releasing more carbon into the atmosphere each year than the combustion of fossil fuel. Litter decay in forests is reasonably well understood, but both the rate and temporal pattern of litter decay are different in deserts. The effects of direct sunlight on litter may increase the rate of decay, while the lack of moisture may reduce microbial activity and decrease the decay rate. This project will test whether the optical properties of litter produced by desert plants contribute to the different pattern of litter decay. Laboratory and field experiments will be used to test the importance of sunlight as an agent of litter decay relative to other mechanisms such as microbial activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research, which will be conducted in the Sonoran Desert, will contribute to our understanding of carbon cycling in deserts and in other ecosystems where litter is exposed to intense sunlight (e.g. grasslands and agricultural systems).The investigators will develop a website that contains a guide to litter decomposition for K12 students, a companion guide to aid teachers in conducting litter decomposition experiments, and they will solicit K12 teachers to take part in this experiment. This project will provide research experience for K12 students and teachers, and undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is now unequivocal evidence that anthropogenic activities over the past 200+ years have altered the global carbon cycle.  Understanding fluxes between major global carbon pools is of paramount importance in order to predict future climate regimes.  The terrestrial biosphere is a major sink for carbon and holds approximately 2,000 gigatons of carbon, with around 1,200 gigatons held within dead biomass.  Decomposition of this dead material contributes to atmospheric carbon and is an order of magnitude higher than that of fossil fuel combustion.   Decomposition of plant litter is dictated by abiotic and biotic factors such as climate, litter chemistry and soil organisms and modeling this process is well understood in most systems.  However, in some environments such as arid deserts, decomposition of plant litter is faster than models predict and photodegradation has been proffered as an addition driver for plant litter decomposition.  In this context, photodegradation has been defined as the breakdown of organic material after exposure to solar radiation.  Since arid systems account for approximately 40% of the global land surface, a better understanding of carbon cycling in these systems is warranted.   This award was a collaboration between research laboratories at Arizona State University (ASU; NSF DEB-1256180) and Minnesota State University, Mankato (MNSU), which is an institution, focused on undergraduate education in southern Minnesota. Our collaborative team conducted a series of field and laboratory experiments to examine the effects of ultraviolet (UV) and short-wavelength visible radiation on the breakdown of plant litter in both arid (Arizona) and temperate (Minnesota) climates. One of the major constituents of plant litter is lignin, which resists decay and absorbs appreciable amounts of solar radiation.  We predicted that shorter wavelengths of solar radiation, with proportionally higher amounts of energy, would facilitate breakdown of this litter.  Experiments conducted at the main field site in Arizona revealed that litter exposed to UV and short-wavelength visible radiation had higher mass loss rates that were not attributed to initial lignin concentrations or optical properties of plant liter.  Interestingly microbes appear to be an important driver of mass loss in these systems and microbial respiration rates were correlated with water-soluble fractions of litter.  Results suggest that exposure to solar radiation increases the loss of water-soluble fractions of plant litter which in turn increases microbial activity.  In Minnesota experiments focused on how litter placement and surface albedo influence the photodecompostion of plant material.  These experiments were conducted in agricultural and wetland settings where plant detritus is often left standing upright for long periods of time. Findings from Minnesota demonstrate that photodecomposition of plant litter also occurs in temperate settings as well. Our findings will help climate modelers predict carbon flux from the decomposition of plant litter, especially in arid regions where decomposition models had previously been less accurate.

Outreach activities included collaborations with local high schools, MSNU student clubs and lifelong learner communities in Southern Minnesota.  We also established a website to detail our findings and disseminated our results through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at international and regional conferences.
