<AbstractNarration>This award supports the partnership between the National Society of Hispanic Physicists (NSHP) and the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).   The aim of the partnership is to increase the presence of physics, broadly defined, at the SACNAS National Conference.   This annual conference is an opportunity for a talented group of predominantly Hispanic and Native-American students to interact with students and professionals in their disciplines, to present their research results, to learn about cutting-edge research, and to attend a variety of professional development sessions.   This award will support the travel of a total of approximately forty students over three years to the conference.   The award will also support the attendance of four professionals per year; these will be NSHP members who participate in the NSHP sessions and judge the physics and physics-related presentations.   The award is supported by the Division of Physics, the Division of Materials Research, and the Division of Astronomical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

A large number of booths manned by universities recruiting graduate students and industries/government laboratories recruiting professional scientists offers students excellent contacts and serves as a valuable source of information as they pursue their career.
