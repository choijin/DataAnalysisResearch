<AbstractNarration>The University of Michigan is developing an integrated, holistic curricular and co-curricular support system for students with high ability and potential in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) but who for reasons associated with socioeconomic class, first generation college status, race, gender, or rigor of high school background might not experience their full potential for success at a highly competitive research university. The University of Michigan STEM (M-STEM) Academy provides transitional academic and social support for a selected cohort of approximately 50-60 students during their first and second years in the College of Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The M-STEM Academy is grounded in well-documented success strategies, developed by the Meyerhoff Scholars Program at the University of Maryland Baltimore-County, for the retention and academic success of diverse students. It expands upon the Meyerhoff model by transferring the components to a large university setting and working with students who, although-well qualified, have often struggled and not reached their full potential in this environment. It partners closely with other University of Michigan STEM education pipeline efforts such as the Center for Engineering Diversity and Outreach, the Michigan Louis Strokes Alliance for Minority Participation (MI-LSAMP) Program, and the Michigan Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (MI-AGEP) Program to provide a seamless continuum of STEM education and support services from grade school to graduate school and the workplace. The M-STEM Academy is fully supported by the University Central and College administrations in a continual effort to increase the number and success of STEM students, with an emphasis on diverse students. The assessment of the Academy by faculty in the Center for the Study of Higher and Post-Secondary Education provides continual feedback for needed modifications to the program as it is implemented.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                   The M-STEM Academy was established in 2008 to foster the academic and co-curricular success of diverse students who for reasons of race, gender, socioeconomic class, first generation college status, or rigor of high school curriculum, might not be as successful in obtaining an undergraduate engineering degree with a good GPA and a full complement of out-of-classroom activities.  It is based on the sound foundation of the Meyerhoff Scholars Program but in the very different academic setting of a major research University.  It also works with students with different incoming academic characteristics than the Meyerhoff program.  Clearly M-STEM students are high achieving or they would not have been admitted to the University of Michigan.  But they have lower incoming characteristics than the typical Michigan student as shown by ACT Math scores.  And they are disproportionately students of color, women, first generation college status, or low family income status.  M-STEM students are experiencing retention and graduation rates similar to the overall student population.  Their GPAs across the undergraduate years are higher than would be expected based on their incoming characteristics.  They are assuming leadership roles within the College.  The program is doing what it was designed to do.  The Meyerhoff model can be successfully transferred to other academic settings and with different student populations.              Since 2013, 112 M-STEM students within the College of Engineering have received S-STEM Scholarships during their first two years ranging in amounts of $750 to $5,000.  In the final year of our grant cycle (2016-2017), we awarded 20 grants to sophomore students ranging in amounts from $2000 to $5000. In this most recent round of 20 awards, 40% of the recipients were Pell grant eligible students and another 30% had unmet need of greater than $10,000.  The S-STEM Scholarships were an exceedingly important component of the overall program in that they allowed students with the greatest financial need to forego a job so they could pursue co-curricular activities to enhance their educational experience, in line with one of the goals of the M-STEM program          Last Modified: 12/06/2017       Submitted by: Cinda-Sue G Davis]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
