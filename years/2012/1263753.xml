<AbstractNarration>1263753&lt;br/&gt;Nolte&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop a multimodal imaging system that integrates TDI with simultaneous confocal and low-coherence backscatter imaging. The molecular specificity of the confocal channel, and the cellular and nuclear morphology changes from the backscatter channel, will serve to validate TDI and identify the biological mechanisms that correspond to the features observed in drug-response TDS spectrograms. They will use the multichannel system to study two well-known classes of compounds: mitochondrial toxins and Raf kinase inhibitors. TDI then will be applied to study apoptosis/necrosis, mitosis/cytokinesis and biochemical/biomechanical oscillations. These processes are important markers for drug&lt;br/&gt;efficacy and present strong physiological responses that make them ideally suited to study with&lt;br/&gt;dynamic imaging. This research will establish the types of intracellular motion that are detected by tissue dynamic imaging, the sensitivity, and the specificity to different types of mechanism of drug action. TDI will be able to track physiological responses of tissue, enabling discovery of new dynamic processes and enhancing knowledge of tissue-scale biodynamics. The successful completion of the proposed research will lay the foundation for tissue dynamics imaging to become a unique imaging tool with a broad array of future biomedical applications. These potential applications include the discovery of new drug candidates with lower side effects and lower costs to consumers, the selection of cancer chemotherapy specifically tuned to the patient to improve cancer remission and patient quality of life, and improvement in the success rate of in vitro fertilization to reduce health-care costs and remove medical complications of multiple births.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award  is co-funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) through the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) program,  and by the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Selecting the most effective cancer therapy for individual patients is a pressing need in healthcare.  Current standard-of-care cancer treatments tend to be monolithic, and the same therapy is applied to almost all patients, even though almost none of the patients will respond best to that therapy.  This NSF-funded project has developed biodynamic imaging as a new diagnostic tool for selecting the right therapy for the right cancer patients.  The technique is based on Doppler imaging similar to the familiar Doppler weather radar images of clouds on the nightly news, but biodynamic imaging uses light instead of radar, and looks inside living tissue biopsies instead of clouds.   In a typical application of this technique, a biopsy is obtained from a cancer patient.  The biopsy is kept alive and healthy, like a tissue for transplant, and is divided into numerous small pieces that each go into small wells of a multi-well plate (like multiple small test tubes).  Different FDA-approved drugs are applied to each well, changing concentrations and combinations.  Biodynamic imaging monitors the Doppler signatures from each sample over a 12 hour period.  At the end of the test, the chemotherapy that has the best Doppler pattern (related to the best effectiveness for that patient) is identified.  In this way, within 24 hours of the biopsy, before the patient begins therapy, the biodynamic diagnostic test can tell which therapy will work best for that patient.   This new approach would replace the current trial-and-error approach to cancer therapy selection that can delay effective treatment of a patient by several months, which, in the case of cancer, can mean a lifetime.  By getting the right drugs to the right patients faster, clinical outcomes for the patients will be better, medical costs will be lower, and side effects will be reduced.   The research for this NSF project has provided much of the underlying science and validation behind this potentially important new approach to selecting chemotherapy.  Future efforts are focused on translating this newly developed biomedical optical technology to the clinic, where it can begin improving the lives of cancer patients.
