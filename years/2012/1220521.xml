<AbstractNarration>The NAACL HLT conference is the major international conference in North America in the field of natural language processing. The goal of this grant is subsidize travel, conference, and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the NAACL HLT Student Research Workshop which will be held during the conference June 3-8 in Montreal, Canada. The workshop aims to attract papers both from authors who are in their early stages of academic work (possibly undergraduate and masters students) as well as from students who are approaching graduate and would like to present their thesis work. The goal is to help attract students from the first group to pursue further academic work, and to help students from the second group in their job search and career planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Papers from the student workshop are presented as posters during the main poster session of the conference. Senior researchers are assigned as mentors to each student and  provide individual feedback. A general session on on how to review papers and what to expect from reviewers is held during a lunch slot. The workshop is organized and run by students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Student Research Workshop provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of natural language processing researchers to enter the computational linguistics community. It allows the best students in the field to take their first important step toward becoming professional computational linguists by receiving critical feedback on their work from external experts, and by making contacts with other students and senior researchers in their field. The students who are involved in running and selecting papers for the workshop also gain valuable opportunities for professional growth and interaction with the researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference. The workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a skilled and diverse computational linguistics and natural language processing research community.</AbstractNarration>
