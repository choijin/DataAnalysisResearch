<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to investigate discontinuousGalerkin least-squares finite element methods (DG-LS FEMs) for &lt;br/&gt;reaction-diffusion problems with singular perturbations. The numerical approximation of singularly perturbed problems is a practically important but still difficult subject. The analytical solutions to such problems typically contain boundary or interior layers, which cause nonphysical excessive numerical oscillations in the vicinity of layers in the solutions by standard finite element method and finite difference method. Many stabilization techniques have been developed to improve numerical solutions. The drawback of these techniques is the presence of problem-dependent parameters that need to be properly tuned according to a priori knowledge of layers, which nonetheless is not achievable in most complex problems. The DG-LS FEM is robust and efficient, which does not involve such problem-dependent parameters. The proposed research will advance knowledge and understanding of the DG-LS FEM as well as singular perturbation problems, provide a theoretical framework for the analysis of DG-LS FEMs, and establish a working principle of efficient and high quality adaptive schemes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Singularly perturbed problems have attracted a lot of attention from engineers, mathematicians and scientists because of a wide range of important applications such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, semiconductor research, chemotaxis, genetics, and computational biology. Numerical approximations are usually the only way for solving such problems. There is an urgent need for a problem-dependent-parameter-free numerical method for singularly perturbed problems. This project is to develop creative solutions to fulfill this need, which will lead to reliable and efficient numerical approaches for solving complex singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problems.</AbstractNarration>

In December 2015, G.

In May 2016, H. Feng&nbsp; (male, Asian) and J.

These students have reported their research findings in regional conferences and University conferences for students, and have won several prizes. In particular, H. Feng delivered a poster presentation in the 12th Annual TAMUS PATHWAYS Student Research Symposium at Texas A&amp;M University at Corpus Christi, TX on October 22-23, 2015 and won the 1st Place in Master&rsquo;s Level - Mathematics group (http://pathways.tamucc.edu/winners_masters.html). H. Feng has also co-authored two articles with the PI, both of which have been published in peer reviewed journals. On the other hand, this project has prompted undergraduate research in numerical mathematics at TAMIU. The students involved are mainly Hispanic due to the demography or structure of the student population (TAMIU has 92% Hispanic students).
