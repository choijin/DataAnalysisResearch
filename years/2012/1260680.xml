<AbstractNarration>Can variations of the moon's orbit around the earth affect climate? Numerous studies have associated bidecadal variability in observations of physical climate and biogeochemical variables with the LNC. Particularly in and around the North Pacific, where diurnal tide constituents are strong, these observations point towards a significant influence of the LNC on temperatures, oceanic and atmospheric circulation and biogeochemical cycles. Model simulations without LNC forcing show strong internal modes of decadal variability in the North Pacific such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. LNC forcing could modulate these internal modes by (1) shifting variability into the bidecadal frequency range, (2) generate resonance, or (3) synchronize their phases. This project will test hypotheses relating LNC oscillations in tides to bidecadal variability in climate via modulations of ocean mixing and attendant effects on temperatures and modes of decadal climate variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A globally consistent parameterization of tidal mixing, that has already been tested in a climate model of intermediate complexity and shown to lead to climatically significant sea surface temperature anomalies, will be implemented in a comprehensive global climate model. This parameterization includes a new scheme of sub-grid scale bathymetry and separately considers four tidal constituents (M2, S2, K1 and O1) and their temporal variations due to the LNC. The model will be used to simulate the effects of LNC oscillations of tidal mixing on diapycnal diffusivities, temperatures, oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and modes of decadal variability in the North Pacific. Model results will be analyzed and compared to existing observations. Satellite altimeter data, now available over one full LNC, will be analyzed with the goal to improve tidal energy dissipation estimates, tidal mixing parameterizations, and the understanding of mechanisms of barotropic energy loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&amp;#8232;Understanding forcing mechanisms of climate change is critically important for decadal climate predictability. In recent decades much progress has been made in identifying and incorporating effects of aerosols, solar and volcanic variability in climate models. However, despite a considerable literature describing observations of the 18.6-year lunar nodal cycle in various climate variables its effect is not included in climate models. This project has the potential to improve climate predictions on decadal time scales particularly in the North Pacific region. Implementing the effect of the lunar nodal cycle on ocean mixing in CCSM4, which is one of the models used by the IPCC assessment reports, will contribute to these international reports of significant policy relevance. The model code will be made available to the large user community. Decadal variability in the North Pacific affects ecosystems and societies. Improved predictability of hypoxic events on the continental shelf of the west coast of North America, for example, may benefit society as these events affect living systems in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem and many commercially important fisheries in the region. Collaboration between a team of three PIs with different expertise, background (global climate modeling, tides, coupled physical- biological regional ocean modeling) and gender diversity will be fostered. A postdoctoral researcher will be trained in climate modeling and data analysis and given teaching opportunities. An undergraduate student will participate through a summer internship. A session on decadal variability in the North Pacific will be organized at the 2014 Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The North Pacific has long been shown to demonstrate a pronounced bidecadal variability in various climate indices (sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, surface winds, etc), with a prominent mode known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The warm (positive) phase of the PDO is characterized by warm SSTs (+0.2&deg;C) along the west coast of North America and cool SSTs (&minus;0.5&deg;C) in the eastern and central North Pacific, an intensification of the Aleutian low-pressure system (by ~&minus;2 hPa), and increased westerly wind stress over the central mid-latitude North Pacific. Such pronounced variability has been shown to be a driver of coastal ecosystems and regional climate variability, including connections to prolonged droughts and mountain snowpack in the western United States.</p> <p>While the effects of North Pacific climate variability have long been studied, the mechanisms driving such oscillations are not completely known. Previous work has suggested the PDO may be an example of internal resonance in ocean circulation with connections to other modes of climate variability such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation. Conversely, the PDO may be the product of an external climate forcing. The moon&rsquo;s orbit around the earth fluctuates with a regular periodicity of 18.6 years, known as the Lunar Nodal Cycle (LNC), with a pronounced effect on ocean tides (Fig. 1). The effect of tidal fluctuations on ocean mixing could potentially drive some of the temperature variability in the North Pacific.</p> <p>In this project, we tested the plausibility of the LNC as a potential forcing for Pacific climate variability using a comprehensive global climate model, the Community Earth System Model (CESM). This state-of-the-art model is used for the future climate projections for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and decadal predictability projects. We implemented an update to the tidal mixing component of the model to allow for the implementation of the LNC as a forcing to ocean tides in the model. We conducted two initial model experiments, with and without the LNC forcing (&lsquo;LNC&rsquo; and &lsquo;control&rsquo; experiments, respectively). After an initial model spin-up, each simulation was run for ~500 years to span a sufficient number of periods of the LNC (~27 cycles) in order to adequately assess the impacts of the LNC on Pacific climate.</p> <p>Initial analysis of the results indicated no significant difference in North Pacific sea surface temperature variability between the control and the LNC simulations (Figure 2 and Figure 3). In fact, the LNC experiment shows <em>reduced</em> temperature variability with a time period of 18.6 years. The LNC experiment presented significant cycling in ocean mixing for regions where tidal-forced mixing is large, but the LNC simulation did not lead to a significant cycling in surface temperatures. A third experiment was conducted with the LNC forcing amplified by 40% (&lsquo;LNCamp&rsquo; simulation). This experiment also did not show significant cycling in SSTs at the 18.6-year period. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>These results have broad implications for our understanding of the mechanisms controlling Pacific climate variability. While previous studies suggest a causal link between the LNC and bidecadal climate variability (Tanaka et al., 2012), our results indicate that such an outcome may be model dependent and not a mechanism of the climate system. Our results do show that the LNC has an influence on regional timescales of mixing, which may suggest that the LNC may impact local or regional nutrient upwelling and ocean productivity.
