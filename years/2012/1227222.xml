<AbstractNarration>Researchers, parents, and teachers all assume that infants and children learn from their social experiences. However, little is known about how social learning happens in infants and children. For example, even in a simple turn-taking game, how do toddlers and adults adapt to one another? How do they fall into a "rhythm," or affect one another's next turn? When and why do toddlers and parents show enjoyment of the game and of one another? We know almost nothing about how toddler's brains produce these social actions and emotions. The proposed research will measure moment-by-moment changes in the behaviors of toddlers and parents playing a turn-taking game, while also recording their electroencephalograms (EEG): changes in electricity on the scalp, partly caused by the brain's neocortex, which controls actions and communication. Two-year-old toddlers and parents play turn-taking games on a touch-screen table. They produce many unscripted social actions, and are sometimes rewarded for their cooperative actions. The positions of toddlers' and parents' hands and heads are motion-captured, so that their EEG can be precisely synchronized with their actions. State-of-the art analyses will derive the most meaningful information from the EEG of both toddler and parent, synchronized with their own actions and with their observation of the other's actions. Advanced statistics will be used to analyze patterns of actions and EEG events throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This paradigm will be used to investigate two major topics: First, how do toddlers' brains register not only their own actions but also other people's actions? Toddlers' brain networks for processing people's actions are virtually unknown, and have not been studied during ongoing social interactions. The results will document toddlers' brain responses to perceiving a parent's actions. This might help researchers understand how parents promote children's engagement and learning during face-to-face activities. It might also indicate why some toddlers are more socially responsive than others. Second, the rewards obtained during face-to-face interactions are crucial for children's learning, but almost nothing is known about how their brains respond to rewards during social interactions. The results will document toddlers' and adults' behavior and brain responses to rewards, especially rewards for cooperation. This will help researchers understand how toddlers develop social skills for learning in social contexts. These skills are critical when children begin school. In sum, a new paradigm for measuring time-locked brain signals and actions of turn-taking toddlers and parents will shed light on the development of skills for social connection and cooperation. The project will also provide training for undergraduate and graduate students, and interns from a charter high school for non-traditional students. The participating laboratories will also host field trips for high school seniors from underserved neighborhoods to learn about neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>

We investigated this by measuring the behavior and brain activity of toddlers and parents engaged in a novel turn-taking game.

Using a modern analytic approach called Independent Component Analysis, we were able to segment the EEG signal into biologically plausible sources of activity generated by the cerebral cortex, and classify these sources using a complete range of signal properties. Thus, for example, every child showed an independent component in their EEG activity that showed all properties of action-observation mu-suppression that have been documented in adult samples. Towards this effort, we used a public age-stratified database of MRI brain scans to generate age-matched head models, and projected the independent components to these 3D brain models.

Thus, we were able to show that in a neurologically and psychiatrically healthy sample of preschool-aged children, cortical generators of somato-motor mu-suppression show an essentially mature profile of activity, that is graded (in adults) with high levels of suppression when the child performs an action, and moderate levels of suppression when they watch a partner perform an action.</p> <p>Subsequent to completing this study (the first results of which were published by Liao et al, 2015), our lab moved to a better location and established a greatly improved testing facility.
