<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor H. V. Rasika Dias of the University of Texas at Arlington will investigate organometallic chemistry of late d-block elements. In particular, the proposed activity is aimed at developing strategies for the stabilization of rare metal adducts featuring one or more unsaturated, carbon centered, pi-acid ligands such as carbon monoxide, alkenes, and alkynes on either "naked" or auxiliary ligand supported group 12 metal (Zn, Cd, Hg) or coinage metal (Cu, Au, Au) ions.  In addition to the study of structures and metal-ligand bonding of these complexes, metal mediated cycloaddition processes such as [2+2+2] chemistry and nucleophilic addition chemistry of coordinated ligands are of particular interest as they permit the construction of useful ring systems on a metal ion template and the functionalization of hydrocarbons.  The new weakly coordinating and highly fluorinated ligands and anions Professor Dias plans to develop during this work will be potentially useful for the stabilization of reactive and labile metal molecules involving various other metal ions as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will significantly improve our understanding of the organometallic chemistry of the group 11 and 12 metals and provide useful new information on key intermediates proposed for a range of industrially important metal catalyzed processes.  This work will provide milder routes to the activation of  bonds and useful new chemicals.  The principal investigator will also mentor K-12 teachers and high school students, and train graduate and undergraduate researchers with diverse backgrounds in modern chemical research.   Professor Dias also plans to utilize the Planetarium at the University of Texas at Arlington to show digital movies to educate and excite young audiences and general public on chemistry and science.  Extensive collaborations with faculty members at foreign universities will continue as they provide opportunities for students to learn new cultures and the value of team-work.</AbstractNarration>
