<AbstractNarration>PI: Nikolla, Eranda&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1226569&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Electrolysis of water is an electrochemical process that generates hydrogen from water. Hydrogen is a key energy source and chemical, widely used in a number of important industrial processes. One of the drawbacks with this process is that it is energy intensive. In this proposal, we describe an approach that uses the chemical energy of a biofuel, a renewable source of energy - its processing leads to no net CO2 emissions - to run water electrolysis using solid oxide electrolyzers (SOEs). Biofuel-assisted SOEs are solid-state electrolyzers that, in principle, can electro-oxidize any oxygenated hydrocarbon (i.e. a biofuel) at the anode, and utilize its chemical energy internally to drive the electrochemical water splitting at the cathode.  Our preliminary results show that the main challenges with SOEs operating with biofuels such as ethanol are: (i) the high overpotential losses at the cathode induced by the high activation energy barrier required to split water on the conventional cathode materials and (ii) the poor stability of the conventional anode materials due to carbon poisoning. The PI's long-term research goal is to develop robust SOE electrode (anode and cathode) materials that can efficiently generate pure H2 from water using the chemical energy of any biofuel source. In this two year BRIGE proposal, the overall objective is to identify robust SOE anode and cathode materials for ethanol-assisted SOEs. We will initially focus on ethanol, since it represents a reasonable model biofuel, containing both C-O and C-C bonds, characteristic of any biofuel molecule. It is our central hypothesis that modifying conventional monometallic SOE electrode materials (such as Ni, Co at the cathode and Ni at the anode) via alloying with another element (such as Ru, Rh at the cathode and Sn, Au, Ag at the anode) will induce geometric and electronic changes to the parent metal surface that will impact the chemistry on these surfaces and lead to improved performance. We propose to employ a combined experimental/theoretical approach to unearth the surface chemistry that governs (i) the process of electrochemical water splitting on cathode materials (such as Ni, Co, Ni/Ru, Ni/Rh, Co/Ru and Co/Rh alloy) and (ii) the stability of the anode materials (such as Ni and Ni/Sn, Ni/Ag and Ni/Au alloy). This information will allow us to identify the electrode materials with the outmost activity and stability. We expect that this work will lead to the development of robust SOEs systems that use the chemical energy of ethanol to drive the production of clean H2 from water. In addition, it will provide significant fundamental insights that can be utilized (i) to achieve the PI's long-term research goal and (ii) to develop other electrochemical systems that involve similar chemistries.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research has broader impact in terms of science and engineering, training and education. The fundamental insights obtained in this project have the potential to move the field of SOEs significantly forward by (i) determining the surface chemistry that governs the electrochemical reactions at the SOE electrodes and (ii) developing improved SOE electrode materials. In addition, these insights can be used to develop other systems that involve similar chemistries such as fuel cells and low temperature electrolyzers. This work will also contribute to the enhancement of the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at WSU. The PI plans to use the fundamental electrochemical insights obtained from this project to design a course, for senior undergraduate and graduate students, titled "Fundamentals of Electrochemistry'. In addition, the PI has arranged for undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities at WSU to work in the lab this summer through the Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) and The Michigan-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Programs. The PI is establishing partnerships with the broader community and local high schools in the area to educate and inspire students from traditionally underrepresented minorities to pursue a career in science and engineering. More specifically, the PI is arranging field trips and demonstration experiments for 11th and 12th graders from the Pontiac and Bethune Alternative Academy High Schools in Pontiac, Michigan. In addition, she plans to recruit two senior high school students to work in her laboratory as a summer internship.</AbstractNarration>

Hydrogen is a key energy source and chemical, widely used in a number of important industrial processes. One of the drawbacks with this process is that it is energy intensive. In this project, our objective was to determine the factors that govern the inefficiency in water splitting using solid oxide electrolysers (SOEs) and design SOE materials that are more stable and active toward water activation making this process economically viable. In addition to this, the objective of the project was to contribute to the advancement of undergraduate students through research, the undergraduate and graduate curriculum through class development and community through outreach activities with local high school students.  Outcomes  - First principles quantum chemical calculations were used to develop an understanding of the mechanism that governs water splitting on Ni and Ni alloy cathode SOE electrocatalysts.  We found that water activation was the rate-limiting step in most of these materials and identified optimal Ni alloys that can be used as promising SOE cathode materials for this process.  - First principles quantum chemical calculations along with well-defined isotope kinetic and electrochemical studies were used to identify the mechanism of oxygen evolution on layered, nickelate oxide SOE anode electrocatalysts. These studies showed that the surface structure of these oxides plays an important role in the chemistry and can be used to control the activity. Using well-controlled synthesis techniques we were able, for the first time, to synthesize shape-controlled nickelate oxide electrocatalyst with high activity toward oxygen exchange.  - Several students from underrepresented groups (female) and K-12 schools with research in the subject.  - Collaboration was developed with the Michigan Science Center by participating in the "Ask the Expert" series in order to enhance the knowledge of the community in the Detroit Area regarding energy and environment.  - Development of a GO-GIRLs Keeping in Touch Workshop "Material Girls Get Energetic!" in order to enhance the interested of middle and high school underrepresented female student from the local Detroit schools to pursue higher education in science and engineering.  The research was presented at several conferences:  -   The Electrochemical Society Meeting, Honolulu, Hawaii, October 2012  -   The American Chemical Society, New Orleans, Louisiana, April 2013  -   The North American Catalysis Society Meeting, Louisville, Kentucky, June 2013   -   The American Chemical Society Fall Meeting, Indianapolis, Indiana, September 2013  -   American Institute of Chemical Engineers Annual Meeting, San Francisco, California, October 2013  -   The American Chemical Society Spring Meeting, Dallas, Texas, March 2014   -   The American Chemical Society Fall Meeting, San Francisco, California, August 2014  -   The American Chemical Society Fall Meeting, Boston, September 2015  -   American Institute of Chemical Engineers Annual Meeting, Salt Lake City, November 2015  -   The American Chemical Society Spring Meeting, Colorado, March 2015   The scientific results described above have been organized in three main peer-reviewed manuscripts:   - Ma X., Wang B., Xhafa E., Sun K., Nikolla E., "Synthesis of nanostructured La2NiO4+&delta; and their anisotropic properties for oxygen diffusion", Chemical Communications, 2014.  - Gu X., Nikolla E., "Fundamental Insights Into High Temperature Water Electrolysis Using Ni-Based Electrocatalysts", Journal of Physical Chemistry C, acs.jpcc.5b07814, 2015.  - Nacy A., Ma X., Nikolla E., "Nanostructured Nickelate Oxides as Efficient and Stable Cathode Electrocatalysts for Li-O2 Batteries", Topics in Catalysis, 2015.
