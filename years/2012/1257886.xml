<AbstractNarration>In animals, normal limb movements such as walking or reaching require sensory information from the limb regarding their movements and mechanics.  While fishes use their limbs (or paired fins) for a diverse array of behaviors, little is known about the role sensory abilities plays in those functions.  This project examines the fundamental question of how the sensory and motor elements of the fin propulsive system co-adapt to generate a functional neuromechanical system.  In particular, it will determine how physical properties of the fins such as stiffness, size and shape, are reflected in the biological instrumentation of the fins for sensation.  In addition to providing a new tractable model for studying integration of sensation and movement, data from this project will inform the design of fin-inspired propulsive devices for underwater vehicles. The broader impacts of this project will provide outreach experiences for children on the South Side of Chicago as well as opportunities for undergraduate and graduate training in the laboratory and builds educational activities at the Field Museum of Natural History.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In many vertebrates, including humans, the ability to control and coordinate body movements relies heavily on proprioception, a type of mechanosensation that includes the ability to sense one?s own movement and relative positions of body elements in space. Proprioception is critical to our ability to use our forelimbs to reach, grasp and perform other tasks. Despite the importance of proprioception to movement in tetrapods, many fundamental questions exist on how such systems are structured and function and how they vary across species.  Here we examine forelimb proprioception in fishes to inform general understanding of this sensory modality, to address fundamental questions of proprioception in fishes, which are only beginning to be explored from the perspective of mechanosensation. Not only do we aim to better understand this sensory modality but also this research may be of use to engineers designing autonomous underwater swimming devices. Fish forelimbs (the pectoral fins) are readily accessible and function in a range of behavior including locomotion (studied here), grooming, brood care and feeding.  The specific aims of the proposed work are to use the morphologically and behaviorally diverse group of pectoral fin swimmers, the wrasses (Labridae), as a study system in which to explore how sensory function is related to fin ray biomechanics and movement of fins during swimming and to test the role of fin ray proprioception in locomotion.  Wrasses were chosen because of their diversity and the extensive use of the pectoral fins in swimming.  Our research has shown that the fins of all fish studied are invested with mechanosensory nerve fibers and that fin sensory nerve fibers are capable of capturing proprioceptive information. Examination of mechanical properties of fins showed variation in stiffness of the fins among wrasses. By comparing across species, it was determined that the sensitivity of these neurons is associated with the mechanical properties of the fin. Sensory nerves of flexible fins that bend substantially during behavior are less sensitive to bending than sensory nerves of stiff fins that bend very little. This work suggests that the nervous system is tuned to the mechanics and movement of the propulsive element.  Experiments also demonstrated that sensory feedback from the fins is critical to the normal performance of behavior. Without sensory feedback fish can still swim with the pectoral fins but the movements of the fins change and, we suggest, are less efficient at generating propulsive forces. When these fish swim at high speeds they change gaits, using pectoral fins to power movement at slow and moderate speeds and oscillation of the body and tail at the highest speeds. At those high speeds the fins are tucked against the side of the body. Without sensory feedback, as swimming speed increases the transition to body and tail powered swimming occurs at lower swimming speeds. We suggest that without sensory feedback to help control the fins they are not able to make the most of their propulsive capacity.    These studies provide insight into how mechanical sensation from limbs is related to limb structure and the role such sensation plays in behavior. It can inform work on other animals and engineering of devices with limb-like pelements.       Last Modified: 10/08/2018       Submitted by: Melina E Hale]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
