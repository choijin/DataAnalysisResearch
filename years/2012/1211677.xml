<AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative project is to carry out a systematic search for sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SBHBs) using as the primary signature the Doppler shift of the broad emission lines emitted by gas that is bound to one of the black holes. Finding such close SBHBs constitutes a crucial test of modern scenarios for galaxy evolution that predict their presence. The program will also test a variety of other physical models that invoke SBHBs to explain the formation of stellar cusps after galaxy mergers and mass deficits therein and models for precessing radio jets and X-shaped radio sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of an undergraduate student and a postdoc, outreach via public lectures, and lab experiments for non-scientist astronomy students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Gravitationally bound supermassive black hole binaries (SBHBs) are thought to be a natural product of galactic mergers in the universe. They however remain very hard to find in observations, thus raising a question about their number and characteristic signatures associated with these systems. The aim of this collaborative project is a systematic search for close, gravitationally bound SBHBs using the broad optical emission lines as their primary signature.  Our part of collaboration has developed a theoretical calculation to evaluate the probability that a SBHB will be detected in the spectroscopic survey carried out by our collaborators given the rate of evolution of such binaries expected from theory, as well as the capabilities of spectroscopic observations.  We have also developed a theoretical database of more than 10 million modeled optical broad emission lines associated with SBHBs of different configurations. We used these profiles to investigate correlations between the profile shapes and underlying SBHB properties, such as their orbital separation, eccentricity and mass ratio.  The theoretical models we developed will be used for direct comparison with the data on SBHB candidates obtained from observations by our collaborators at Penn State and other groups in the future. This comparison will provide the test for current theoretial models of SBHBs and opportunity to interpret the observed data.  The results of this project have so far been dissiminated through publications in scientific journals and talks in scientific conferences and seminars. They also resulted in research projects for two physics graduate students at Georgia Tech.       Last Modified: 09/29/2015       Submitted by: Tamara Bogdanovic]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
