<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on understanding the linkages between water acquisition by temperate forest trees (maples, oaks) and their strategies to acquire mineral nutrients, especially calcium and silica.  Trees act as powerful "pumps" to bring up soil water and groundwater, and as the soil wets and dries through the season, trees shift their water sources as needed.  The investigation will employ isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen to trace those shifts in a heavily instrumented biogeochemistry study site in central Pennsylvania, part of the NSF Critical Zone Observatory network.  At the same time as they acquire water, trees acquire nutrients from the soil.  Investigators will test ideas about how mineral nutrient sources may change as water sources change.  Trees take up nutrients they need, and when leaf drop occurs, recycle them to the soil.  One question is how important is the "mining" of nutrients from deep levels in the nutrient budget.  If trees cannot mine nutrients, then they are limited to the store that is in shallow soil and in standing vegetation. Some evidence suggests that in some species tree roots leak water to shallow soils - one possible explanation is that they do this to make nutrients available from otherwise dry, shallow soils during times of water stress.  Strontium isotopes and the ratios of germanium to silicon and strontium to calcium will be used to test these hypotheses more explicitly.  This builds on previous work on mineral nutrient cycles the investigators have carried out in tropical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The response of forests and of biogeochemical cycles to climate change is an important consideration because of the possible feedbacks on the carbon and water cycles.  A prediction of most climate models is for more variable precipitation patterns, with increased periods of drought even under overall wetter conditions.  Water and nutrient acquisition strategies for species that are better suited to these variable conditions may predict success patterns among species in adapting to climate change in temperate forests.  Such species may also be able to increase their utilization of CO2 under increased CO2 levels if they are better able to acquire nutrients even under conditions of low soil water availability.  It is critical to improve our understanding of  the coupling between water and nutrient cycles in order to better predict the response of these important ecosystems to climate change, and their future impacts on the carbon and water cycles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: We obtained data on the sources and cycling rate of major inorganic nutrients in a hardwood forest representative of the northeastern US. The data indicate that the shallow soil was the source of the nutrients, and that tree uptake is fast enough to seasonally deplete the soil of soluble elements during the growing season.  Measurements on sap flux rates and chemistry give estimates of nutrient uptake that broadly agree with an independent method using litterfall fluxes and chemistry.  Aluminum, which is a toxic element for most plants, is largely excluded by tree roots but nevertheless shows a biological cycle that is about 20 times slower than that for silica, another rock-derived element, and 50 &ndash; 200 times slower that potassium, an important plant nutrient.  Broader impacts:  This is among the first studies to combine sap flow rate measurements with sap flow chemistry, demonstrating a new approach to studying chemical cycling by forests. The linkages between plant water use, driven by transpiration, and element uptake can be quantified using this approach, leading to improved understating of water and nutrient cycles and potentially suggesting ways to better manage tree plantation water and fertilizer use.  This project was designed to gain insight on how deciduous trees in a temperate hardwood forest from the northeastern U.S. acquire soil nutrients and water, and how that might change through the growing season.  We particularly focused on calcium and silica, as they represent two classes of nutrient elements and we have tracers available to help us understand their sources.  The tracers include the isotopic composition of the element strontium, which behaves in many ways like calcium.  Strontium has several isotopes, and the ratio of strontium 87 to strontium 86 varies depending on the sources of the strontium, and by inference, calcium. Another relative novel tracer that we used is the trace element germanium, which behaves much like silicon.  The germanium-silicon ratio provides us information on the sources and uptake pathways for silicon in vegetation, as well as in stream and soil water.    The strontium isotope data from the leaves and the sap is close to that found in the upper 50 cm of the soil.  Although the trees may get water from greater depths during dry periods, it appears that the shallow soil is the source of most of the strontium and by inference calcium.  During transport of the sap up to the leaves strontium is absorbed by the xylem tissue, so that the proportion of calcium to strontium is higher in leaves than in soil solutions or sap.  The isotopic composition of the strontium in soil and sap is consistent with a mixture or strontium derived from weathering the shale bedrock and from deposition of atmospheric dust and salts.  In stream waters an additional source of strontium and calcium is the dissolution of calcium carbonate found in the bedrock below the soil. This calcium carbonate dissolves relatively easily, and is absent in the shallow soils.   In contrast, silicon is mostly transported to the leaves, where it forms phytoliths (silica bodies).  Through the growing season, the silica content of the leaves increases as more water is transpired through the leaves. We observed the same effect for two species of oaks (red and chestnut oak) and sugar maple.  At the same time, silica in soil solutions went down, indicating that plant uptake is fast enough during the growing season to temporarily deplete the pool of available silica in soils.  Silica is returned from the plant to the soil by litterfall at the end of the growing season.  We also calculated the rate at which the forest cycled several elements, including potassium, silicon, calcium, strontium and magnesium.  These calculations were made using the chemistry of leaf litter and the rate of leaf litter fall under the same three different species that dominate the tree canopy (red oak, chestnut oak and sugar maple).  These data reflect the nutrient demand of the forest and the rate at which nutrient elements are taken up and recycled to the soil.  Most of the nutrient supply in a given year is derived from the decomposition of previous years? litter fall.           Last Modified: 11/30/2016       Submitted by: Louis A Derry]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
