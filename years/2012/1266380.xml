<AbstractNarration>Dmitrii E. Makarov is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop and employ computer simulations and theory to study the coupling between mechanical and chemical phenomena in biological and synthetic molecular systems.  The research focuses on rational design of novel mechano-sensitive molecular systems, characterization of multidimensional free energy landscapes of mechanically stressed biomolecules, and theory of dissipative phenomena in proteins.  The award is cofunded by the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory program in the Division of Materials Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research advances our understanding of the interplay between mechanical and chemical forces in living organisms, which accounts for structural integrity of tissues and bone, enables organisms' defense against various diseases and lies at the heart of many vital biological phenomena. It may further impact bottom-up design of novel polymeric and bio-polymeric materials with unique mechanical properties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The key outcomes of this research project are as follows:  1. The Makarov group and their collaborators have developed a comprehensive theory, along with computational tools, that allow one to predict how molecules respond when mechanical forces are applied to them. Pulling on individual molecules mechanically is known to induce novel chemical transformations, but prediction of such phenomena has been largely based on trial and error or on chemical intuition. The theoretical tools developed by this research allow chemists to design novel "mechanophores" (i.e. molecules whose chemical properties are changed by mechanical forces) computationally.  2. When a piece of material is bent or squeezed, individual molecules within this material experience a mechanical force, which may change their chemical properties. This, in turn, may lead to a change in the material?s physical properties (such as its color or its resistance to fracture). Theoretical and computational studies carried out as part of this project have provided important insights into how macroscopic forces applied to a bulk sample are transmitted to individual molecules. These insights enable bottom-up design of smart materials, whose mechanical properties are programmed by the arrangement of their constituent individual molecules.  3.
