<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1206468            PI: Dillen, J. A.       ORG: Materials Research Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Spring 2012 MRS Symposium RR: Molecules to Materials - Multiscale Interfacial Phenomena in Biological and Bio-inspired Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Buried interfaces, i.e., interfaces that are occluded within the final composite material or functional structure, are crucial to a variety of biological processes and applications, including:  (1) biological wet/dry adhesion in barnacles and geckos; (2) biological control over mineral growth and functional properties in biominerals; (3) tissue engineering; and (4) bio-lubrication, for example, in joints.  Rational design of bio-inspired materials for applications from biomedicine to sensors and from catalysts to high toughness composites depends on a detailed understanding of the structure, chemistry, routes of assembly, mechanical properties, and wear-processes at these interfaces.  With typical length scales ranging from the subnanometer to macroscopic dimensions and the complexities arising from the hybrid (hard/soft, organic/inorganic, etc.) character of these materials, the synthesis, simulation, and in situ functional characterization of such buried interfaces is a significant challenge.  These challenges are currently addressed by experts from a number of communities that do not generally interact, as they currently have no common platform.  The proposed symposium seeks to create such a multi-disciplinary forum and will actively recruit contributions from materials science, chemistry, biochemistry, medicine, biotechnology and state-of-the-art in situ characterization methodologies (e.g. Xray, electron imaging and tomography, spectroscopy, cryo-techniques).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:   The organizers are particularly interested in increasing the participation of underrepresented groups (women, minorities, and disabled persons), undergraduate institutions and historically black colleges and universities, and young researchers (students, postdocs, and young faculty).  To this end, they are requesting funds to support the participation of these groups through travel grants for two exceptional female young faculty invited speakers and to up to nine others from these groups who have been accepted to make oral or poster presentations.</AbstractNarration>
