<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar on Plant Lipids: &lt;br/&gt;Structure, Metabolism, and Function&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ruth Welti, Kansas State University&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Edgar Cahoon, University of Nebraska&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The 2013 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Plant Lipids: Structure, Metabolism, and Function, to be held January 27 to February 1, 2013 at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas,  is being organized by the GRC, an organization internationally known for high-quality, cutting-edge meetings.  The program for the meeting is assembled around the theme of "Emerging and advancing research areas in plant lipid metabolism and signaling".  Presentations will focus on elucidation of lipid signaling and lipid metabolic mechanisms, strategies to enhance production of economically important plant products, and new lipid imaging strategies.  The GRC on Plant Lipids brings together experts working to create and disseminate new research tools, discovering fundamental paradigms for lipid-mediated regulation of development, physiology, and stress responses and developing new understanding of lipid storage and homeostasis.  Formal and informal interactions throughout the conference will stimulate new research directions and provide the basis for collaborative interactions to advance fundamental research into plant lipid structure, metabolism, and function.  For the first time, a pre-conference Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), planned for January 26-27, 2013 at the same location, is being organized by investigators at the graduate student and postdoctoral levels for investigators at those levels.  Activities during the seminar are intended to provide (1) background that will enhance understanding of science presented at the subsequent conference, (2) opportunities to share research and to network with peers and experts in the field, and (3) peer and expert feedback and supportive suggestions about ongoing research.  NSF support of the GRC and GRS will partially defray registration fees for 16 graduate student and postdoctoral researchers who will present their research at one or both meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Scientific talks, poster presentations, get-togethers, and discussion at the 2013 GRC and GRS on Plant Lipids will stimulate new research directions and provide underpinnings for collaborative interactions that advance the study of lipid structure, metabolism, and function, leading to practical applications, such as improved plant production and increased seed oil quality and quantity.  The GRS will offer a concentrated opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to network and learn. The GRS will include a thought-provoking session on mentoring that will encourage participants to consider new ideas for effectively receiving and providing mentoring. The proportion of women among the invited speakers and discussion leaders (29%) at the GRC exceeds the proportion of women who attended the 2011 conference (26%). Because conference participation is an important facet of inclusion in the research community, the GRC and GRS will employ a diverse, international committee with 5 women in its 8 members, to seek additional speakers from among those submitting abstracts, with positive consideration of under-represented status. Fiscal support for registration will increase participation of students and postdoctoral trainees who present their research at the GRC and GRS.  Participating as a presenter and interacting with other scientists in the supportive atmosphere of the GRS and GRC provides an excellent opportunity for beginning researchers to develop a strong network of peers and senior colleagues, while increasing scientific breadth and depth.  This opportunity for young researchers should aid in their retention and success in scientific endeavors, providing long term benefit to society.</AbstractNarration>
