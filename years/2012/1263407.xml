<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award has been made to the University of California Merced (UCM) that will provide research training for eight students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2015. The Yosemite Environmental Science Research Training REU program will be based at the Yosemite Field Station in Yosemite National Park (YNP). Students will be involved in research projects with UC Merced faculty mentors and YNP/United States Geological Survey co-mentors that span a range of sub-disciplines, but that all use the "living laboratory" of Yosemite to answer key questions in environmental science. These projects examine both the unique ecosystems and organisms found within Yosemite (i.e., montane meadows and the Great Gray Owl), as well as key processes of broad relevance (i.e., fire and hydrology). Many of the projects seek to understand human interactions with and alteration of ecosystems, organisms, and processes; these include quantifying local impacts (e.g., pack stock use and visitation patterns), as well as the effects of global change. Project results will contribute fundamental scientific knowledge to a variety of fields, while also generating information of direct value to natural resource managers. REU student outreach activities will be broad and diverse, including a public presentation of their research open to the Yosemite community and YNP's many visitors. Training will include a session on scientific ethics and the responsible conduct of research led by staff from the Office of Research at UC Merced during the first week of the program. The program's multi-phase recruitment effort consists of both traditional "hard copy" formats as well as digital-based advertising. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in the environmental sciences. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of a REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://snri.ucmerced.edu/Yosemite_REU, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Stephen C. Hart at shart4@ucmerced.edu) or co-PI (Dr. J. Michael Beman at mbeman@ucmerced.edu).</AbstractNarration>

Supplemental professional development knowledge and skills were fostered by a week-long introduction to the natural history of the Sierra Nevada, as well as weekly æScience FridaysÆ consisting of seminars and meetings.  The first week of the program, faculty/YNP scientist team-taught lectures and field based activities that culminated in field trip in the park and wilderness skill training.  During weekly "Science Friday" seminars at the Yosemite Field Station in Wawona, participants were exposed to research projects conducted by a wide variety of federal and university scientists.  After these seminars, participants typically met with their mentors, and the day ended with a social gathering that included a barbecue and an informal social gathering with other youth programs in YNP.

We arranged with ESA for reduced registration fees (this was serendipitous and not included in our original budget) and had the students interact with other undergraduate students by attending the Student Section Mixer.  The summer 2014 participants also met with other NSF biologically oriented REU students from the Bay Area at the Bay Area Symposium of Undergraduate Research Experiences (BA SURE) held at the Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Sciences.  To foster communication skills, participants were required to present their project ideas orally to the rest of the participants and their mentors.  At the end of the program, students presented their research in an open public seminar either in Yosemite Valley (2013) or at El Portal (2014, 2015), where most of the YNP scientists and managers offices are located.
