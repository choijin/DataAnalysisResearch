<AbstractNarration>The "International Conference on Groups and Semigroups" will take place June 11-14, 2013 at Bar Ilan University in Israel.  The aim of this conference is to stimulate cooperative research among group theorists and semigroup theorists who are using related techniques in the geometric, combinatorial, and dynamical aspects of the theories.  Research in both group theory and semigroup theory has burgeoned in recent years, with many new tools and ideas connecting these fields to topology, geometry, dynamical systems, symbolic computation, and combinatorics.  The conference will feature invited talks by several of the leading researchers in these fields, highlighting new developments using geometric, combinatorial and dynamical methods to study algorithmic and asymptotic problems in groups and semigroups.  The proceedings of the conference will be published in a special issue of the International Journal of Algebra and Computation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group theory and semigroup theory are central areas of modern algebra that have close connections with diverse areas of mathematics including topology, geometry and formal language theory, as well as many applications in the physical and computational sciences. Recent developments in group theory and semigroup theory have made use of a wide variety of mathematical tools from geometry, combinatorics and symbolic dynamics. The aim of this conference is to bring together several of the world's leading experts in the use of these techniques to stimulate cooperative research in these fields.  Invited talks will be given by senior researchers from the US, Canada, Israel, Russia, and several European countries, and there will be open problem and discussion sessions involving interaction between senior researchers and junior mathematicians and graduate students.  Details of the conference may be found on the conference website at http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~msapir/stuart/main.html.</AbstractNarration>
