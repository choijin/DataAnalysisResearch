<AbstractNarration>This project will support an observational survey to find lowest mass objects formed in areas of recent star formation.  A principal goal is to uncover the initial mass function (IMF), which is the distribution of stellar/substellar objects over mass.  This will be done through analysis of optical and infrared photometry from wide-field surveys and followup spectroscopy of candidate substellar objects (brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects) identified in those data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to (1) test theories of star formation, which make different predictions for the minimum mass of the IMF and its dependence on star-forming conditions; (2) constrain the possible mechanisms for the formation of planetary-mass companions; and (3) enable estimates of the frequency of giant planets that have been ejected from planetary systems based on microlensing detections of free-floating Jupiter-mass bodies.</AbstractNarration>
