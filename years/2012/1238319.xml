<AbstractNarration>PROGRAM DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP 1238324 &lt;br/&gt;North Carolina State University &lt;br/&gt;Goldfarb &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP 1238265 &lt;br/&gt;Virginia Tech &lt;br/&gt;Fox &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP 1238305 &lt;br/&gt;Oregon State University &lt;br/&gt;Howe &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP 1238319 &lt;br/&gt;Purdue University &lt;br/&gt;Michler &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for a second five-year term (Phase II) of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) sites including the North Carolina State University (lead), Virginia Tech, Oregon State University and Purdue University. The collaborative research conducted under the CAFS umbrella focuses on optimizing genetic and cultural systems to produce high-quality raw materials for new and existing forest products industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past 50 years, much forestry research has taken place in university-based, industry-supported, cooperative research programs. These "coops" continue be extraordinarily successful at achieving research and technological advances on topics of great relevance to the forest industry. However, the ability to focus on specific disciplinary topics in response to industrial guidance is also a limitation. Many of the problems and opportunities facing forestry today, bridge disciplinary and regional boundaries. For technological advances to be made, it is necessary to approach research questions on multiple spatial and temporal scales, including the molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, and ecosystem levels. The proposed Center (CAFS) has been successful at providing the administrative structure and funding that has allowed scientists from these existing cooperatives to initiate much need cross-disciplinary research in areas of genetics, site manipulation, and growth and yield modeling. The proposal presents a plan for the 2nd five-year phase for the four original university CAFS sites, North Carolina State, Oregon State, Purdue, and Virginia Tech. This proposal also serves as a research and administrative template for the other five university sites that have joined CAFS since its interception in late 2007. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research conducted by CAFS increases the competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners by solving problems on multiple temporal and spatial scales and determining fundamental solutions that transcend traditional species, regional, and disciplinary boundaries. Member organizations of the Center benefit by becoming knowledgeable about a wider range of technological capabilities. In addition, technology transfer between Center scientists and member personnel fosters rapid implementation of new technologies. The broader scientific community benefits through refereed publications and presentations at scientific meetings. During the Phase II period, graduate student training will continue to be featured in Center research and technology transfer. Aggressive recruiting for graduate students among under-represented groups will be conducted, increasing the diversity of the workforce for both academia and industry in this traditionally diversity-deficient discipline. Opportunities will continue to be sought to involve undergraduate students in Center research activities, exposing them to the excitement of forest science and encouraging them to pursue graduate education.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We worked with cooperators in the forest industry to study how availability of water and nitrogen (N) in the soil affects development of young black walnut (<em>Juglans nigra</em>&nbsp;L.), a commercially valuable forest tree. We also evaluated how these processes change when black walnut seedlings are subjected to warming conditions, similar to what may be expected with climate change. To accomplish these goals, we measured rates of photosynthesis in black walnut seedlings and evaluated how N may translocate from the soil to the plant and be stored over-winter for use the following spring in this perennial species. We found that black walnut is highly sensitive to drought, rapidly decreasing its photosynthesis rate as drought intensity increases. When exposed to high temperatures, drought-stressed seedlings reduce their photosynthesis rates more rapidly than seedlings grown under adequate moisture availability. This suggests that black walnut may be highly susceptible to environmental stress from future climate change and the occurrence of black walnut may become more limited on sites that are prone to extended periods of drought. Irrigation may therefore become increasingly important in black walnut forestry plantations in order to maintain productivity under climate change. We also showed that black walnut relies mainly on N stored in roots to fuel early growth in the spring, but becomes dependent on root uptake of N from soil in summer. Black walnut prefers the ammonium form of N over nitrate-N in summer, suggesting that fertilization programs for black walnut should ensure availability of this N form during the summer growing period. Our results may provide a basis to establish physiological sub-models for the processes of carbon and N uptake, utilization, and remobilization in black walnut. This may aid the forest industry in managing black walnut plantations for commercial production.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/15/2020<br>      Modified by: Douglass&nbsp;Jacobs</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
