<AbstractNarration>Whether bicycling or walking across roads, children must make decisions about whether gaps are large enough for safe crossing. This involves assessing how long it will take for the oncoming car to arrive in relation to how long it will take for them to cross the street. Past work suggests that gap decisions and crossing movements are less well coordinated in children than in adults. Children and adults choose the same size gaps, but children typically end up with less time to spare between themselves and the oncoming car. Tightly linking gap decisions and crossing movements may be particularly difficult when children are just beginning walk or bicycle across roads on their own. If so, we might expect developmental patterns to repeat themselves at different ages for pedestrian and cyclist road crossing. However, little is known about how pedestrian and cyclist road-crossing skills are related to each other because there have been no direct comparisons of the two skills.  This project examines children's use of visual information to guide selection and timing of motor behaviors.   The investigators will use large-screen, immersive pedestrian and bicycling simulators to safely and systematically compare how 6- to 12-year-old children select gaps and time their movement when walking vs. bicycling across intersections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide new information about children's perceptual-motor development in the context of a real-world problem where the visual information (i.e., traffic) stays the same, but the mode of locomotion differs (i.e., walking vs. bicycling). This research will also contribute to our understanding of the risk factors for collisions involving children and motor vehicles, a significant public health problem. As such, this work will help lay the foundation for future intervention studies designed to reduce the risk of such collisions.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, this project used virtual reality technology to safely and systematically examine the development of pedestrian and cyclist road-crossing skills across childhood and early adolescence. The basic task involved repeatedly crossing a single lane of virtual traffic in an immersive bicycling or pedestrian simulator without colliding with a vehicle (Figure 1). The traffic travelled at a typical residential speed of 25mph and included both crossable and uncrossable gaps. We measured the size of the gaps chosen for crossing and the timing of movement (i.e., how closely youth cut in behind the lead car in the gap and how much time to spare they had when they exited the roadway).&nbsp;</p> <p>Our first set of findings focuses on how children?s skill as pedestrians and bicyclists develops during childhood and early adolescence. A major finding from our study of road-crossing performance in 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, and 14-year-old and adult pedestrians&nbsp;was that children did not show adult-like pedestrian road-crossing skills until age 14. Priorto age 12, children?s gap choices were more risky and less discriminating than those of older children and adults. We also observed steady improvement in children?s timing of entry relative to the lead car in the gap up to age 14. Coupled with their less precise timing of entry, 6-, 8-, and 10-year-olds? gap choices resulted in significantly less time to spare and more collisions than 14-year-olds and adults.

Even though the traffic was exactly the same across the two tasks, younger children were better able to choose gaps and time their movement when they crossed the road as a pedestrian than as a bicyclist. Younger children?s difficulties with timing their movement in particular resulted in 8-, 10-, and 12-year-old bicyclists having significantly less time to spare when they exited the roadway than the 14-year-old bicyclists. Only 8-year-old pedestrians had less time to spare than 14-year-old pedestrians. Together, these findings suggest that transfer of skill from walking to bicycling is not complete.

One question we asked was how does crossing roads with friends impact risk taking in young adolescents and adults? Twelve-year-olds and adults either crossed our virtual roadway with a friend or alone. We found that pairs of adolescent friends exhibited more risky road-crossing behavior than pairs of adult friends. Adult pairs were more discriminating in their gap choices than adult solo crossers, crossing fewer of the smaller gaps and more of the larger gaps. This pattern did not hold for 12-year-old pairs compared to 12-year-old solo crossers. To compensate for their less discriminating gap choices, pairs of 12-year-olds adjusted their movement timing by entering and crossing the road more quickly.
