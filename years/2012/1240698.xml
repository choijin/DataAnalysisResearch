<AbstractNarration>This project will support research and educational activities as part of the Thematic Program on Inverse Problems and Imaging at the Fields Institute in 2012. The organizers aim to create an environment conducive to collaborative research by combining the particiapnts' high-level expertise from Partial Differential Equations, Nonlinear Variational Methods, Differential Geometry, Regularization Theory and Numerical Analysis. Techniques initially developed in image processing or in microlocal analysis will be extended to treat novel hybrid inverse problems. Modern faster and more accurate optimization techniques for recovering data from undersampled measurements will be explored. Nonlocal methods have been recently proven to be the most efficient techniques in image denoising and image regularization. Current and future directions for solving a large range of inverse problems by nonlocal methods and their computational challenges will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By integrating research and education, the organizers will introduce next generation researchers in Medical Imaging to the recent important and deep mathematical advances in the field. Numerous lectures, graduate and short courses will be given by leading researchers in the fields of inverse problems and imaging. These problems have important applications in medical imaging, geophysical prospecting and nondestructive testing.  Graduate and postdoctoral students will greatly benefit from being exposed to these most active areas of research in mathematics today. They will also be exposed to interdisciplinary research mixing theoretical advances with up to date applied issues. Women and underrepresented groups will be given the opportunity to actively participate in the program as organizers, speakers, and regular participants. Teams of graduate students will be offered a summer research experience on concrete problems in medical imaging.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award supported numerous research activities as part of the  Thematic Program on Inverse Problems and Imaging at                      the Fields Institute, in Toronto (January-August                      2012).   The Fields Thematic Program on Inverse Problems and Imaging aims                to focus in depth on selected active areas of recent mathematical                research in Inverse Problems and Image Analysis. The emphasis                is on longer events that encourage collaborations on important new                directions of investigation.

The program included more than 200 participants, each of whom was at the Fields Institute for 1-4 weeks.Many of the participants were students and postdoctoral scholars. The organizers placed high priority on the representation of women and underrepresented groups in the thematic program as speakers, organizers, and funded participants.                                                                                                                                                   Normal 0     false false false  EN-US X-NONE X-NONE              MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                                                                                                                              We aim to introduce next generation researchers in Medical      Imaging to the recent important advanced, deep mathematical advances in      the field. This covers two areas: Inverse Problems (which seek to      develop next generation image acquisition modalities) and Image Processing      (which analyze existing images being generated in hospitals across the      world). The program seeks to establish connections between these distinct communities      and fosters a collaborative research atmosphere among the participants.   Reviews of the proposal submitted to the Fields Institute have attested that "the program comes at the right moment": these are some of the most active areas of research in mathematics today, and "indeed the interaction between the two is in an explosive phase". "The program offers a convincing and balanced mix of theoretical advances with up to date applied issues". "The topics have been chosen very well and are all of great interest, all the graduate courses and the short courses are of very high quality and are held by extremely well qualified lecturers. All the initiatives are carefully presented and planned."   While there are a number of regular conferences devoted to Inverse Problems and, separately, to Image Analysis, we believe that the emphasis on fostering interactions between these areas as well as between the pure and applied research communities in Medical Imaging are timely and unique to the program.   The research in the areas of inverse problems and image processing will benefit. The medical imaging area will also benefit. Finally, results introduced during the program will have a great impact in the healthcare industry. Students and postdocs have been trained in an interdisciplinary area from which science, technology and society will benefit.
