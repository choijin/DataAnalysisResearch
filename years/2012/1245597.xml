<AbstractNarration>PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS: &lt;br/&gt;North Carolina State University (Primary)&lt;br/&gt;Louisiana State University, Kentucky University, UNC-Ashville, UNC-Charlotte and NC A&amp;T University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION &lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians and engineering educators are collaborating to address the mathematics needs that can adequately support engineering students. The project is developing a series of individualized, just-in-time assessment and review (JITAR) mathematics modules that can help students in their engineering courses. The modules are part of an on-line system that can assess the mathematical competency level of a student and provide individualized developmental learning opportunities. The just-in-time learning opportunities will help students to successfully apply the necessary mathematics in their new engineering courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is creating an on-line software system that: 1) challenges students to address their conceptual understanding by emphasizing the engineering motivation for the mathematics reviewed; 2) supports diverse learning styles by offering formative feedback and guidance through the review process; and 3) provides instructors with content that can be customized for their mathematics needs, the goals of their course and their teaching approach. Classroom delivery of the modules is provided in a just-in-time fashion, whenever the relevant mathematics content is needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER SIGNIFICANCE &lt;br/&gt;This effort addresses an urgent national need to improve the preparation of engineering majors, in order to increase motivation and degree success. Engineering retention is of particular concern among members of underrepresented groups, as well as among transfer students and non-traditional students returning to school from workplace. The project is helping students in underrepresented groups improve their mathematics skills, thus creating multiple pathways for them to excel in STEM courses. The online system is impacting engineering students at schools throughout the country and can be customized to also support other discipline areas (e.g., statistics, physics, chemistry). The individualized approach to assessment and review of the mathematics concepts is increasing the confidence and ability of students, providing valuable feedback to their instructors, and helping to improve the retention of underrepresented groups in engineering programs.</AbstractNarration>

Any instructor who assesses the pre-requiste knowledge of students is familiar with this dilemma. If the instructor reviews the pre-requisite material, she/he loses valuable class time and bores the well prepared students. The other option is to start the new material right away and leave a significant number of students behind. JITAR prepares everybody according to their needs by detecting their levels from their answers. If the student can't solve the problem after two trials, JITAR opens a set of easier problems with accompanying videos or tutorials.
