<AbstractNarration>This research will provide new information about how hormones specifically control hunger. Decisions about how much to eat are affected by the amount of food previously eaten and the need to engage in other activities. Thus, motivation  to eat will be carefully measured in either food-limited or food-unlimited laboratory rodents that will be provided with behavioral options, including the ability to interact with other members of their species. Experiments are designed to determine whether gonadotropin-inhibiting hormone (GnIH) increases the appetite for food, inhibits the reproductive system, or both, and to specify how GnIH orchestrates behavioral priorities. The activation of individual brain cells that secrete GnIH will be measured using immunohistochemistry and a map will be created of the GnIH-cell activation that occurs at the time hunger levels increase and decrease. Drugs that block GnIH binding to its receptors will be used to determine whether GnIH is necessary for food-restriction-induced changes in hunger and the reproductive system. Other experiments will examine whether hormones secreted by the ovary control neural activity in GnIH cells. This project will offer important insights into the high incidence of obesity and eating disorders in women and the  explore links to the side effects of contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy. This research will have broad impact on the public's understanding of the appetite for fo, and its interaction with reproduction, fertility, exercise, health, lifestyle, drugs, and prescription hormones. The funding will be used to establish a collaboration with the Kriegsfled laboratory, to team-train graduate and undergraduate students, and to engage in K-12 outreach activities. The award will provide support for the PI's participation, as an NSF ADVANCE chair, in STEM women's seminars and a "writing boot camp". In addition to using traditional publication venues, both PI's will disseminate their work via their webpages and behavioral endocrinology blogs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The research that we conducted was designed to determine how the brain controls hunger and feeding in the face of competing energetic demands.  Decisions about when and how much to eat are influenced by time since the last meal, the nature of food eaten, and the need to engage in other activities required for survival and reproduction.  How hormones and metabolic signals interact in the brain to appropriately balance hunger and feeding with other needs represented the thrust of our research.  Specifically, we explored the role of two, complementary chemical communicators in the brain, RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3) and kisspeptin, that were discovered at the turn of this millennium.  RFRP-3 is an important inhibitory regulator of the reproductive system whereas kisspeptin stimulates the reproductive axis.  We speculated that these neurochemical systems respond to energetic and hormonal cues and work in opposition to balance hunger and feeding with reproduction.  Our findings revealed a pronounced role for the RFRP-3 system in balancing feeding and reproduction in response to energetic and hormonal status.  However, despite having a pronounced role in reproduction, we found that the kisspeptin system does not appear to be involved in balancing these behavioral priorities.  These discoveries have important implications for informing the mechanisms regulating obesity, eating disorders and the metabolic side effects of contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy. Additionally, the funding for this research provided important support for training of graduate and undergraduate student researchers and outreach to the community through lectures, demonstrations, activities, and training seminars.
