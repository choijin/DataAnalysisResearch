<AbstractNarration>This summer, during July 23-27, 2012, there will be a workshop&lt;br/&gt;entitled ``Spectral invariants on non-compact and singular spaces"&lt;br/&gt;held at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques (CRM) in Montreal,&lt;br/&gt;Canada. Important examples of spectral invariants are given by the&lt;br/&gt;index of an elliptic operator, the determinant of the Laplacian on a&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian manifold, the eta invariant (or spectral asymmetry) of a&lt;br/&gt;self-adjoint elliptic operator, and the analytic torsion. On&lt;br/&gt;non-compact or singular manifolds, the very definition of spectral&lt;br/&gt;invariants is much more delicate.  The workshop will highlight recent&lt;br/&gt;developments and new research directions in spectral geometry in&lt;br/&gt;singular contexts (e.g., spectral invariants in the presence of cusps&lt;br/&gt;and edges, scattering theory for asymptotically regular non-compact&lt;br/&gt;geometries, applications to moduli spaces and geometric structures,&lt;br/&gt;etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to defray the expenses of U.S.&lt;br/&gt;participants at this conference. The expected participants represent a&lt;br/&gt;balanced mixture of senior and junior researchers and include some of&lt;br/&gt;the most renowned experts on spectral invariants. This is a very&lt;br/&gt;active field with many recent developments, and this workshop will&lt;br/&gt;provide an important forum to advertise the state-of-the-art and an&lt;br/&gt;excellent opportunity for collaboration.
