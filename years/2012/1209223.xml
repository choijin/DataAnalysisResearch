<AbstractNarration>The University of Hawaii at Hilo is a geographically- isolated, minority-serving institution with a principal focus on undergraduates.  The primary objectives of this ADVANCE project are to conduct data collection, examine trends in the data, recommend policy changes and disseminate relevant information all related to the status of STEM women faculty on their campus.  To accomplish these objectives, several relevant strategies are proposed that include surveys, focus groups, institutional data analysis, establishing a web page, and forming a peer group of existing ADVANCE institutions.  It is noted that the PIs specifically intend to explore the ways in which the needs of STEM women faculty on their campus and the elements of their institutional climate are different from institutions well-represented in the ADVANCE portfolio (e.g., large, research intensive, predominately white).   They provide measureable goals to increase the representation of women to 40% and increase representation of women in leadership to 25%.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The confidential on-line campus climate survey was distributed in Spring 2013 and was kept open throughout the summer, with re-issues of the link for it in late July and again in August, to allow faculty who had been traveling or otherwise out of contact a chance to complete it. In addition to the survey?s dissemination via faculty/staff list-serve, the link for the survey was also published on Chancellor Straney?s page within the UH Hilo web site.  Sections of the survey were created as follows:  Demographic information/professional history Overall Impressions of UH Hilo Work-life Balance Recruiting Your Unit at UH Hilo Productivity Job Satisfaction EDGE at UH Hilo   Analysis of the survey revealed:  Women, compared to men, are more likely to have worked at UH Hilo for a shorter amount of time (average 105 months vs 153 months) and more likely to be unwed (32% no spouse vs 15% for men).  Factor analyses produced eight factors:   Happiness at Hilo - overall contentment with one?s life at UH Hilo and in Hilo; Gender perception - perceptions regarding UH Hilo?s hiring of female faculty; Unit satisfaction - level of satisfaction with the environment of his/her work unit; Funding - belief about the importance of, and personal performance in, acquiring funding at UH Hilo; Research - belief about personal performance in conducting research at UH Hilo; Teaching - belief about personal performance in teaching at UH Hilo; Career - level of satisfaction with regards to one?s career; Salary - level of satisfaction with regards to one?s salary.    Cluster analyses using these factors produced two cluster groups:  Cluster A &ndash; Funding, research, teaching  A1 &ndash; higher funding, higher research, lower teaching A2 &ndash; mid funding, mid research, higher teaching   Cluster B &ndash; Career and salary  B1 &ndash; lower career, higher salary B2 &ndash; higher career, mid salary B3 &ndash; mid career, lower salary       Happiness at Hilo and unit satisfaction correlate with four other factors each, including each other. These are probably the strongest indicators for use in future surveys. Research is the only factor that does not correlate with any others. While funding, research, and teaching all capture respondents? opinions about their performance in each factor, only funding has high loading for respondents? beliefs about how important the factor is in how faculty are evaluated.  Gender perception is statistically significantly different with respect to respondent gender. Women have a more negative perception of UH Hilo?s gender recruitment and environment than men.  Gender perception, funding, and teaching are statistically significantly different with respect to respondent race. Non-Caucasian faculty are less pleased with the recruitment of female faculty, believe they are better at acquiring external funding (and that doing so is important in how they are evaluated), but believe they perform worse at teaching. Research and career are statistically significantly different with respect to respondent position. Professors believe themselves to be better at conducting research and are more satisfied with their career trajectory at UH Hilo.  Cluster B2 (higher career, mid salary) was statistically significantly happier than B1 (lower career, higher salary), which was statistically significantly happier than B3 (mid-career, lower salary).  Caucasians were statistically significantly more likely to be in Cluster A2 (mid funding, mid research, higher teaching) than non-Caucasians. In other words, Caucasians are more likely to believe that they are better at teaching and worse at conducting research and acquiring external funding (and that doing so is less important) than their non-Caucasian counterparts.   Non-professors were statistically significantly more likely to be in Cluster B1 (lower career, higher salary) than professors. Professors were more likely to be in Cluster B2 (higher career, mid salary) than non-professors. Both groups were represented equally in Cluster B3 (mid-career, lower salary).     Broader Impacts:  Findings of the climate survey led to establishing focus groups of faculty from 4 groups: female non-tenured, female tenured, male non-tenured, and male tenured. Participants identified issues that might affect recruitment and retention of female faculty at UHH as follows:  Institutional:   Culture: Participants felt the culture of UHH can be aggressive toward and dismissive of female faculty. Policy: Lack of a family care policy and lack of clarity re: faculty promotion procedures were noted.   External environment:   Hilo: Its isolation, lack of amenities, and sociocultural elements were deemed relevant. National landscape: Focus groups suggested UHH?s difficulty in recruiting and retaining female faculty may be due to national-level circumstances affecting all academic institutions.   This project is the basis of ongoing Institutional Transformation work. We will affect the numbers of women in STEM faculty positions at UH Hilo, and their retention and promotion. This will encourage the students they interact with and a long-term effect will be to increase the numbers of females entering the academy in STEM disciplines and taking a leadership role.
