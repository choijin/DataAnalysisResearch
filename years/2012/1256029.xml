<AbstractNarration>Cellulose is an essential component of every plant cell.  It is also the most abundant biopolymer on Earth and of great societal importance (food, clothing, shelter and fuel). Therefore, identifying compounds that modulate cellulose biosynthesis is critical to enhance biomaterials for human use. The current project reasons that plant associated microorganisms secrete natural products that are capable of modifying plant cellulose biosynthesis, and that this could be systematically exploited to identify new bioactive compounds. Complexity of natural small molecules generally limits the ability to isolate bioactive compound(s).  To overcome this hurdle, this project will couple chemical fingerprinting with genetics and live cell imaging to identify bioactive constituents and the mechanism(s) by which they act. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have broad community impact through training via the Science Readiness Program, a program tailored to provide a bridge for students between high school and University and to enhance the pedagogy of professor, high school teacher and student. Resources developed in this project will be deposited or made available for others via an online database.</AbstractNarration>

Due to be an essential and plant specific process, cellulose biosynthesis ideal target for inhibition and development of new plant drugs (herbicides).  Based on the documented utility of small-molecule inhibitors to dissect  complex cellular processes we identified a cellulose biosynthesis  inhibitor (CBI), named acetobixan, by bio-prospecting among compounds  secreted by endophytic microorganisms. Acetobixan was identified by examining the additive interactive between microbial secretions and genetic alternation of cellulose biosynthesis and represents a new herbicidal structure. The active compound was identified by searching through the microbial secretion for compounds that were particularly abundant and unique compared with other endophytes.  Analogs of this lead compound were screened for CBI activity, and the  most potent analog was named acetobixan. In living Arabidopsis cells  visualized by confocal microscopy, acetobixan treatment caused CESA  particles localized at the plasma membrane (PM) to rapidly re-localize  to cytoplasmic vesicles. Previous CBI resistant mutants such as <em>ixr1-2, ixr2-1</em> or <em>aegeus</em> were not cross resistant to acetobixan indicating that acetobixan targets a different aspect of cellulose biosynthesis. By examining hormonal levels in living plants, we hypothesized that certain hormonal pathways associated with expansion are influenced by such endophytes.
