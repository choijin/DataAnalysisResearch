<AbstractNarration>This action funds Joshua Townsend of Northwestern University to conduct a research project, entitled "Water storage capacity of planetary interiors," during the summer of 2012 at The University of Ehime Geodynamics Research Centre in Matsuyama, Japan.  The host scientist is Dr. Jun Tsuchiya.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to further understanding of what makes a planet habitable for earth-like life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
