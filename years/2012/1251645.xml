<AbstractNarration>Ending long-standing conflicts is an urgent global challenge. Although intractable conflicts develop an air of inevitability over time, these conflicts are initiated and maintained by people; therefore, changing people's hearts and minds is a critical step for resolving such conflicts. The present research evaluates a new theory-based intervention designed to promote more productive emotions and attitudes in the context of an ongoing intractable conflict. The proposed project extends preliminary work by this research team, which showed that teaching in-group members that groups do not have a fixed nature (an incremental belief about groups) increased favorable attitudes toward the opposing group and, in turn, fostered greater willingness to engage in major compromises that could lead to peace. In the current project, the researchers will for the first time examine the longer term effects of this belief-based intervention in a societal context in which in-group participants are routinely exposed to negative information about the out-group. The researchers will compare this belief-based intervention to both a Perspective Taking Intervention (a common conflict resolution strategy) and a Coping Control Intervention. Before participants are randomly assigned to one of the three interventions (and then again immediately after and six months later), attitudes and emotions toward the out-group will be assessed, along with favorability toward conciliatory actions. The study design will allow an examination of the durability of the effects of each of these three intervention conditions, as well as their influence across ideological sub-groups as they confront real world conflict-related events. Importantly, the focal intervention introduces a novel way of promoting conflict resolution, in that there is no attempt to create interactions, familiarity, empathy or perspective-taking between members of conflicting groups. Instead, the focus is on promoting a change in mindset. This research will have a broader impact on society by testing a novel approach to conflict resolution that does not involve the logistical problems associated with other interventions, such as bringing parties in conflict together or running the risk of engendering resistance by explicitly trying to teach hostile groups in intractable conflicts to empathize with each other. If successful, this new belief-based approach can be disseminated easily and broadly, and can work for people with a variety of ideological stances and cultural characteristics. This approach has relevance to a large number of intra-national and international conflicts, and to efforts aimed at preventing future conflicts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant examined a new theory-based intervention designed to promote more positive and less negative emotions and attitudes, as well as greater support for conciliation, in the context of intractable conflicts. This intervention is grounded in the view that participants who are taught that groups have a malleable nature (an "incremental" belief that groups can change over time) will exhibit more positive and less negative emotions toward the outgroup as well as greater conciliatory attitudes and actions than participants who do not receive this incremental belief intervention.     To test this idea, 510 Jewish Israeli citizens were recruited from communities throughout Israel and randomly assigned to one of three conditions in which they learned a) that people and groups do not have a fixed, inherent nature but can change (Incremental Intervention), b) how to take the perspective and understand the viewpoints and motivations of the Palestinians (Perspective Taking control Intervention), or c) a series of coping skills for dealing effectively with social conflict (Coping Control Intervention).
