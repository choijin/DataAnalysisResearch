<AbstractNarration>1231326 &lt;br/&gt;Jacobs  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Coordination Network under NSF's Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) initiative will create a multi-institution collaboratory to support the integration of climate science and engineering research for sustainable transportation infrastructure (Infrastructure and Climate Network ? ICNet). The nation?s physical infrastructure is at increasing and critical risk from climate-driven stressors due to both ambient and periodic extremes in precipitation, temperature, and wind. Climate nonstationarity poses challenges that have been broadly recognized by the road and bridge engineering community. However, relatively few infrastructure researchers incorporate climate change into their work due to significant knowledge and data barriers. A network of collaborators in the transportation infrastructure research and practitioner community is essential to develop and maintain the capacity needed to keep pace with rapid advancements in climate modeling, error propagation and adaptation arenas. A distinctive part of the strategy is to build a knowledge resource using processes designed by our social science ICNet members to support knowledge-sharing and prioritization among ICNet researchers and to link that knowledge to the community of user institutions. This will be accomplished by (1) fostering collaboration among the infrastructure research and practitioner community who have the expertise to conduct this research, (2) identifying key questions and hypotheses, common data needs and standards required to generate and expand new research, (3) building and populating a knowledge commons that will serve as a web-based resource for the community, (4) strengthening the linkages between researchers and practitioner communities to successfully address adaptation challenges for a sustainable infrastructure in the future, and (5) developing and exploring the efficacy of processes of knowledge access and network development to improve technology transfer.   The ICNet RCN will develop the institutional networks needed to accelerate research methods in climate change transportation infrastructure impacts and adaptation. It will also advance the science of sustainable engineering under emergent environmental conditions.  The ICNet will topically address a concrete societal need to discover new ways to deal with uncertainties of planning for human systems in the environment of nonstationary natural and earth systems. A goal of the project is to develop science to build bridges and roads that will last longer in the future and require less money and energy to maintain. The knowledge-linking strategies that will be explored are designed to build conduits with societal institutions in New England that are responsible for long-range infrastructure adaptation standards and policies and demonstrate an approach transferable to other regions and adaptation problems. This will help maximize the benefits of the knowledge network and will also play a role in its own sustainability. The RCN will also provide opportunities for, and already reflects in its steering committee and participants, strong leadership of women in engineering, cultural diversity, and over 80% of the graduate degree granting Civil Engineering Departments in the region and will advance education in sustainable engineering at institutions with significant underrepresented groups in the region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Infrastructure and Climate Network (ICNet) is a network of more than 150 academics, students, and practitioners who are dedicated to accelerating climate science and engineering research in the Northeastern United States.  The ICNet focuses on climate change and sea level rise impacts and adaption for sustainable bridges, roads, and transportation networks.  What exactly does this mean?  In 2012, Drs. Jennifer Jacobs (PI), Jo Sias Daniel (co-PI) and others were awarded an NSF grant to develop a multi-institutional collaboratory.   At the time, very few academics or private/agency engineers included climate science in their work due to both knowledge and data barriers.  Additionally, climate scientists did not direct their work towards the needs of transportation engineers.  Both what was needed (by the engineers) and what could be supplied (by the climate scientists) was unknown to each other.  ICNet development started with outreach to the northeastern Departments of Transportation (DOTs), academics in engineering and climate science, and practitioners.  The first ICNet workshop focused on co-education for the various fields represented.  Every field has its own language and jargon. A simple word like "conservative" had completely different meanings across these fields.  Stationarity, the assumption that climate stays within the same range over time, was the standard for both academic and practicing engineers.  This workshop created a common knowledge and language basis across the disciplines. Topics addressed ranged from the mundane to arcane: How is climate science output generated?  How are roads built?  How does scour effect bridges?  Why are there multiple climate models with different scenarios? Who determines the building codes for infrastructure components? Why aren?t engineers already accounting for the changing climate?  DOT personnel were clear that they already had to deal with changes in climate.  Climate scientists were strongly interested in developing climate model output that could be used by engineers. Academics in engineering, economics, and social science wanted to address this complicated issue.  The network grew to include academic faculty and their students, federal and state agencies, and practitioners. Their fields are pavements, bridges, wind, ports, public policy, communication, climate change, and hydrology. Annual workshops evolved to include multiple presentations focused on select issues, with extensive time devoted to open discussion.   From these discussions, subgroups identified the most critically needed knowledge including topics such as extreme rainfall, uncertainty, and risk management. These subgroups communicated and met throughout the year.  Furthermore, based on the workshop discussion, a set of products was developed.

One of the most relevant, and most useful products of ICNet is almost unquantifiable &ndash; the connections that were made among the world class academics, the state and federal agency personnel, and the practitioners who all brought an intense interest, combined with a strong desire to make transportation infrastructure resilient to climate change.  Some of the issues addressed and being addressed include seasonal weight restrictions due to changing winters, flooding and erosion from extreme rainfall events, and coastal roadway challenges due to rising seas including nuisance flooding and groundwater rise. While none of these issues has a complete "fix", notable progress has been made in understanding and mitigating the problems. This directly benefits communities across the Northeastern U.S.  ICNet?s success is most readily evident from the national leadership roles that the network and its members have achieved.  Numerous other states and countries have sought advice and guidance to establish their own networks addressing climate change and transportation engineering. Members of the network have become the point person in their agency, field, or office for transportation and climate science issues. ICNet members have led efforts to synthesize current transportation challenges for the National Climate Assessment and to provide a perspective on how the changing climate will impact the future of the Interstate Highway System.  ICNet has broadly increased literacy about these challenges through venues ranging from community "Pint of Science" festivals to the prestigious White House Office of Science and Technology Policy forum.
