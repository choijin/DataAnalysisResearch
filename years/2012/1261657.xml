<AbstractNarration>This project is an important part of the Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) experiment scheduled for January and February 2014, with NSF/NCAR GV flights based out of the island of Guam. This effort includes flight planning and photochemical modeling to provide near real time interpretation of data during the campaign, and post-mission modeling and data interpretation afterward. CONTRAST is designed to measure the chemistry and transport of reactive chemical species into the tropical Tropopause Transition Layer (TTL) over the Western Pacific warm pool area. The sources, chemistry, and transport of trace gases and their degradation products into the lower stratosphere in this region during the boreal winter season can substantially impact the chemistry of the lower stratosphere. The CONTRAST mission is organized in collaboration with two partner projects: ATTREX (the Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment--a NASA project utilizing the high altitude Global Hawk (GH), and CAST (Coordinated Airborne Studies of the Tropics)--a project sponsored by the British National Environment Research Council using a BAe-146 aircraft. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives of CONTRAST are to: (1) Characterize the chemical composition at the level of convective outflow over the Western Pacific during the deep convective season; (2) Evaluate the budget of organic and inorganic bromine and iodine in the TTL; and (3) Investigate transport pathways from the oceanic surface to the tropopause. The results of this effort will increase understanding of halogen budgets and impacts on stratospheric ozone depletion. It will also improve the development of process-oriented chemistry/climate models and their validation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided definitive scientific quantification of the impact of biological processes on the abundance of bromine reaching Earth?s stratosphere.Scientists have long desired to know how much natural, biogenic bromine reaches the stratosphere because this source competes with a human source regulated by the Montreal Protocol.  Interestingly and perhaps ironically, this human source has been much better quantified over the years than the natural source, in part because evaluation of the human source can be based upon measurements obtained in populated regions of the lower atmosphere.  Conversely, quantification of the natural source required deploying a suite of state-of-the-art instruments in remote areas of the Tropical Western Pacific (TWP).  Flights within the TWP were needed because the natural brominated compounds are short-lived (i.e., measurements obtained over population mid-latitudes bear little or no relation to the stratosphere) and because more air enters the stratosphere above the TWP than any other location on Earth.  The scientific paper that conveys these findings is at: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2017JD027978  This paper is a tour-de-force that quantifies the stratospheric injection of bromine (Bry) by very short lived substances (VSLS). The paper reports that  VSLS Bry is 5 &plusmn; 2.1 ppt, which is nearly one third of the bromine entering the stratosphere from other, so-called longer lived sources.  The paper includes a detailed comparison to output from 14 global models that participated in the Chemistry&#8208;Climate Model Initiative, showing that even though the representation of stratospheric bromine in these models generally lies within the range of the empirical estimate, models that include explicit representations of VSLS compare better with observation than models that utilize longer&#8208;lived chemicals as a surrogate for VSLS.   A figure from the this paper will appear in the upcoming WMO Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion report.  The analysis of data collected during CONTRAST will lead to more accurate forecasts of the recovery of Earth?s ozone layer, as the atmosphere is slowly-cleansed of human-derived halogens.  --  Data collected during CONTRAST and our sister CAST mission also showed large patches of air characterized by high levels of ozone, at times exceeding the U.S. EPA standard of 70 parts per billion, accompanied by very low levels of gaseous water vapor.  The CONTRAST and CAST measurements were used to provide a convincing connection of these so-called high ozone, low water vapor structures to biomass burning (i.e., human set fires) in Africa and Southeast (SE) Asia.   By some measures, ozone is the third most important anthropogenic (human origin) greenhouse gas.  The climatic effects of ozone originate mainly from elevated abundances in the tropical, upper troposphere (UT) (i.e., the region sampled during CONTRAST).  Our analysis showed that reduction in the rate of deforestation in Africa and SE Asia, which would have enormous local benefits (i.e, air quality, ecological diversity; carbon sequestration) would also lead to reduction in global warming due to tropospheric ozone.The scientific paper that conveys these findings is at: https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10267  This publication received widespread attention, including these two articles in popular scientific news websites: https://phys.org/news/2016-01-africa-asia-high-ozone-tropical.html https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/01/160113100550.htm  We had not set out to connect ozone in the tropical UT to human activity.  Rather, we obtained a surprising observation and "connected the proverbial dots", all of which pointed to human set fires being the primary source of elevated abundances of ozone observed in the TWP during winter 2014.   Another important result that emanated from this project was the finding that biogenic gases released by oceanic biology are removed by reactions involving tropospheric hydroxyl (OH) at a rate faster than commonly appreciated, because global models likely under-estimate OH in the TWP due to poor representation of the release of nitrogen oxides by biomass burning, in addition to neglect of an oceanic source of acetaldehyde that decomposes into hydrogen radicals.  These results are summarized in two additional peer-review publications: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JD025067 https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JD026121  Finally: data collected during this project constituted a key component in the doctoral dissertations of three recent PhDs rt the University of Maryland: Dr. Daniel C.

This grant enabled a critically important educational experience for three persons, all of whom have secured postdoctoral positions in the atmospheric sciences since obtaining their PhD.  Also, Anderson and Nicely flew on the NCAR GV HIAPER aircraft on the deployment in Guam, a remarkably excellent educational experience for any graduate student.  One behalf of these three students, we express sincere appreciation to NSF for the support of NSF of their doctoral research.
