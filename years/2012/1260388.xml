<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding for the development and validation of a new sophisticated numerical model that would follow Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) from their birth in the solar corona, through interactions with the ambient solar wind, and out to 1 AU.  The finished model will combine two established, well-recognized codes, "MAS" (MHD Around a Sphere) to model the solar corona out to about 30 solar radii and "LFM Helio," an adaptation of the LFM code originally developed for magnetospheric simulations, that would follow the propagation out to 1 AU.    Specific tasks to be completed include: 1) Steady-state MAS/LFM-helio coupling to obtain the ambient solar wind configuration throughout the corona and inner heliosphere prior to CME initiation; 2) Time-dependent coupling allowing seamless propagation of the CME structure through the interface between the coronal and inner heliosphere domains located at &amp;#8764; 30 RE; 3) Vetting of the resultant coupled model by performing corona-inner heliosphere simulations, investigations of CME interaction with the ambient solar wind and each other, and comparisons with heliospheric imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a major CME was to hit the earth it could have major consequences on everything from GPS satellites to the terrestrial power grid. Hence, understanding how CMEs propagate from the Sun to the Earth is perhaps the most important aspect of space weather forecasting.  A female PhD student would be trained under this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Space Weather has been defined as the conditions on the Sun and in the solar wind, magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere that can influence the performance and reliability of space-borne and ground-based technological systems and can endanger human life and health. Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are spectacular eruptions on the Sun that expel plasma and magnetic fields into space.  CMEs are the primary drivers of geomagnetic activity and are responsible for some of the most severe space weather conditions.  Understanding the eruption, evolution, and propagation of CMES is a fundamental problem in solar and heliospheric physics.  Under this project we have combined two state-of-the-art models (MAS and LFM) of the corona-inner heliosphere system, to provide important improvements in capabilities for modeling CMEs.  We have also further developed capabilities to model CME events and the time-dependent ambient solar wind.  Development and validation of numerical models is a time-consuming process that must be performed carefully in stages.  Over the course of the project, we were able to develop a coupled version of the MAS coronal and LFM heliospheric models, guided by the coupling of MAS coronal and MAS heliospheric models.  We verified that the MAS-LFM coupled model obtained solar wind and CME solutions equivalent to earlier MAS-MAS results.  The higher order accuracy of the LFM model will allow more detailed simulations of heliospheric structure in the future.  We were also able to further develop models of CME events.  The attached figure shows the radial velocity and polarization brightness (what would be measured by a space-based coronagraph such as SOHO LASCO) for a MAS coronal simulation of the July 14, 2000 ("Bastille Day") CME.  The MAS-LFM coupled model is now ready to attempt simulations of the propagation of such events into the heliosphere.  Further development of such a model can eventually lead to improvements in operational capabilities for forecasting of CMEs and their possible impacts.
