<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to measure the temperature at the tool/workpiece interface during precision machining for depths of cut less than 10 micrometers to an accuracy of 5 degrees Celsius.  To make this measurement, a number of important sensors will be added to a precision lathe that already has 3-dimensional force sensors.  Visual and infrared microscope systems will be added to view the material flow in the chip at small depths of cut.  These will provide an overall view of the temperature distribution in relation to the chip/tool interface.  In addition, a unique elliptically shaped, light-guiding diamond tool will be fabricated to focus the infrared radiation from the tool tip into a spectrometer and improve the sensitivity of the peak tool temperature measurement.  A unique wear measurement technique will be used to compare the tool wear with changes in material, depth of cut, temperature and cutting distance.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Keeping the tool edge sharp and avoiding degradation with time are key factors in machining materials like steel where chemical wear due to temperature dominates.  Models of the machining process are available to calculate tool temperature, but measurements are needed to corroborate these results.  If successful, the benefits and impact of this research will be improved knowledge of precision manufacturing processes and education of scientists and engineers.  The proposed temperature measurement is needed to 1) corroborate models of the machining process and 2) predict tool wear when machining important structural materials like steel.  Optical and precision mechanical systems play a pervasive role in modern life in the US and require nanometer-scale fabrication processes to yield the required performance.  There is a critical need to improve these manufacturing processes, to visualize new processes and to educate the next generation of students needed to create them.  The technical results will be published in engineering journals and integrated into university courses.  The graduate and undergraduate students involved will develop expertise in key areas like machine design, control, materials response, dynamic systems and precision manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

The temperature was to be related to the volume of wear on the tool for a variety of operating conditions and workpiece materials. A model of the tool wear was the goal. Unfortunately the issue of built-up-edge came to the forefront and required a change in scope of the project to look at both tool wear and BUE.  Intellectual Merit  Surface Finish The goal of machining with a diamond tool is to utilize its high-quality geometry and edge sharpness to create a surface with low roughness and minimum form error.  As applied to non-ferrous metals and plastics, DT can produce mirror finishes and form error less than 100 nm.  However, extrapolating this performance to steel work-pieces has proven difficult.  Built Up Edge (BUE) BUE occurs when the workpiece material sticks to the rake and flank rake of the tool. This occurs in ferrous materials that work harden materials, such as steel, but it also happens when machining aluminum alloys that also work harden. This process is considered to occur dynamically and potentially at a cyclical rate. BUE affects surface finish by effectively changing the geometry of the cutting edge and thus, the cutting process. Experiments were done to examine the effect of BUE on the workpiece as well as to measure the shape of the BUE using an SEM.   Tool Wear While machining ferrous material, diamond tool wear occurs at a much higher rate than when machining non-ferrous materials. This affects the cutting process by changing the cutting edge of the tool. Once the tool is measured with the BUE in place, the build-up is chemically removed and any changes to the diamond edge are measured.
