<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER has, since its inception in 1998, been working towards a predictive understanding of the long-term response of coupled land-estuary-ocean ecosystems to changes in three drivers: climate, sea level, and human activities. The Plum Island Estuary-LTER includes the coupled Parker, Rowley, and Ipswich River watersheds, estuarine areas including a shallow open sound, and extensive tidal marshes. PIE is connected to the Gulf of Maine in the Acadian biogeographic province, which is a cold water, macrotidal environment that is geographically and biologically distinct from coastal ecosystems to the south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the next four years the LTER will build upon the progress they have made in understanding the importance of spatial patterns and connections across the land-margin ecosystem. The overarching goal is to understand how external drivers, ecosystem dynamics, and human activities interact to shape ecological processes in a mosaic of coastal landscapes and estuarine seascapes. Understanding how landscapes and seascapes evolve and change, and how those changes control ecosystem processes, is both a fundamental science question and a critical management question. During the remainder of PIE III LTER researchers will continue to address the role of temporal change and variability in climate, sea-level rise and human activities on ecological processes in our long-term monitoring but they will also initiate new activities that examine spatial arrangements and connectivity. LTER research questions are focused around two themes: 1) What controls the spatial arrangements and connectivity between ecological habitat patches in the coastal zone? 2) How do the spatial arrangement and the connectivity between ecological habitat patches in coastal watersheds and the estuarine seascape influence ecological processes? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address their goal researchers will: 1) Quantify recent changes in spatial arrangements and connectivity in the watershed and estuary and investigate their drivers. 2) Supplement long-term monitoring with additional measurements in the watershed and estuary to understand how ecosystem processes are influenced by different spatial arrangements and connectivity. In the watershed these include areas where the river network has been modified by suburbanization and beaver dams. In the estuary LTER investigators will examine feedbacks between form and function in contrasting areas that appear to be responding very differently to sea-level rise; in one case maintaining the marsh platform and in another losing marsh area, forming ponds and transitioning to a lower elevation. 3) Continue existing and add new large scale manipulative experiments to increase mechanistic understanding of ecological processes in various critical land and seascape patches and their responses to drivers. 4) Develop and apply models to understand how biogeochemical and trophic processes emerge at broader scales in a spatially complex coastal environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-term data collection, however, will remain a central activity as many of the hypotheses, as to the importance of geomorphic change to ecosystems processes, have come from our observations that spatial arrangements and their connections at PIE are rapidly changing, on the time scale of decades. Further, the LTER continues to expand efforts to understand how management decisions are influenced by both geomorphic and ecosystem changes. These interactions and feedbacks are important drivers of change at PIE and as a consequence LTER researchers have increasingly integrated human activities within the PIE conceptual framework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The LTER K-12 schoolyard program, "Salt Marsh Science", serves over 1,000 students in grades 5-12 in ten schools and the LTER hopes to continue to expand this into more schools. LTER education coordinator, Ms. Duff, has co-founded an effort to eradicate perennial pepperweed that involves over 1000 students and adults. This effort has attracted regional attention and partners. The LTER serves college undergraduates through internships, research projects and field trip. REU opportunities for undergrads exist through the PIE-LTER, the NSF funded Clark "HERO" program, the MBL-Brown partnership, and the U. of New Hampshire. The LTER will continue the collaboration with the MBL-Brown IGERT Program, where graduate students are exploring the intersection between modern genomics and ecosystems science. Outreach is an important part of the PIE LTER mission and includes inter-LTER efforts and participation in the MBL's science journalism program. The LTER has close connections with nearly all of the management agencies and NGOs in the region and LTER researchers serve on many advisory boards. All data collected by the PIE LTER are centralized and made available though a web site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientific Merit: The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER is an integrated research, education and outreach program whose goal is to develop a predictive understanding of the response of a linked watershed-marsh-estuarine system in northeastern Massachusetts to rapid environmental change.  Some key findings are:  1)      Biological processes occurring in streams and rivers in the watershed remove much of the nitrogen from land sources (lawns, septic, sewage, runoff) and thus prevent nitrogen (N) from reaching the downstream estuary.  At PIE, we have found that more nitrogen is prevented from reaching the estuary than is the case for most watersheds in the northeastern United States.  This may be because most of our nitrogen sources are in upstream portions of the watershed furthest from the estuary, so streams have more opportunity to do their work.  In addition, abundant riverine wetlands have the ability to reduce N loading, a role that may be increasing due to expanded beaver ponding since 2000.    2)      Nitrogen that does reach the estuary may be further removed in creek and marsh sediments through a biological processes called denitrification that converts nitrate to nitrogen gas.  However, our research has  shown that  a competing nitrate reduction process, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), that conserves N within the ecosystem is a major nitrogen pathway that cannot be ignored.  PIE is not unusual; in a cross-site comparison we found that DNRA accounted for more than 30% of the nitrate reduction at many sites. This has important implications for estuarine production.   3)      A better understanding of the role that marshes play in the carbon balance of coastal ecosystems is essential for predicting carbon sequestration in marsh peat and for the ability of marshes to maintain elevation relative to SLR.  We measured large variability in net carbon uptake between 2013 and 2016.   Years with lower carbon uptake were years when there was a summer drought.  This work suggests that variations in summer precipitation have a dramatic impact on annual marsh grass production (carbon uptake), probably through altering soil salinity during a critical growth period.  In turn, marsh productivity affects how much carbon is stored in sediments.  4)      Warming water temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have allowed for the northward migration of some species.  In 2012 we documented the arrival of the warm-water blue crab and in 2014 for the first time we found adult Atlantic marsh fiddler crabs, Uca pugnax, in the marsh.  Fiddler crabs have now become well established in PIE marshes.  5)      To understand how striped bass, important large mobile predators, are distributed and how their distribution relates to prey abundance we used acoustic tagging techniques to map the whole system distributional patterns of the fish.  This allowed us to understand how currents and bathymetry controlled the distribution of the striped bass.  We were also able to determine that young striped bass are very dependent on the marsh for their growth.  6)      Our work has shown the importance of a small, highly adaptable bait fish in PIE marsh food webs.  Mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus) , are omnivores that eat small invertebrates but will also consume algae growing on the marsh surface, switching their diet depending upon food availability.   However, their fitness improves when their diet is supplemented by protein-rich food items such as insects, which they gain access to during tides that flood the marsh.  7)      We have described a change in behavior and appearance in some parasitized amphipods that makes them highly vulnerable to predation.  When infected by the flatworm Levinseniella byrdi , the salt-marsh amphipod Orchestia grillis, turns orange and moves "zombie-like" into open areas where it is easy prey for birds, the necessary host for the flatworm.  Our work suggests that nutrient enrichment, which is occurring in many marshes, may increase the incidence of parasitization.     BROADER IMPACTS: Our award winning K-12 schoolyard program, "Salt Marsh Science", served over 1,000 students per year in grades 5-12 in ten schools.  In addition, local high school students served as interns and we had a local teacher studying striped bass. A total of 24 college undergraduate students, funded through the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, spent the summer in residence. Twenty-one additional undergraduates from all over the country worked or conducted summer research at PIE.  Thirty-one Masters and Ph.D. students and 5 post-doctoral fellows conducted their research under the PIE-LTER Program.               PIE's contribution to the LTER children?s book series was "Save our Stream", published in 2017.  Two children learn how to make lawn care more ecologically sensitive and take action on what they have learned.     The science carried out at PIE has influenced environmental policy locally, regionally and nationally, and outreach activities involve nearly every member of the team.  PIE scientists serve on numerous advisory committees for federal and state commissions and nonprofit environmental organizations.
