<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The interpretation of genetic information by the molecular machinery inside cells requires highly specific interactions between protein, DNA, and RNA molecules. The ability to predict the nucleotide sequences bound by RNA and DNA binding proteins would accelerate understanding of the molecular networks that underlie organismal development and physiology, and would have broad application in basic research and biotechnology. However, it remains difficult to predict the RNA binding properties of most RNA binding proteins, or to design them to bind specified RNA sequences. This project focuses on a family of RNA binding proteins, the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, that holds special promise for the rational design of specified RNA binding properties and for the engineering of regulatory switches to control gene expression. PPR proteins consist of tandem repeating units that form a surface for binding RNA. PPR-RNA recognition is modular in nature: each repeat specifies binding to a particular RNA nucleotide via the combinatorial action of amino acids at two positions in the repeat. PPR proteins are found in all eucaryotic organisms, but the family is extraordinary for its size in the plant lineage, with &gt;450 members in flowering plants. PPR proteins localize primarily to mitochondria and chloroplasts, where they influence the expression of RNAs encoded by the organellar genomes. As such, the PPR family has a profound impact on many organelle-dependent processes, including photosynthesis, respiration, and fertility. The goal of this project is to develop understanding of the basis for PPR-RNA recognition to the point that (i) the binding sites and functions of PPR proteins in crop plant genomes can be reliably predicted, and (ii) PPR proteins can be designed to achieve desired RNA sequence specificities. The ability to predict PPR binding sites and the functional consequences of that binding will be tested by engineering PPR proteins to regulate endogenous organellar genes that are distinct from their natural targets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Anticipated outcomes would impact applied and basic biology by: (i) accelerating the assignment of functions to one of the largest gene families in plants; (ii) providing a set of switches with which to control mitochondrial and chloroplast gene expression, and thereby modulate photosynthesis, respiration, and plant fertility; and (iii) providing tools for targeting passenger proteins to specified RNA sequences in vivo. This funding will foster an international collaboration between laboratories in the US and Australia. The interdisciplinary and international nature of this research will provide a rich educational experience for one graduate and two undergraduate students. The undergraduates will take ownership of core components of the project, and will employ informatic, biochemical and genetic approaches. They will be mentored by the PI and graduate student in a program that will include weekly subgroup meetings tailored to their needs. Project content will also be incorporated into University-wide initiatives aiming to increase diversity in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by Genetic Mechanisms in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, by Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, and by the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

Summary of outcomes: We assigned functions to several proteins that are critical for plant viability, revealed that natural PPR proteins are less "predictable" than had been assumed, developed approaches for the rational design of molecular switches to modulate organelle gene expression, and provided tools for targeting passenger proteins to specified RNAs in vivo. These points are elaborated upon below.  i) Expanding the known functional repertoire of native PPR proteins.  We assigned functions to two members of the poorly understood PPR-SMR subfamily, showing that they activate translation and stabilize specific chloroplast RNAs. We showed that a member of the PLS subfamily, whose members generally specify sites of C- to-U RNA editing, acts as a blockade to degradation of a specific chloroplast mRNA.

We comprehensively analyzed the sequence specificity of the native protein PPR10, and found that the PPR code cannot account for a substantial fraction of the nucleotides that it recognizes. Additionally, we found that the PPR code cannot predict the diversity of RNA ligands recognized by several native PPR proteins in vivo.

We designed synthetic PPR proteins built from consensus PPR motifs, and comprehensively analyzed the repertoire of RNA sequences they bind in vitro. Contrasting with results from native PPR proteins, the PPR code accurately predicted the sequence specificity landscapes of these designer proteins. Our results also elucidated how to design such proteins to maximize binding affinity while minimizing off-target binding. Finally, we showed that two designer PPR proteins expressed in chloroplasts bound with specificity to the intended RNA target. These results lay the foundation for the rational design of regulatory switches to control organelle gene expression and for targeting passenger proteins to specified RNAs.   iv) Interplay between RNA folding and PPR binding.

We explored the interplay between RNA folding and PPR binding by studying the binding of a model protein to RNAs with engineered structures of varying stability. The results showed that PPR binding is exquisitely sensitive to RNA structures that intrude on the binding site. This implies that mechanisms must exist in the cell to reorganize RNA structures and allow PPR binding.   This work resulted in the publication of two invited review articles and five research articles thus far, with two additional articles undergoing revision after initial review.   Training and outreach. One postdoctoral fellow, two PhD students, one MS student, and six undergraduates participated in this research, many of whom presented their findings at conferences. Some of these students served as mentors in a summer outreach program for underserved high school students, in which we used biochemical methods to analyze proteins in various foods.
