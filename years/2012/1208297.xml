<AbstractNarration>This project provides funding to support the participation of US researchers in the two-week long research school Senegal Workshop on Geometric Structures and Control Theory that will be held at the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar (Senegal) from May 7 to May 18, 2012. The workshop will explore recent advances in symplectic geometry, contact geometry, sub-Riemannian geometry, as well as  hyperbolic geometry, with a special emphasis on the interplay between all these aspects of geometry and  applications to control theory. More information about the program can be found at the website: http://cimpadakar2012.ucad.sn/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the meeting is to bring together experts and young researchers working in geometry and control theory. The workshop introduces graduate students and young researchers to current research topics in geometry and control theory. In addition, it provides an opportunity for international collaboration between researchers and encourage cross fertilization between different relevant topics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project consisted of three international meetings.   The first event was a research summer school on "Geometric Structures and Control Theory"  has been held at the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal,  from May 7, to May 19, 2013. It was attended by 72 registered participants from Africa,  Europe, America and  Asia: Northern Africa (Egypt, Tunisia) , Central Africa (Cameroon,  Gabon), West Africa (Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Togo,  Senegal), Europe (France,  England,  Italy, Spain, Poland), USA, and  India.  About 10 percent of the participants were female. The main objective of the meeting is to provide a forum, where experts and young researchers in symplectic geometry, sub-Riemannian geometry and control theory can exchange ideas and have opportunities for future collaboration.  The scientific program consist of seven   mini-courses of four and half hours and one hour talks. The mini-courses  were delivered by:  Augustin Banyaga (Penn State University, USA): Symplectic geometry and some applications.  Ugo Boscain (Ecole Polytechnique,  Paris, France): Introduction to sub-Riemannian geometry.  Francoise Dal'Bo (Universit\'e Renne 1, France):  Hyperbolic geometry and Diophantine approximations.  Bronislaw Jakubczyk  (IMPAN, Poland): The geometry of ODEs, vector fields and distributions.  Witold Respondek  (INSA, Rouen, France): Introduction to the geometric theory of nonlinear control systems. Philippe Rukimbira  (FIU, USA): Introduction to contact and Sasakian geometry.  Aissa Wade (Penn State University, USA):  Moment maps, Convexity theorems and Hamiltonian reduction.   In addition, there were one-hour talks delivered by:   Fernanda Alcade, (University of S. J. Compostel, Spain), Mirna Dzamonja (University of East Anglia Norwich, England), Janusz Grabowski (IMPAN , Poland,)  David Hurtubise (Penn State, USA), Philippe Jouan (University of Rouen, France),   Stefan Muller (Penn State and KIAS),  Philibert Nang (ENS Libreville, Gabon), Peter Spaeth (Penn State and KIAS).   The workshop has significant effects and impacts: there was  a lot of  discussions during the conference and there were many exchanges between researchers from different areas of geometry and control theory. All  four and half hour lectures ended with open questions. Some lecture notes were available for graduate students.   The second event was a four-day workshop (March 5-8, 2014) attended by more than thirty participants form Hong Kong, China and the USA.  The conference covered topics in Lie theory, symplectic geometry, and algebraic geometry. One-hour talks were delivered by Sam Evens (University of Notre Dame, USA), Allen Knutson (Cornell University, USA), Conan Leung (Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong), Dragan Milicic (University of Utah, USA), Victor Mouquin (University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong), Tudor Ratiu (EPFL, Switzerland), Mathieu Stienon (Penn State University, USA), Aissa Wade (Penn State University, USA), Ping Xu (Penn State University, USA), Ting Xue (University of Helsinki, Finland), Milen Yakimov (Louisiana State University, USA), Yunxin Zhang (University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong).    While the third event was a one week workshop on "Noncommutative Geometry and Mathematical Physics" held in Scalea, Italy, during the period of June 16-20, 2014. It brought together 46 participants from Europe, the USA  ( 3 participants from USA) and Asia. Prof. Alberto Cattaneo (Universitat Zurich, Switzerland) gave a mini-course  on "Classical and quantum Lagrangian field theories with boundaries". In addition,  thirteen one-hour talks were delivered by: J. E. Andersen (Aarhus Universitet, Denmark), Paolo Aschieri (Universita degli Studi del Piemonte Orientale, Alessandria, Italy), Ozgur Ceyhan (University of Luxembourg, Lexembourg), Nicola Ciccoli (Universita di Perugia, Italy),  Alexander Getmanenko (I.H.
