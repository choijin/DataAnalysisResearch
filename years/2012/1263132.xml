<AbstractNarration>This grant funds the Nebraska REU in Applied Mathematics, held at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska, and run by the Department of Mathematics.  The PIs will offer projects during the summers of 2013, 2014 and 2015, and each project will last for eight weeks.   Most of the projects are interdisciplinary as well as applied, and many incorporate computer exploration in order to gain insight into mathematical problems.  There is an emphasis on mathematical biology, and the site will offer projects in herbivore-plant interactions, population movement along a river, and dynamics in recurrent neural networks.  There will also be projects in differential equations, including discrete fractional calculus on time scales, nonlocal models for elasticity and diffusion, and finite element schemes for wave equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU students work in two teams of five undergraduates each, along with one or two faculty mentors and one graduate student mentor. Each group works together on one or more problems with a common theme.  The main goal is to give the students a complete research experience, with attention given to defining good problems, solving problems and (in some projects) giving rigorous proofs, writing mathematics, and presenting work with a talk and a poster.  This is achieved by using a structure carefully designed to make use of the strengths of talented undergraduates while compensating for their relative inexperience and limited background.  The students meet with their mentors almost every weekday, and spend significant additional time with their graduate student mentors. Over the course of the eight weeks, the projects will gradually transition from a focus on preparation to an exclusive focus on research to a focus on preparing results for dissemination.  Research, educational, and social activities will combine to cultivate an environment that emphasizes interaction and collaboration.  The students document their work as a written report in professional mathematics style as results are produced.  In the final week of the Site, the project teams devote the bulk of their energy to preparation of results for dissemination, which includes a group talk presented to the larger University of Nebraska-Lincoln mathematics community and a poster intended for presentation at the Joint Mathematics Meetings the following January.  REU projects result in one or more conference presentations, and many also produce papers published in undergraduate or professional journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the summers of 2013, 2014 and 2015 the University of Nebraska hosted 10 students (11 in 2015), offering two projects each summer. The goal was to provide a meaningful research experience for undergraduates.  Each group was mentored by one or two faculty members with experience supervising undergraduate research, and each group included one graduate student mentor who learned how to mentor undergraduates, and also received some research training.  All of the projects were in areas of applied mathematics.  In 2013 and 2014 there were projects in time scales, which is a theory that unified and extends both discrete-time (difference) equations and continuous time (differential) equations.  In 2013 there was also a project in partial differential equations, where the students theoretically and numerically investigated a mathematical model of mechanical vibrations with "degenerate" frictional damping, meaning that the dissipative forces diminish at smaller amplitudes.  In 2014 there was also a project where the students created a mathematical model for a predator-prey system in which prey populations were distributed between productive and unproductive environments, and predators can only live in the unproductive environment; analysis determined regions in the parameter space where the predator could exist simply through predation on prey migrating from one productive patch to another.   In 2015 there was a project where the students modeled coupled populations, each with extinction thresholds, and analyzed the equations to determine conditions under which the coupled population will go extinct.  Also in 2015 we had a project in nonlocal models in diffusion and elasticity, which are used when local models (for instance differential equations) do not adequately describe physical processes.  These projects have resulted in 5 papers submitted to professional journals, four of which have been accepted and one of which is under review.  All of the students learned how to formulate and solve applied mathematics problems, write up their results in TeX, and give a research presentation.  Furthermore, many of the students obtained subtantial original research results.          Last Modified: 05/23/2016       Submitted by: Richard L Rebarber]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
