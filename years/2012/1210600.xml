<AbstractNarration>Understanding the factors that structure ecological communities is a central goal in ecology. When new communities are formed, the identity of the initial colonists can determine which types of organisms ultimately populate the resulting community. The role that the effects of early colonists, termed priority effects, play in structuring insect communities is largely unexplored. This project examines the insect communities that inhabit leaf ties, which are shelters between overlapping leaves built by caterpillars using silk. Other insects subsequently inhabit leaf ties leading to an increase in the abundance and diversity of insects on the plant. Experimental manipulations will be used to determine if aggressive behavior exhibited by initial colonists influences subsequent community development and composition. Priority effects will be demonstrated if leaf ties colonized by caterpillars that vary in aggressive behavior contain different insect communities. This research will aid in understanding the dynamics of an ecologically important yet understudied insect community that is important for forest health and management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide training to young scientists and educate the local community about these fascinating insects. This project will train undergraduate research assistants who will subsequently conduct independent research projects. Volunteer Master Naturalists will also be trained in the basics of plant-insect ecology through a local program; they will then lead community groups and students on nature walks aimed at conveying natural history information and basic ecological relationships of local fauna and flora.</AbstractNarration>
