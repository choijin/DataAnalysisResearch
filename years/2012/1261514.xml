<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr.  Christopher A. Pool and Dr. Michael L. Loughlin will direct a regional archeological survey to investigate causes for the remarkable resilience of the polity headed by Tres Zapotes in southern Veracruz, Mexico. From the Arab Spring, to the Haitian earthquake, to global climate change, contemporary events underscore the need for polities to adjust to social and natural disturbances in their environments. Archaeology has a unique ability to provide a comparative perspective on the resilience of human societies in the long term. While much scholarly and popular attention has been focused on the phenomenon of collapse, understanding why some polities and institutions are more resilient than others is as important as as understanding what collapses and why. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tres Zapotes was the capital of regional polity of the Olmec and epi-Olmec cultures between 1000 B.C. and A.D. 300. While other Olmec centers were collapsing around 400 B.C., Tres Zapotes grew and flourished for another 700 years before it suffered a protracted decline. During that time, the evolving Tres Zapotes polity experienced challenges from periodic volcanic eruptions, changing environmental conditions, and an increasingly competitive political landscape. Previous NSF-funded investigations by Dr. Pool suggest that a key factor in the resilience of the Tres Zapotes polity was its shift from monarchical rule to a system in which governance was shared among multiple competing factions in the capital. The current project focuses on how Tres Zapotes implemented governance within its territory and how that territory was created and maintained. Such understanding requires regional-scale data on the distribution of population, the plans of civic-ceremonial architecture, the organization of craft production, and the exploitation of the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project combines traditional archaeological survey and surface collection methods with the advanced remote sensing technologies of LiDAR and multispectral satellite imagery to investigate the relationship between Tres Zapotes and hinterland populations over time. In addition the project seeks evidence of earlier occupations stretching back into the Archaic period (8000-2000 B.C.) to better understand how humans adapted to the humid tropical environment that eventually gave rise to  the Tres Zapotes polity. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its melding of political-economic and landscape perspectives to evaluate models of political resilience -  a matter of considerable anthropological and practical importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the study include the training of Mexican and U.S. students in field and analytical techniques, interpretation of remote sensing data, and enhancement of the local research infrastructure through needed expansion to the project laboratory on the grounds of the Tres Zapotes Museum. The project will contribute to public education by (1) providing materials for museum displays (2) allowing museum visitors to observe laboratory activities, and (3) giving public talks to schools and civic organizations in the region. Information from the project will be widely disseminated through professional publications, graduate dissertations and theses, and a project web page.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Between 1000 BC and AD 300 the archaeological site of Tres Zapotes governed the region between the Papaloapan River and the Tuxtla Mountains in what is now southern Veracruz, Mexico. Founded as a village of the Olmec culture around 1250 BC, Tres Zapotes grew and continued to flourish after 400 BC, when other Olmec centers, and was not itself abandoned until around AD 900. Through four field seasons beginning in summer of 2014, the NSF-funded project, Long Term Social Stability in the Tres Zapotes Region investigated the rise, fall, and impressive resilience of this long-lived polity. Researchers from the University of Kentucky?s Department of Anthropology conducted archaeological survey over 400 square kilometers&nbsp; of an 800 square kilometer study area with the assistance of graduate students from the US and Mexico as well as local fieldworkers. The University of Houston?s National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping collaborated in the project, mapping 93 square kilometers using high-resolution LIDAR (Light Distance and Ranging) technology. In all, the project recorded 450 sites containing over 2000 individual mounds, platforms, and artifact concentrations. Additionally, the project recorded 72 petroglyphs (carved rock art) and two previously unreported stone monuments. &nbsp;</p> <p>Analysis of the artifacts recovered from the archaeological features shows that the regional population grew from 1500 BC through AD 600, then collapsed at the end of the Classic period around AD 900 before beginning to rebound in the last two centuries before the Spanish Conquest. Tres Zapotes itself achieved its greatest size and influence as an Epi-Olmec capital in the Late Formative period, &nbsp;between 400 and 1 BC, establishing secondary administrative centers throughout the region. The expansion of the Tres Zapotes polity coincided with a shift in governance from a highly centralized monarchy to a ruling collaboration of factions represented by civic-ceremonial architectural complexes in Tres Zapotes. Subsequently, in the Classic period, the political landscape became Balkanized with the proliferation of small centers arranged around ?standard plan? plaza complexes. Although it would be overstatement to call the Late Formative Tres Zapotes polity&nbsp; a democracy, our findings support the hypothesis that the more flexible framework provided by collective government enhanced this polity?s overall resilience and stability.</p> <p>Through its results and continuing data analysis, the project, ?Long Term Social Stability in the Tres Zapotes Region? is making an impact on the field of archaeology in several ways. Theoretically, it explores the resilience of complex societies, asking why some persist through crises while others collapse. Substantively it investigates sociopolitical change and stability over the long term in the heartland of one of the earliest complex societies in Mexico. Methodologically the project explicitly combines traditional pedestrian archaeological survey with two remote sensing techniques, LiDAR and multispectral satellite imagery, to identify archaeological sites and landscape features in a humid tropical environment, evaluating the effectiveness of the techniques in combination and individually to advance archaeological survey methods. Moreover, in the course of its four field seasons, this project provided intensive training in archaeological survey, the use of remote sensing and GIS data, and artifact analysis to twelve graduate students while expanding curation space and improving research infrastructure in southern Veracruz. To date, results have been disseminated in in four peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters and seventeen professional conference papers, as well as public lectures at museums and community gatherings in Mexico and the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/19/2018<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;A&nbsp;Pool</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261514/1261514_10273413_1545254210754_Group3LiDARcrop--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261514/1261514_10273413_1545254210754_Group3LiDARcrop--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261514/1261514_10273413_1545254210754_Group3LiDARcrop--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">LIDAR image of Tres Zapotes Group 3</div> <div class="imageCredit">Christopher Pool</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;A&nbsp;Pool</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261514/1261514_10273413_1545254295181_RRATZOutcomesfig1sites--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261514/1261514_10273413_1545254295181_RRATZOutcomesfig1sites--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261514/1261514_10273413_1545254295181_RRATZOutcomesfig1sites--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Map of archaeological sites recorded in the Tres Zapotes region.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Christopher Pool</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;A&nbsp;Pool</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261514/1261514_10273413_1545254420739_NSFoutcomespopulationcurves--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261514/1261514_10273413_1545254420739_NSFoutcomespopulationcurves--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261514/1261514_10273413_1545254420739_NSFoutcomespopulationcurves--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Comparison of demographic trends at Tres Zapotes and the RRATZ regional survey.
