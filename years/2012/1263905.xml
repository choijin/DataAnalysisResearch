<AbstractNarration>1263905 - Nomura &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are microbially produced, biobased, and biodegradable polymers that have a wide array of uses ranging from substitutes for non-biodegradable, petroleum-based plastics in bulk commodity products to biomedical applications.  One of the factors that limits the widespread use of PHAs for more specialized applications is the lack of control over repeating unit compositions and by extension the inability to produce polymers with desired physical properties.  The long-term goal of this research project is to genetically engineer E. coli for producing expanded classes of PHA materials with desirable material properties.  PHAs comprised of repeating units of 3-5 carbon atoms are known as short-chain-length PHAs (SCL-PHAs) and tend to be thermoplastic in nature but lack toughness, while PHAs comprised of repeating units of 6-14 carbon atoms are known as medium-chain-length PHAs (MCL-PHAs) and tend to be elastomeric.  It has been demonstrated in previous studies that SCL-MCL PHA copolymers that are comprised of 80-95% SCL and 5-20% MCL repeating units have material properties that are very similar to common petroleum-based plastics.  The objective of this project is to further develop strains so that they can produce SCL-MCL PHA and PHA-co-Polylactic acid (PLA) copolymers with desirable material properties from the renewable sugar feedstocks, and to produce new PHA-co-PLA copolymers with specific repeating unit compositions from lactic acid and fatty acids. This will be accomplished with a combination of synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, protein engineering, and synthetic chemistry methods to improve PHA production. Successful completion of these studies will lead to novel polymer production platforms with the potential to overcome the lack of diversity and control over repeating unit compositions of existing bacterial PHA producing systems and expand the number of applications for PHA polymers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies and research training activities are expected to have a broad impact on society, ranging from improving upon the science of biodegradable and biobased polymer synthesis to the development of new biomaterials for research, industrial, and biomedical applications.  The project will contribute to reduce US dependency on non-renewable sources such as fossil fuels for energy, materials production, and transportation.  The research associated with this proposal is intrinsically interdisciplinary in nature and will be performed in a diverse training environment.  It will also provide summer research experiences for underrepresented minority students with a goal of increasing the number of college graduates from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the interdisciplinary nature of this SusChEM project the award from the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Bioengineering Program of the CBET Division is co-sponsored by the Genetic Mechanisms Program of the Molecular and Cell Biology Division and by the Biomaterials Program of the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>

However, modern uses of plastic materials present two major problems: (i) the major precursors for the chemical synthesis of plastics are derived from non-renewable resources and (ii) petroleum-based plastics are inherently non-biodegradable, presenting a litany of environmental problems post disposal as they make their way into landfills or directly into the environment.

The biological synthesis of the biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymers has potential to address both the issues of sustainability and biodegradability as these materials can be completely degraded to CO2 and H2O upon disposal.   In this project we have engineered bacteria for producing expanded classes of PHA materials with desirable material properties from renewable resources.   In pursuing the intellectual merits of this project, we have engineered a number of E. coli strains for the production of new types of PHA polymers.  One of the key strains we have created is capable of taking the unprocessed hemicellulosic polysaccharide, xylan (a key component of woody biomass) and converting it into biodegradable plastics.  Another strain we have engineered allows us to accurately control the repeating unit composition of PHA polymers so that we may control the physical properties of the materials.  Additionally, we have synthesized novel fatty acid feedstocks that may be fed to our strains to be incorporated into PHA polymers that can then be further modified by ?click-chemistry.?  These will be key platforms for new and advanced applications for PHA polymers.  This project has resulted in 1 book chapter, 4 patents (2 applications, 2 issued), 17 peer-reviewed articles, 60 presentations at conferences, 20 invited lectures at institutes and universities. In addition to the broader impacts of developing new routes for the production of sustainable biodegradable plastics production, this grant has provided significant training opportunities for 3 postdocs (one woman, one underrepresented minority), 5 graduate students (one women, two underrepresented minorities), and &gt;10 undergraduates (5 women, 3 underrepresented minorities).
