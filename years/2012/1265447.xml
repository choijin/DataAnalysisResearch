<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to measure the mechanical properties and active processes that produce propulsive motion in cilia and flagella. Cilia and flagella are tiny subcellular structures (about 200 nanometers in diameter and 5-30 micrometers long) that beat regularly to propel cells or to move fluid. Cilia line the airways of the human respiratory system and beat in coordination to eliminate bacteria and particles. In this project, elastic stiffness and ability to produce force will be measured in algae flagella, which have structure and behavior very similar to human cilia. Mechanical properties will be tested in flagella with specific genetic mutations, under varying experimental conditions, to learn how the underlying structural features produce the coordinated oscillations required for effective propulsion. The novel combination of mechanics and genetics is uniquely suited to make progress on this problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, these studies will advance our scientific understanding of cilia and flagella, and provide insight into how these systems fail in injury or disease. This improved understanding could lead to new methods for diagnosis and therapy, or ways to harvest energy from biological oscillators. More generally, these studies will clarify the coordination mechanisms which allow many independent microscopic oscillators to work together to produce macroscopic motion. The project will achieve broad impact through a partnership between Washington University (WU; a research-intensive private university) and the University of Central Oklahoma (UCO; a public institution focused on undergraduate education). Through this partnership, undergraduate students from both institutions will participate in research, enhancing the availability of such experiences to a diverse population. This award will also support educational projects in which high school and undergraduate students design large-scale, physical models of cilia and flagella. These models will illuminate the behavior of cilia and flagella while providing practical experience in electromechanical design and control.</AbstractNarration>
