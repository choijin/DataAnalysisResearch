<AbstractNarration>1209402&lt;br/&gt;Foufoula-Georgiou&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a pressing need to identify which elements of the coupled natural-human system are most sensitive to changes in land use and climate in the sense that they are likely to respond strongly to changes in these factors. Means of identifying such "hot spots" of sensitivity to change would allow us to target remediation and other management measures where they will do the most good. This project will test and explore the ecologic and management implications of a novel hypothesis termed human-amplified natural change (HANC), which states that the areas of the landscape that are most susceptible to human, climatic, and other external changes are those undergoing the highest natural rates of change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will develop a theoretical framework for vulnerability assessment and will test the HANC hypothesis through intensive study of the Minnesota River Basin (MRB), a 44,000 km2 agriculturally-dominated watershed in the upper Midwest. The MRB encompasses an extremely broad spectrum of natural and human-induced rates of change and sensitivity to land-use practices. Of particular interest is the complex nonlinear coupling between land use and river network processes, which has already resulted in severely impaired waters for sediment and nutrients. What will be the future condition of the waters and ecosystem services in the MRB under changing human actions and climatic conditions? Of the many potential land and water management options, which are most likely to produce a sustainable, resilient, and thriving coupled economic-environmental system?  To answer such questions, this study seeks to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) determine the extent to which current high rates of sediment production are concentrated in areas that were undergoing high rates of natural change before the external changes were imposed; &lt;br/&gt;(2) study how thresholds and localized features in the system amplify and accelerate change and how such nonlinear effects can be parameterized in an integrated predictive modeling framework; &lt;br/&gt;(3) investigate the extent to which the human-amplified natural changes (HANC) in the geomorphic system contribute to observed ecological changes in the MRB; and &lt;br/&gt;(4) develop means to include HANC-based reasoning in decision analysis frameworks, including a suite of methods to identify sensitive regions, along with spatially targeted monitoring activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Strong relationships previously developed with State regulatory agencies will ensure that the results from this project directly influence future land and water policy and management decisions.  The research team will disseminate new knowledge directly to the public in close collaboration with State agencies via stakeholder meetings, widely attended regional meetings and informational reports. Further, they will develop a HANC-based analytical toolbox for evaluating areas prone to rapid change in the landscape, beginning with Midwestern agricultural landscapes. New knowledge generated from this work will be used to inform Science Museum exhibits related to the Anthropocene, develop innovative K-12 curricula in environmental science and engineering, and disseminate NSF's Earth Science and Climate Literacy Principles via teacher training.  The project supports three early-career PIs and training of graduate, undergraduate, and "synthesis-postdoctoral" students in an interdisciplinary environment, co-advised by scientists in hydrology, geomorphology, ecology, biology, engineering, and economics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching goal of our Water Sustainability and Climate project (called REACH: REsilience under Accelerated CHange) was to develop a framework within which the vulnerabilities of a natural-human system can be assessed to guide decision-making towards eco-hydrologic sustainability and resilience. Over the lifetime of our project, REACH collaborators have created an interdisciplinary body of work that has highlighted the importance of specific places, times and processes in determining how human and climate induced changes to intensively managed agricultural landscapes propagate through river networks to result in impacts to downstream water quality.</p> <p>Our efforts have leveraged large, existing publicly available datasets, underscoring the immense value of publicly funded long-term data collection. We have also generated unique, unprecedented original field datasets that have enabled us to examine spatial and temporal linkages between land use, hydrology and water quality impacts; these datasets are now published for public use. Many of our research contributions have focused on developing reduced complexity models to understand how land and water are connected and modified via biophysical processes to affect pollutant loads and aquatic life. At the same time, we have worked to integrate new knowledge into existing mechanistic models widely used by state and federal agencies for conservation planning. In addition to providing new insights into the biophysical underpinnings of agricultural landscapes, our research has highlighted tradeoffs in ecosystem services derived from competing conservation management scenarios. This work involved forging new paths with stakeholders to incorporate science into decision making, establishing a tight network of collaboration with Federal and State agencies, agricultural producers, and conservation groups.</p> <p>Considerable time and effort was invested into reconciling conflicting disciplinary perspectives and working collectively towards a truly interdisciplinary collaboration in which researchers from different fields understood the objectives and critiques of those from other disciplines. This work was not always easy, but was ultimately fruitful. According to a state agency staff partner, the scientific advancements made by the REACH group have done more to &lsquo;change the game&rsquo; around water quality management in Minnesota than any other scientific collaboration. Many of our findings point to the role of altered hydrological regimes in driving pollutant outcomes, the importance of hydrology-driven transport of near channel sediment sources and nutrients, the role of wetlands in mitigating watershed-scale pollutant loads, and the ways in which biogeochemical processes can alter pollutant export behavior.</p> <p>One of the culminating elements of this work is a set of biophysical models, coupled to a holistic water quality valuation framework, that can identify the costs and benefits of conservation scenarios designed to address multiple water quality endpoints (nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended sediment) at large watershed scales. This effort includes key biophysical processes that have previously been overlooked, such as connections between hydrology and in-channel sediment transport, and the removal of nitrogen via wetlands. Importantly, our approach has allowed for the accounting of wetland restoration effects on downstream water quality impacts, something which to date has been omitted from many conservation planning tools. Placement of conservation scenarios on the landscape are optimized for both local water quality targets (i.e., in-state water quality standards for streams, rivers, and lakes) and downstream water quality targets (i.e., nutrient and sediment reduction goals for Lake Pepin and the Gulf of Mexico). We have linked conservation landscapes to the provision of a broad array of ecosystem services, including the costs and benefits to public goods such as air and drinking water quality, recreation, and biodiversity conservation. Our research has also provided an evaluation of multiple potential policy mechanisms that could be used to cost effectively implement conservation actions across the landscape to meet water quality targets and maximize ecosystem benefits.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/18/2018<br>      Modified by: Efi&nbsp;Foufoula-Georgiou</p> </div> <div
