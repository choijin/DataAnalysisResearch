<AbstractNarration>The Florida State University is building a dedicated campus research network to significantly accelerate both local and national transmission rates of "big data" among collaborators participating in NSF funded research. The campus network improvements form the foundation of the newly created NoleNet Express-lane. Our work leverages the availability of unused or "dark fiber" to cost effectively connect campus network switches with core instrumentation and data storage facilities.  The new network supports leading edge instrumentation used to better understand the structure and function of complex biological molecules, the organization of agriculturally important genomes, and the processes and patterns of evolution and population dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To share results and instrumentation with a broad audience, the project improves by a factor of 40 the connectivity to research partners beyond FSU's campus boarder by upgrading the switching infrastructure between FSU's campus "Express-lane" network and Florida's statewide optical network Point-of-Presence. These improvements, coupled with the newly created Sunshine State Education &amp; Research Computing Alliance (SSERCA), are helping to enhance FSU's ability to support collaborative activities across the state of Florida.  SSERCA works to bring together Florida's geographically distributed educational institutions and to create a Cyberinfrastructure that can be used by FSU faculty as bridge to national computing and data storage resources.  Routing local and regional network traffic related to research onto an advanced dedicated network lowers the barriers to scientific discovery by removing bottlenecks related to sharing data and instrumentation and supporting leading edge data analysis workflows.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Florida State University Researchers and IT staff have collaborated to develop a NoleNet Expresslane research network.  This high speed network enables the transfer of large amounts of information between various research instrumentation and data collection devices to dedicated storage and processing facilities located at the centeral University Research Computing Center, as well as high speed pathways to the statewide regional optical network.  This dedicated network      environment for the FSU campus has served to increase focus on interdisciplinary computing on the FSU campus and it will enable increased      collaboration outside the institution.  A science DMZ was made operational in which traffic is      bypassing the campus firewall systems using this new      infrastructure allowing unrestricted access.  Major network enhancements have been      performed to improve network access and performance to the research      network, leading to increased data throughput for core scientific      instruments. In some cases this has lead to an increased research      productivity.  For example, a Cryo-electron microscope can now sample more      images after its network-path to storage systems at the Research Computing      Center (RCC) was improved using technology provided by this grant.  The target of this research and that of several PIs at FSU depends on taking thousands of images using electron microscopy. In collaboration with the FSU RCC, we have developed a pipeline where our microscope images are transferred from the instrument to the RCC for long-term storage and processing. Additionally, we have collaborators at other universities with whom we share data. All of these activities depend on on a networking infrastructure that can support rapid transport of terabytes of data. The Nolenet Expresslane infrastructure including the 10Gbps switch that is directly connected to our microscope has facilitated the development of a high-throughput high-resolution pipeline at FSU for three dimensional electron microscopy. This has allowed us to support more users, collect more data more rapidly, and automate many of the processes that were previously performed manually.
