<AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to understand the mechanisms by which plant cells control the delivery of proteins and other functional molecules to their outer surface, the region defined by the plasma membrane and surrounding cell wall.  This process is known as vesicle trafficking, as proteins are produced within the cell, packaged into small, membrane-bound carriers (vesicles), and then moved to the plasma membrane for final delivery.  This process is important because: 1) it is the primary mechanism used to build and to control the plant cell interface with its outside environment, which can affect how the plant interacts with harmful or beneficial microbes; 2) it is crucial for cell growth; 3) it is a regulator of cell-cell communication between cells; and 4) it is crucial for the acquisition of nutrients from the surrounding environment via specialized plasma membrane-localized protein transporters.  The molecular mechanisms regarding how vesicle trafficking are controlled are not well understood.  One player that appears likely to control this process in plant cells is the eight-protein exocyst complex, which provides spatial regulation at the plasma membrane for vesicle trafficking.  This project uses the Arabidopsis root hair as a model and investigates the exocyst-mediated vesicle trafficking pathway (EMVT).  EMVT is required for proper growth of the root hair, a key structure for nutrient acquisition.  The project seeks to understand how root hair growth relies on EMVT through: 1) Characterization of exocyst interactions with other known components of the vesicle trafficking system; and 2) Molecular identification of a new gene (NERD1) which interacts functionally with the exocyst in the Arabidopsis root hair.  The project should build a deeper understanding of how the function of plasma membrane-targeted molecules is enabled and controlled, and how precise patterns of cellular growth are affected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge generated in this project may have broad implications for plant physiology and development.  Due to its hypothesized connection to the plasma membrane, EMVT may help mediate interactions between root and soil.  Thus, this work could inform applied work that seeks to manage plant responses to abiotic stress induced by the surrounding environment (e.g. drought, salinity, and nutrient-poor soils), to pathogens, and to interactions with the rhizosphere microbial community.  In addition, the project will train a postdoctoral researcher in integrating genetic, cell biological and next-generation sequencing approaches, and will mentor undergraduate students in plant genetic research.  Finally, this project will support outreach efforts to high school students through the Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering program at Oregon State University.</AbstractNarration>

The mechanism by which these vesicles are delivered to the correct location on the plasma membrane at precisely the right time is not well understood, even though this tight regulation is fundamental to such processes as cell division, cell wall elongation, defense against pathogens, and intercellular communication (e.g., plant hormone signaling).  This project helped advance our understanding of this tight control by characterizing the role of the exocyst, a complex of eight proteins, in such vesicle trafficking in the model plant Arabidopsis.  Note that the exocyst is conserved and appears to act in all eukaryotes, and thus this work also has implications for fungi, animals and humans.  The exocyst is hypothesized to work as a tether between a vesicle and its intended destination at the plasma membrane, helping to target vesicles to specific sites at developmentally appropriate times.  This project helped demonstrate that the exocyst plays crucial roles in several different processes in plants that were previously unknown: root cell elongation (which helps drive growth of the root); and proper control of the size of the primary root meristem (the structure in which new cells are generated for growth, and without which, root growth is defective).
