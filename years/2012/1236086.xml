<AbstractNarration>1236086&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dufresne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrophoretic displays based on charged colloidal pigments consume far less energy than conventional back-lit liquid crystal displays.  In fact, a well-designed electrophoretic display with a static image consumes no energy.  This energy savings arises from two important factors.  First, electrophoretic displays are bistable, so they consume energy only when changing the displayed image.  Second, electrophoretic displays use ambient light, instead of internal light sources.  Therefore, electrophoretic displays are ideal for reading, signage and architectural applications.  However, the central limitation of these displays is that they only produce black and white images.  In principle, color images can be created from electrophoretic displays through the use of colored filters, as in an LCD display, but such devices would be too dark for most applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bright electrophoretic displays would require each pixel to be able to display either red, green or blue.  To achieve this, this project will create electrophoretic inks with structural color.  Inspired by color-producing nanostructures in bird feathers, this work will control the color of electrophoretic inks by tuning the spacing of charged colloidal particles.  The spacing will be determined by interparticle forces and external electric fields.  Thus, the color of the ink containing pixel will be switchable with an applied voltage.  To achieve this goal, this project will need to solve several fundamental problems in colloid science.  First, the research will identify general principles and specific materials for creating charged suspensions in non-polar solvents with sufficient short-range order to produce structural colors.  Second, the research will characterize the effect of external electric fields on the structure of these suspensions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was concerned with the self-assembly and properties of soft materials.  We performed experiments on a number of different systems including colloids and gels.  The central themes were the self-assembly of colloidal particles and the properties of interfaces.  The main thrust of this work was the investigation of how particles adhered to lipid membranes (an important component of living cells), interact with each other.  This was inspired by some high-performance optical materials produced by insects, which are templated by membranes.  The adhesion of particles with membranes inspired experiments in the adhesion of particles to other surfaces, including polymer gels and simple liquid interfaces.   Insights from these experiments may provide new routes to make commercial adhesives and to new routes to stabilize oil droplets in water, a ubiquitous problem in industrial materials.  This project provided partial support for the training of six junior scientists: 3 post-docs and 3 graduate students (3 women and 3 men).  This project supported the education at across a spectrum of ages.  The PI presented two public lectures targeted to school children (K-8), one is available online: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWIOBj1cHuw.  At the other end of the spectrum, PI was a lecturer at the Boulder Summer School for Condensed Matter Physics in 2015 for advanced graduate students.  His notes and lectures are available online: http://boulderschool.yale.edu/2015/boulder-school-2015-lectures.  During this course of this project, the laboratory worked collaborated with three different companies (two in the US, and one international).
