<AbstractNarration>The award is to design a compact electron storage ring with circumference about 3 m capable of producing X-rays at energy 5 to 80 KeV, by employing inverse Compton scattering of laser at 800 nm wave length with electron beams at 20-60 MeV. The photon flux is estimated to be about 100 billion photons/second.  The award will evaluate effects of the collective instability, intrabeam scattering and Touschek lifetime. We will carry out experiments at the ALPHA stroage ring to characterize beam properties. In addition to the compact light source, the award will carry out design of a compact proton storage ring at energy of about 300 MeV. Such proton storage rings can provide industial and medical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is to investigate beam dynamics problems associated with high brightness low energy storage rings and its applications in the generation of inverse Compton X-ray source, and possibly coherent light sources.  This award is also intended to investigate physics associated with high power accelerators.  Topics associated with high power accelerators are space charge physics, synchrobetatron coupling, nonlinear beam dynamics and collective beam instabilities.  The award activities also include training of future accelearator scientists.</AbstractNarration>

Mr. Ao Liu will defend his thesis on Feb. 24, 2015; and Mr. Alper Duru and Patrick McChesney will defend their thesis in April, 2015.  For the past three year of NSF funding, our achievements are listed as follows:    We study of the bunch dilution method with rf voltage modulations (Dr. PhamÃ†s Ph.D. thesis) and references [13]). Using two rf systems, one can generate control dilution to avoid space charge and uniform beam intensity for radiation effect experiments, cancer treatment, and high power beams.    We study of the neutron storage ring for neutron beams (McChesny; submitted for publications). Using the time varying dipole field, one can create a longitudinal bucket for electrons. This will provide bucket for neutron beam synchrotron motion. This work will continue to be important topic for this renewal proposal.    We study of the space charge dominated beams (HC Chao, PRSTAB, 18, 024202 (2015)). We develop effective method for multiparticle simulation for the envelope dynamics of space charge dominated beams.    We collaborate with LCLS-II project physicist to study the beam dynamics with tapered undulators. (K. Fang, Ph.D. thesis and his publications with LCLS teams at SLAC).    We study compact storage ring design (Hwang, submitted for publication and H.S. Xu, et al, PRSTAB, 17, 070101 (2014)).
