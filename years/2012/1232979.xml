<AbstractNarration>Scientists from Wright State University and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will participate in the 2013 GEOTRACES cruise to the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP).  Seawater samples collected during this transect from Peru to Tahiti will be analyzed for total mercury (Hg), monomethylmercury (CH3Hg+), dimethylmercury ((CH3)2Hg), and elemental Hg (Hg0) to construct high-resolution vertical and horizontal sections.  In addition to filtered seawater samples, the scientists will also analyze suspended particles for total Hg and CH3Hg+, as well as rain and aerosol samples for Hg species and dissolved and particulate thiols, such as cysteine and glutathione. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cruise track extends from the upwelling region off Peru, to an expansive oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), followed by the hydrothermal vent fields of the East Pacific Rise, and finally into the highly oligotrophic waters near Tahiti.  These different oceanographic features will allow the researchers to determine their influence on the inputs and cycling of Hg in the ocean.  Specifically, they plan to assess whether (1) continental margins off Peru are a significant source of Hg, CH3Hg+, and (CH3)2Hg; (2) the OMZ sustains the highest levels of methylated Hg in the ocean; (3) hydrothermal systems are important sources of total and methylated Hg; and (4) the large gradient in productivity along this track impact the vertical distribution of this element, its bioavailability, and its speciation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this research may have societal benefits in helping to understand the source of methylmercury in the ocean, which bioaccumulates in fish and poses a hazard to those who eat seafood.  In an effort to improve science education, the proponent from Wright State University and his graduate student plan to involve a class of 7th graders at Bellbrook Middle School in the Dayton area in their research experiences at sea via classroom visits, a blog, and interacting with them during the cruise.  One graduate student and one undergraduate student from Wright State University would be supported and trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>

Of particular importance on this cruise was the study of various chemical forms of Hg that are present in the ocean: total mercury (Hg) composed mostly of inorganic Hg2+, monomethylmercury (CH3Hg+), dimethylmercury ((CH3)2Hg), and elemental Hg (Hg0). It is important to study these forms of Hg separately because their fate and behavior in the ocean are different from one another. For example, Hg0 is a dissolved gas that builds up in surface ocean water enough to degas from the ocean and enter the atmosphere, representing a natural process of detoxification of Hg from the ocean. In contrast, CH3Hg+ is synthesized within the ocean and is the form of Hg that accumulates in seafood and poses a risk to human and environmental health. Thus, in order to understand the potential health risks of CH3Hg+ in seafood, we must gain an understanding of the chemical forms of Hg in seawater and how they interact with one another.     We measured concentrations of different chemical forms of Hg in filtered water, suspended particles, and rain and aerosols.

Some highlights from our findings include:   Mercury exhibited nutrient-type vertical profiles: low concentrations at the surface that increase with depth.

In oceanographic terms, evidence for denitrification is often demonstrated with the N* metric, with negative N* values indicative of denitrification. During the cruise, we saw some weak evidence for a coupling of production of Hg0 from Hg2+ when N* was negative, but not as strongly as we had hypothesized. The source of Hg0 in "dark" waters, away from sunlight, is still therefore a mystery. Although there is evidence that hydrothermal fluids from the East Pacific Rise can contain greatly increased concentrations of Hg, we saw no evidence of increased levels of Hg in the hydrothermal plume extending away from the East Pacific Rise. This is similar to what we observed at a hydrothermally active site at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and suggests that vents do not contribute a substantial amount of Hg to the global ocean.  It is likely that Hg that is present in hot fluids precipitates out of the fluids near the vents.  We found that Hg0 evading from the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean increased the amount of Hg in the atmosphere downwind to a significant degree.
