<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;#1238292&lt;br/&gt;Kann, Maricel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to demonstrate proof-of-concept feasibility for a biomolecular interaction characterization technology that utilizes Biomolecular Interactions using Coherent X-ray Scattering (BICXS). The BICXS technology is based on small-angle coherent x-ray scattering (SAXS) signatures of reporter agents to determine the occurrence of interactions between two targeted proteins or small molecules. A strong multidisciplinary team has been assembled and includes expertise in bioinformatics, cellular biology, Gold NanoParticles, physics, and computational studies. The team includes three faculty members from University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC)as well as team members from the Division of Imaging and Applied Mathematics (DIAM), OSEL/CDRH/FDA. The team members are experts in their fields and uniquely qualified. Three graduate students will participate and perform research at the FDA site for one year. The proposed imaging technology may provide improved spatial resolution with high specificity that could enable deep tissue characterization of biomolecular interaction processes providing unique opportunities to evaluate the differences between normal vs. abnormal cells at the molecular level for various disease states.</AbstractNarration>
