<AbstractNarration>Nitrogen is a critical nutrient for forests, and scarcity of nitrogen often limits forest growth.  Theoretical considerations in ecology indicate that as a forest ages and its growth slows, its uptake of nitrogen from the soil should also slow, leading to increased loss of nitrogen in drainage water.  Long-term measurements of nitrogen in streams draining the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire contradict this expected pattern. This project seeks to understand the discrepancy between the theory and the data by testing the hypothesis that young forests extract nitrogen from deep soils, but as the forest ages, re-accumulation of the nitrogen in the soil delays the loss of nitrogen in drainage water.  The hypothesis will be tested by a field experiment to determine the propensity for nitrogen accumulation in soil beneath forest stands of different ages, and careful accounting of the amount of nitrogen in a sequence of forests ranging from 15 to over 200 years old.  In addition, a computer simulation model of forest ecosystems will be revised to incorporate these new observations. &lt;br/&gt;This work is important for management of forests to minimize loss of nitrogen, a key plant nutrient. Air pollution adds excess nitrogen to the forest, and if it is lost in drainage water, it can pollute streams and lakes. The project will involve training of two graduate students and two postdoctoral associates, and a teacher training module will help two high school science teachers develop a unit for teaching about forest ecology in their classrooms. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

In this project, we expand the model to recognize critical roles of soil organic N as a source and sink for N over succession, as plants borrow from and repay this soil ?nitrogen bank.? Early in succession, the rate of N accumulation in plants regularly exceeds the N supply from atmospheric deposition, indicating that plants likely extract N from soil.

Consequently, successional patterns of stream N loss should lag those of plant biomass accumulation.</p> <p>This portion of this collaborative project characterized how soil microbial processes involved in soil N acquisition (decomposition enzyme activities and gross N cycling rates) varied with each other, soil depth, and stand age (40 and 100 years and old-growth). We also measured how rates of plant N accumulation decrease with stand age, and we characterized how plant (leaf, bark, wood) and soil N stocks (to 50 cm depth) and isotopic (d<sup>15</sup>N) composition varied across an eight-site chronosequence (two sites x four ages:&nbsp; 20-, 40- and 100-years post-harvest, old-growth) at and near the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire.

We suggest that gross N cycling measurements capture mostly the N released during microbial N recycling rather than from decomposition of complex organic matter. Microbial processes differed little across the three sites, but the youngest had the lowest ratio of C- to N-acquiring enzyme activity, consistent with greater N demands in younger stands. At all three stands, subsoils below 10 cm contributed 30-53% of all N cycling to 50 cm.

We also measured how rates of plant N accumulation decrease with stand age, and we characterized how plant (leaf, bark, wood) and soil N stocks (to 50 cm depth) and isotopic (d15N) composition varied across an eight-site chronosequence (two sites x four ages:  20-, 40- and 100-years post-harvest, old-growth) at and near the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. In addition, we supported field experiments using stable isotopic tracers (15N-NO3 and 15N- and 13C-labelled litter) to track the retention of inorganic and organic N in mineral soils along the chronosequence.  Our measurements of soil microbial processes showed that N cycling rates and enzyme activities per gram soil correlated strongly with soil carbon (C) concentration, which decreased exponentially with depth.
