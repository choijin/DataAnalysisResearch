<AbstractNarration>Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient whose availability can limit primary production and the capacity of the biological pump to export carbon from the surface ocean on seasonal, annual, decadal, and millennial timescales. The inventory of fixed (bioavailable) N in the ocean is driven by biological processes such as nitrogen fixation, denitrification, and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox). Water column oxygen deficient zones (ODZs) are important sites for fixed N loss, as well as N2O production, and they are projected to expand and intensify in the coming years as global warming increases ocean stratification and decreases ventilation. It is important to understand the distribution of nitrate, nitrite, and N2O isotopes in relation to current ocean conditions of oxygen and trace element availability order to interpret past and future changes in nitrate Ã¤15N signals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a team of researchers from Stanford University, University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, and Brown University will measure the nitrogen- and oxygen-isotopic composition (del15N and del18O) of nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide in seawater samples collected along the GEOTRACES Pacific Peru-Tahiti Section. Values of del15N and del18O will also be measured in nitrate from aerosol and rain samples to inform our interpretation of the N isotope budget and isotopic gradients within the tropical South Pacific. Finally, N2/Ar and N2 del15N will be determined to close the N mass and isotope budgets. Nitrate del15N is a GEOTRACES "core parameter" that will complement other measurements, such as bioactive trace element concentrations and speciation, Si isotope variations, as well as redox and productivity proxies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEOTRACES Peru-Tahiti section provides a rare opportunity to track the fate of the isotopic signals of N loss from one of the largest water column ODZs. Furthermore, little is known about the effect of N recycling through hydrothermal vents on nitrate isotopes in the deep ocean, and this section will allow quantitative tracking of this input. Together, these measurements will yield insight into the relative rates of modern N cycle processes and will provide background information for paleoceanographic applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  This project will provide a high-quality nitrate isotope data set from undersampled parts of the South Pacific for use by the broader oceanographic community via BCO-DMO.  Educational impacts include the mentoring of a graduate, undergraduate, and high school students at Stanford, and the inclusion of undergraduates in state-of-the-art collaborative research at Brown and UMass-Dartmouth. The project will also support development and implementation of an oceans component for the annual 6th grade teacher workshop offered by Stanford University's School of Earth. This program includes both instruction for the teachers on cutting-edge research in Earth Science and Oceanography, and support for them to include the material into their classroom activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient whose availability in the ocean often limits biological production and its capacity to pump carbon from the surface for sequestration at depth. This nitrogen control on the oceanÃs biological pump thus also influences atmospheric CO2 concentration.  The oceanÃs inventory of bioavailable N in the ocean (mostly in the form of nitrate; NO3-) is uniquely driven by biological processes such as nitrogen fixation (which creates bioavailable N from unavailable N2 gas) and denitrification and anammox, which convert bioavailable N back into unavailable gaseous forms (N2O and N2). Oxygen deficient zones (ODZs) are important sites in the ocean for bioavailable N loss (up to half of global total), as well as N2O (a greenhouse gas) emission to the atmosphere, and they are projected to expand and intensify in the coming years as global warming increases ocean stratification and decreases O2 renewal rates. It is important to understand the current distribution of relevant chemical forms of nitrogen and their isotopic composition and how these signals are spread from the ODZ out to the greater South Pacific Basin in order better constrain the operation of these N transformation processes at present and into the future.     The stable isotope signals of nitrate in ODZs are some of the highest values observed anywhere in the global ocean, as a result of isotopic fractionation during nitrate consumption. These regions have far-reaching impacts on the mean isotopic composition of deep ocean nitrate. How these signals are transmitted and modified after leaving the ODZ is poorly understood.

For UMD's portion of the project, the major field activity was first collection of samples for biogenic N2 and N2 isotope analysis along the Pacific GeoTraces transect.  The major shore-based activity was analysis of these samples in the laboratory.  So far we have been able to infer from these data that     1)    The slope of N deficit versus  biogenic N2  (x2) is slightly less than 1 (Fig. 3),  suggesting that nitrogen to phosphorous (N:P) remineralization ratios may be less than the canonical 16:1 in ODZ waters.  Previous studies have suggested organic matter remineralized in the ETSP ODZ may be similar to but slightly less than the canonical Redfield ratio.  2)    Estimates of the N:P of remineralized organic matter in the middle and lower ODZ (sigma theta density surfaces 26.4 to 26.8) may increase slightly away from the ODZ,  As the N:P of phytoplankton can vary, longitudinal gradie...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
