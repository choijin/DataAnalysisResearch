<AbstractNarration>This project will examine the influence of particle size on atmospheric reactions of iron and, in turn, the influence of particle size on iron solubility. In particular, how particle size affects iron solubility during atmospheric processing by two different mechanisms will be investigated. First, the effect of particle size on iron solubility during photoreduction of iron in cloud waters will be determined. Photochemical reduction of aqueous iron has been well studied in authentic and simulated cloud waters, however, particle size has never been considered as a variable but may be important because only a restricted aerosol size fraction can form cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Previous laboratory studies focusing on particles too big or too small to act as CCN may under- or overestimate the soluble iron resulting from photochemistry in real atmospheric systems. Second, the influence of particle size on iron solubility during reaction with gaseous sulfur dioxide will be investigated. Exposure of iron phases mixed with sodium chloride will be studied at two relative humidities (20% and 80%) representative of dry continental and wet marine environments, respectively. This will allow determination of whether gas-particle or liquid-particle reactions are more important during iron-sulfur interactions. Following exposure to sulfur dioxide, the iron isotope composition of the dissolved iron fraction will be determined and used to elucidate mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be a valuable contribution to understanding iron solubility in continental and marine aerosols. The results will be relevant to the broader question of how atmospheric iron affects ocean productivity and, hence, its relation to the global carbon cycle. Iron is a limiting nutrient in many parts of the open ocean and substantial effort has been put forth to determine the availability of iron in atmospheric particulate matter to marine life. This study will also advance the training of the next generation of atmospheric scientists. The project will fund one Ph.D. student at Arizona State University (ASU), with this research being the core of his/her thesis work. In addition, one undergraduate student each year from Northern Arizona University (NAU) will work with the principal investigators and the Ph.D. student at ASU. The Department of Chemistry at NAU is a non-Ph.D. granting department. Therefore, collaboration with ASU researchers will provide undergraduate students at NAU training in research approaches and techniques that are not normally possible at NAU. Furthermore, NAU is among the national leaders in granting degrees to Native American students. These unique demographics will be drawn upon to recruit environmentally-focused Native American undergraduates through the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals at NAU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award was originally made to the principal investigator at Northern Arizona University under award 0963987 but was transferred to the University of Denver in 2011.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Atmospheric iron is a nutrient to algae in the open ocean and also results in inflammation of the lungs when it is inhaled.  Ambient, airborne particles are on the order of 3-4 % iron, by mass.  The extent that this iron can act as a nutrient to oceanic life depends on how the iron is chemically bonded in the particle.  About 95% of all iron in the atmosphere is a result of wind-blown surface soils in arid and desert regions. The iron present in this "windblown dust" is quite stable, chemically, and is not readily soluble in water (0.02-2.0 % water soluble).  As a result, researchers think that the iron in this dust (and, thus, the bulk of all airborne Fe) is not readily available for use by marine organisms.  Conversely, iron-containing particles from combustion sources such as motor vehicles have been found to contain up to 70% soluble iron.  Although human-derived activities only directly account for 5% of the total iron pool, the soluble iron resulting from human activies may be on the order of 30-50%.       In this study, we explored the chemical changes of iron as it makes it way through the atmosphere.  Particularly, we were interested in iron solubility changes.  We investigated the chemical reactions that iron participates in when it is entrained in clouds and, also, chemical reactions of iron with gases prevalent in urban atmospheres, such as sulfur dioxide.  Our results indicate that particle size and mineralogy are more important predictors of iron solubility than is interaction with urban gases.  Specifically, smaller particles have a much greater iron solubility than larger particles.  The fact that interaction with urban gases did not appear to be important raises other intriguing possibilities of the observed soluble iron sources.  Soluble iron may be co-emitted with other combustion markers or, perhaps, iron solubility may be affected by other, unexplored chemical components of the airborne particles.   Broader Impacts:  As part of this study, the project team participated in the STEMosphere event.  This event hosted exhibitors such as the Denver Museum of Natural Science and other local/regional entities.  During this event, our booth, entitled "Clouds Among Us," served ~ 3,500 child and adult learners.  At our hands-on DU exhibit, our visitors made clouds using water and dry ice while our team worked one-on-one to help people understand why clouds form and what they are made of.  In addition to this large event, our group has participated in several smaller library programs, which are designed to help teach chemistry to the general public.
