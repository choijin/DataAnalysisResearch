<AbstractNarration>The Transylvania University (TU) STEM Scholars Program provides four years of support to two cohorts of freshmen entering in successive years, with up to 15 students comprising each cohort.  Participants in the TU STEM Scholars Program are recruited from students who are intended majors in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics, neuroscience or environmental science.  In addition to the financial support from the S-STEM scholarships, program activities to recruit and retain students include personalized mentoring and advising by STEM faculty members, workshops on quantitative reasoning and learning habits, scientific lectures, a science and math journal club, summer research experiences, and presentations on STEM career opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Through the various cohort-building activities and other support mechanisms provided the students selected to participate in the TU STEM Scholars Program, this project contributes to the knowledge base of effective recruitment and retention strategies for undergraduate STEM students.  The fusion of existing TU student services with those developed through this project provides a model for other similar institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The S-STEM scholarships allow students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds to pursue an education as a major in a STEM discipline at a private liberal arts university.  More than one-third of recent incoming students to Transylvania are first generation college students.  Thus, the TU STEM Scholars Program is broadening participation to individuals who otherwise may not have had opportunities to become STEM professionals.</AbstractNarration>
