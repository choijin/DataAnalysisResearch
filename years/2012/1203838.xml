<AbstractNarration>Large-scale atmospheric circulation systems affect the geographic distribution of precipitation in western North America, yet little is known about how these systems may have varied before the instrumental period of the last 150 years.  The main goal of this project is to reconstruct the history of precipitation in Alaska during the last thousand years using ice core records of snow accumulation.  The researchers plan to collect several new ice cores from the Mt. Hunter Plateau in the Alaska Range of Denali National Park and the new ice cores will be combined with an existing spatial array of ice cores in the region to map changes in the spatial patterns of precipitation.  Because changes in atmospheric circulation patterns caused by ENSO and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) affect where the precipitation falls, this spatial array of ice cores will provide a record of how these larger scale climate systems have varied during the last thousand years.  The project will focus on determining the differences in the precipitation patterns at the Little Ice Age (approximately 200 to 600 years ago) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (approximately 800 to 1,200 years ago).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will evaluate how changes in the climate state affect atmospheric circulation and precipitation.  In addition the project includes K-12, undergraduate and graduate education activities, and, in conjunction with the National Park Service, the development of an interactive display showing the climate history of the region and the history of glacier advance and retreat in Denali National Park.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this collaborative project was to reconstruct precipitation and atmospheric circulation changes in Central Alaska over the past 1000 years.  This is a critical time                                                                                                                                                   in Earth?s history, which encompasses at least three significant climate intervals &ndash; the Medieval Climate Anomaly, the Little Ice Age, and the onset of the industrial revolution and human impacts on the Earth System.  Our approach was to use a combination of ice cores drilled on the Mt. Hunter plateau (13,000 feet elevation) inside Denali National Park, extensive geophysical and glaciological measurements, and detailed analysis of meteorological and climatological information.  The two surface-to-bedrock ice cores recovered in 2013 represent the first such data in this region, and were subject to a range of geochemical, physical, and modeling analysis.  Using these data, we derived a record of annual snow accumulation at the site going back over 1000 years.  The results show an increasing trend in snow accumulation beginning in the mid-1800s, which continues through the 20th century.  These changes in snow accumulation appear to be unprecedented in the last 1000 years.  We also measured the stable isotopic composition of water in over 8000 samples in the ice cores, which provide additional information on changes in the regional hydrologic cycle.  In each sample, we measured the stable isotopic composition of both oxygen and hydrogen, and from those data calculated a parameter known as deuterium excess.  There is a long history in the ice core community of using deuterium excess to interpret climatic conditions in the moisture source region &ndash; that is, the ocean area where evaporation takes place, and provides moisture that eventually forms snow falling on the glacier.  In the Mt. Hunter ice cores, the deuterium excess data have a large decreasing trend from the mid 1850s to today.  Like in the accumulation rate record, the change in deuterium excess over the past ~150 years is anomalous with respect to the last 1000 years.  In fact, the timing of changes in accumulation rate and deuterium excess are quite similar, and when taken together suggest that fairly large changes in regional hydroclimate occurred starting at roughly the beginning of the industrial revolution.  We suspect that connections between climate changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean and the higher latitude North Pacific region during this time interval are involved.  Our ongoing work with meteorological data products in conjunction with the ice core datasets will reveal further details.        The broader impacts of the project relate to several educational and outreach activities we completed.  To make the project a reality, we established and continue to maintain a close working relationship with Denali National Park, including scientific staff and rangers.  As part of this relationship, we routinely interact with a large number of park visitors through informal contact and organized lectures and science caf&eacute; events.  During the drilling season in 2013, we participated in a large PolarTREC project that embedded a Maine middle school science teacher with our field team.  During the field season, we maintained an expedition blog and participated in several live call events.  In 2014, we hosted a pair of journalists during our field season, and helped them collect a wide range of media products related to our project.  They (Kate Tobin and Miles O?Brien) produced a series of multimedia stories that were broadcast on NSF Science360, the Weather Channel, and on national television (PBS Newshour).  We followed up on this by making all of our meteorological and climatological data products available to the public on a user-friendly and widely used platform known as the Climate Reanalyer (http://cci-reanalyzer.org).  Finally, we had several graduate and undergraduate students supported on the project.  One example is Dr. Seth Campbell, who obtained his PhD at UMaine developing ground penetrating radar, GPS, and ice flow modeling products that were critical to the project.  Dr. Campbell took a full-time research scientist position at the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory after completing his PhD, and recently left CRREL for a postdoctoral position at the University of Washington.  Another example is Abagail Bradford, who completed her senior thesis after joining us in the field during 2014.  Abi was featured in all of the national broadcasts, and was an excellent role model for subsequent undergraduates who are following in her footsteps.
