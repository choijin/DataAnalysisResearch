<AbstractNarration>In addition to its presence in filarial nematode worms and several non-insect arthropods, the bacterium Wolbachia infects more than one million insect species, or about two-thirds of all described insect taxa; by virtue of its widespread distribution alone, it is the most common intracellular bacterium on earth. Wolbachia also has profound ecological and evolutionary effects on the reproduction of its animal hosts, as well as other important biological consequences. The primary means of transmission of Wolbachia from host to host is vertical (hereditary) transmission, through passage from the adult female host ovary to the offspring via the egg; there is also evidence of horizontal (non-hereditary) transmission of Wolbachia among hosts. Given the biological importance of this symbiotic bacterium, both for basic research and for its applied potential in insect control, it is remarkable that so little is known about the mechanism by which Wolbachia infects insect host cells. The aim of this project is to elucidate this mechanism.  In earlier research, the investigator has shown that Wolbachia targets specific cell types in the insect ovary, particularly the cellular environment supporting the stem cells (aka stem cell niche) of insect ovaries during both horizontal and vertical transmission. Bringing a suite of novel imaging and molecular tools to bear on the problem, the investigator now plans to characterize the detailed mechanism by which this targeting (tropism) of stem-cell-niches occurs. In addition to its strong importance for understanding the biology of Wolbachia and the dynamics of hereditarily-transmitted symbioses in general, this project also will contribute fresh perspectives on the biology of stem cells. The project includes research training and education on stem-cell and symbiosis biology for students from high-school through graduate levels, including outreach workshops specifically targeted to high-school girls and students from under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since their origin, animal cells have had an intimate relationship with bacterial cells, as demonstrated by the mitochondria. Mitochondria are derived from symbiotic bacteria that invaded the precursors of the animal cells. In nature, symbiotic bacteria are ubiquitous in animal hosts. Wolbachia are intracellular symbiotic bacteria that are maternally transmitted, the same way we inherited our mitochondria from our mothers. They represent one of the most extensive pandemics in the recent history of life in this planet, infecting a significant fraction of insects and worms. The tissues or cells preferentially infected by a microbe, known as tropism, is an essential aspect of microbial-host interactions. The tissues infected can determines the successful establishment and transmission of the microbe. Wolbachia are transmitted maternally through infected eggs and can also move horizontally across species boundaries. The broad aim of this proposal was to identify the host tissues preferentially infected by Wolbachiaand the cellular ? molecular mechanisms required for bacteria maintenance and transmission.   The main findings are:  1) tropism for stem cell niches is a general mechanism of Wolbachia transmission and is evolutionary conserved  2) factors encoded by the Wolbachia genome determine differences between the types of stem cell niches that are infected.  3) In addition to stem cell niches, Wolbachia display tropism for several somatic cell types, including polar cells, the hub cells, and the gut epithelium.  4) Wolbachia tropism in the gut epithelium affect the composition of the gut microbiome.  5) In polar cells, Wolbachia tropism, or intracellular accumulation, is coordinated with the differentiation of progenitor cells into polar cells.  6) Wnt signaling pathway modulates Wolbachia tropism in gonadal stem cell niches, germline and polar cells.  7) Upregulating Wnt signaling using small molecule agonists is sufficient to drive high Wolbachia density in Drosophila, Aedes aegypti, and Aedes albopictus cell lines suggesting a novel application of our findings.  Wolbachia are emerging as a novel method to prevent vector transmitted diseases including Dengue and Zika. Although currently there are several releases of mosquitoes infected with these bacteria around the globe, our understanding of the mechanisms at the interface of Wolbachia with their hosts are poorly understood. There is no consensus on why Wolbachia suppress human pathogens, but bacterial density usually correlates with more effective suppression of Dengue and Zika. Beyond insights in to the mechanisms of Wolbachiat ropism for specific cell types, this work also provides innovative ways to control Wolbachia levels and promote viral blockage in non-model insects with relevance in public health.
