<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technological development is paced by the creation and putting into service of materials that are ever-more capable of withstanding extreme conditions, such as high stress, temperature, radiation and long-term service. This Gordon Research Conference on Physical Metallurgy provides a forum for the presentation of cutting-edge experimental and modeling research on materials at extremes, such materials with ultra-high strengths relative to their ideal strengths and materials that can operate at high temperatures relative to their melting points. Understanding the effects of extremes in the physical size-scale and microstructure is critical to advancing the performance of materials under demanding conditions. Presentations will describe developments in state-of-the-art experimental techniques for evaluating material behavior and microstructure, and complementary computational and modeling efforts aimed at fundamental understanding of materials under these extreme conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technological development is paced by the creation and putting into service of materials that are ever-more capable of withstanding extreme conditions, such as high stress, temperature, radiation and long-term service.

In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.          Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
