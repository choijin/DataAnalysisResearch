<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: Life requires the production and use of proteins.  Proteins are polymers of amino acids, and the amino acid sequence of a protein is encoded in a gene.  To translate the genetic message into the proper amino acid sequence requires the presence of adaptor molecules, aminoacyl-transfer RNAs, in a cell.  Twenty amino acids are commonly used in proteins.  Each of the twenty amino acids has a corresponding pool of transfer RNAs (tRNAs).  For an amino acid to be used in translation, it must be attached to its corresponding tRNA.  For the amino acid asparagine, nature has evolved two distinct pathways for forming asparaginyl-tRNA used in protein synthesis.  In the first pathway, asparagine is directly attached to the tRNA.  In the second pathway, asparagine is synthesized on the tRNA itself. Computational analyses predict that Staphylococcus aureus and Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus each encode both pathways in their genomes. These studies will combine biochemical and molecular genetic techniques to verify that both pathways are used in these two bacteria, and to determine how dual routes for asparaginyl-tRNA formation are integrated into the life cycles of these bacteria.  The research will provide insight into the evolution of asparaginyl-tRNA synthesis and the physiology of S. aureus and B. bacteriovorus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The project will provide three undergraduates each summer and academic year the opportunity to take part in scientific research that challenges them to synthesize biochemical data with bioinformatics and molecular genetics.  The work will therefore provide them a strong foundation for success in graduate or professional school in the biomolecular sciences.  The principal investigator will work closely with Skidmore's S3M and Schupf programs to recruit students from underrepresented groups. The project will also allow development of an experimental biochemistry laboratory course at Skidmore enabling additional undergraduates to take part in research.  To expand scientific literacy and retain more women from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines, the principal investigator and Skidmore undergraduates will meet with and mentor students from the Brighter Choice All-Girls Middle School in Albany, NY.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, we determined that Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus halodurans, Legionella pneumophila, and Borrelia burgdorferi also encode both routes for forming asparaginyl-tRNA in contrast to previous predictions.  The results may explain how these species have adapted to survive a range of environments.  We also identified with collaborators that the insertion domain specific to bacterial aspartyl-tRNA synthetases may enable a dynamic complex with GatCAB to allow the latter enzyme to be used for other purposes in the cell besides asparaginyl-tRNA synthesis.  Our phylogentic studies revealed that discriminating forms of bacterial aspartyl-tRNA synthetases is likely a case of convergent evolution, which would explain the challenge in designing experiments to switch the tRNA specificity of a bacterial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase.  The results were published in four peer-reviewed research articles and presented twenty times at regional and national scientific meetings.  The strains generated are available for the wider scientific community to use.  Sixteen different undergraduates were actively engaged in the research both during the academic years and summers, a high impact learning experience for each.  In addition, a project based advanced biochemistry laboratory course was developed at Skidmore enabling an additional nine students to be involved in the work as well as additional students in subsequent semesters.  Twelve different undergraduate students were co-authors on the research articles published on the studies.  In addition, fourteen middle school students from the Brighter Choice Charter Middle School for Girls in Albany, NY visited Skidmore College along with two teachers and one administrator to learn chemistry in a hands-on manner.  In addition, the students learned about how to get into college and how to be involved in science.            Last Modified: 11/30/2016       Submitted by: Kelly Sheppard]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
