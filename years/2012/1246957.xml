<AbstractNarration>The College Board, in collaboration with Duke University and Middlebury College, proposes to extend the developmental work accomplished during the NSF-supported project "Using Computational Thinking to Model a New Course:  Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP I; NSF award #0938336)."  That effort led to the design of a new introductory computing course -- Computer Science Principles (CSP) -- that aims to reach a broad, diverse audience of high school students with rich computer science content and exciting pedagogy, while meeting the rigor and high standards of the AP program.  AP CSP will enable students to explore the creative aspects of the field and will provide a solid academic foundation for understanding the deep intellectual and practical contributions of computing.  This follow-on project -- Advanced Placement® Computer Science Principles Phase II (AP® CSP II) -- will extend that developmental work by completing all tasks required for deployment of the AP CSP exam during academic year 2016-17.  To meet the goal of this project and to support the CS 10K initiative's interest in developing assessments and models of delivery, teacher professional development, and AP support materials, the AP CSP II project will (1) complete the assessment design to support the learning objectives of the AP CSP Curriculum Framework, pilot implementation, and scoring of the computer-based exam, and (2) conduct formative and summative evaluation of AP CSP II activities, with a focus on determining the extent to which the assessment tasks measure the learning objectives and whether the course and various assessments foster participation and success in computer science education, especially among students traditionally underrepresented in computer science.</AbstractNarration>

Longer-term, the aim is for AP CSP to enable students access to computing and computational thinking education and prepare thousands of additional students -- especially those underrepresented in computing -- for careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.   AP CSP launched in 2016-17 and in 2019-20 is in its fourth operational year. In 2018-19, there were over 5,000 teachers authorized to teach the course across over 4,800 institutions worldwide. As of 2018-19, the College Board has endorsed 12 education organizations that offer preapproved syllabi, curricula, and professional development, helping to quickly drive up adoption by teachers of all backgrounds.    Collaborative Research Award # 1246957 to Middlebury College partially supported work and travel for Professor Amy Briggs as a computer science content expert to the College Board.    Outcomes of the Award:    CSP has significantly increased the number of students exposed to computer science. Since the course launched in 2016-17, by 2018-19  Overall student participation more than doubled, Female participation increased 136%, Hispanic/Latino participation increased 125%, Black/African American participation increased 121%, and Nearly 6,000 schools offered AP CSP worldwide.      Teachers and students have benefitted from the following grant-funded resources:  Two full practice exams accessible via the AP Course Audit: https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-course-audit Two Teaching and Assessing online modules accessible via AP Central: https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/professional-development/online-pd/teaching-modules 301 Teachers across the U.S. participated in the AP CSP Teacher Summit at Facebook headquarters in the summer of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Recordings of experienced CSP teachers offering strategies for novice teachers from the 2018 and 2019 AP CSP Teacher Summit, accessible via the AP Teacher Community: https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/professional-development/ap-teacher-community      For 2018-19, the College Board recognized 639 schools across the country with the AP Computer Science Female Diversity award for attaining at least 50% or higher female representation in AP CSP. An additional 36 schools received the award for both AP CSP and AP CSA.     Finally, this grant enabled creation of a solution to address the teacher pipeline problem: The College Board has endorsed innovative curricula that come with preapproved syllabi, lesson plans, and formative assessments, delivered by expert education organizations. These out-of-the box solutions include professional development to prepare teachers, whether experienced or new to computer science, to teach the AP Computer Science Principles course.
