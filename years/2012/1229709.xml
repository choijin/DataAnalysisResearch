<AbstractNarration>Science and engineering researchers across many disciplines have access to increasing amounts of computing power and research data available to support their work. State of the art cyberinfrastructure resources are needed to tackle large computational problems and make massive data accessible to promote superior analysis.  This proposal plans for a 32- node GPU/CPU cluster with a storage array and a 5Ã—8 foot tiled display to be located in a visualization theater setting. The equipment will support parallel computing and rendering, data storage, and high resolution imaging as researchers complete externally funded work. In addition, the instrument will be housed at a facility open to both university researchers as well as to local technology companies and partners, and provide partners with cyberinfrastructure access as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrument will support research in multi-scale wind energy forecasting, data-driven modeling for threat reduction in chemical and biological defense, material characterization and modeling, snow hydrology and remote sensing, and fundamental studies on understanding the mechanisms in skeleton development in living systems and how living systems maintain complex three dimensional shapes. Boise State University is recognized as a CUDA Research Center for embracing GPU computing use across multiple research fields. The center?s goal is to develop and apply advanced numerical methods and computational algorithms to science and engineering, where rapid and real-time computations can transform current practice. This instrument would substantially increase computing power and play a key role in advancing research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will directly support Boise State's strategic goal to emerge as a metropolitan research university of distinction. exposure to cutting edge cyberinfrastructure and research can not only benefit researchers, but may also have profound effects on regional students who might otherwise never gain exposure. Faculty will also use the instrument to support externally funded education activities.</AbstractNarration>
