<AbstractNarration>Elevated convection, in which thunderstorms draw on their energy from instability focused well above the earth's surface, is impactful in terms of its capacity to produce heavy precipitation yet often poorly forecast.  Such events are particularly common during the warm season over the mid-Mississippi basin, in close proximity to the principal investigator's home institution.  The primary objective of this effort is direct observation of the upper atmosphere prior to, during and after episodes of elevated convection through analysis of special serial radiosonde observations and other means.  Radar observations will be exploited to describe storm life cycles, while a variety of observations (both routine and specially collected) will be analyzed and ultimately assimilated by simulations using the WRF (Weather Research and Forecast) community model to further explore and describe processes responsible for creating environments conducive to outbreaks of elevated convection.  Comparative examination of resulting successful and unsuccessful forecasts (including hit, miss, and null events) will serve to more clearly identify sources of forecast error and required improvements, with an emphasis on heavy rainfall and snowfall events.  Broader impacts will include uniquely detailed observations of a variety of high-impact precipitation events and direct interface with the forecasting community.  Both undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in a wide array of data collection and analysis activities, and result will be integrated across an array of university courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, flash flooding is the #1 cause of thunderstorm fatalities in the United States.  The Program for Research on Elevated Convection with Intense Precipitation (PRECIP) at the University of Missouri, was designed to examine flash flood events that occur with thunderstorms that appear to occur in environments that will support only weak thunderstorm activity.  These thunderstorms are called 'elevated thunderstorms' or 'elevated convection.'       PRECIP's approach to the problem of flash flooding from elevated convection had three components:  observations, forecasts, and modeling.  For observations, instrumented weather balloons were released, usually near a National Weather Service Doppler radar site, in order to gather high resolution data, in both time and space, on the atmosphere that gave rise to these elevated thunderstorms.  Next, weather forecasts were also created daily in the warm season in order to get our equipment in the right place at the right time to observe elevated convection.  Lastly, sophisticated computer models were used to understand the elevated thunderstorm environment in ways that observations alone did not permit.       Along the way, we developed tools to better predict these elevated thunderstorms, determined a method of estimating whether severe weather would occur along with heavy rains, discovered why some events last longer than others, and even determined that the historic flooding rains in south Carolina in October 2015 were far less the result of Hurricane Joaquin than were first speculated.       So far, the PRECIP work has supported 5 graduate students and 13 undergraduate students, produced 17 conference posters/presentations, and 5 refereed journal articles; the PRECIP website contains much more detail.
