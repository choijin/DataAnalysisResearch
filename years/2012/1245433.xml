<AbstractNarration>This project is providing open-source tools for converting LaTeX documents into interactive course materials.  For students, who are now surrounded by interactive media, such materials are increasing demand for active learning and are leading to gains in educational outcomes.  For researchers, the platform is providing quantitative data addressing the ongoing debate between pure and guided discovery and the debate over the effectiveness of inquiry-based and constructivist pedagogy. Since many STEM researchers and STEM educators  are comfortable with using the near-ubiquitous markup language LaTeX, this project is making it possible for these content experts to broadly disseminate their scientific understanding and engaging course materials in a compelling and interactive way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is enhancing the infrastructure for research and education.  For example, using the platform, a researcher is able to measure exactly how much time and in what way a student engages with the various components of an interactive activity.  From this data, the researcher is gaining insight into student learning, while the content author is receiving valuable feedback about what activities are particularly effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is being evaluated from the point-of-view of an industrial or UX (user experience) designer, addressing questions of author and student experience.  The resulting content authoring tools are available as open-source software on the web.  To ensure broad dissemination and to increase user expertise, a five-day workshop is providing training to content authors.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Ximera is a free and open-source platform for creating and sharing interactive online course materials.&nbsp; This grant provided resources for the investigators to create the Ximera platform, as well as to create free open-source interactive textbooks, including a year-long calculus sequence. These textbooks were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the platform.&nbsp; Open licenses on both the backend technology and the textbooks promote broad dissemination and reuse.<br /><br />A primary goal (and broader impact) of Ximera is to improve student success in mathematics courses by creating compelling online learning experiences which weave together the exposition from a traditional textbook with interactive, computer-graded homework exercises.&nbsp; Besides addressing student success, Ximera also addresses college and textbook affordability: students in classes using Ximera no longer have to purchase an expensive commercial textbook because Ximera provides a free open-source (PDF) textbook, an open-source homework system, and an interactive online textbook.&nbsp; Already thousands of dollars have been saved by students using Ximera-based texts at multiple institutions.<br /><br />Ximera also benefits instructors: Ximera makes it much easier for authors to create interactive online content for their students, and by hosting the source files on GitHub, Ximera encourages instructors and authors to collaborate on the development of engaging online activities.&nbsp; This is important because, as technology advances, there is concern it will become too difficult for the average person to create new digital content.&nbsp; Collaborating on the creation of a complicated interactive textbook also poses a challenge.&nbsp; With Ximera, an instructor who knows a standard markup language (LaTeX) can rapidly and collaboratively develop interactive online materials.&nbsp; By reducing the learning curve for developing online content and by making it easier to share source files, Ximera democratizes the creation of interactive online content.&nbsp; Educators and researchers have collaborated to use and improve the Ximera platform through three summer workshops funded by the grant. These workshops provided professional development for instructors interested in using Ximera in their classroom, trained authors to produce interactive online textbooks, and organized software developers who extended the capabilities of Ximera.&nbsp; During the academic year, undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs also contributed content.&nbsp; During the span of the project, 18 talks and presentations about Ximera were given.<br /><br />Finally, Ximera provides educators and researchers with quantitative data on student performance and involvement.&nbsp; Unlike a traditional print textbook, with Ximera it is possible to measure how much time a student spends with the textbook, and record each interaction the student makes with the integrated homework problems.&nbsp; These events are recorded in a learning record store, which can be mined for insights into how students learn mathematics.&nbsp; For instance, the investigators observed a positive correlation between usage of Ximera and scores on the traditional in-class exams.&nbsp; The investigators developed and deployed, using Ximera, a large bank of conceptual calculus items and analyzed the items with item response theory.&nbsp; During the final year of the grant, the investigators ran a experiment to assess the effectiveness of the open-source textbooks deployed on the Ximera platform.&nbsp; Students chose a section of calculus without knowing whether or not their section would use the open-source calculus text developed under this grant, or a commercial textbook and its associated online homework system.&nbsp; The experiment was structured as a non-inferiority study.&nbsp; Exam scores and final course grades in the sections using Ximera were similar to those using the closed-source textbook.&nbsp; But by various affective measures, the students using Ximera had more positive outcomes.&nbsp; For instance, the students using the Ximera-based textbook were more likely to report that the textbook was "readable" as compared to the students using the closed-source textbook.&nbsp; Before and after the course, students were asked about their confidence in their mathematical abilities and their enjoyment doing mathematics; there is weak evidence that students using the open-source textbook were more likely (as compared to students using the closed-source textbook) to express, after the course, the same level or a stronger level of mathematical enjoyment and confidence as compared to the beginning of the course.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2016<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fowler</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1245433/1245433_10272664_1480525911253_ximera1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1245433/1245433_10272664_1480525911253_ximera1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Interactive graphics"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1245433/1245433_10272664_1480525911253_ximera1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Interactive graphics"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The free textbooks created in Ximera can include interactive graphics alongside mathematics questions.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ximera</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">James&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fowler</div> <div class="imageTitle">Interactive graphics</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1245433/1245433_10272664_1480525992543_ximera2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1245433/1245433_10272664_1480525992543_ximera2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Embedded videos"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1245433/1245433_10272664_1480525992543_ximera2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Embedded videos"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ximera makes it easy for authors to embed YouTube videos into a LaTeX document, alongside  freeform text boxes in which students can write longer answers.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ximera</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">James&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fowler</div> <div class="imageTitle">Embedded videos</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1245433/1245433_10272664_1480526177002_mobile--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1245433/1245433_10272664_1480526177002_mobile--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ximera works on mobile phones"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1245433/1245433_10272664_1480526177002_mobile--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ximera works on mobile phones"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Unlike many online homework systems, the interactive textbooks built on Ximera can be used by students on their mobile devices.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jim Fowler</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">James&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fowler</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ximera works on mobile phones</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1245433/1245433_10272664_1480526442438_ximera-math-answer--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1245433/1245433_10272664_1480526442438_ximera-math-answer--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Instant feedback on student answers"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1245433/1245433_10272664_1480526442438_ximera-math-answer--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Instant feedback on student answers"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ximera permits students to input mathematical expressions using a reasonable syntax, and then displays in real-time what it believes the student means.
