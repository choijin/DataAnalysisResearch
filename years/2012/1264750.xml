<AbstractNarration>1264997/1264750&lt;br/&gt;Yang/Liu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to develop a new class of nanoparticle sensors based on ultrahigh quality factor (Q) optical micro-resonators on a silicon wafer to achieve not only ultra-sensitive detection but also molecule-specific identification and measurement of nanoparticles and molecules in air and in liquid environments at single particle resolution. The merit of this new technique lies in enhancing Raman and Rayleigh scattering and integrating them in an ultrahigh-Q Whispering Gallery mode (WGM) micro resonator to achieve multi-function sensors. On one hand, Rayleigh scattering in resonators leads to self-referencing mode-splitting, which can be utilized to detect and measure nanoparticles (e.g., size) down to several nm in size. On the other hand, Raman scattering, which is greatly enhanced by several orders of magnitude in an ultrahigh-Q microresonator, provides identification of molecules/particles through recognition of their spectral fingerprints of molecular vibrations. By integrating mode-splitting and microresonator-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, they can achieve a multifunction sensing unit capable of ultra-sensitive real-time, in-situ detection, identification and measurement of single nanoparticles.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Whispering gallery mode (WGM) microresonators have emerged in recent years as extremely sensitive and yet compact sensors, with applications in medical diagnosis, environmental monitoring, and security. Two major advantages of the WGM microresonators are their high quality factor (Q) and small mode volume. High Q factor allows the confinement of light for an extended period of time, whereas small mode volume allows the optical field to be concentrated at the analyte of interest. As a result, light-matter interaction is greatly enhanced in WGM microresonators, leading to sensitive detection of small particles and molecules, such as gold, polystyrene, hemozoin, and Influenza A virus nanoparticles. Yet, existing WGM sensing methods usually rely on interrogating the polarizability of the particles. Hence, although it is possible to detect the presence of particles and to measure the sizes of the particles (with <em>a priori</em> knowledge of the particle&rsquo;s refractive index), it is challenging to determine the material composition of the particles only from measurements based on perturbation of WGM modes due to particle polarizability, such as mode splitting and resonant frequency shift.</p> <p>In this collaborative program, researchers from the Washington University and the Pennsylvania State University have developed a hybrid approach by combining WGM sensing with Raman scattering spectroscopy. Raman scattering is inelastic scattering of light from molecules, with each peak in the Raman scattering spectrum corresponding to a particular vibrational mode of the molecules. Raman spectrum provides the &ldquo;spectral fingerprint&rdquo; of the probed molecule, and is a well-established technique for material characterization. When combined with high-Q WGM microresonators, the two techniques complement each other. Raman spectroscopy provides the material composition information that is missing from WGM resonance measurement alone. It is also worth noting that WGM resonance enhanced Raman signals have been demonstrated in this collaborative research.</p> <p>A schematic of the experimental systems developed at Washington University and Penn State is shown in the supplementary figure 1. The researchers have demonstrated that Rayleigh and Raman scattering enhances the particle sensing capabilities in WGM microresonators. By adhering particles with the size in the range of 400 nm to 2&mu;m to a high-Q microresonator, mode-splitting spectrum and Raman spectrum were acquired from the device, demonstrating that microresonators can detect the presence of particle and analyze particle composition. By locking the pump laser to the resonant frequency of the resonator, the Raman signal from the adhered particle can be enhanced as well, indicating that not only does the chemical sensing capability of Raman spectroscopy enhance the WGM resonator, but, in turn, the resonator platform itself can also enhance the Raman signal of the detected particles. Utilizing both of these features, microresonators, as sensing platforms, can be an effective and useful tool to quickly detect and analyze small particles and their chemical compositions. More specifically, we have shown the capability of chemical sensing through the unique Raman peaks measured from particles adhered to microresonators. We have demonstrated microresonator enhanced Raman scattering that allows high-speed (~ 1s) or low-power (down to 150 &mu;W) Raman measurement. We have also investigated the enhanced Raman emission of silica and rhodamine 6G due to WGM resonances in microspheres, and obtained a Raman enhancement factor of 7 x 10<sup>4</sup>, with majority of the enhancement due to pump enhancement. The dependence of Raman signals on the Q of the microresonator has also been studied. Two exemplary results are presented in the supplementary figure 2. Our work will lay the groundwork to develop a multi-function sensing unit capable of ultra-sensitive real-time, in-situ detection, identification and measurement of single particles.</p> <p>The program has also provided invaluable opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. The PIs have exploited the interdisciplinary nature of the research project to create education and training opportunities through which students at different levels could obtain broad knowledge and diverse technical skills in physics, device, materials science, spectroscopy, sensing, and nanofabrication. The research results from this project have been included in several Ph.D. theses. Two Ph.D. students (Penn State) and six Ph.D. students (Washington University) were partially supported by this program. One student (Penn State) graduated in Dec. 2016 and another will graduate this year; two students (Washington University) have graduated.
