<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cloud computing is an integral part of our computing and communication ecosystem offering great opportunity for cost-effective large-scale processing and storage capabilities. Major service-providers Google, HP, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM are offering cloud computing services to corporations and general users at affordable prices. As we step closer to æcloud services for everybodyÆ, a major question is æhow secure are the cloud computing services and systems?Æ  Security is a major concern for many Information Technology (IT) systems and applications and as we enter the mass-market for cloud computing services, the security and privacy of those services become first class features that ensure broad usability and deployment.  The goal of the NSF workshop was (a) to identify research challenges of æSecurity of Cloud Computing Services and SystemsÆ, and (b) to rally a broader computer science and engineering research community behind the challenges that need to be solved.  The NSF workshop participants asked several important questions:  What are the unsolved challenges of "security of cloud computing"?  What are the intellectual merits of these problems, why are these problems important in the scientific space?  What is the broader impact of these problems if we solve them or we donÆt solve them?    The outcomes and findings, presented in form of research challenges and recommendations, are:  Adversary models for cloud computing: The participants asked  "What are the new security threats?" "What does an adversary look like in cloud computing when different entities are involved such as when a client is a user, an owner, a storage provider and a compute provider and when some or all of the entities in the cloud can become adversaries? ", "Is there a hierarchy of adversaries when attacking clouds?"  Since clouds will be used by multiple tenants,  "Do all tenants need the same security or is leveled security sufficient at different prices?" Another challenge was: "A cloud client builds a cloud application and must rely on many technologies that he/she did not create.  What are the defenses if underlying cloud technologies are used by adversaries?" The recommendations were to:  consider new adversary models for new situations,  develop techniques to check cloud applications for vulnerabilities, and explore protection techniques for data, and enable multi-level security.    End-to-end security in cloud computing:  Cloud computing is not an isolated entity in the computing ecosystem but it is connected with clients who want certain work from the cloud service. End-to-end challenges are "How do we verify work on clouds on behalf of clients? What kind of checks do we put in place at the clientÆs and cloud side? How do we achieve trust and trustworthy relations between client and cloud?  How to deal with end-to-end privacy and how to own data in the cloud?" The recommendations were to  investigate systematically tradeoffs between security and efficiency at each component (clients, networks and clouds) of the end-to-end problem,  consider approaches towards securing data and applications on secure client devices against untrusted cloud platforms,  explore platforms for private data, investigate policy-based security applied to end-to-end cloud computing.    Delegation and authorization in cloud computing:  With cloud computing, we see third parties accessing clouds on behalf of users.  Challenges for delegation and authorization were discussed. Another challenge was "How do we support mobile device access to a cloud? " Computation over encrypted data were discussed using homomorphic encryption and homomorphic signatures. Challenges of end-to-end cloud  life cycle were presented and with it restricted delegation, secure service composition, multiple credential types and  fine-grained access control.  Reconsideration of capabilities was proposed. With capabilities one does authorization not based on æwho you areÆ, but æwhat you haveÆ. Hence...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
