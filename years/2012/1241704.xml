<AbstractNarration>This project is linking and integrating multi-media teaching materials (slides, videos and textbooks) used in Information Security courses based on a security ontology. The semantic linking of the multimedia course materials allows students to search and compose multimedia and interactive course materials based on the content, medium and learning styles, enabling flexible personalized learning. To achieve these goals, the project is focusing on several research tasks: (1) Segmenting and annotating learning media based on their learning content, (2) Building a Security ontology to be used for annotating and querying of the learning objects, (3) Adapting lecture content to student learning styles, and (4) Evaluating the usability and effectiveness of the linked multimedia security learning system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology and methodology that is being developed by this project, including the ontology builder for a given learning topic, the semantic segmentation of multimedia learning objects, the search, and personalization of learning objects, can be adapted to any course. The outcome of this project helps students build upon existing knowledge as they are being introduced to unfamiliar material, by creating subject specific searches of all course content. This changes the way students learn by making course content more organized, interactive, and instantly accessible while adding individualization options. Students are able to fill gaps in their previous learning instantly by integrating search results into their current studying. By having instant access to learning, and experiencing a truly interactive, individualized learning environment, students are less likely to be overwhelmed by course materials.</AbstractNarration>

Our approach was to develop a security ontology and a multi-modal course repository that integrates all the multimedia learning material and allows the course material to be searched on their learning content.  Intellectual Merit:   The intellectual merit of this project is three-fold:  1 Search through Security Ontology  To create a knowledge base of cyber security learning resources and to support the search for the resources, we have developed a cyber security ontology (SO) that can provide students with domain knowledge of cyber security concepts and relationships.  The semi-automated cyber security ontology engineering uses bootstrapping and text extraction methods to recognize the cyber security concepts from textbooks and Web pages. We also developed an ontology guided co-occurrence analysis method to identify the relationships among security concepts, by extracting sentences from a cyber security textbook. We have also designed and implemented the security experts tool (SOX) that allows experts to insert and edit concepts and relationships in the cyber security ontology and the security ontology browser (SOB) for students to navigate the domain knowledge structure and to learn the definition of each security concept via the hierarchical taxonomic structure among concepts, and learn about related concepts via the horizontal relationships among them.     2.
