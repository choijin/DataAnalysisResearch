<AbstractNarration>This is a project to study subtropical gyres, which are  lower-tropospheric cyclones occurring between 12N and 30N in northern summer, especially in the western North Pacific.  They are larger than tropical cyclones (TCs), and sometimes contain TCs that form within them and propagate cyclonically around them.  The work will investigate the origin, climatology, structure, and dynamics of the gyres, and study their spatial and temporal distribution and their contribution to precipitation and TC genesis.  The project begins by determining an appropriate set of criteria to define subtropical gyres, so that an automated process can be used to create a record of them, to be used to determine their spatial and seasonal distribution, typical size and duration, and variations associated with El Nino and events and the Madden-Julian Oscillation.  Next, the research will focus on the structure, evolution, and dynamics of subtropical gyres.  In addition to the observational record, the research will use simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to examine the contributions of various physical mechanisms to gyre evolution, including the surface wind response to diabatic heating associated with convection within the gyre, and the subsequent enhancement of surface heat exchange on the western side of the gyre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on subtropical gyres has societal value given the association of the gyres with TC formation.  Typhoons forming within subtropical gyres pose a threat to the coastal regions of East and Southeast Asia, and the work performed under this award may contribute to better understanding and prediction of these storms.  In addition, the project supports a graduate student and thus contributes to the next generation of researchers in this scientific area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Variations of deep tropical rain clouds over the tropical west Pacific Ocean have an enormous impact on weather in the United States 3-4 days later during all seasons of the year. As a result, it is of interest to understand the nature of convective storms in the Pacific.  "Monsoon gyres" represent huge cyclones that develop worldwide in subtropical latitudes. These disturbances have not been well understood in many aspects: how they form and intensify, and where they fit in the spectrum of atmospheric disturbances. Because most gyres develop in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, we developed a gyre climatology and carried out studies of two individual gyres in that region. We showed that their impact is large: about 20% of northwest Pacific tropical cyclones form adjacent to gyres,. The gyres produce enormous rainfall, and often last as long as a month as they move slowly westward. We showed that these disturbances actually often arise from forcing from higher latitudes. In our papers, we described how these gyres fit into the spectrum of disturbances in the Northwest Pacific. We believe that several classes of storms, including the 20-25 day mode, the Pacific-Japan pattern, quasi-biweekly disturbances, and submonthly disturbances all represent variations of the types of lows we described. In that sense we believe we have simplified classifications of storms in the Pacific.       Last Modified: 08/10/2017       Submitted by: John E Molinari]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
