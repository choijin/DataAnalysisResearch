<AbstractNarration>Many natural areas persist as habitat patches within a larger developed landscape. Species communities in these patches fluctuate over time as a consequence of local extinction, dispersal between patches, and interactions between species. Metacommunity theory is an organizing framework for understanding how networks of communities assemble and change, and can help resource managers make decisions about habitat and species conservation. There is a strong need to test metacommunity theory, though, at field scales relevant to conservation questions. This project examines forested vernal wetlands, which provide ideal systems for testing metacommunity theory. Vernal wetlands may flood in the spring and dry completely each year and frequently contain species adapted to these unique environmental conditions. They tend to be small and difficult to detect on the landscape, but they provide critical breeding habitat for amphibians and aquatic insects.  Insects, amphibians, plants, and water chemistry will be studied in sixty wetlands within Wisconsin's Chippewa Moraine region over five years in order to capture the effects of environmental variability on community structure. The role of more permanent wetlands as sources of organisms for vernal wetland communities will also be evaluated. Finally, field experiments will provide insight into how community history affects species presence and abundance. These studies will help determine the relative contributions of environmental variation, species interactions, community history, and landscape position on community composition.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conserving forested vernal wetlands is a priority in efforts to protect aquatic biodiversity, and understanding how metacommunities function in these unique systems is critical to protecting them. Research findings from this project will be incorporated into ecological landscape management plans for use by forest managers. The project will involve numerous undergraduates in research experiences and will increase the number of under-represented groups and first-generation college students pursuing STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

EPs are temporary wooded wetlands that dry during many years. They are critical habitat for amphibians and many unique invertebrate taxa. Metacommunities are a set of ecological communities connected to each other via the interchange (dispersal) of different species across geographic space. We also took advantage of the study design to compare the species communities in permanent and ephemeral wetlands.</p> <p>For five years, we collected data on the plant, aquatic macroinvertebrate, and amphibian communities of 57 different ephemeral and permanent wetlands. We also collected soil, hydrological, and water chemistry data.</p> <p>In terms of plant species communities, we addressed the important question of how EP vegetation differs from that of permanent wetlands in the understudied vegetation of temporary wetlands in eastern North America. We also addressed metacommunity concepts such as shared species and trends in beta-diversity between permanent and ephemeral wetlands. We determined that EPs do not have inherently low floristic quality, potentially meriting further conservation value (Fig 1).</p> <p>We also demonstrated that EP vegetation is distinct from that of permanent wetlands, with particularly high proportions of woody, annual, and fern species (Fig 2). Our results suggest that this notion may be true for some individual EPs, but that as a class, their vegetation differs from permanent wetlands, which share, on average, &lt;40% of EP species.
