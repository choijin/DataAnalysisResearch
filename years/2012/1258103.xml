<AbstractNarration>Bacterial and fungal pathogens inflict major crop losses. The bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent for bacterial blight of rice, affects yield stability with losses up to 60% in the developing world. Three groups with complementary expertise have identified a fundamental mechanism for plant disease susceptibility involving Xoo-induced expression of sugar transporters known as SWEETs. SWEETs are involved in the translocation of sugars from photosynthetic leaves to roots, pollen, and seeds in uninfected plants. Xoo directly induces SWEET gene expression using TAL (transcription factor-like) effector proteins, which are injected from bacterium into leaf cells. The team has also shown that genetic alterations affecting TAL effector function through genomic editing of the target sequence in the host can be used to engineer pathogen resistance. The team hypothesizes that growth of the pathogen depends critically on nutrient supply from the host, and that Xoo specifically targets sugar release from leaf cells for supplying carbon and energy to the pathogen. They also hypothesize that this mechanism is relevant for other host/pathogen systems. This work lays the basis for engineering robust and broad disease resistance by targeting SWEETs encoded by a family of ~20 genes in rice and other crops. The results are expected to provide insight into durable and broad resistance and have global impacts on the environment and quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The insights gained from this project are relevant to engineering pathogen resistance in rice, but due to the fundamental nature of the mechanism the research may have impact in other crops. The project will provide training for high-school, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs with an emphasis on minorities at the interface between organismal interactions, cell biology and nutrition physiology. The work will enhance the educational environments at ISU, KSU, and the Carnegie Institution. The project will provide undergraduates with valuable experience in the latest tools of genetic analysis and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The findings that the natural variations in the promoters of SWEET genes (OsSWEET11, 13 and 14) affect the ability of the corresponding bacterial TAL effectors (PthXo1, PthXo2, AvrXa7 and PthXo3) to cause blight disease has advanced our understanding of coadaptation between host rice and pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo).  The discoveries have also enabled engineering broad-spectrum blight resistance by precisely mutating the TAL effector target sites (EBE, effector binding elements) within those SWEET promoters using TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 in elite rice lines for practical applications to subsistence farming in developing countries.     Engineered promoter mutations in SWEETs have allowed testing and analysis of more field isolates of the pathogenic Xoo, leading to identification of new critical TAL effectors that can overcome the resistance mediated by the genetic variations in EBE of SWEET genes (e.g., OsSWEET13), also leading to better understanding the diversity of SWEETs and TAL effectors involved in bacterial blight of rice.  Discovery of the basis of xa5 function in suppressing SWEET gene activation by TAL effectors has revealed the adaption by rice to the TAL effector dependent bacterial blight through mutation of its one of two general transcription factor TFIIA small subunit genes.  Generation of knockouts of 16 single rice SWEET genes and knockouts of clade members in combination of 2, 3, and 4 of some SWEET genes using TALEN and CRISPR technologies and preliminary analysis of those knockout mutants reveal important functions of some SWEETs in plant growth, development and production in addition to their role in bacterial blight disease. For example, OsSWEET4 (glucose transporter) has been found to be required for endosperm filling; OsSWEET11 and 15 (both sucrose transporters) function redundantly for endosperm filling.  Generation of promoter-reporter rice lines of 6 SWEETs (OsSWEET11, 11b, 12, 13, 14 and 15) enables in-depth analysis of gene expression and function for all six clade III SWEETs. CRISPR-mediated gene knock-in in OsSWEET11 with GUS gene demonstrates the feasibility of gene replacement in rice with genome editing technology and provides material for gene expression/function analysis.  Broader Impact: Training of graduate students, postdoctoral research associates and undergraduate students enables them career development and experience in most advanced biology and biotechnology. Publications in scientific journals and numerous presentations at conference, invited seminars and course lectures at university help dissemination of findings among a diversity of communities.
