<AbstractNarration>PI: Lee, Jung-Kun&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1235979&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;Title: Solid State Dye Sensitized Solar Cells Using Tunable Surface Plasmons of Core-Shell Particles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to significantly improve the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells, a fundamental understanding is needed on how the light absorption mechanism, specifically related to solid dye sensitized solar cells (SDSSCs).  One of a promising ways to control the light absorption is to exploit the resonance phenomenon, such as surface plasmons.  The objectives of this research are 1) to develop a fundamental understanding the physical interactions among surface plasmons, solar light modulation, and carrier/exciton generation, and 2) to design the novel plasmonic particles (i.e. metal nanoshell) that enhance light absorption capacity of SDSSCs. The metal nanoshells will avoid inherent problems of the metal nanoparticles such as fixed plasmonic frequency, fabrication complexity, long-term aging and carrier transfer. Newly obtained knowledge on enhanced photon-electron conversion by metal nanoshells will enable us to exploit the full potential of plasmonic SDSSCs.  The proposed research holds the potential to provide new directions for the hybrid solar cells by extending our current knowledge on the plasmonic nanostructures and the solar radiation harvesting. This work will generate knowledge on the plasmonic nanostructures and facilitate a new class of photovoltaic where the solar radiation absorption and the carrier generation are significantly improved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the development of the proposed research will contribute to furthering the goal of energy security of the US. Given that the electricity produced from solar energy is more than 1% of the total annual electricity consumed in the US, the expected results of this research will contribute to increasing energy conversion efficiency by exploring surface plasmon enhanced light absorption and carrier generation. The anticipated research results will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses such as ?Materials for Energy Generation and Storage? and other activities.</AbstractNarration>

PI&rsquo;s group has explored the surface plasmons of various particles using experimental and theoretical methods. For the theoretical study, one graduate student in PI&rsquo;s group has worked on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach using a commercial tool, &ldquo;Lumerical&rdquo;. The plasmonic core-shell particles were embedded into DSSCs and the near-field effect of the plasmonic particles on the light absorption and output electric current was systematically investigated. The results show that the core-shell type plasmonic particles cause both light trapping and light scattering in the photoanode and enhance the conversion of incident light to electrons in DSSCs. The role of the plasmonic particles on the solar cell performance depends on the position of the plasmonic particles and the absorption spectrum of dyes. When the core-shell particles were embedded inside the photoanode, a synergetic increase in the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs was observed. This is attributed to a combined effect of the scattering and light trapping of the plasmonic particles. Furthermore, the plasmonic particles were implemented into the solid state solar cells and the photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. In the case of the solar cells, different kinds of electrolytes (liquid electrolyte and solar electrolyte) and mesoporous platforms (nanoparticle film and nanorod film) were compared to find a good pair of the electrolyte and the nanostructured film. Nanorod films were found to promote carrier transport and suppress electron recombination in comparison to nanoparticle films. An important material property is the diffusion coefficient of electrons. As the density of the surface and bulk defects decrease, the electron diffusion coefficient increases and the solar cell performance increases. In the case of the plasmonic PEC cells, we examine the role of nanostructured metals on the performance of BiVO4 film that is one of promising oxide semiconductors for the solar-fuel applications. Consistent with the IPCE, the remarkable increase in photocurrent density is also observed when the plasmonic particles were coated on the top of BiVO4 film. Hole transfer between BiVO4 and electrolyte is improved by presence of plasmonic particles on surface. Upon illumination, photogenerated charge carriers are separated and holes go to interface in order to oxidize water to oxygen. Concurrently, the increase light absorption of the resultant films also positively effects photoelectrochemical performance by concentrating the light onto photoactive surface. These results indicate that plasmonic particles deposited on the semiconductor surface triggers photoassisted charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, and suppresses the possible recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. As the last task of the project, we worked on the perovskite solar cells on the TiO2 nanoporous electrode.
