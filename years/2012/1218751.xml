<AbstractNarration>Broadcast is an important operation in ad hoc networks, especially in distributed multi-hop multichannel networks. Although the broadcasting issue has been extensively investigated in traditional single channel and multi-channel ad hoc networks, there are unique challenges that are un-explored in the broadcast design in cognitive radio ad hoc networks. Existing schemes can have serious performance degradation due to the neglect of the dynamics in the spectrum availability in cognitive radio networks. The research objective of this project is to design, analyze, and evaluate new broadcast protocols for multi-hop cognitive radio ad hoc networks without a common control channel. The broadcast design is aimed at maximizing the broadcast success rate and minimizing the average broadcast delay simultaneously. The approach is focused on exploiting the spectrum correlations of neighboring nodes and the spectrum diversity of different nodes in designing new channel rendezvous, scheduling, and collision avoidance algorithms to achieve the broadcast performance goals in practical scenarios. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide fundamental and complementary solutions to existing cognitive radio networking research on other network operations. It will also help generate innovative techniques to numerous applications of the cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access technology. This project provides an excellent opportunity for graduate and undergraduate research students to gain valuable educational training and research experiences. The research results will be presented at IEEE/ACM journals and international conferences.</AbstractNarration>
