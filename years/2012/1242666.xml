<AbstractNarration>The project entitled - Emerging Researchers National Conference in STEM - will hold a student research conference with selected programs of the National Science Foundation Human Resources Development and Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) programs in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. The conference will include undergraduate and graduate students from the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology, Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate, Research in Disabilities Education, Tribal Colleges and Universities Programs and the REUs.  In terms of advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning, students will participate in undergraduate and graduate student poster and oral presentations. Topics covered at the three-day conference as part of plenary and workshop sessions will focus on applying for and persisting in graduate schools; identifying graduate school fellowships and financial aid; identifying, interviewing for, and persisting in STEM careers in all employment sectors; and understanding science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) research in a global context. Other conference features will include exhibitors from government, academia, and business who will showcase graduate programs, fellowships, summer undergraduate research programs, employment opportunities, and international research and education opportunities. Estimated annual conference participation is 1,000, including 650 students and 350 faculty and administrators from government, business, professional societies, and media organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Human Resource Development (HRD) co-hosted the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Emerging Researchers National (ERN) Conference in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  Intellectual Merit  The objective of the ERN Conference is to help undergraduate and graduate students enhance their science communication skills and to better understand how to prepare for science careers in a global workforce.  The 2-1/2 day conferences were aimed at students who participate in programs funded by the NSF HRD Unit and the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Programs, including underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities. NSF HRD Programs include:  ***Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP);  ***Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST);  ***Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU?UP);  ***Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) and LSAMP Bridges to the Doctorate;  ***Research in Disabilities Education (RDE); and  ***Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP).  Attendance for the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 ERN Conferences averaged about 990. Attendees included students, faculty, administrators, and others.  The number of institutions participating in the ERN Conference, 2013-2016, ranged from 205 to 319, per year.  The number of STEM students attending the 2013-16 ERN Conferences ranged from 621 &ndash; 784, per year. Students represented over 60% of the ERN conference attendees.  The number of student abstracts submitted for the ERN Conference grew from 491 to 655, per year. About 80% of the student attendees presented at each ERN Conference.  Of the 656 students who reported their discipline for the 2016 ERN Conference, 202 or 30.8% were biology majors; 144 or 22% were technology and engineering majors; and 101 or 15.4% were chemistry majors; and the 209 students were in other STEM disciplines.  Broader Impacts  In general the conference format is interactive, and sessions are designed to provide mentoring and coaching in scientific communication, as well as applying for and succeeding in STEM graduate programs and careers.  On a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest rating, all the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 ERN Conferences plenary and poster and oral presentation sessions and workshops were rated in the very good range.  The 2013-2016 ERN Conferences and pre-conference activities ratings were about a 4.2 or in the very good range (on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest rating) in terms of helping participants to better understand:  ***How to prepare and submit abstracts for STEM conference poster and oral presentations.  ***How to prepare posters.  ***How to prepare an oral presentation.  ***How to communicate science findings.  ***How to network with peers, faculty, and others.   ***Science in a global context.  In terms of helpfulness with identifying opportunities the 2013-2016 ERN conferences were rated in the very good range (3.7 &ndash; 4.1):   ***Internships;   ***Graduate school opportunities; and   ***Career resources.   In terms of helpfulness with identifying opportunities the 2013 -2015 ERN conferences were in the good plus range (3.5 &ndash; 3.9) for   ***Employment opportunities and   ***Travel grants for professional meetings.
