<AbstractNarration>PI: Netoff, Theoden I. and Moehlis, Jeffrey M.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1264432 &amp; 1264535&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Populations of neurons must dynamically synchronize and desynchronize for transmission of information within the brain. The disruption of this dynamic synchronization is thought to underlie the symptomatology of several neurological disorders. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) therapy is being used to treat many of these neurological disorders, such as Parkinsons disease (PD). It is generally believed that DBS leads are placed in regions of brain that are pathologically synchronous, and periodic DBS pulses then "over pace" these areas, blocking the pathological activity. The PIs have recently developed an alternative hypothesis for the mechanism of DBS which focuses on DBS's modulation of the firing times of neurons. Stimulation at certain frequencies can induce a chaotic response that desynchronizes a population; we term this chaotic desynchronization. The response of a neuron to a DBS pulse is characterized by its phase response curve (PRC), a measure of how the stimulus advances the phase depending on the phase the stimulus is applied at. The PRC can then be used to determine if two neurons in the population starting at nearly the same phase will entrain to the stimulus pulses, or will diverge and effectively become desynchronized. In this grant the PIS propose to use PRCs to determine the optimal stimuli to desynchronize population oscillations. Preliminary experiments show that small periodic stimulus pulses at certain frequencies can desynchronize populations; the frequency and amplitude that desynchronize can be predicted from the PRC of the neurons to the stimulus.  Moreover, continuous stimulus waveforms can be designed that desynchronize populations with much less energy than the pulsatile stimuli. The aims of this grant are to further the theoretical work in designing these waveforms from measured PRCs, and then to test chaotic de-synchronization in physical and biological systems. Specific Aim 1 will use measured phase response curves and control theory to determine the optimal stimulus waveforms to maximize desynchronization of neuronal ensembles. Specific Aim 2 will be to apply this theory to desynchronize oscillations in a chemical oscillator model, the photosensitive Belousov-Zhabotinsky (pBZ) reaction, through pulsatile and continuous waveform photo stimulation. Specific Aim 3 will test the theory in neurons in vitro basal ganglia preparation.  Neurons will be recorded and stimulated using a dynamic clamp experimental protocol. The PRCs from single neurons will be measured in response to DBS pulses, and we will test for chaotic behavior in their stimulus response patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The motivation of this research is to 1) understand how behaviors relate to oscillatory synchronization in and between the basal ganglia and motor cortex, and 2) improve DBS treatment of PD, for which the selection of stimulus electrodes, frequency, and amplitudes are currently tuned manually by a clinician. The goal of this research is to determine the optimal stimulus properties based on simple physiological measures of the neurophysiological response to DBS. This approach will enable faster and more robust programming of neurostimulators and will decrease the amount of required injected current, which will reduce side effects and battery power consumption. This approach has high potential for closed loop control algorithms where DBS parameters are automatically tuned to maintain maximal efficacy. This approach may also be applied to seizure suppression and other neurological diseases.  These studies leverage a recently funded IGERT training plan at UMN for neuromodulation. To maximize our clinical impact, we have discussed with Dwight Nelson (Neuromodulation department at Medtronic) what basic research will enable the next steps in developing new DBS stimulus parameters and the yet unmet clinical needs (letter of support included). The results from this research will be disseminated to the public through various education programs including ones focused on underrepresented undergraduate students, high school educators, high school students and junior-high school students. Finally, this award will train graduate students and undergraduates in interdisciplinary research activities, and enhance the education of other graduate students through results that will be incorporated into courses taught by the PI and co-PI.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Major Goals   The goal of this grant is to better understand how deep brain stimulation disrupts pathologically synchronous activity seen in Parkinson?s disease. This research will help us understand how such forcing affects populations of oscillating neurons and to determine optimal stimulus waveforms and characteristics from the response of the population to inputs. The ultimate goal is to develop a better approach to tuning deep brain stimulation parameters using the patient?s physiology.   Accomplishments  The research supported by this grant consists of:  Computational modeling networks of oscillators, to represent neurons, and their response to control inputs (Netoff and Moehlis) Experiments with photoexcitable chemical oscillator systems measuring their phase response curves, predicting, and then measuring, their response to forcing with light and the effects on synchrony (Showalter) Single cell recordings from neurons from the basal ganglia of rat to measure the effect of periodic forcing with electrical stimuli on the reliability of neurons as a surrogate for synchrony across populations (Netoff)   Specific Objectives:  Our objective is to determine how to measure phase response curves from populations of neurons and use that information to design stimuli that will maximally disrupt synchrony. This is being tested in models, chemical oscillator systems, and neurons.  Significant Results:  Modeling results (Netoff, Moehlis)  We have developed analytical tools to explain how oscillations emerge from coupled populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the basal ganglia. We have demonstrated in a network of oscillating neurons that we can measure a phase response curve from a population of neurons. We have shown that from the phase response curve we can predict what stimulation frequency suppresses the population oscillation. We have developed a closed-loop phasic pulse stimulation protocol that is highly effective at desynchronizing neurons. We have developed a burst stimulation protocol that applies several pulses in one cycle and is much more efficient at suppressing oscillations that the pulsatile stimulation. We have developed a method for calculating PRCs of individual oscillators using an aggregate signal from a large homogeneous population. We have derived upper and lower bounds on the critical coupling strength required to achieve frequency synchronization in a population of oscillators with distributed natural frequencies and phase response properties. We have shown that high frequency pulsatile inputs will separate a population of noisy phase oscillators into multiple clusters, each with a nearly identical proportion of the overall population. We have developed a general method for isostable reduction of partial differential equations, which provides the framework for the design of a novel control strategy to desynchronize a population of synchronized oscillatory neurons. As an alternative approach to optimizing stimulation using phase response curves, we have been developing temporal difference learning algorithms to optimize phase when PRCs cannot be measured directly.  We have developed computational models of basal ganglia with synaptic plasticity to develop the next generation of optimization algorithms that maximize plasticity as well as suppression of oscillations.   Chemical oscillator networks  We have done computational modeling of the chemical oscillator networks to determine parameters and shown feasibility of the experiments. We have demonstrated that periodic forcing of the oscillators with light whose amplitude is modulated sinusoidally can synchronize the chemical oscillators. We demonstrated that periodic forcing with pulsatile light and phasic stimulation can desynchronize the chemical oscillators, which can be predicted accurately from the phase response curve.   Neuronal experiments  We have patch clamped neurons in the Subthalamic Nucleus of rat, one of the targets of DBS, and measured the phase response curves of the neuron to DBS-like stimulation inputs. A sinusoidal current was applied and we have seen clear phase locking of the neuron spike times to the phase. Phasic bursts of stimulation pulses were applied to the neuron and we saw clear evidence that the ability of the neuron to synchronize to the sinusoidal waveform was modulated by the phase at which the DBS burst was applied. We have tested and verified the open loop stimulation and closed loop stimulation for single pulse and bur stimulation in neurons in vitro. We have measured phase response curves from basal ganglia with electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in awake and behaving non-human primates.   Key outcomes or Other achievements:  We have developed methods of measuring phase response curves from populations of neurons. We have developed a closed loop phasic stimulation that is highly effective at desynchronizing populations of oscillating neurons. We completed the first experiments in neurons to demonstrate that stimulus pulses delivered at specific phases of the population oscillation is highly effective at disrupting the oscillation. We have filed a preliminary patent for burst stimulation optimization for oscillation suppression. We have shown that periodic pulsatile stimuli can lead to desynchronization via clustering. We have developed temporal difference learning algorithms for optimizing stimulation patterns empirically without supervision.
