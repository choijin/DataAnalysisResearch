<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the topic of meteorite effects on the upper atmosphere by using physics-based models and interpreting data collected at NSF radar facilities. Particles that impact the Earth's upper atmosphere with sufficient energy create high-density plasmas in the E-region ionosphere, seeding the upper atmosphere with an array of metal ions and atoms. A better understanding of meteor plasma dynamics and its radiowave scattering characteristics is needed in order to be able to utilize the information that radars generate about meteors. The project will address the following questions: (1) How do meteor plasmas evolve from their initial ablation and ionization through the early-stage kinetic expansion to their later-stage diffusion and turbulence? (2) What characteristics of the meteor plasma influence radar head echoes? (3) Can more accurate theoretical and computational models improve our quantitative understanding of radiowave scattering? (4) How do large-scale atmospheric inhomogeneities and neutral wind shears modify the evolution of the long-lived plasma trail produced by the meteoroid? Answering these questions will lead to progress in understanding the physics of the highly collisional lower ionosphere and will provide better interpretations of measurements made by radar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond contributions to Aeronomy, the results of this work will be useful to space science and engineering, and provide a better understanding of potential hazards due to particles. The simulator development could be broadly applicable to plasma physics problems. The project will support a full-time graduate student and an undergraduate. The PI and CoPI will share their knowledge and enthusiasm about space and meteor science with the larger community through outreach to K-12 schools and at the University.</AbstractNarration>
