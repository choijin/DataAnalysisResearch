<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1206272, Principal Investigator: Jeanne Nielsen Clelland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to apply the theory of exterior differential systems and Cartan's method of equivalence to study several problems in differential geometry and differential equations, both individually and with various collaborators. In joint work with Gui-Qiang Chen, Marshall Slemrod, Dehua Wang, and Deane Yang, she will investigate the local existence problem for isometric embedding of higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds into Euclidean space, incorporating ideas from elastostatics and hyperbolic conservation laws to find conditions which guarantee local existence of isometric embeddings. She will continue her joint work with Thomas Ivey on classification results for Backlund transformations for certain categories of PDEs, paying particular attention to auto-Backlund transformations, which may be used to generate new solutions of a PDE from a known solution of the same PDE. She will expand upon her joint work with Christopher Moseley and George Wilkens on sub-Finsler geometry, and investigate geometric properties of metric structures associated to affine distributions, as well as potential applications to optimal control theory. In joint work with her former Ph.D. student Matthew Stackpole, she will investigate the phenomenon of dynamic equivalence between control systems, with a focus on finding ways to compute invariants to distinguish between dynamically inequivalent systems. In joint work with her former M.A. student Nathaniel Bushek, she will investigate geometric properties of surfaces in 5-dimensional centroaffine space, including the classification of homogeneous examples and other special families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differential equations have an enormous range of applications, from engineering and physics to biology and finance, just to name a few. A common theme in all the proposed projects is the use of geometric techniques to study structural features of differential equations which may be obscured by the expression of an equation in a particular choice of coordinates. This approach, pioneered in the early 20th century by Elie Cartan, has enjoyed great success in furthering the understanding of many types of differential equations and their solutions. The proposed research on isometric embedding addresses one of the 23 mathematical challenges recently posed by DARPA, due to potential applications to the science of protein folding. The proposed research on Backlund transformations is related to integrable systems, whose applications include efficient signal propagation over long distances with minimal distortion in signal quality. The proposed projects on affine distributions and dynamic equivalence are related to control theory, whose applications include areas such as robotics and quantum computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the grant period, I published six articles based on my grant research in highly ranked refereed mathematics journals.  One additional article has been submitted and is currently under review, and two articles are still being prepared for submission.  The common theme in all of this research is the application of geometric techniques to study structural features of differential equations.  This approach, pioneered in the early 20th century by Elie Cartan, has enjoyed great success in furthering the understanding of many types of differential equations and their solutions.  The primary grant project centered around the local existence problem for isometric embedding of higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds into Euclidean space.  In joint work with G.-Q. Chen, M. Slemrod, D. Wang, and D. Yang, we achieved one of the major objectives of the project: we proved a local existence theorem for solutions of a category of systems of partial differential equations that we call "strongly symmetric positive."  We then applied this theorem to give a vastly simplified proof of earlier results of Bryant-Griffiths-Yang and Nakamura-Maeda regarding the local existence of isometric embeddings of smooth 3-dimensional Riemannian manifolds into 6-dimensional Euclidean space.  We expect that our theorem will have broader applications to other problems in geometry and differential equations.  Four of the research articles published during the grant period were joint projects with current and former undergraduate and masters-level independent study students.  These projects include:  1) a classification of lightlike surfaces in 3-dimensional Minkowski space, including the construction of explicit examples (joint with B. Carlsen) - see example in Image 1;  2) a comparison of two notions for arc length for curves in surfaces in 3-dimensional equi-affine space, including a classification of those curves for which the two notions agree (joint with E. Estrada, M. May, J. Miller, S. Paneyra, and M. Schmidt) - see example in Image 2;  3) a classification of hyperbolic affine flat, affine minimal surfaces in 3-dimensional equi-affine space, including the construction of explicit examples (joint with J.

The manuscript has been submitted to the American Mathematical Society and is currently under review.  Finally, during the grant period I co-organized a research conference, "New Directions in Exterior Differential Systems: a conference in honor of Robert Bryant's 60th birthday."  This week-long conference brought together researchers and students in the field of exterior differential systems and featured talks on a wide array of current research in the field.
