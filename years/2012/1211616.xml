<AbstractNarration>This award will support an observational survey to detect and characterize a large sample of white dwarf stars.  The goals of the project are to search for white dwarf stars in the stellar spectra obtained with the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), and to create population statistics to study the evolution and origin of many types of single and binary white dwarfs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The is expected to have an impact on several fields of astrophysics, including the production and evolution of white dwarfs and on the physics of matter at high densities.  The project will also involve amateur astronomers and students from high school through graduate school.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Projects Outcomes Report  White dwarf stars are the endpoints of most stars, including our own Sun.  Our original project goal was to search for white dwarf stars (WDs) in the stellar spectra obtained with the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) and in parallel mode.  The delays suffered by the HETDEX project have prevented this project from being completed as originally planned.  We have shown, however, as data came in this past year, that this magnitude-limited, statistically well-characterized, survey has the potential to have a significant impact on least three main areas of astrophysics: white dwarf luminosity functions, constraints on stellar evolution and exploring physics of matter under extreme conditions.  Broader Impacts:   Our research develops and extends the potential and optimize the scientific output of HETDEX, a project that NSF has recently decided to invest US$ 8 million in, for dark energy science. We will constantly process the stream of VIRUS data and will make our WD data available to the scientific community. If data reduction, processing and analysis continues, this project will ultimately represent a significant value added to the HETDEX survey. The proposed activities, which also include follow-up observations of interesting targets, we will work in close collaboration with astronomers at various institutions, using well established international collaborations coupled with an open data policy. We will also continue the work with amateur astronomers, high school students, undergraduate and graduate students, encouraging them to participate in some follow-up observations and scientific discussions.  They will be involved directly in cutting-edge astrophysics as a result.       Last Modified: 11/30/2018       Submitted by: Donald E Winget]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
