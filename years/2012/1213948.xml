<AbstractNarration>Under the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jean Chmielewski of Purdue University conducts research to gain a clear understanding of the assembly mechanisms of collagen-peptides into microstructures and the features necessary for inclusion of functionality within these microstructures.  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop novel approaches to the rational control of hierarchical assembly of collagen peptides into microstructures with desired functionality.  The size and shape of the supramolecular assemblies will be manipulated with assembly signals appropriately positioned within collagen triple helices and through ligand control to generate novel materials with improved properties for biotechnology applications.  The residual ligands and interior cavities within the supramolecular assemblies will be harnessed to add imaging functionality to the microstructures.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of collagen triple helical peptides as building blocks for microscale materials is highly evocative and has broad implications for society and many areas of science. In the long term the materials developed may be useful for in vivo drug delivery and imaging, or have applications in tissue engineering. These studies will also have a broad impact on graduate student and undergraduate training, and the proposed K-4 interactions will help to inspire the next generation of students in their appreciation of science and math. The emphasis on discovery and education in this work is essential to reap the full benefits of research in this field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Professor Chmielewski?s research group has designed new molecules that are small parts of natural collagen with sticky pieces (CSPs).  The sticky pieces allow the CSPs to grow into micron-sized materials such as solid balls, hollow spheres and 3-D meshes.  The Chmielewski group is evaluating many different types of sticky pieces attached to collagen to identify novel materials that can bind to cells, hold growth aids and contain medicines.  With this research, the Chmielewski group is producing a basic understanding of how collagen with sticky pieces can grow into larger structures.  This understanding will help them to develop more advanced materials for growing new tissues and delivering medicines and cells in the body.  There is a crucial need for new materials to grow tissues, such as heart valves and blood vessels.  Developing new materials for delivery of medicines and cells within the body is also a major challenge. The fundamental research of this project has great potential to help with both of these challenges.  This project has also had a significant impact on students at a number of different levels.  Undergraduates and graduate students from Purdue University, including minority students, and K-6 students in the public school system in Lafayette, IN have all participated in research and science activities supported by this grant.
