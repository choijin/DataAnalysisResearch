<AbstractNarration>High-dimensional data is prevalent in areas such as medicine, finance, environmental studies, imaging, networking, and the Internet. Making sense of this massive amount of data holds the key to critical scientific questions such as discovering biomarkers related to disease and evaluating the effects of climate change. The proposed research will use statistical learning techniques to develop novel multivariate approaches incorporating sparsity (variable selection), smoothness, and accounting for known structure in high-dimensional data. Extending multivariate methods for structured data improves signal recovery and feature selection. These techniques will be useful in spatio-temporal and image data, for example, where strong correlations from known structure obscure dimension reduction. Much attention has been given to multivariate methods for matrix data. The proposed research will extend many modern multivariate techniques such as sparse principal components analysis to the multi-dimensional or tensor framework. Finally, this proposal seeks to generalize much of the existing literature on regularized multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, canonical correlations analysis and linear discriminant analysis by illustrating how to encourage many types of regularization. This proposal also seeks to develop algorithmic and computational frameworks that will allow researchers to apply these methods to modern massive data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As multivariate analysis techniques enjoy nearly universal application, the theory and methods developed in this proposal will have wide ranging significance in many applied fields. The methods developed are in part motivated by and will have immediate impact in neuroimaging studies, cancer genomics, and metabolomics studies.  Other areas where this methodology will prove beneficial include climate studies, remote sensing, networking, engineering, finance, and imaging. Results of this research will be disseminated through the release of open-source, publicly available software and will be incorporated in course material of an advanced graduate course on statistical learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the major frontiers in science and medicine is understanding the human brain.  Neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) allow researchers and clinicians to take three-dimensional images of the active human brain, and pose great potential for treating neurocognitive, neurodevelopmental, and neruodegenerative diseases.  Statistically analyzing neuroimaging data to extract meaningful information, however, poses many challenges as the data is massive (2-4 GB of data per subject), highly structured, multi-dimensional, and has a low signal-to-noise ratio.     In this project, we have developed several new statistical techniques to improve statistical analysis of neuroimaging data.  These include methods to better separate brain signals from the imaging and temporal noise through modern multivariate analysis techniques, methods to conduct inference over a population to find differences in functional brain networks, and methods to build predictive models of subject-level behavior or outcomes based on brain scans.  The newly developed statistical techniques have been used to study fMRI and EEG data for diseases and conditions such as alcoholism, autism, neurofibromitosis, and synesthesia.  The methods, however, are general and will be useful for many types of neuroimaging data and studies.  Overall, these new statistical techniques will help neuroscience researchers better understand the complex workings of the human brain.
