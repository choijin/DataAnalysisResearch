<AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematics &amp; Computer Science at Valparaiso University will host the summer REU site, Valparaiso Experience in Research by Undergraduate Mathematicians (VERUM). VERUM will recruit nine undergraduate students each year. These students will work in teams of three for nine weeks on solving open problems in combinatorics, biomathematics, or statistics. Each group will work with a different project director who will provide guidance and feedback to the students on a daily basis. In each project, the participants will investigate open questions of interest to the larger mathematical community, and therefore yield potentially publishable results.  Most of the participants will be students from primarily undergraduate institutions who have not yet decided on a graduate school career path.  Therefore we will target undergraduates for a first research experience in mathematics.  Additional attention will be given to recruiting participants from groups under-represented in STEM, including first-generation college students since they also will have had less exposure to academic values and processes than their peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By modeling the research experience of a mathematician, the program will produce students engaged with, and prepared to join, the mathematical community. The program will emphasize the professional development of the students while encouraging them to pursue mathematics related careers and graduate studies thus increasing the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines. Students will become part of a small professional group that will provide support during their undergraduate careers and beyond. As part of the program a graduate student will also act as a mentor for the participants and the students will visit graduate schools to learn about the lives of graduate students in different types of institutions. The students will also be exposed to different areas of mathematics by following the progress of each research group and by listening to and interacting with weekly visitors to the program. VERUM participants will increase their communication and presentation skills through weekly group presentations, presentations at local and national conferences and through writing a final project report.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Valparaiso Experience in Research by Undergraduate Mathematicians program provides an opportunity for undergraduate participants to model the research experience of a mathematician.  The program serves students with limited access to a research environment and helps these students foster effective work habits.  Students work closely with a project mentor and have increased independence in their work as the program progresses.  There is also a strong professional development component with focus on improved written and oral communication of technical material throughout the summer program.   Over the life of this grant, 28 undergraduate students were supported to conduct research projects under the guidance of Valparaiso University faculty.  Nine students participated in cohorts for each of summers 2013, 2014, and 2015.  One additional student was supported in summer 2016.  Each summer these students were selected from a national applicant pool, with particular consideration given to applicants for whom the program was a first research experience.  Our stated objectives also included the involvement of students that come from a population traditionally underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. 55% of the participants were female, 39% first generation college students and 14% minority students.    Students met daily with their faculty mentors in small groups to discuss progress on their research projects, which varied from pure mathematics (graph labeling, enumerative combinatorics, and differential equations) to applied mathematics (with modeling problems involving ecology, finance, and epidemiology).  Weekly guest lecturers helped expose students to a variety of research topics and mathematical career options.  Each summer visitors included mathematicians from academia, industry and government to assure that the participants could explore a wide range of possible career paths. In addition to research areas the participants also learned about possible funding opportunities for future studies and professional development in mathematics.  Students also visited two graduate schools and met with faculty and graduate students to learn more about graduate work in mathematics.  Based on annual assessment of the program most participants were more likely to consider graduate school in mathematics as a career option at the end of the program than at the beginning of the program.  Students gave weekly presentations to their peers and faculty mentors on their work; by the end of the program, each student team produced slides for a 20-minute talk and a research poster to disseminate their work at appropriate conferences.  Each year students attended a state wide undergraduate mathematics conference where each group gave an oral presentation. Each project was also presented in January following the summer at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in the undergraduate poster session. Many of the participants disseminated results at their own institutions and at other local and regional mathematics conferences. As of May 2017, 3 scientific papers have been published from the results of these projects, and 5 additional papers have been submitted for publication.  All final project reports are also available at http://www.valpo.edu/mathematics-statistics/academics/verum-summer-research-program/completed-verum-projects/  Of the 28 participants, sixteen have begun or will begin graduate studies in a mathematics-related discipline by fall 2017, three have begun careers as teachers, and six are mathematically employed in actuarial science or in the technology sector.
