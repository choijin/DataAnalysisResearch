<AbstractNarration>The object of this proposal is to pursue new approaches to some fundamental problems in Galois theory, following recent breakthroughs in this subject.  The focus of research will be on lifting finite (possibly ramified) Galois covers of smooth projective curves over a commutative ring and on finding small rings of definition for such lifts.  These problems pertain to the classical Inverse Galois Problem as well as to the question of finding the relations between etale fundamental groups of various kinds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal deals with fundamental questions about the solutions of algebraic equations.  The study of the symmetries of such equations has been the motivation for the development of much of abstract algebra.  Advances in abstract algebra have been essential to the development of modern technology.  Some particular examples of applications of abstract algebra include the compression and transmission of data, cryptography, search algorithms and solving optimization problems in the physical sciences, engineering and economics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research conducted with the support of this grant was about Galois theory and related topics.  Galois theory began as the study of symmetries of systems of equations.  It was discovered by Galois that the symmetries of equations limit the ways in which one can write down explicit expressions for their solutions.  A primary goal of the research conducted with the support of this grant was to study lifting gproblems.  These have to do with determining whether one can refine the coefficients of systems of equations without changing their symmetries.    Some new tools concerning the generalized Oort Conjecture about when lifting problems can be solved were developed.  These established some new cases of the conjecture along with clarifying the limitations on solutions.  Some other related topics which were studied had to do with symmetries of differential equations, ways of representing groups of symmetries by matrices, and applications of this work to other fields such as spherical and hyperbolic codes, knot theory and logic.  One outcome of this research was the solution of a long standing open problem:  The function field of a curve over a global field can be defined up to isomorphism by an explicit sentence in the language of fields.
