<AbstractNarration>The BioInformatics and Bio-Modeling (BIBM) conference focuses on leading edge questions in the field. The conference agenda is a varied program with topic paper areas, tutorial programs, and special interest group meetings that align with recent funding trends within the ABI program. In addition to research findings, the program also incorporates hands-on workshops of the newest informatics tools to be developed. The conference provides an interactive forum in which researchers can share ideas, learn new techniques, and forge professional relationships with other colleagues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A panel on Bioinformatics Training and Education at the conference will help to share resources and lessons learned in bioinformatics training and workforce development. The panel will feature representatives from academics, industry and government to discuss different career paths. The conference program also includes mentoring activities. The organizers will invite 20-30 (20 funded by this award) students and postdoctoral researchers to attend the conference, with a well-articulated diversity recruitment plan that targets gender, minority, and disability participation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to promote multidisciplinary research and education in Bioinformatics and Biomedicine and support the participation of students and early career researchers to broaden its scientific impact.  The major activity supported by this grant is the Sixth Annual IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM-2012) held in Philadelphia, PA, USA, on October 4-7, 2012. The Conference provided an open and interactive forum to promote interdisciplinary research and education in Bioinformatics and Biomedicine, catalyzing the cross fertilization of ideas and bridging our knowledge gaps.  The scientific program highlights five themes to provide breadth, depth, and synergy for research collaboration: (i) genomics and molecular structure, function, and evolution; (ii) computational systems biology; (iii) medical informatics and translational bioinformatics; (iv) cross-cutting computational methods and bioinformatics infrastructures, and (v) healthcare informatics.  The scientific quality of BIBM-2012 is evidenced by contributed talks at a highly competitive acceptance rate, three keynote speeches and several invited talks given by preeminent scientists, as well as the publication of conference and workshop proceedings and special issue publications in well-known scientific journals.  The Conference received a total of 299 research paper submissions from 1015 authors/co-authors from 44 countries.
