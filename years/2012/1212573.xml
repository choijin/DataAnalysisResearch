<AbstractNarration>1212573/ Van Wie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cartilage regenerative medicine for osteoarthritis will be advanced signifi-cantly by improved fundamental understanding at the cellular level of the complex interplay of mechanical and biochemical stimuli needed to create healthy cartilage. The central hypothesis posed by these investigators is that optimal differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) occurs via exposure to bioactive molecules combined with physical stimuli that promote membrane N-cadherin de-pendent cellular junctions. The researchers investigate our hypothesis using a unique continuous centrif-ugal bioreactor (CCBR) in this industry-university collaborative EAGER project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The strength of this research program is the collaborative interface between biology, engineering and technology. WSU engineers will provide the novel bioreactor and AFM analytical technology, and REGN scientists will provide genetics and cell biology expertise. The research is : 1) to grow and differentiate hMSCs in the CCBR; 2) to determine the addi-tive and synergistic influences of multiple stimuli on chondrogenesis; and 3) to establish the relative contributions and synergistic impacts of various stimuli on mRNA upregulation and expression of proteins responsible for signaling pathways and mechano-transduction mechanisms responsible for heightened chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs.  The work could yield potential commercial application for autologous chondrocyte tissue culture systems for regenerative implants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact:&lt;br/&gt;Teaching &amp; training: Presentations will be given on synergistic stimuli on chondrogenesis at REGN, and annual NIH Protein Biotechnology Training Program symposia; Representation: A U.S. woman and/or minority PhD student is being recruited to join the pro-gram through an anticipated NSF Graduate Research Supplement; Infrastructure: A new CCBR will be developed capable of imparting multiple stimuli for mechanotransduction studies; Dissemination at AIChE and ACS meetings and in technical journals; Societal Benefits: The work is expected to have long-term impact on regenerative cartilage repair and other tissue culture applications that impact human health.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intelectual Merit:</p> <p>Unhealthy and degenerating articular cartilage (AC) is a significant and increasing health issue for about 40 million people in the U.S., leading to arthritis and injury. Joint replacement surgery occurs once every minute in the U.S., and this is exacerbated by an increasingly obese and aging population. Regenerative AC repair is gaining interest as a solution and under support of a National Science Foundation EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER), Professors Bernie Van Wie and Nehal Abu-Lail at Washington State University (WSU) have teamed with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Tarrytown, NY) researcher Dr. Vincent Idone to study mechanical and biochemical stresses that promote growth of healthy cartilage. AC stays healthy by being exposed to a combination of growth factors and varying amounts of pressure and loads on our knee or hip joints or use of our fingers. However, once we are injured, pressure such loads can negatively influence our AC. Not only that, AC has very limited ability to heal because it is an avascular tissue and lacks the nutrient supply needed to promote growth of healthy tissue to replace that injured or damaged. As such, to be able to engineer a functional AC tissue that can be implanted in vivo, we need to mimic the in vivo environment to the maximal extent possible. Our approach has relied on utilizing a unique continuous centrifugal bioreactor (CCBR) method invented at WSU to grow a cartilage tissue starting with adult stem cells and cartilage cells called chondrocytes derived from cattle and procured through a local meat packing company. Our CCBR allows growth of a larger amount of cartilage cells compared to other methods. Furthermore, through extensive efforts to modify the system to include oscillating pressures while flowing growth cocktail medium through the CCBR, this allows us to put the cells under stresses mimicking those experienced by AC in vivo. &nbsp;To test if our AC engineered tissues are functional, we measured the mechanical properties of the engineered tissues using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), and mapped the distributions, densities and location patterns of special signaling molecules called N-cadherin and b1-integrin on the surfaces of cells that are stimulated by the mechanical loads, after the cells are extracted from the engineered tissues. This was done after exposure of the cells to variable stresses and we also measured the amounts of messenger molecules, mRNA, that are produced within the cell and responsible for creating the cartilage proteins important for growing healthy cartilage tissue.</p> <p>Our findings indicate that adipose (fat tissue) derived stem cells are differentiated into chondrocytes, the cells responsible for making cartilage, in our CCBR. Chondrogenesis, the process that causes adult stem cells to mature into those which produce cartilage, is improved when TGF-&beta;3, an important cell growth factor, is applied along with oscillating and very high liquid pressures. The resulting engineered AC tissues have mechanical properties, represented in terms of the elastic nature of the tissue (Young&rsquo;s moduli), nearing those of normal AC tissues. Furthermore, our results indicate that proteins called b1-integrins are needed for the growth of AC tissues with an insufficient cartilage matrix. The need for these molecules is reduced as mechanical stresses are applied to the tissues in the CCBR.&nbsp; Our results also indicate that supplementing AC tissues with TGF-b3 increases the expression of SOX9, a protein that governs the cell maturation process, as well as the mechanical properties of engineered AC tissues, suggesting that chondrogenesis of human adipose derived stem cells occurs by a pathway that depends on N-cadherin. We expect our findings will be used to enhance research about the underlying molecules that regulate healthy chondrogenesis with potential commercial application for removing chondrocyte tissue from patients and culturing them to make healthy cartilage that can be used in regenerative implants.</p> <p>Borader Impact:</p> <p>Through this EAGER project two PhD graduate students were trained, one of whom was a minority and four undergraduate students, two female and two male. We published five technical papers, have one currently pending review and another in preparation for publication. We presented our work at 22 national and local meetings. As a result of the grant, we perfected the design of the CCBR and applied for and received a follow on NSF GOALI grant, continuing with Dr. Idone of Regeneron, to explore addition of 3D printed scaffolds consisting of a mixture of human or cattle chondrocytes, and human adult stem cells grown in the CCBR.
