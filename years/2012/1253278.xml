<AbstractNarration>Mammals are home to a vast consortium of commensal bacteria that help shape and maintain host health. While some resident microbes have beneficial consequences to the host, others are detrimental. Pathogenic and commensal bacteria share many of the same molecular motifs, making it unclear how the host immune system discriminates between beneficial and harmful bacterial species. Vertebrates possess a unique gene family, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC),that allows for activation of a tailored immune response toward a specific microbe. The fundamental function of the MHC gene locus is to allow the immune system to discriminate between "self" and "non-self" tissue, thus allowing the immune system to destroy microbial invaders, while preventing the immune system from attacking cells of the animal's own body. However, the investigators propose an additional, thus far un-appreciated role for the MHC: that a major driving force in the evolution of the MHC, beyond its long-known roles in animal "self" recognition and eradication of pathogens, is the need for animals to maintain a homeostatic relationship with their commensal microbial communities.  This project will test this novel hypothesis using genetic and molecular approaches coupled with microbiota transfers into germfree mice. These studies have the potential to reveal how microbial communities are constructed within the host and to identify novel principles by which the host and microbes communicate. If the MHC is proven to govern the assembly of commensal communities, then animal "self" will need to be redefined to include not just the host animal itself, but also the animal's commensal microbiota. Educational goals of this project include research training for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students. In addition, the investigator and her students will work with staff of a local natural history museum to create a summer science camp that teaches middle school children about their own commensal microbiota.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit  It has been appreciated for decades that many organisms on this planet rely on symbiotic relationships to survive and thrive. Similarly, mammals harbor a vast consortium of commensal organisms that have only recently begun to be appreciated as playing an integral role in mammalian development. Because symbiotic bacteria have been associated with mammals since their inception, we propose that a major driving force in the evolution of the mammalian immune system has been the need to maintain homeostatic relationships with commensal bacteria and thus our microbiota is as much a part of our ?self? as our own genome encoded proteins.  The role for MHC in microbiota-host interactions has never before been tested. If our hypotheses are proven correct, the results of the studies herein will transform long-standing ideas about the function and evolution of mammalian immunity through the testing of the following novel concepts:   1) Current dogma suggests that MHC presentation of microbial antigens results in onlyimmunity, however we propose that mucosal MHC provides an antigen specific means to induce toleranceto commensal bacteria and therefore represents a primary means to assemble microbial communities.    2) The current paradigm is that increased MHC diversity increases the hosts ability to eliminatepathogens, however we propose that increased MHC diversity within the intestine will permit a wider variety of commensal microbial communities to persistwithin the host.  This work has provided an additional explanation for why MHC has been maintained as a polymorphic locus and has provided in depth insight into how complex microbial communities are formed.   Broader Impacts   This grant has supported the training, growth and development of multiple individuals including a postdoctoral fellow that has now begun his own laboratory based on the results of these studies, graduate students and technicians.
