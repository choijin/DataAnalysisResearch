<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to study the surface wind based on reanalysis data, weighing the&lt;br/&gt;influence of the large-scale atmospheric circulation and local atmospheric boundary layer destabilization on its changes. Further, a budget including all variables in the sea ice momentum balance will be calculated using a state-of-the-art ice?ocean model. This enables the estimation of the individual effect of surface wind and ocean stresses, ice thickness, and ice concentration on the recently observed acceleration of the Arctic sea ice motion. Likely changes in the partitioning of air?sea and ice?sea stresses at the ocean surface due to the shrinkage of the ice area will be taken into account. For this purpose the model results will be validated with satellite data of ice concentration and ice drift. These findings will finally be combined into an integrative picture documenting and explaining the changes of the momentum flux into the Arctic Ocean during the past three decades. The proposed research will also aim to predict the future evolution of the momentum flux. Recently, it has been hypothesized that coupled global circulation models are incapable of correctly projecting trends in Arctic sea ice characteristics, perhaps because they lack dynamic feedback processes involving sea ice strength. The proposed work will aim to either disprove the hypothesis or understand the possible deficiencies of common sea ice models to represent such dynamic feedbacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased momentum flux from the atmosphere to the Arctic Ocean can be expected to result in more vertical mixing, possibly bringing warmer waters from depth to near the sea surface where they may contribute to acceleration of the loss of sea ice.  This study will enhance our ability to understand and predict the future changes in this momentum flux.  Consequently, it contributes to our understanding and management of resource extraction, shipping, and ecosystem change in the Arctic, all of which depend on the evolution of the sea ice cover.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The reduction of arctic sea ice over the past decades has gained major scientific and public attention. Sea ice inhibits the exchange of heat, moisture, and gases between the atmosphere and the ocean.  Our NSF-funded project "InMotion: Influx of Momentum into the Arctic Ocean &ndash; Changes Associated with Sea Ice Reduction" was designed to investigate how a changing sea ice cover affects the amount of wind energy entering the Arctic Ocean.  In the Arctic, wind is the dominant driver of sea ice and ocean motion. Momentum transfer (or "stress") from the atmosphere into the ocean generally depends on two factors: (i) wind speed and (ii) surface roughness.  Roughness changes in response to changing ocean surface waves and variations in the geometry of ice floes and ridges. There are three roughness regimes in the Arctic Ocean: (i) At very high ice concentrations, say near 100%, the pack ice is so compact that it barely responds to the wind forcing and hence also shields the ocean from the wind. (ii) Slightly lower ice concentrations, about 80-90%, reduce the pressure within the ice pack to a minimum, and still provide plenty of floe edges and ridges for high drag. We refer to this as an "optimal ice concentration," because ocean surface stress is maximal in this case (iii) For still lower ice concentrations, stress declines because open water (even with surface waves) is generally smoother than pack ice.  Our simulation enables us to create a map of annual mean Arctic-wide ocean stress. Ocean stress is high where wind forcing is strong and the ice cover is generally less compact, such as in the Nordic and Barents Seas.  Stress is low where the pack ice is thick and dense, e.g. north of Greenland, or where there is rigid winter landfast ice, e.g., along the Siberian coast. A belt of moderate ocean stress lies between these two regions.  Annual mean ocean surface stress over the Arctic Ocean is increasing, with a recent steepening of the trend.  Since there is no significant increase in the wind forcing, i.e. the source of momentum, over the same period, we link this increase entirely to the decrease in sea ice thickness. A thinner and thus weaker ice cover has less resistive force against the wind forcing, and hence enables greater momentum transfer into the ocean.  On the other hand, we found that a shrinking summer sea ice extent means less momentum flux into the ocean in that season. How is that? In the 1980s and 1990s most of the Arctic Basin featured the optimal ice concentration of 80-90% even in summers. In recent years however, summer sea ice concentration has greatly decreased to much lower values. These vast areas of open water provide less drag to the wind forcing and overall ocean stress decreases at a small but significant rate.  What does the future hold? Increasing summer open water areas might eventually cause a reversal in the annual mean trend from increasing stress toward decreasing stress.  But this assumes that wind forcing and ocean surface waves do not grow, and assumption that might prove incorrect in a changing climate.  This illustrates the fascinating interplay between opposing forces that will determine the magnitude of Arctic Ocean currents in the future.
