<AbstractNarration>This project will further understanding of ocean-ice-atmosphere interaction around the Jakobshavn Isbrae and Disko Bay region of west Greenland, with a particular focus on the role of sea surface temperature and sea ice variability in modulating past outlet glacier behavior and ice sheet/cap mass balance (snowfall and melt) over the past two centuries.  The PIs will reconstruct past environmental conditions in the Disko and Baffin Bay region based on new glaciochemical and stratigraphic records from three 100-m deep ice cores, several firn cores, and geophysical studies from three sites surrounding Disko Bay.  Their field activities will commence in 2013 with the primary ice coring activity in 2014 and lab and computation work following to derive climate reconstructions from the cores.  The results will complement recent glaciological studies of regional ice dynamic behavior, as well as recent paleoceanographic and glacial geologic reconstructions of conditions from this area and era.  Das and Frey will each supervise a full-time PhD student, and Evans will supervise undergraduate research assistants and senior theses.  A high school science teacher will also participate in the field work and interact with students at his school in Massachusetts as well as from the ice.</AbstractNarration>

The Nuussuaq core, however, &nbsp;reached within a few meters of the bed, covering nearly 2500 years, so the layer thickness was significantly influenced both by vertical compression and by accumulation-rate variations.&nbsp; We analyzed GPS ice-penetrating radar data both from our survey and from airborne surveys conducted by NASA&rsquo;s Operation Ice Bridge to develop a detailed model of the bed topography beneath the Nuussuaq ice cap, which provided a precise estimate of the ice thickness at the coring site.&nbsp; We used this information, combined with layer-age information from the core (provided by the Woods Hole group, in collaboration with Dr. Joe McConnell and the Desert Research Institute) in an inverse-modeling scheme that yielded an age-depth scale, and an uncertainty estimate that takes into account the accuracy of the age-depth picks, as well as the uncertainty in our estimate of the ice thickness. &nbsp;We exchanged draft versions of this age-depth scale with the Woods Hole group, who used it to help locate more potential layer picks. &nbsp;Figure 2 shows the final age-depth scale and the misfits for the picked layers, as well as the range of model ages that were less than 20% more complex than the best model. &nbsp;Figure 3 shows the accumulation rates associated with the acceptible accumulation histories, and the model complexity as a function of the esimated ice thickness. &nbsp;These plots show that there is a relatively narrow range of ice thicknesses that are consistent with the measured layer ages, and that these ages constrain the age-depth scale to within a few years, but that there is around a 20% range of accumulation-rate values that are consistent with these measurements. &nbsp;We have a draft manuscript describing the inversion techniques and the field measurements that we expect to be finished in as Matt Osman completes his Ph.D work on the Nuussuaq and other cores. &nbsp;</p> <p>The data for this project have been submitted to ArcticData.io:</p> <p><a href="https://arcticdata.io/catalog/#view/arctic-data.14377.1">https://arcticdata.io/catalog/#view/arctic-data.14377.1</a></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Benjamin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Smith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205062/1205062_10207658_1512068365306_Location_and_iceT--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205062/1205062_10207658_1512068365306_Location_and_iceT--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure(1): Surface topography and bed elevation for the Nuussuaq site"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205062/1205062_10207658_1512068365306_Location_and_iceT--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure(1): Surface topography and bed elevation for the Nuussuaq site"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Shaded-relief topography (contours show elevations) inferred from satellite photogrammetry, and color-coded bed topography inferred from ice-penetrating radar (color-coded points).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ben Smith</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Benjamin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Smith</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure(1): Surface topography and bed elevation for the Nuussuaq site</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205062/1205062_10207658_1512068764962_age_depth_and_errors--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205062/1205062_10207658_1512068764962_age_depth_and_errors--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2: Age-depth scales and their errors for the Nuusuaq site"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205062/1205062_10207658_1512068764962_age_depth_and_errors--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Age-depth scales and their errors for the Nuusuaq site"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Top: ages for picked layers (circles) and the derived age-depth models.
