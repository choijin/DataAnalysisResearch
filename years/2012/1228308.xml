<AbstractNarration>This proposal concerns the development of theory and algorithms for knowledge discovery in large data clouds characterized on Grassmann and Flag manifolds. This work includes applications to the detection of geometric misclassifications as well as the development of algorithms to exploit recent work on the detection of spatially-correlated Gaussian time-series. The investigators propose a mathematical framework centered on computing statistics for data clouds on Grassmann and Flag manifolds.  This includes, for example, a theoretical characterization of a Schubert Variety of Best Fit. The results of the research will be applied to data sets that include, e.g., automatic identification of insects, the brain computer interface, statistical signal processing, foliage diversity in landscapes, automatic identification through hyperspectral imagery, acoustic arrays, super-resolution, and action recognition in video sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed interdisciplinary research program addresses a major challenge in research related to the processing and extraction of meaningful information from large collections of data. The investigators' propose new geometric and statistical tools for classifying patterns of interest. The research program provides students with a unique multidisciplinary experience and research integration in education. Goals of the research include optimizing the detection, characterization and classification of features and anomalies in signals. A Data Set Repository of a broad nature for the purpose of furthering national expertise in Geometric Data Analysis. This repository will facilitate the development of algorithms ofinterest to a range of scientific interests.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project concerned the development of new algebraic and geometric approaches for the theoretical and algorithmic analysis of large data sets. One key idea that was developed throughout the course of this work was the notion of representing a set of data in such a manner that it can be compared to other sets of data.  The resulting set of tools produced over the course of this award enable researchers to measure similarities or differences in massive amounts of data encoded in the geometric framework known as the Grassmannian.  We illustrated the power of the methodology by exploring high-dimensional data sets and multui-way arrays such as hyperspectral images and movies.  The proposed representation of a set of points as a subspace leads to a broad array of mathematical questions.  In contrast to numbers, or vectors, the mean of a subspace can't be computed using the usual definition since the geometry of subspaces is only locally flat.   We address the question of averaging subspaces and provide a new efficient algorithm for accomplishing this equipped with a rule for determining the appropriate dimension of the mean subspace.  Additionally, we propose to to compute distances from subspaces to sets of other subspaces constrained to satisfy additional properties.  This approach reveals geometroc structure inherent in sets of patterns in high dimensions.  Further, we develop the mathematical apparatus required to solve optimization problems in this setting.   These results are now being applied to the problem of detecting objects, invariant to their articulation, by matching to a subspace that has been averaged from experimental images.  Another computational tool and theoretical result  generated by this research is an effective means to compute generalized curvatures of parameterized curves in arbitrarily high dimensions.  This methodology has been applied to the time-series segmentation problem which has broad applications including the auotmatic detection and characterization of human motion.  Over the course of this research program five graduate students completed their Ph.D. degrees and all have been employed directly after graduation.  Of these, one is in industry, two in academia and one with a government laboratory.          Last Modified: 01/03/2017       Submitted by: Michael J Kirby]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
