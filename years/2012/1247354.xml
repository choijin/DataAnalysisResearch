<AbstractNarration>The questions in this proposal are centered around 4 different but deeply connected research areas in commutative algebra: local cohomology, algebraic D-modules, F-singularities, and homological conjectures. Local cohomology is the common thread. For example, the study of Frobenius actions on local cohomology modules has been fruitful in the study of F-singularities, and the content of local cohomology, a notion introduced by Hochster and Huneke, has provided a number of new approaches to homological conjectures, and in the study of local cohomology, algebraic D-module theory has proven to be indispensable. The PI wants to study various aspects of local cohomology and their applications to both F-singularities and homological conjectures and to investigate a characteristic-free notion of holonomicity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is mainly concerned with questions in commutative algebra and their applications to algebraic geometry. Algebraic sets are sets of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Commutative algebra studies functions over algebraic sets (in commutative algebra, these algebraic sets can be over any commutative rings); while algebraic geometry studies the geometric or topological aspects of algebraic sets (in algebraic geometry, these algebraic sets are very often over a field). These two areas are closely related and are mutually beneficial. Questions in this proposal can be considered as questions about the existence of solutions to systems of polynomial equations and the topological or geometric nature of the solution sets.</AbstractNarration>

Commutative algebra is the study of algebraic sets which are the solutions to polynomial equations in a commutative ring.

During the life of this award, 16 papers have been published or accepted by peer-review journals and 4 papers have been submitted. Below I will mention a few specific outcomes.   A long-standing open problem regarding the finiteness property of local cohomology modules was settled in my joint work with Bhatt, Blackly, Lyubeznik, and Singh.   With Katzman, we discovered the first ever practical algorithm to compute the support of a local cohomology module over a field field and we used this algorithm to solve a problem that has been open for 20 years.    With Katzman, we discovered a connection between a classical invariant, Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, and the discreteness property of a newly introduced invariants, the F-jumping numbers.  With Ma, we introduced a new class of D-modules, Eulerian graded D-modules, and our study of Eulerian graded D-modules has shed new light on the structure of local cohomology modules.   With Schwede, we proved that F-pure and F-regular singularities satisfy the classical Bertini theorems and discovered a surface on which F-injectivity fails to satisfy Bertini theorems.   With Sezer, we classified the modular representations of Z/pZ whose rings of co-invariants are Gorenstein.       Last Modified: 09/28/2015       Submitted by: Wenliang Zhang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
