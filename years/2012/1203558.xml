<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the use of naturally-occurring radon as a tracer for gas exchange in seasonally ice-covered waters in the Arctic Ocean, using ships of opportunity for sampling. At its maximum extent, sea ice covers nearly 10% of the ocean surface, which creates an important control on the exchange of heat and biogenic gases (CO2, O2, DMS) between the ocean and atmosphere. In the Arctic, the summer minimum in sea ice cover is rapidly decreasing and this implies a greater oscillation between the minimum and maximum sea ice extents. The effect of this increased oscillation on the net air-sea exchange of gases is not certain because sea ice is interconnected with upper ocean physics and biology. What appears certain, is that the Arctic surface ocean will experience greater variability in ice cover and this increase in variability emphasizes the need for a predictive map of air-sea gas exchange versus the forcing conditions in the sea ice zone. Sea surface convection during freezing, stratification by meltwater, and the presence of interspersed ice floes may exert important controls on the gas transfer velocity and flux of biogenic gases. A well-constrained determination of the flux of CO2 in sea ice, and in turn a well-constrained budget of polar ocean carbon, will require more detailed knowledge of gas transfer velocity in the presence of sea ice. This study proposes to make an exploratory map of the scaling relationship between the gas transfer velocity and the forcing conditions in the seasonal sea ice zone, by combining estimates of the gas transfer velocity from radon measurements with forcing conditions (such as wind and upper ocean turbulence) from Arctic Observing Network measurements and from model results. In addition to its impact on understanding carbon cycling, the project will support an early career investigator, and a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to determine the rate of exchange of gases between the ocean and the atmosphere, when sea ice is present.  Sea ice covers much of the Arctic Ocean throughout the year, but sea ice cover is also changing as a result of warming in the Arctic.  The rate of exchange of gases between the ocean and atmosphere is important to know because the ocean absorbs and stores carbon dioxide produced by human activity, and because large quantities of climatically-active gases such as methane are stored in the Arctic sea bed.  If these gases are liberated, the rate of air-sea exchange will partially determine whether the gas reaches the atmosphere, where it is able to participate in the greenhouse effect.  This project has determined that the average rate of gas transfer is approximately 40% faster than we would expect, given the restriction imposed by sea ice cover.  The average rate of gas transfer was determined to be 4.0 meters per day.  We do not yet have a concrete explanation for the faster-than-expected rate, but we suspect the rate is driven by the dynamics of ice itself, which generate turbulence in the water.  Turbulence in the water is an important factor determining the rate of air-sea exchange.  Beyond measuring the rate of air-sea transfer, we would like to predict it.  We used an ocean model to attempt to predict the measurements of gas transfer.  We found that the data quality used to drive ocean models forward in time is not accurate enough to produce realistic ocean currents on the small scale necessary for these predictions.  As a result, prediction of air-sea gas transfer is still a work in progress.    More research is needed to determine those processes that really drive gas exchange when ice cover is present.  It is valuable to use different methods for estimating air-sea gas transfer rates, and work to achieve a concensus between the methods.  Future projects would benefit from dedicated examination of these processes using multiple measuring techniques at the same time and in the same locations       Last Modified: 01/29/2017       Submitted by: Brice Loose]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
