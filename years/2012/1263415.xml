<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of Alaska Anchorage that will provide research training for 30 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013-2015. The program is designed to actively engage undergraduates in faculty-mentored, independent research in the areas of Ecology and Physiological Ecology in South-central Alaska. The opportunities offered by Alaska as a natural laboratory for high latitude ecological studies are unparalleled. The program is intended to positively influence undergraduates toward postgraduate education and careers in the sciences. It is guided by four main objectives: 1) to help students develop critical thinking skills, 2) to increase student interest in pursuing careers in sciences and to engage students directly in discussions surrounding graduate school and career options, 3) to increase student independence as researchers, and 4) to attract a diverse range of students into the program. The program is structured to involve students in all aspects of scientific investigation and inspire them through direct exposure to ecological and physiology phenomena in Alaska. Students are mentored toward increased independence as the program progresses. Weekly research seminars, a series of career development workshops that include a focus on ethics and responsible conduct in research, and a variety of fieldtrips and social activities facilitate student learning and development. The program concludes with a student research symposium. Students from underrepresented minority groups and from institutions with limited opportunities for research are targeted during recruiting efforts. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://uaa.alaska.edu/reu/ , or by contacting the PI (Dr. David Pfeiffer at afdcp@uaa.alaska.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Khrystyne Duddleston at afkd1@uaa.alaska.edu.)</AbstractNarration>
