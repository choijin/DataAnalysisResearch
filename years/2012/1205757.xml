<AbstractNarration>There is growing global importance of ocean exploration and monitoring as the oceans play a major role in climate regulation, nutrient production, resource retrieval and transportation, etc. Building and deploying a real-time underwater networked sensing infrastructure is thus needed for desired levels of monitoring and data collection. Despite a wave of research efforts in the area of underwater wireless networks, the lack of a community testbed has so far hampered further advances, as there is no common platform to evaluate and compare various communication and networking algorithms and protocols. Furthermore very few studies can afford to consider real system features due to the high cost of system deployment and maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the design and deployment of an open underwater testbed suite, accessible to the public at four sites in Connecticut, California, Texas, and Washington States. The testbed will include flexible choices of surface nodes, bottom nodes, and mobile nodes with reconfigurable modems. It will enable the vision of remote controlled and continuous networked node deployments running tests of communication, networking, sensing, and data streaming. In addition, the testbed will enable oceanographers to study scientific research questions, while using the testbed as a prototype for larger real-time monitoring deployments elsewhere. The testbed will also directly impact undergraduate research and student diversity by involving undergraduate students through REU programs, impacting curriculum development by enabling field courses, and engaging K-12 students and teachers, particularly in underserved communities.</AbstractNarration>

Specific Outcomes  Ocean-TUNE UCLA testbed - WaterCom provides multiple experiment platforms facilitating various stages of underwater wireless network protocols and applications development and evaluation. Reliable, reconfigurable MAC protocols for mobile underwater networksThe protocols feature opportunistic transmission scheduling properties required for the reliable data transfer in underwater networks. External Experimenters: Michigan Tech University &ndash; an UW Research team from Michigan Technological University has conducted a channel estimation experiment using the UCLA field testbed in Spring, 2017. An OFDM waveform was transmitted by Node 2, 3 and 4 in the Marina testbed. By processing the received signal, the channel impulse responses of each acoustic link were estimated.
