<AbstractNarration>The proposed research will investigate how different rates of dispersal in marine snails can influence their ability to adapt to water temperatures.  The investigators will compare the larval and juvenile traits of two species of snail (genus Crepidula) under different temperature regimes.  One of the species (C. fornicata) has larvae that live in the water for 2-4 weeks and disperse with ocean currents; the other (C. convexa) has larvae that disperse by crawling away as juveniles.  Previous research has shown that C. convexa has much lower dispersal than C. fornicata, and that this lower dispersal may allow the species to adapt to local water temperatures.  The current project will rear larvae and juveniles of both species at an ambient temperature and a stressful, higher temperature to investigate the genetic basis of temperature tolerance in these species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important because it will help to elucidate the links between dispersal mode, gene flow, and extant local adaptation as related to future adaptation in the face of warming climate, one of the most pressing questions facing organismal biologists today. &lt;br/&gt;In addition to being a valuable model system to answer these questions, the issue of range shifts or expansions in C. fornicata is of management interest. The species is invasive in Europe and has impacted its invaded ecosystems. These same impacts may also apply to the native range of C. fornicata as the species expands its range and abundance northward in response to warming water temperature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  A challenge facing organisms as climates change around the world is whether they will be able to adapt to these changes.  The process of evolutionary adaptation can be slowed by too little genetic variation (where the DNA of all individuals is too similar for change to happen).   Populations that are at the edge of a speciesÃ† range are expected to have lower genetic variation.  However, this prediction made by mathematical theory has not been universally supported in nature.  We studied genetic variation in central and edge populations of two species of marine snail (Crepidula fornicata and C. convexa; see pictures).  Crepidula fornicata has larvae that live in the ocean for up to a month, dispersing over long distances, while C. convexa does not have a free-living larva.  Instead, juvenile snails crawl away from their mother, moving only as far as they can crawl.  We expected that this difference in dispersal would influence any reduction in genetic variation that we found: C. fornicataÃ†s greater dispersal ability means that it should be easier for populations of this species to exchange genes, and therefore a reduction in diversity seems less likely for this species.  Study and results  We sampled these two species in populations ranging from Newfoundland, Canada to New Jersey (four populations each; see map), and used high-throughput DNA sequencing technology to look at variations in their genetic code across the whole genome.  We found that edge populations of both species showed slightly reduced genetic variation relative to central populations.  Surprisingly, this was the case in both species, even though they have very different dispersal abilities &ndash; and this result matches theoretical predictions.  However, the populations of C. fornicata that we studied were much farther apart geographically than those in C. convexa.  Although C. fornicata may be able to exchange genes more easily than C. convexa over a given spatial scale, that does not mean that very distant populations of C. fornicata are particularly well-connected.   Another interesting thing we found was that populations of C. fornicata in Canada are very different from those in New York and Massachusetts.  In addition, snails in Newfoundland are different from those in Nova Scotia, despite being close together.  These differences may be because of patterns of ocean currents in the area moving water from west to east: the larvae of this species are not good swimmers, so they are at the mercy of the currents.  Because these edge populations, in both Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, are relatively isolated from other populations of C. fornicata, they may be in the process of adapting to the extreme conditions found in these areas.  Implication and impact  This work provides information about how much genetic variation is in these populations of Crepidula species.  C. fornicata is known to cause problems in Europe, where it is an introduced species: it alters how fast sediment accumulates in bays, and changes the habitat on the bottom (and the communities that can live there).  In its native North American range, it is expanding northward with warming water, and may become an ecologically important species in these areas as it becomes more abundant in the future.  Our work is the first to study genome-wide diversity in C. fornicata from the northern edge of its range.  Further studies should investigate the consequences of this reduction in genetic diversity: what does it mean for populations of this species at the edge, as they must adapt to future conditions?
