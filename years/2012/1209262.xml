<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  This project is a collaboration between two of the leading research groups in the area of ultra-high temperature ceramics, namely the Institute for the Science and Technology for Ceramics (ISTEC) in Faenza, Italy and the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, MO.   The team at ISTEC includes Dr. Frederic Monteverde and Dr. Diletta Sciti who are funded separately by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) in Italy.  The focus of the combined effort is on fundamental aspects of processing and microstructure of boride-based ceramics to improve their mechanical properties at elevated temperature.  Boride ceramics, such as zirconium diboride, are currently capable of withstanding sustained mechanical loads over a range of temperatures but fail catastrophically under extreme loads and under the extreme thermomechanical conditions for which they are being researched and developed.  Applications include thermal protection systems for hypersonic flight, containment materials and fuel forms for nuclear reactors, high-speed cutting tools for machining, and ultra-high temperature refractories for metal production. The focal point of this project is the development of a dual composite architecture designed to create a new paradigm of structural ceramics with superior mechanical properties at elevated temperatures and in extreme environments.  The ability to utilize dual composite ceramics in commercial applications, in extreme environments, will provide improvements in both energy efficiency and sustainability of future systems such as hypersonic aircraft and molten metal containment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:  Utilizing the combined expertise of the research group at ISTEC in diboride-silicide ceramics and the processing and properties of hierarchical ceramic composites expertise of the research group at Missouri S&amp;T, the goal of the project is the development of a new paradigm of dual composite ceramics with improved elevated temperature mechanical properties.  Zirconium diboride that is liquid phase sintered with molybdenum disilicide is being used as a base composition for the dual composite ceramics, although the concept is broadly applicable to any thermodynamically compatible material system.  The role of controlling the structure and microstructure of ceramics at multiple length scales (i.e., a dual composite architecture) on the elevated temperature mechanical behavior of boride-based ceramics is being investigated using experimental studies, physics-based models, and analytical characterization techniques. The project is timely based on the global need to develop new ceramic materials for applications in extreme environments.  Furthermore, the outcome of the research has the potential to transform state of the art boride ceramics into ceramics capable of extending the lifetime and use temperature of ceramics for applications in extreme environments, including hypersonic flight vehicles, nuclear reactors, molten metal and glass containment vessels, and others.  Finally, ceramic materials for extreme environments is an area of research and development that is highly specialized and in dire need of more trained scientists and engineers to lead future research efforts.  The project is directly impacting this area of the ceramic field by facilitating the exchange of young, underrepresented researchers from both institutions and by directly training a graduate student and two undergraduate students in the processing, testing, and characterization of ceramics for use in extreme environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Materials World Network project 1209262 supported the research of one graduate student and four undergraduate in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Missouri S&amp;T. One journal paper has been written, two more are in progress and a total of six are planned for submission covering the work funded by this project. One contributed poster presentation and eight contributed oral presentations resulted from the research. The graduate student, and undergraduate students, participated in outreach activities that brought over 450 high school students into the laboratories at Missouri S&amp;T for demonstrations, hand-on experiments, or summer camps. The graduate student assisted two groups of high school students with their research scholar projects using equipment in the University?s laboratories, one of which was awarded the high school?s science award. The project supported international research collaboration by supporting the graduate student?s travel to CNR-ISTEC in Feanza, Italy for three summers to work with experienced researchers who are widely respected experts in ZrB2-MoSi2 ceramics. A comprehensive study of the processing, microstructural characterization, and properties of ZrB2-MoSi2 ceramics was conducted.  The results included the first ever quantification of the volume fraction of (Zr,Mo)B2 solid solution shell structure in ZrB2-MoSi2 ceramics, fracture toughness measurements of ZrB2-MoSi2 ceramics at elevated temperatures, flexure strength measurements of ZrB2 with greater than 20 volume percent MoSi2 additions at elevated temperature, identification of the critical flaws responsible for mechanical failure at room temperature in ZrB2-MoSi2 ceramics, and fabrication of novel, Dual Composite Architectures specifically designed for improved fracture toughness in ceramics at elevated temperatures.
