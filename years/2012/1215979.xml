<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Ikaros Bigi, Antonio Delgado, and Christopher Kolda at the University of Notre Dame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LHC is now taking data at an impressive rate.  This data is likely to demonstrate the need to modify the Standard Model of particle physics in order to accommodate new particles and perhaps even new interactions.  Professors Bigi, Delgado, and Kolda propose to analyze this possibility within the framework of exotic models such as supersymmetry, strongly coupled Higgs sectors, or extra dimensions.  A careful study of how the new data can be accommodated into models of new physics will be performed.  Special attention will also be paid to the implications of new physics for processes that lead to a violation of flavor symmetries --- situations which are very rare in the Standard Model but which nevertheless can provide the smoking gun for a new model of particle physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  Professors Bigi, Delgado and Kolda will continue their activities teaching physics at the undergraduate and graduate levels, lecturing at graduate physics summer schools, organizing workshops and conferences around the world, teaching particle physics to high school teachers and students through QuarkNet, using new technologies to better advise and retain STEM majors at Notre Dame, and preparing STEM graduate students for careers in academia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this proposal was to explore the physics related to the electroweak breaking using the data generated at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. That is the biggest collider built by men so far and in July of 2012 it discovered the last building block of the Standard Model, the Higgs boson, responsible of the breaking of the electroweak symmetry and predicted more than thirty years along. This discovery alone has made the LHC a success but more discoveries are expected and this proposal has analyzed the different possibilities that exist now that we have discovered the Higgs. In particular different extensions of the Standard Model where analyzed:  -Supersymmetry: Possibility of discovering extra Higgses or new particles.  -Strongly coupled models: Deviation on the properties of the Higgs.  -Flavor physics: How new physics will affect low energy precise measurement in rare decays.  The main results of the proposal were presented in several international conferences and lead to more than 20 publications in refereed journals. During the course of the award three graduate students finished their Ph D and one postdoc was supported by the grant.  On the broader impact aspect the PIs were involved in different outreach activities like public lectures, developing new courses to attract undergraduates into particle physics or working with high school teachers to incorporate several aspects of research into their classrooms.
