<AbstractNarration>Nearly 100,000 of the 730,000 people who exit state and federal prisons each year in the US are women. This population has grown quickly since the 1970s. Women are targets for intervention by organizations that work to reform, educate, save spiritually, or otherwise prepare ex-prisoners for community life as citizens with rights and duties. This process is known as prisoner reentry: voluntary or mandatory programming to make prisoners worthy of their belonging as citizens. Increasingly, this work falls on community-based organizations (religious and secular, for-profit and not-for-profit). With the increased outsourcing of this work, organizations with different visions for women ex-prisoners as citizens are engaged, sometimes targeting women particularly, but sometimes merely including women in predominantly male reentry programs.  This research examines what such community organizations actually do, in their delivery of messages about belonging and rights in gendered ways, and in the treatment of women as inviting targets for morally-motivated interventions. The PIs use re-incorporation as citizens as a framework for examining programs addressing work, parenting, and romantic relationships.  Three types of organizations are compared: secular organizations guided by therapeutic practices; religiously inspired organizations guided by faith principles, expecting workforce participation or education in participants; and reciprocally religious organizations expecting an expression of faith from participants.  The study employs multiple data sources, including administrative and organizational records, interviews with organizational staff and officials, and personal observations of programming in two southern Wisconsin counties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will illuminate variation in how organizations understand women ex-prisoners as citizens along the dimensions of work, parenting, and romantic relationships. The research team includes undergraduate researchers who are being trained in data coding and basic textual analysis. Ultimately, the project will inform the criminal justice system with regard to the utility of community-based organizations that provide services to women ex-prisoners attempting to reenter society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An unprecedented number of people is now leaving prisons and returning to communities, in the United States overall and in the state of Wisconsin in particular. In response, over the past 10 to 15 years, the field of services geared toward ex-prisoners has rapidly grown. The field encompasses such varied work as drug treatment, job readiness classes, and bible studies. The process of devolution (passing off work to non-governmental parties) has made non-governmental organizations (NGOs) increasingly important in this field.  This study examined NGOs that work with formerly incarcerated people to prepare them for post-prison life. The approach values NGOs as providing means to social inclusion.

The study investigated how staff members' and policy-makers' visions of ideal citizens corresponded to programming and expectations of participants.  _Key results_. The project makes four scholarly contributions.  1) The study examines a wide field of services, not only famous programs receiving earmarked "reentry" funds.

This is a contribution to feminist and critical penology.  2) The study examines gendered work at NGOs, moving past a limiting analysis of gender as a variable that merely explains recidivism or desistance.
