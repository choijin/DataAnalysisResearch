<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to provide support for approximately 40 students to attend the American Society of Mechanical Engineers International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition in Houston, Texas, November 9-15, 2012.  The students will be selected on the basis of an application including a brief resume, a one-page statement of why they want to attend the conference, and a statement of support from their faculty advisor.  Consideration in the selection process will be given to inclusion of members of underrepresented groups and diversity of institutions that the students represent.  The students will also present posters on their research at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attendance at the conference will give the students a broader view of the engineering profession and of state-of-the-art research in their fields.  They will also meet the top researchers in their fields.  This exposure will significantly broaden their education, create greater enthusiasm for the research that they perform, and better acquaint them with expectations that they will face later in their careers.  This award will benefit the nation through the education of a skilled engineering workforce better prepared to meet the challenges of their chosen fields.</AbstractNarration>
