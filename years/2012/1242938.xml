<AbstractNarration>The Global Environment for Network Innovations 'GENI' is a suite of research infrastructure supported by the NSF that is rapidly emerging in prototype form across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for 'at scale' experiments in future internets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GENI Project Office organizes three major GENI Engineering conferences (GEC) per year, in which the entire GENI community meets to review current status, and to decide on subsequent steps in GENI's evolution. These GECs include community-based working groups leading GENI's design and planning, and demonstrating progress with live experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MIT is hosting the fourteenth edition of the GENI Engineering conference. This project supports organizing the demo session to be held on the MIT Campus. About 400 leading researchers and Ph.D. students from diverse US institutions will gather at MIT to showcase their ideas and results. The campus venue has an existing 10GB link which will provide access to the National Lambda Rail (NLR) network in addition to MIT's more standard Internet services.  Each demo will be provided with 1G wired connection to the GENI infrastructure.    Additionally, because MIT and its Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) provide wireless access to all guests, wireless will be available for demonstrations and participants.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The GEC Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication. It helps new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and encourages cross-university cooperation by providing a method for students and faculty to discover who amongst their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community.</AbstractNarration>
