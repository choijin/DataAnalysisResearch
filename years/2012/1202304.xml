<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a biocompatible, fabricated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent platform with novel properties, including sensory capability, and potential for wide application to biomedical research. The approach is to employ both top-down and self assembly approaches, incorporating environmentally responsive materials, to develop a class of contrast agents which address major limitations of currently available agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the development of next generation MRI contrast agents using micro- and nanofabrication techniques incorporating biocompatible magnetic materials to develop a series of geometrically precise, particulate contrast agents yielding distinct spectral signatures with multiplexing capability. In addition, the incorporation of biocompatible hydrogels, tunable to respond to myriad environmental stimuli, into the fabrication process will yield in vivo biological sensing capability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed MRI contrast agents includes an expanded role of MRI in biomedical applications from the bench to the bedside. Multiplexed imaging, paired with an in vivo sensing capability, would dramatically potentiate the study of myriad diseases using MRI. In addition to the research impact, this project offers a rich potential for educating pre-college, undergraduate and graduate students given its multidisciplinary nature, integrating materials science, micro- and nanofabrication techniques, as well as imaging science and a focus on biomedical application. Finally, the investigators will take part in Boston University's Summer High School Honors Program to mentor high school students on this project, a unique opportunity to expose the top students from across the country to a rich, interdisciplinary educational experience.</AbstractNarration>

Using both top-down and self assembly approaches to MRI contrast agent fabrication, this project aims to develop a class of contrast agents with engineered MRI properties. The current generation of MRI contrast agents is limited by a lack of multiplexed imaging, relatively low sensitivity, as well a lack of functional imaging or sensing capability. We aim to develop a series of geometrically precise, particulate contrast agents, using micro- and nanofabrication techniques incorporating biocompatible magnetic materials.</p> <p>This work highlights the importance of the rational design of particle systems using top-down engineering approaches, as well as the limitations in the current fabrication methods for size and shape specific particles. Other than particle size, other properties, including particle shape, mechanical property, surface property, etc., also have significant impact in determining how the particles will interact with the biological systems, such as the vascular circulation time, bio-distribution, cellular internalization, and pharmacokinetics. A scalable, low cost and easily accessible manufacturing platform was attempted to realize the full potential of micro- and nanoparticles in biomedical applications.</p> <p>Top-down approaches were employed in the rational design of two particle systems for their potential use as MRI and CT contrast agents, respectively. Specifically, the design, material characterization, particle fabrication and MRI validation of precisely engineered MRI contrast agents were investigated. Reactively sputtered iron oxide thin films with controllable saturation magnetic polarization were employed in the top-down fabrication of two types of biocompatible MRI contrast agent micro- and nanoparticles with geometry and magnetic property-dependent, tunable MRI spectral signatures. This unique approach enables the possibility for multiplexed imaging in MRI, as well as a diffusion driven signal amplification and the potential for functionalization.</p> <p>In addition, a nanomanufacturing platform was proposed and demonstrated, which represents the top-down engineering approach for polymeric micro- and nanoparticles with strict control over particle size and shape that can be used as a delivery vehicle for X-ray attenuating media for next-generation CT contrast agents. At the micro-scale, hydrogel particles carrying X-ray attenuating payloads were fabricated, their CT imaging capability were examined, and their mechanical properties were characterized, demonstrating superior tunable mechanical properties based on various parameters of the hydrogel fabrication process. At the nano-scale, a novel nanomanufacturing platform utilizing self-ordered nanoporous AAO membrane for fabricating size and shape specific polymeric nanorods, that is both scalable and cost-efficient, was proposed and demonstrated.</p> <p>Based on this project, which demonstrates evidence of a successful collaboration between the engineering and the clinical medical departments, there is growing recognition at the university level of the need to develop and sustain these types of important collaborations. More importantly, given the broad interdisciplinary nature of this research, graduate students have been afforded an outstanding opportunity to work in an area that bridges basic research and applications, mentor undergraduate students and middle- and high-school teachers, and publish their work in high-impact journals. Several honors/awards have been received by them during the course of the project, including 1) Boston University Cross-Disciplinary Training in Nanotechnology Fellowship; 2) Outstanding Paper Award in ASME Global Congress on Nano Engineering for Medicine and Biology; 3) Boston University Berman Future of Light Prize Award; 4) Boston University Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Award; and 5) Boston University Cheung Family Fellowship Award, etc.</p> <p>In addition to the impact on the biomedical research community, this project offered abundant opportunities for education given its multidisciplinary nature which integrates materials science, micro- and nanosystems, as well as imaging science and a focus on biomedical application. In addition to employing the efforts of undergraduate students each year, this research supported graduate students towards doctoral degree, serving to develop the next generation of highly interdisciplinary scientists. Multiple undergraduate students including female and underrepresented groups participated the project and gained knowledge, experience, and inspiration through the design, fabrication and testing of the micro- and nanoparticles.Teachers from public schools, especially those from the schools that work with the Massachusetts STEM Pipeline Networks and schools with high percentages of underrepresented minorities were also included in the project, resulting in healthy communication and inspirations among the teachers.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/27/2018<br>      Modified by: Xin&nbsp;Zhang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202304/1202304_10159854_1519764526528_Image_1_ZhangandAnderson_BostonUniversity--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202304/1202304_10159854_1519764526528_Image_1_ZhangandAnderson_BostonUniversity--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image_1_Zhang and Anderson_Boston University"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202304/1202304_10159854_1519764526528_Image_1_ZhangandAnderson_BostonUniversity--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image_1_Zhang and Anderson_Boston University"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Image 1.
