<AbstractNarration>Funds are  provided for the principal investigators (PIs) to participate in a project that aims to investigate the dynamics controlling fault continuity, strain partitioning, and interaction between multiple fault branches as fault systems evolve. Specifically, the proposed work will focus on the evolving relationship between the northern and central branches of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF). To evaluate a series of possible models describing this relationship, the project will use high-resolution multi-channel seismic (MCS) data already collected for the northern branch, and will collect new MCS data for the central branch. The data will be combined with modeling to characterize slip history, strain partitioning, and relative fault activity. Results will constrain the evolution of the NAF system and enable comparisons with other transform fault systems. Funds will allow the initial participation of the PIs on the Turkish reserach cruise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed work has direct implications for understanding seismic hazards in Turkey, and may also support a future IODP initiative in the area. It will strengthen international ties through ongoing collaboration with Turkish researchers. The PIs will continue ongoing outreach efforts. Data management includes archiving of data in various repositories within two years of acquisition/analysis.</AbstractNarration>

The profiles were critical to stratigraphic correlations between basins.         The project has produced three journal publications.

The third manuscript is about a type of basin formed by both horizontal and vertical slip on faults, comparing the basins near Istanbul to the Ridge Basin in California.       A fourth manuscript is very close to being submitted. We document the horizontal and vertical motions across the North Branch of the North Anatolia Fault (NAF-N) near Istanbul for the last half million years. The results of this manuscript and the three publications have implications to earthquake and other hazards to Istanbul and smaller cities and towns along Marmara Sea.          The project has produced three journal publications.
