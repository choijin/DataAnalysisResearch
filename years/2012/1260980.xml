<AbstractNarration>This project explores whether or not we can empirically test the assumption that people make decisions in economically rational ways.  The project combines the well-known microeconomic concept of revealed preference with recent results on nonparametric demand estimation.  The research team combines new research in economic theory, the development of new computational tools, and new statistical testing methods that include new test statistics, ways to estimate the distribution of these statistics, and ways to construct confidence intervals.  The methods are all intended for application to large data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project breaks new ground by building ideas and methods that bring together two very different areas of economics.  The results will allow for the empirical testing of key economic hypotheses using very large data sets in ways that are only now possible because of increased computing power.  The methods developed in this project will be useful for many other purposes; for example, businesses and governments will be able to use these methods to infer demand for new products from observed purchase decisions about existing products.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "Revealed Preference" is a concept at the intellectual heart of economics. It asks how much we can learn about people?s (economic) wants and desires by just observing economic actions, notably consumption choices, in real-world settings. This can serve the purpose of testing theories (and hence to understand behavior) but also of predicting future behavior, e.g. consumers? adjustments to policy, tax, or price changes.  The classical revealed preference literature stands out by imposing minimal assumptions that only reflect core economic principles, letting the data speak as freely as possible. The price is that predictions may not be very sharp, but they can then be contrasted with sharper predictions that depend on stronger assumptions. An important practical limitation was that, despite considerable effort in the literature, the connection to statistical testing was not yet satisfactory.  The NSF grant "Revealed Preference and Econometrics" funded research that aims at precisely this weakness and connects revealed preference analysis to cutting-edge econometric technique. A core project in the grant was "Nonparametric Testing of Random Utility Models" (by the PI with Yuichi Kitamura, resubmitted to Econometrica). This paper considers a setting in which consumption choices by a repeated cross-section of consumers are observed over a number of different price regimes, a typical feature of data collected both by government agencies and in commercial research. We provide a statistical test of the hypothesis that purchase data were generated by a population of consumers who are economically rational, but without otherwise restricting any individual preferences or the distribution over preferences. Thus, we allow for unrestricted, unobserved heterogeneity.

In addition, nonstandard features of the testing problem necessitate delicate modification of na&iuml;ve simulations of the test statistic. We also provide novel econometric theory to deal with the fact that expenditure is likely endogenous, that is, it was not (not even "as if") randomly assigned by an experimenter.  The empirical implementation suggests that observed choices are not precisely rationalizable even when allowing for unconstrained heterogeneity, but that the divergence is plausibly due to statistical error. This illustrates the necessity of proper statistical tests: The non-rationalizability of observed choices would otherwise be hard to interpret. The tools developed in this project should also be applicable to other delicate testing problems with similar features, notably the analysis of psychological random utility models and of games. Some such applications have already been implemented.  A recent extension of the project is a different model of individual rationality that was recently developed by the above authors with Rahul Deb and John Quah.

The statistical testing problem that emerges is closely related to the previous one, and an empirical implementation is in progress.
