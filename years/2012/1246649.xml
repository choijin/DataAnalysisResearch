<AbstractNarration>The Computing Research Association?s Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W) and the Coalition to Diversify Computing (CDC) Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) Alliance will (1) partially support under-represented minorities and women (URM+W) participants in established and enhanced Alliance programs and (2) establish the CRA Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline (CERP). CRA-W/CDC Alliance programs broaden participation in computing as they aim to make participants aware of the rewards of a research career and the value of a PhD; to help participants develop self-efficacy through increased knowledge, skills, and confidence; and to connect participants to the research community and to each other to further their success. CERP will conduct the first ever, longitudinal and national study of the factors that lead to research careers for all undergraduate and graduate students in computing; in particular, CERP will evaluate whether the Alliance intervention programs are effective at increasing participation of URM+W in computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alliance's goal is to grow the URM+W research community and positively impacting the career development of individual URM+W researchers. These impacts include institutional change in response to the Alliance's sustainability efforts and resources for the national BPC community and for the nation in general for similar programs to encourage computing research among the population in general. The project's evaluation efforts through CERP will yield a national comparison database that will become a powerful national resource for the CISE community and may also inform the wider research community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Computing Research Association’s Committee on Widening Participation (CRA-WP), formerly known as CRA-W, was established in 1991 with the goal of increasing the number of individual researchers from underrepresented groups in computing (UGC) (including women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities) who participate and succeed in computer science research at every stage of the research pipeline. Achieving these objectives requires that an increasing number of individuals from UGC start and progress to the next stage. The CRA-WP Alliance offers programs for participants from undergraduate to senior professional levels. Different career stages need different types of interventions. The interest in and choice of a particular career path are increased by interventions that improve one or more of the following: (1) outcome expectations (understanding and valuing the rewards of a particular outcome), (2) self-efficacy (a belief that one can successfully achieve an outcome), and (3) social supports that help one persist and overcome obstacles. Alliance programs aim to make participants aware of the rewards of a research career and the value of a Ph.D.; to help participants develop self-efficacy through increased knowledge, skills, and confidence; and to connect participants to the research community and to each other to further their success.  Distributed Research Experience for Undergraduates: This program matched undergraduate women and students from underrepresented groups with a faculty mentor for a summer research experience at the mentor’s home institution. Career Mentoring Tracks at the Grace Hopper Celebration: Focused on current and prospective faculty, this program aimed to enhance career development with advice, collaborations, mentoring, and peer networks.  Grace Hopper Celebration Research Scholars: A program for undergraduate Grace Hopper attendees providing small group mentoring, interaction with other research-interested students, and participation in research-focused events. Graduate Cohort Workshop for Women: Brought together women graduate students in the first, second, or third year of graduate school for a two-day workshop on graduate school survival, career planning, and networking. Graduate Cohort Workshop for Underrepresented Minorities and Persons with Disabilities: Aimed to increase the ranks of UGC by building and mentoring communities through their graduate studies. Based on the successful program for women, this program brought together graduate students in early, middle, and later years of graduate school for a two-day workshop. Collaborative Research Experiences for Undergraduates: A program designed to provide positive research experiences for teams of undergraduates who work during the academic year. Each team consisted of undergraduate students and sponsoring faculty members. Discipline-Specific Workshops: Provided mentoring support and built communities of UGC researchers within the context of a specific sub-discipline of computing. The workshops offered in-depth technical information, community, conversations, and potential collaborators focused on specific sub-disciplines. Distinguished Lecture Series: Sent faculty and lab researchers to campuses to encourage UGC to attend graduate school by arranging events at institutions that do not have a large number of researchers, women, or minority faculty. Cumulatively, the alliance programs supported through this project provided essential career skills, advice, and technical insight to 11,887 participants from a diversity of institutions &ndash; including 646 in research settings and 11,241 in conference settings.
