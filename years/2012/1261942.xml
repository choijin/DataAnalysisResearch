<AbstractNarration>In this project, quantitative measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC) utilizing the HAIS TOGA-GV instrument on the NCAR GV aircraft will be obtained as part of the Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) experiment proposed to take place during January and February 2014 from the island of Guam. CONTRAST is designed to measure the chemistry and transport of reactive chemical species into the tropical Tropopause Transition Layer (TTL) over the Western Pacific warm pool area. TOGA-GV measurements include a suite of volatile organic compounds C-2 (VOCs), including: oxygenates, non-methane hydrocarbons, halocarbons, and some nitrogen and sulfur containing species. The sources, chemistry, and transport of trace gases and their degradation products into the lower stratosphere in this region during the boreal winter season can substantially impact the chemistry of the lower stratosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trace gas concentrations measured in this campaign can influence atmospheric chemistry and climate and will provide a method of chemically describing transported air masses. Specific data will be obtained for: tracers of oceanic emissions and anthropogenic and biogenic activities, radical precursors, tracers of urban and biomass combustion emissions, products of oxidative processing, precursors to aerosol formation, and compounds important for aerosol modification and transformation. Better understanding of the processes in this region will improve process-oriented chemistry/climate models and their validation by providing a unique suite of benchmark measurements, especially in the characterization of active halogen chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our work, as a component of the CONTRAST experiment, provided insight into three broadly important aspects of tropical atmospheric chemistry. These included, the assessment of bromine source gases at the tropical western Pacific tropopause, determination of the role convection serves as a mechanism to move reactive organic compounds from the surface to the upper troposphere, and identification of the processes that transfer polluted air into the tropical western Pacific.  The amount of very short lived bromine at the tropopause (typically about 17 km for the CONTRAST domain) defines one route for injection of bromine from very short lived compounds to the stratosphere. The data in Figure 1 show the prevalence of two very short lived bromine compounds (CH2Br2 and CHBr3) throughout the tropospheric column. When supplemented by the bromine content of other VSL species such as CHBr2Cl, CH2BrCl, and CHBrCl2, it will represent the first experimental determination of bromine injection in the tropical western Pacific.   We quantified the influence of convection on the composition of the tropical western Pacific troposphere by sampling air masses in regions of active convective outflow, as well as nearby air masses not influenced by recent convection. Selected chemical species measured by us demonstrated the strong impact of convection on the composition of upper troposphere air masses, as indicated by the difference of the air masses from inside to outside of convective outflow. The persistent convection in this region leads to enhanced overall upper troposphere levels of reactive species such as benzene and acetone and thus affects the chemistry of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.  What brings dirty air into the tropics is an important theme of CONTRAST. During the experiment, flights targeted a number of cases where a significant difference of polluted versus clean air masses was observed. These cases included: 1) measurements both north and south of a well-defined ITCZ; 2) measurements in front of and behind a shear line, which moved into tropics from the northeast Asian continent; 3) sampling of a pollution plume brought into the tropical western Pacific region by the jet stream and the region?s anticyclonic flow; and 4) observations of the polluted tropical tropopause over Papua New Guinea versus the more pristine tropical tropopause over the Coral Sea. These situations provide insight and a means of assessing the importance of the mechanisms moving polluted air into tropical regions of the Pacific.
