<AbstractNarration>This action funds Lok-kun Tsui of the University of Virginia to conduct a research project, entitled "Storing sunlight in hydrogen with nanotube solar cells," during the summer of 2012 at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan.  The host scientist is Prof. Takayuki Homma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in a better understanding of the energy conversion performance in photoelectrochemical solar cells made from titanium dioxide nanotubes, sensitized to visible light with cuprous oxide and hematite. Specifically, the research objective of this project is to determine the correlation between the electronic structure, electrochemical and charge transport properties of these systems in order to design more efficient devices. This research has the potentail to advance U.S. energy independence by developing a way to produce storable solar energy in a scalable manner using low-cost materials and synthesis techniques. Further, it advances the fuel production stage needed for a future hydrogen economy. Understanding the properties of this titanium dioxide nanotube system and its surface modification can also move forward other technological applications including photocatalysis and sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
