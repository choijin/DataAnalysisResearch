<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the challenge of coupling direct drive servo actuators to industrial robotic plants with uncertainties. Enhanced productivity sought in many applications requires higher cycle rates placing great demands on machine kinematics, actuators and control systems. Further increase in operating speed must resolve dynamic challenges intrinsic in directly coupling servo actuators and robot linkages. When compared with existing electromechanical servo actuators - which route power through complex mechanical transmissions - direct-drive actuation of robot linkages enables simple mechanics and rapid motion, but does not provide dynamic isolation between the actuator and robotic plant. Consequently, direct-drive servo actuators are sensitive to variations in plant parameters, unknown disturbances, and un-modeled dynamics. This project will investigate and develop a prototype of an innovative, direct-drive pneumatic robot actuator that employs an advanced control strategy to rapidly accommodate dynamic system variations. Effectiveness of a new control strategy that relies on limited specific knowledge of the plant to optimize robustness to bounded uncertainties will be researched and developed. Success of this project will provide for significant advances in speed, load capacity, and affordability in contemporary industrial robotic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project involves engineering research conducted to enhance understanding of the dynamic interaction between direct-drive servo actuators and robotic mechanisms, and further to enhance the effectiveness and understanding of a control strategy which provides for an advantageous coupling between them, heretofore not practically feasible. This has the potential of introducing transformative change in the robotics industry, and to industrial automation in general. Furthermore, the controls knowledge gained from this research can be extended to many electric servo systems and to industrial control systems in general. Two market segments will be targeted: robotics and general motion control (GMC), both estimated at $7 billion. If software, peripherals and systems engineering are included, the robotics market is estimated at $19 billion. Both the robotics and GMC industries significantly support the national economy with applications ranging from manufacturing and food processing, to medical advances such as remotely controlled surgery, and to national defense. Well-paying new hi-tech jobs are created in engineering and technical services. This research will develop new applications in robotics and industrial automation, educational STEM opportunities, enhanced scientific and technological understanding, making the U.S. more competitive globally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal objective of this Phase II Project was to develop, prototype, test and evaluate a new control technique that is optimized for precision dynamic control of direct drive actuators.  Direct coupling an actuator to a plant is advantageous in simplicity of arrangement and cycle speed.  But it creates a dynamic challenge that drives the need for a robust control scheme to provide high fidelity motion control in the presence of plant parameters that are uncertain.  The specific direct drive actuator developed in this NSF project is a novel product designed and patented by Sunstream Scientific.  However, the controls solution developed herein is not limited to pneumatic actuators, but extends to all direct drive actuators and electric servos with mismatched inertia.  Due to immediate commercial pull, Sunstream first addressed a single axis application in automated resistance welding by partnering with manufacturer of resistance welding products Tuffaloy, and affiliated manufacturer of resistance welding software and controls, ENTRON.  The Sunstream servo actuator is secured to a welding machine frame, and couples directly to the welding tool ram, which has a mass up to 75kg.  The development program was successful, with the Sunstream servo capable of executing a welding routine by rapidly translating the tooling ram in a vertical orientation and transitioning on-the-fly between force and position modes.  New products were developed to satisfy the requirements of the automated resistance welding application, including a servo actuator capable of 5,000 lbf peak force, and a "safe move" algorithm to detect physical obstructions (such as a finger) in the path of motion.  Improvements to cycle rate and weld quality were noted, and the software intelligence improves operator safety, reduces operator error, and reduces poor welds up to 50%.  In May 2017, with commercial partner Tuffaloy/ENTRON, three robotic welding systems were installed in a US production facility of a major global automotive manufacturer. The automotive company was very impressed with the technology, and will submit this robotic welding system as a candidate for a Manufacturing Innovation Award within their North American network.
