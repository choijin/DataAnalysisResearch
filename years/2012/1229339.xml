<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Maolin Guo from University of Massachussetts, Dartmouth and colleagues Emmanuel Ojadi, Catherine Neto, Sivappa Rasapalli and David Manke will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) bioinorganic chemistry; (b) natural products; (c) organic synthesis and asymmetric catalysis; (d) inorganic chemistry including MOFs; and (e) DNA adduct formation in plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth and neighboring academic institutions, industries and local high schools.</AbstractNarration>
