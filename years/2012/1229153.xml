<AbstractNarration>Protons and neutrons (collectively called nucleons) are fundamental building blocks of the atomic nuclei, and they are held together inside nuclei by the strong force.  Precise knowledge of the proton's radius is critically important for understanding nucleons in terms of the underlying quarks and gluons, which are the degrees of freedom of the accepted theory of the strong force called quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  High precision measurement of the proton's radius is also warranted by the recent controversy over the size of the proton, triggered by the new ultra-high precision measurement in muonic hydrogen, which is significantly smaller than the commonly accepted value obtained from measurement in normal (electronic) hydrogen.  To address this "proton radius crisis," we have developed a novel electron scattering experiment that can achieve an unprecedented precision using a high resolution calorimeter and a windowless gas flow target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Collaboration consisting of Norfolk State University, Duke University, Mississippi State University, and North Carolina A&amp;T State University  will develop and construct a windowless hydrogen gas flow target in order to measure the proton charge radius with sub-percent precision.  The  experiment will be carried out at Jefferson Lab, where this target will  be the first of its kind.  The windowless target in conjunction with a  high resolution calorimeter will allow us to access momentum transferred  squared ranging from 0.0001 to 0.001 GeV-squared, which is lower than any  previous electron scattering experiment.  The experiment will employ a  novel approach of simultaneous measurements of electron-proton elastic  scattering cross section and Moller scattering cross section using a  high resolution calorimeter.  This novel approach will help achieve the  unprecedented precision and an almost model independent extraction of  the proton charge radius for the first time in electron scattering  experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Jefferson Lab PRad experiment aims to measure the charge weighted size of the proton with high precision.  This size of the proton, also known as its charge radius, is a fundamental quantity in physics.  The precise knowledge of the size of the proton has a wide variety of impact ranging from the understanding of the strong force that holds atomic nuclei together to our knowledge of fundamental constants of nature.  For nearly half a century the charge radius of the proton had been obtained from high precision measurement of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom or by scattering electrons from a hydrogen atom and measuring how the probability of scattering varied with the scattering angle and then extrapolating it to zero angle (one cannot measure at zero scattering angle since we run into the incoming beam).  Until recently the proton charge radius obtained from these two methods agreed with one another within experimental uncertainties.  In 2010 the proton charge radius was obtained for the first time by precisely measuring the energy levels of an unusual kind of hydrogen atom.  In these specially prepared hydrogen atoms the electron is replaced by its heavier cousin known as the muon.  The muon being about 200 times heavier than the electron, is held much closer to the proton in the special hydrogen atom, also known as muonic hydrogen.  This means that the energy levels of the muonic hydrogen are more sensitive to the size of the proton and hence allow a more precise measurement of its size.  The charge radius of the proton obtained from muonic hydrogen was significantly smaller than those obtained from regular hydrogen atoms.  Around the same time an electron scattering experiment was also performed which measured the change of the scattering probability with angle over a large range of angles with very small steps between the angles.  Although the new electron scattering result was more precise than previous scattering measurements, it was consistent with them.  This meant that the muonic hydrogen and regular hydrogen results being this different just by chance was less than about 1 in a 100 billion.  This was called the "proton charge radius puzzle" and led to a rush of experimental as well as theoretical efforts to understand why the size of the proton appears to be different when measured in regular hydrogen vs. muonic hydrogen.  Our experiment is one such effort which will use electron scattering from a regular hydrogen atom, but with several innovations that will make it the highest precision electron scattering measurement.  One of the innovations involves using a special high resolution detector called a calorimeter that allows us to reach the smallest angles ever, but at the same time measure over a wide enough range of angles such that the extrapolation to zero angle is robust.  The second innovation is to continuously flow hydrogen atoms as they interact with electron beam by holding the atoms inside a tube with no end-caps and using powerful pumps to remove the hydrogen that spills out of the tube.  This eliminates the scattering from the end caps of the tube that tend to hide the electrons that scatter from the hydrogen inside the tube, a common problem with all previous electron scattering experiments.  This novel windowless hydrogen gas Flow target is the innovation that has been developed for PRad and funded by this NSF MRI award.  The third innovation is to simultaneously detect the electrons that scatter from the proton in the hydrogen atom as well as the electrons that scatter from the electron in the hydrogen atom.  Doing so eliminates the need to know exactly how many hydrogen atoms were hit by the electron beam.  In all previous electron scattering experiments knowing exactly how many hydrogen atoms were hit by the electron beam was one of the largest source of uncertainty.  These innovative methods will allow the PRad experiment to measure the size of the proton more precisely than it has been ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
