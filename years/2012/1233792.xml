<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to investigate the mechanical response of a new class of nanolayered ceramics (MAX phases) and their solid solutions in extreme dynamic loading conditions through a combination of experimental approaches. MAX phases have attracted considerable attention as potential multifunctional materials for extreme environments since they combine some of the best attributes of ceramics and metals. Preliminary work on MAX phases suggests that new underlying physical mechanisms that can make ceramic materials resistant to dynamic loadings are yet to be discovered and fully explored. Studies conducted under this award will elucidate the physical mechanisms of deformation and damage in the MAX phases, and address fundamental questions regarding the constitutive behavior of the MAX phases under dynamic loading conditions as a function of temperature and to what extent our understanding of deformation and failure mechanisms of the MAX phases in quasi-static conditions can be extended to the extremely high deformation rates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the technological point of view, successful completion of this project will result in a deeper understanding of the connections between composition, structure and mechanical properties in this novel class of materials for extreme service conditions, enabling further developments in power generation, hypersonic and orbital re-entry flights, ballistic protection, etc. The educational and outreach plan focus on a series of activities, including: building a strong integrated research, educational and outreach collaboration between Texas A&amp;M and University of Rhode Island focused on mechanical behavior of novel ceramics under extreme loading conditions; mentoring and training the next generation of experts in the areas of experimental mechanics and materials science of ceramics materials; and linking undergraduate and graduate students? research experiences to their education through their close involvement in research during coursework, research projects, and thesis research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Systematic experimental investigation was conducted to evaluate the mechanical response of MAX phases and elucidate their deformation and failure mechanisms in quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions at temperatures ranging from room temperatures to 1200 oC. Most of the studies were carried out on Ti2AlC, as one of more than 70 different MAX phases because it shows the best attributes for applications in extreme environments such as gas turbines, propulsion engines, nuclear reactors, etc.  The major outcomes of this projects are summarized as following:  Ti2AlC shows brittle-to-ductile transition (BPT) at temperatures between 900 and 1100 oC, in both quasi-static (strain rate 10-4 s-1) and dynamic loading (strain rate of 500 s-1). BPT temperature increases with increasing strain rate. Above BPT temperatures, the compressive strength decreases significantly with increasing temperature. However, that decrease is less pronounced in dynamic loading condition, and thus Ti2AlC shows remarkable compressing strength of 1.2 GPa in dynamic loading conditions even at 1100 oC.  I was demonstrated demonstrated that complex hysteretic constitute behavior of MAX phases are result of multiple micro-yielding, each of which was attributed to the different mechanisms, namely onset of dislocation glide, kinking and micro-cracking. Mechanical response in both quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions was found to be a strong function of the grain size in polycrystalline MAX phases, with coarse grain structures having lower strength than fine grained ones. However, this strong dependence on the grain size diminishes above BPT temperature, only in quasi-static loading conditions, while in the dynamic loading conditions microstructures with different grain sizes shows substantially different behaviors. This finding suggest that BPT can be attributed to rate dependent deformation mechanisms, such as grain boundary sliding.  It has been demonstrated that solid solution strengthening or reinforcement with ceramic fibers can be used to enhance mechanical properties (compressive strength and fracture toughness) of MAX phases, in both quasi static and dynamic loading conditions.       The above research activities also contribute to a graduate course development on Mechanical behavior of materials at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU), creating vivid demonstration material on qusi-static and dynamic behavior of ceramic materials.  Results of this project are disseminated in 1 book chapter, 10 peer-reviewed journal papers, 2 doctoral tresses, 14 conference presentations and 5 invited lectures. Two graduate students, two undergraduate students and one international exchange student (from Brazil) received trading in ceramics processing, experimental mechanics and structural characterization of materials.
