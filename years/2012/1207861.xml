<AbstractNarration>The PI will continue his observational search for evidence of asteroids accreting onto white dwarfs, which is motivated by previously observed abundance anomalies in white dwarf spectra. He will use the Keck Observatory to obtain spectra of disks around white dwarfs that he and a graduate student will analyze. The results will be used to constrain models of planetary formation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is likely to have broader impacts to fields of cosmochemistry, planetary science and stellar evolution. This project will also help train a graduate student in research who is participating in an outreach program with China.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To Whom it may concern: I am writing to request a new one-year no-cost extension to NSF grant to UCLA: AST 1207861 on "The Composition of Extrasolar Planetesimals".  As I described in my NCE request of one year ago, the administration of this grant has had a troubled history.  The initial PI was UCLA Professor Michael Jura who passed away in January 2016, but had been ill for some time before then.  Siyi Xu, the other person significantly involved with this grant moved to a post-doc position at ESO in Germany.  Because of her complex ESO job responsibilities, new discoveries in which she has played the leading role, and time she has had to devote to finding her next job, she has had very little time to work on the research project covered by the Jura grant.  During the past year I have been the PI for the grant, but my own efforts were very limited due to repercussions from the death of my wife; she passed away not long before Dr. Jura died. Indeed, it is only in the past few months that I have been able to again devote substantial time to astronomical research.  In our previous NCE request, a year ago, I mentioned a UCLA graduate student, Nathaniel Monson, who had begun to help us with our Keck optical spectroscopy research on white dwarf stars.  I had hoped that Mr Monson might take the lead on the research project supported by grant AST 1207861, but, for a variety of reasons, this has not happened.  He has received no support from this grant.  Now, the picture for the coming year appears to be much brighter.  My UCLA colleague, Professor Edward Young in the Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences Department, has identified a graduate student, Alexandra Schneider, in his department who is very interested in taking on the proposed project beginning in September.  Her interests include astrochemistry.  She has just finished her first year in graduate school. She and Ed and I had a productive conversation about the proposed research project a week or so ago.  The project involves reducing and analyzing HIRES echelle spectra of numerous white dwarfs obtained with the Keck telescope at Mauna Kea Observatory going back many years.  The spectra were all obtained during observing runs for which either Mike Jura or I were the PI.  There is much to be learned, both from the ensemble of spectra and from detailed analysis of some of the individual stars.  Because of the long history of this area of research at UCLA, Jura's former graduate students Siyi Xu and Beth Klein and my former grad student Carl Melis will all be involved to some degree and are all very experienced working with HIRES spectra.  While Siyi and Beth will not receive any financial support from the grant (if the requested NCE is approved), it is possible that I will want to pay Dr. Melis for a few weeks this summer to expedite getting Ms Schneider started in the fall.  Specificallly, Carl would organize the data and he would help to bring Ms. Schneider up to speed by teaching her how to reduce and analyze HIRES spectra.  Thus, if the NCE is granted, then the remaining funds would be spent primarily to support Ms. Schneider during the 2017-2018 academic year and in the summer of 2018.  As mentioned in the previous paragraph, a small portion of the funds might be used to support Dr. Melis for a few weeks in summer 2017.  We expect that all currently remaining funds will be spent by August 31, 2018.       Last Modified: 01/02/2019       Submitted by: Benjamin M Zuckerman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
