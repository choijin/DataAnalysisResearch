<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of California, Santa Cruz to develop a new generation of animal tracking collars and tags for terrestrial and marine mammals that use the animal's own locomotion to power the device. The Energy Scavenging Collar for Animal Physiology and Ecology (ESCAPE) will revolutionize the study of wild animals by dramatically increasing the deployment time of animal biologgers while greatly reducing the cost of and need for re-collaring or re-tagging wild animals. The ESCAPE will lead to significant advances in animal physiology and ecology research by enabling scientists to evaluate the physiological and behavioral responses of wild animals to long-term changes in the environment. The project will use a laboratory-to-field approach to: (1) Design a power-scavenging device that uses the locomotion of the animal to charge an onboard capacitor and battery. (2) Integrate the power generation device with a GPS, accelerometers, and magnetometers to measure animal behavior, energetics, and movement. (3) Test the ESCAPE on three terrestrial species (domestic dogs, trained elephants and wild mountain lions) and its potential assessed on two marine mammal species (trained dolphins and sea lions). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This comparative approach will allow the research to evaluate the ramifications of locomotory mode, body mass and environment on the functionality and durability of the collars or tags. These tests will also provide a "proof of concept" regarding the collar's capability to collect, store, and send various types of longitudinal data. By relying on animal movement to charge the device, ESCAPE will provide up to order-of-magnitude increases in tag deployment time, allowing researchers to compile long-term data sets crucial for the study of wild animal physiology and ecology. The development of the ESCAPE will leverage a unique interdisciplinary team from the Departments of Environmental Studies, Ecology and Evolution, Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering. The ESCAPE collar is expected to be widely adopted by the research community at large and lead to breakthroughs in animal ecology, conservation and management. The insights gleaned from these collars will also greatly inform public understanding of animal behavior and conservation.  Outreach activities associated with the research will include presentations at professional academic conferences, monthly public lectures, field trips for middle and high school children, as well as the production of a professional video showcasing the ESCAPE technology. Details on how to purchase ESCAPE collars will be made available at wildlife.ucsc.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ESCAPE project has been an ongoing long-term effort in trying to extend the life of an animal tracking collar by utilizing energy scavenged from the animal motion or from the environment (e.g.: solar). Several different methods for energy extraction were studied and quantified theoretically and validated with experimental results.  In order to validate these techniques, new hardware was built and prototyped that featured low-power sensors and the ability to turn individual sensors and other elements on and off under software control. This allowed for energy consumption to be addressed as well as energy scavenging.  Changes in acceleration associated with animal motion were tested for both aquatic and terrestrial mammals varying in body mass.  This included cetaceans and pinnipeds using dorso-ventral and lateral forms of swimming propulsion, respectively, as well as quadrupedal locomotion by canids, felids, and ursids. Several factors markedly altered the level of body acceleration and potential for energy scavenging, 1) body mass, 2) frequency of limb movements, 3) surface substrate and incline on land, and most importantly, 4) placement and orientation of the sensor tags on the animals.  Practical considerations for terrestrial mammals limited placement of sensors to collars, while greater variability in tag placement to maximize energy scavenging was possible on swimming species.  Lastly, although 3-dimensional maneuvers increased overall body acceleration in diving mammals, long periods of gliding particularly during descent tended to mitigate these advantages for energy scavenging under normal, free-ranging situations.  Beyond the well-known environmental energy sources (solar cells on the collar), our work demonstrated that most of the ways in which to extract energy from animal motion were either impractical or generated too little energy to be useable. For example the size of the weighted pendulum to extract useable energy from a mountain lion would interfere with the animal motion.  One interesting energy harvester was created from the mechanism in a commercially available watch, however the mass needed to be tuned for the animal (as opposed to a human wrist), and the amount of energy extracted was marginal at best.  Our research showed what trade-offs were required to effectively scavenge energy from animal motion, and have pointed in the direction of other types of energy extraction (e.g.: thermal) that might be workable.  Given the limited amount of energy available to extract from animal motion, the energy consumption was examined and several key results stand out: (1) the radio frequency (RF) transmitter was easily the largest energy draw on the device, and (2) GPS was the next most power hungry.  The RF power could be reduced by only transmitting data when requested, and by encoding information into a "symbol" table which would be decoded by the scientists. This alone could easily extend the deployment life of the tracking tags. Additionally, GPS measurements can be substantially reduced by deducing animal motion from the other, lower power sensors (e.g.: accelerometers).

Lastly, working with the ecologists and biologists, the sensor information itself was used to identify animal behavior using signal processing techniques borrowed from other applications. This was very successful, and allowed for better understanding of the environmental requirements for the animals. These techniques are being used in other domains to improve the understanding of the animal movement and life-cycle.
