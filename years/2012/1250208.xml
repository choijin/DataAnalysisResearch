<AbstractNarration>Whales play a central role in the ecology and biogeochemistry of the Southern Ocean. However, little is known regarding their distribution and behavior, in part because of challenges associated with studying these organisms from large research vessels. This research will take advantage of the unique opportunity presented by the 2012-2013 test run of the smaller, more mobile R/V Point Sur. This work will use the Point Sur to investigate humpback whales in the waters studied by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Station off the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Employing a combination of long-term satellite-linked tags and short-term suction cup tags, researchers will investigate the distribution, abundance and foraging behaviors of whales in this region. Whale biogeography will then be related to quantitative surveys of krill, their primary food source. Hypotheses regarding whale distribution and foraging strategies as well as physical oceanographic features will be tested. The WAP is undergoing some of the most dramatic warming on the planet, and a better understanding of the ecology of top predators is central to developing an understanding of the impacts of this change. Results will be widely disseminated through publications as well as through presentations at national and international meetings. In addition, raw data will be made available through open-access databases. Finally, this work will be coordinated with the extensive infrastructure of the Palmer LTER site, enabling outreach and educational activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the project were to use a combination of long-term satellite-linked tags and short-term suction cups tags concurrent to quantitative surveys of prey throughout the water column to test specific hypotheses regarding the ecology of baleen whales in Antarctica.  As importantly, the goals of this RAPID award were to determine the utility and suitability of conducting ecological whale research from a smaller, dedicated platform (R/V Point Sur) that is not traditionally part of the USAP fleet (e.g. LM Gould and NB Palmer).  We successfully conducted our field work from the R/V Point Sur, using the small rigid-hulled tagging boat operated by grantees which made our work significantly more streamlined, efficient, and safe.  We we re able to deploy tags, conduct visual surveys and conduct prey mapping surveys as anticipated. We believe that there are several significant and critical results from our RAPID award.  First, we were able to, for the first time, deploy both satellite-linked and multi-sensor suction cup tags on Antarctic minke whales.  This is a significant achievement as it will now allow us to study in a quantitative way the behavior and ecology of this Antarctic krill predator that has, heretofore, been unknown to science.  It is also significant to note the efficiency and utility of the platforms that we used for our research.  While we were limited in our ability to prey map from the Point Sur due to sea ice conditions, we were able to deploy more tags (34) in less time than has ever been accomplished.  For example, on our previously supported NSF award to study humpback whale foraging ecology, we deployed 12 tags over the course of 4 weeks from the LMG.  Critical to our success in this RAPID award was the use of an aluminum-hulled inflatable RHIB that was part of the compliment on the Point Sur and the ability to allow our science team to operate the small boat for our tagging purposes.  It cannot be understated how necessary it is for boat operators to have experience working around whales. Aside from our scientific goals, we were able to successfully collaborate with the Australian Antarctic Division who helped to support this research. We currently have 2 manuscripts in review at Biology Letters, three presentations to be given at the Biennial Conference on the Biology of Marine Mammals in December 2013, and our research was used as a key piece of evidence regarding the ability to conduct non-lethal research on minke whales by the Australian government at the International Court of Law in a case against Japan. Along with a final report that will be submitted to the NSF, a final report will be presented to the Australian Antarctic Division.  Two popular magazine articles have been published to date (by the Australian Antarctic Division and Moss Landing Marine Laboratory).  Our research was highlighted as critical evidence in AustraliaÆs case in the International Court of Law against Japan for claims of scientific whaling.  Two manuscripts are currently in review at Biology Letters, a highly-cited and high-impact biology journal.  Several other manuscripts are currently in preparation for submission in the coming year.  Three presentations will be given in December 2013 in Dunedin New Zealand at the biennial conference on the biology of marine mammals.  Photographs of minke whales from this research are currently being considered by editors at the National Geographic Society for a magazine article.   The PI for the project (Friedlaender) is a young investigator and this grant offered the opportunity for experience in leading a field research program in Antarctica.  As well, three PhD students and one postdoctoral researcher were involved in field work, data collection and analysis, and manuscript writing.
