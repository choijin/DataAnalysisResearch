<AbstractNarration>This award funds research in the economic theory of matching methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research develops new methods for analyzing two-sided matching, whether it is organized via a decentralized market or a central clearinghouse.  The projects focus on college admissions as a possible application, although the new theory is general and will apply to many other contexts.  The first project develops a canonical model of a decentralized college admissions game, analyzes the strategic yield management decisions made by colleges and universities, and evaluates the resulting equilibrium outcomes.  The second project uses data from Australia, where college admissions are centralized in each state.  The data analysis determines the effect of specific features of this centralized process on the resulting assignment of students to universities.  The third project is again economic theory; the team seeks to develop new and more general conditions that guarantee existence of stable matching in an asymptotic sense; as applied to college admissions this would mean a match that is stable as the economy grows in the number of students and in the number of college places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different ways of encouraging college access through changes in admissions processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research supported by the grant developed both theoretical and empirical frameworks for understanding and improving current systems of college admissions. The research consisted of three parts.   The first part studies the implications of decentralized colleges admissions employed in many countries including the US.  Decentralized college admissions involve limited opportunities for offers and acceptances to be made.  We show that the resulting congestion induces colleges to target their admissions strategically to manage their yields. The research suggests that the outcome of such response is inefficient and often not fair, and a centralized management of admissions could improve the outcome.  The scond project then asks how college admissions can be centrally organized.  A desirable goal for such a centralized system is to ensure stability---for the resulting matching to leave no opportunities for participants to manipulate.  While stability is not guaranteed when colleges' preferences involve complementarities, my research proves that approximate stability can be attained if the number of applicants is sufficiently large and colleges' preferences are sufficiently continuous.   In order to understand how a centralized college admisions system may work, it is important to evaluate an existing system.  To this end, we collected admissions data from Victoria, Australia, which employs a system of centralized college admissions.  To understand the welfare outcome of such a system, we must begin with estimation of applicants' preferences.   For this purpose, we have develops an empirical identification method which leverages stability of the matching outcome guaranteed by the matching rule.   We have developed theoreical results arguing that our method is robust to mistakes often exhibited by applicants in ways the common method relying on the assumption of truthful reporting of preferences is not.  The results of the first project are reported in an article, entitled "Decentralized College Admissions," published in the Journal of Political Economy in 2016.  The results of the second project are reported in an article, entitled "Stable Matching in Large Economies," accepted for publication in Econometrica.
