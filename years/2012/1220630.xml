<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Roger Revelle, a 273? general purpose Global vessel; the R/V Melville, a 279?general purpose Global vessel; the R/V New Horizon, a 170?, general purpose, Ocean/Intermediate vessel and the R/V Sproul, a 125? general purpose Coastal/Local vessel. All four vessels are operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both R/V Roger Revelle and R/V Melville are Global vessels and support multidisciplinary oceanographic research in all of the world?s ocean basins. R/V New Horizon focuses primarily on offshore California but has been used for work throughout the Pacific. The primary working area for R/V Sproul has been the continental shelf and coastal environments off Southern California. In 2012, R/V Roger Revelle is scheduled for 281 days with NSF days accounting for 64% of the total sailing schedule; R/V Melville is scheduled for 281 days with NSF days accounting for 60% of the total sailing schedule; R/V New Horizon is scheduled for 131 days with NSF days accounting for 60% of the total sailing schedule; and R/V Sproul is scheduled for 91 days with NSF days accounting for 35% of the total sailing schedule&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) Disk Storage Servers $36,215&lt;br/&gt;2) TrackLink 5000 USBL $64,564&lt;br/&gt;3) Air Winches $111,285&lt;br/&gt;4) EIVA Geophysical Software $50,222&lt;br/&gt;5) SeaSoar Block $16,897&lt;br/&gt;6) SeaSoar Hydraulic Unit $59,574&lt;br/&gt;7) 10m2 MOCNESS Components $46,217&lt;br/&gt;                          TOTAL  $384,974&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

The 2 larger ships sail globally, with each scientific cruise lasting 3 to 6 weeks. Several gigbytes of data are collected on each cruise. Two redudant strorage servers were installed on each of these ships. There are now used routinely. Data is stored on both, so as to reduce risk of loss from hardware failure. The data is provided to the scientists during the cruise via the shipboard network.
