<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 12-28312&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Apon, Amy W.&lt;br/&gt;  Gemmill, Jill; Ligon, Walter B.; Smith, Melissa C.; Stuart, Steven J.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Clemson University&lt;br/&gt;Title:   MRI/Acq.: High Performance Computing Instrument for Collaborative Data-Enabled Science&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring a high performance computing (HPC) for collaborative data-enabled science, aims to enable fundamental and applied research in areas of experimental HPC, including scalable file systems, accelerator technologies, middleware architectures, and cluster scheduling policies. The instrument will be used as a production resource to support several compelling science applications in materials and biomolecular modeling, bioinformatics (and others) and will contribute a significant new component of the institution?s well established and managed Palmetto cluster while providing critically needed file storage, and accelerator systems not currently available. Supported projects include:&lt;br/&gt;- Scalable file system implementation,&lt;br/&gt;- Exploiting and analyzing concurrency in heterogeneous computing environments,&lt;br/&gt;- High performance cluster modeling, analysis, and characterization,&lt;br/&gt;- File replication and consistency maintenance,&lt;br/&gt;- Cloud architecture,&lt;br/&gt;- Properties of advanced materials and biomolecular systems,&lt;br/&gt;- Molecular dynamic simulation studies of poly-dots, new light-emitting nanoparticles,&lt;br/&gt;- Biomolecular evolution,&lt;br/&gt;- Optimizing catalysts for direct chemical remediation from water,&lt;br/&gt;- Protein-surface interactions,&lt;br/&gt;- Map/Reduce framework for next generation sequencing data assembly,&lt;br/&gt;- Searching for identification of significantly conserved protein blocks,&lt;br/&gt;- Digital manufacturing,&lt;br/&gt;- Statistical inference in nonparametrics models of production,&lt;br/&gt;- Analysis of the structures of hospital and banking industries,&lt;br/&gt;- Multiple scatter rendering,&lt;br/&gt;- Digital scholarship, and&lt;br/&gt;- Applications of computing to the geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;Regular planned input from the scientific team is expected to facilitate the development of policies for use of the instrument as a test bed for experimental high performance computing systems research as well as a shared production resource for scientific applications.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  &lt;br/&gt;The instrument serves as a tool for the collaborative team that includes more than 20 faculty from 4 institutions, and more than 250 graduate and undergraduate students. The system will also be utilized by the already established ?Desktop to Teragrid? program that reaches more than a dozen universities across South Carolina, an EPSCoR state, and with regional partners. The proposal team includes 6 women senior personnel. The institution has outreach, education, and training activities, and has engaged SC?s only public HBCU, South Carolina State University, as well as other minority institutions within the region. Development of interdisciplinary curricula will support computational and data-enabled science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A high performance computing (HPC) cluster computer was acquired to support data intensive computing at Clemson.  The instrument included new HPC technologiesincluding graphics processing units (GPUs), solid state disk (SSD) storage, and large disks for compute nodes.  GPUs can be used for significant computational speedup; the storage provided faster access to larger data sets.  The instrument was available to all Clemson researchers, educators, and students with priority use reserved for the senior researchers and projects listed in the proposal.  The instrument was purchased, installed, and ready for use in May 2013; it has run continuously since then, 24x7, with the exception of routinely scheduled maintenance periods. The instrument was named "Palmetto" after the tree on the South Carolina State flag.   Three broad categories describe the research and education that was conducted using Palmetto:  (1) experiments in high performance data intensive computing such as scalable file systems, accelerator technologies, and system modeling and analysis;  (2) compelling science projects in materials and biomolecular modeling, bioinformatics, digital manufacturing, economics, digital production arts, digital humanities and the geosciences;  (3) impact the curriculum by developing new courses and programs in computational and data enabled science.  By the end of this award in August 2015, 73 senior researchers and 247 students had used Palmetto for 68 reported research projects.  The complete list of participants, projects, and publications are available in the final report for this award; some examples are listed below.  (1) Experiments and Accelerator Technologies  * A number of investigations on the detection of large-scale distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks were developed.  DDOS attacks can cause computer systems to crash and congest Internet paths so that they become very slow.  Most intrusion detection systems available today use entropy-based dettection.  Experiments revealed they such systems can be fooled by spoof attack packets.  This discovery will lead to further research to improve intrusion detection methods. (Cybersecurity:  Ilker Ozcelik, Dr. Richard Brooks)  * Gene interaction graphs help genomics researchers discover specific gene interaction patterns across developmental stages and treatment conditions.  Graph alignment between gene expression states from a single species reveals groupings of gene expression that are common to a single organ or condition response; these groupings are represented as sub-graphs.  Further insights can be gained by comparing gene expression networks in two species to reveal evolutionarily or condition conserved sets of genes controlling biological processes.  Due to the computational complexity involved, GPUs were programmed to significantly speed computation time from hours to seconds.  A public web site http://network.genome.clemson.edu/ is available where researchers can submit their own data for alignment performed on the Palmetto supercomputer; results can be visualized.  This new method has been applied to the study of sorghum, an important crop worldwide. (Bioinformatics: Karan Sapra; Dr. Melissa Smith; Dr. F. Alex Feltus;)  * The dynamic Hadoop platform was extended into a meaneuverable platform.  This new approach makes it possible to integrate Hadoop (a special file system and computational techniques optimized for large data sets) into an existing large scale academic HPC infrastructure and automate scheduling to allow an arbitrarily long run time within the administrative constraints of a shared environment and with minimal interactions required from system administrators.  (Dr. Amy Apon; Dr. Linh Ngo, Dr. Edward Duffy)  (2) Science Projects   * 63 Computational research projects were conducted in Bioengineering, Biological Sciences, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Economics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Earth Science, G...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
