<AbstractNarration>Two significant challenges in ecology are to understand and accurately describe the spatial spread of species. Such spatial spread is important in a variety of ecological contexts, such as when non-native species invade new habitat and when species shift their spatial distributions in response to global change processes. Meeting these challenges requires population models that capture essential aspects of the dynamics of spatially spreading species, including demography and dispersal. Integro-difference equations will be used to describe the spread of populations with separate growth and dispersal stages wherein vital rates and dispersal abilities are determined by age, size, or developmental stage. Semi-discrete models (hybrid dynamical systems) involving reaction-diffusion equations and integro-differential equations will be employed to study the spread of populations in which different processes or different rates occur inside versus outside a species' reproductive period. Models with Allee effects will be developed for plant populations with pollination limitation, and for two-sex populations with reproductive asynchrony and imperfect mate-finding. Data from two well-studied field systems matching the structure of specific models will be used to parametrize key model components. The investigators will examine the existence of spreading speeds and traveling waves for the models, provide formulas for spreading speeds and traveling wave speeds, and calculate the sensitivity and elasticity of the speeds to changes in demographic and dispersal parameters. Methods from differential equations, integral equations, and dynamical systems will be used to investigate the spatial dynamics for the models. The outcomes of this research will also have broader impacts in other scientific disciplines where wave propagation is addressed. New rigorous mathematics will be integrated with extensive field and laboratory data to bridge the gulf between abstract mathematical results and ecological observations. To further broaden the impacts of this research, the investigators will also develop a MathBench module (.umd.edu) relating to ecological invasion dynamics. This module will feed into the larger, NSF-funded MathBench Initiative, which is designed to improve the quantitative literacy of undergraduate biology students and give them a deeper appreciation of the role of mathematics in understanding biological problems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Through new research at the interface of mathematics and biology, this project will contribute to the growing body of information on the spatial spread of species. Research on the dynamics of species spatial spread is essential to understanding when and where resource managers can act to limit the spread and impacts of non-native, invasive species. Likewise, better understanding of the dynamics of spatial spread is essential for forecasting species responses to global change processes. In this project the investigators will develop and analyze mathematical models incorporating species birth, growth, death, and movement to identify points in species? life-cycles that are critical to the rates of population spatial spread. Models for plant species limited by pollen supply and for populations featuring imperfect mate finding will be explored, with a focus on understanding the effects that particular population processes have on the rate and nature of species spatial spread. By focusing on two ecological case-studies in addition to novel mathematics, this project will help to point out specific targets and opportunities for natural resources management.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>As ecologists, we often think of biological populations as being groups of similar or identical organisms, all behaving in a like manner that ultimately generates population level characteristics, for example the explosive outbreak of a pest species, or the rate of spread of an invasive species.&nbsp; Assuming that individuals are alike allows us to apply simple mathematical models that help to understand biological populations.&nbsp; In reality, however, populations are composed of highly heterogeneous individuals, and this heterogeneity can be important for understanding population behavior.&nbsp; In the case of the human population, for example, individuals can be old or young, or male or female.&nbsp; Similar classes apply to other biological populations as well.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Mathematical models that include different classes of individuals are called structured population models.&nbsp; Although structured populations have been studied for a long time, they are uncommon in certain types of systems &ndash; for example models of species invasions or models of seasonality in biological communities.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as we enter into a new world, with increasing numbers of invasive species, dramatic loss of natural habitat and an ever-changing climate, these are the very systems that are most important to understand.&nbsp; Over the course of this grant, we considered a series of scenarios where population structure was crucial for understanding biological outcomes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In one study, for example, we considered extinction risk of a stage-structured insect population wherein the first stage &ndash; the larva &ndash; was non-mobile, and the second stage &ndash; the adult &ndash; was mobile.&nbsp; We were interested in when habitat loss, coupled with climate change, would impact the insect.&nbsp; This problem is particularly relevant for endangered butterfly populations restricted to small, remnant prairie patches.&nbsp; Interestingly, we found that butterfly species that disperse over long time periods prior to laying eggs were more susceptible to habitat loss, but were actually more resilient to climate change (see Fig. 1).&nbsp; This information helps to identify specific species that are at risk as a result of environmental perturbations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In another series of studies, we considered the opposite problem &ndash; a novel invasive species that we would like to eradicate. &nbsp;&nbsp;For these studies we were interested in the effect of climate change on invasion rates.&nbsp; We began by exploring the basic properties of species invasions under warming conditions.&nbsp; Specifically, we were interested in how a moving habitat boundary or gradient interacted with the natural process of species dispersal to determine population spread.&nbsp; Shifting habitat boundaries have already been observed, with organisms that prefer colder temperatures moving northwards (in the Northern Hemisphere) and up mountains.&nbsp; Our analyses suggested that climate change has the potential to slow or even stop the spread of certain species.&nbsp; However, it can also allow spread of a species that would otherwise be &lsquo;pinned&rsquo; by a habitat boundary.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In a separate study, we considered the role of climate change on spread of an invasive species when climate alters the length of time a species spends in different life stages (egg, larva, pupa and adults).&nbsp; In many insects, different life stages have different mobility.&nbsp; The pupa, for instance, is almost always non-mobile, whereas the adult can often disperse long distances.&nbsp; We found interesting non-intuitive effects of altered life stage durations.&nbsp; For example, invasion rate increases with increasing time that adults spend in flight, but only up to a certain point.&nbsp; After this, invasion rates decrease again, because adults that spend too long dispersing do not leave sufficient time over the rest of the season for larval growth and development (see Fig. 2).&nbsp; This work identifies invasive species that are most at risk of increasing their rate of spread under climate change.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Also on the topic of invasions, we studied the spread of a stage-structured population in the context of a competitor.&nbsp; Specifically, we considered how an invasion would be impacted if the invading species faced competition from a native species, but this competition was more concentrated on the juvenile stage or on the adult stage.&nbsp; Interestingly, we found that the invasion was slowed when the competitive pressure on the less abundant stage was more intense (see Fig. 3).&nbsp; A similar result occurred when the less abundant stage exhibited lower dispersal rates as compared to the more abundant stage.&nbsp; This work identifies species traits that might impact the rate at which an invasion progresses, particularly within the realistic context that the invasive species is displacing a native species with similar biology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Several additional studies were undertaken, for example considering stage-structured competition between invasive and native mosquitoes known to spread disease (see Fig. 4), and considering the effect of climate change on certain species interactions, including plants and herbivore (See Fig. 5) and plants and pollinators (see Fig. 6).&nbsp; As with the previous studies, these works identify potential outcomes of global change on a variety of different species populations.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2016<br>      Modified by: William&nbsp;F&nbsp;Fagan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1225917/1225917_10208064_1480556494140_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1225917/1225917_10208064_1480556494140_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1225917/1225917_10208064_1480556494140_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Habitat requirement as a function of (a) time spent dispersing prior to laying eggs (b) time spent laying eggs.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Bewick et. al., 2016</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">William&nbsp;F&nbsp;Fagan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1225917/1225917_10208064_1480557117237_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1225917/1225917_10208064_1480557117237_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1225917/1225917_10208064_1480557117237_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Contour plot showing invasion rate as a function adult flight time and larval lifespan.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Otto et al.
