<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Advancing Health Services through System Modeling Research project is to develop and evaluate health information technology (IT) interfaces that can be used to guide healthcare providers in real-time as they complete the complex, error-prone blood transfusion process. The researchers will determine how the interfaces should be designed to best help individuals complete the process safely, and to effectively alert and guide individuals when process failures or exceptional situations arise. The researchers will develop and evaluate these interfaces using laboratory-based evaluations and experiments in a realistic clinical setting. This project will establish foundational principles for the design of real-time health IT-based process guidance systems that improve healthcare process safety and efficiency. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;While health IT has the potential to guide individuals completing complex healthcare processes, it is often inflexible, forcing individuals to perform non-ideal, inefficient, and potentially unsafe processes. This project has the potential to dramatically reduce medical errors by designing health IT interfaces that allow individuals flexibility in the way they complete processes, yet provide enough guidance to maintain a high level of process safety. While this project focuses on the blood transfusion process, the fundamental findings will be generalizable to other complex healthcare processes. Through this project, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained by an interdisciplinary team of engineering, computer science, and nursing faculty members. The process guidance system and interfaces developed and evaluated through this project will be integrated into clinical simulation laboratory exercises used in the university?s nursing education curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Medical errors result in hundreds of thousands of human deaths every year. The major goal of this project was to understand how health information technologies (IT) integrate into clinical care processes, to better understand how health IT plays a role in medical errors. With this understanding, we can identify limitations in the designs of these technologies, propose redesign strategies, and formulate process-driven heath IT training programs.  We focused our efforts on three common, error-prone, and safety-critical healthcare processes for which current health IT systems are known to be problematic: blood transfusion, medication history taking, and verification of patient identity (ID) while administering medications. Our approach was interdisciplinary, driven by technologies from computer science, informed by nursing clinical knowledge and practice, and evaluated using industrial engineering approaches, specifically human factors.  We developed health IT software interfaces that can aid nurses as they complete the blood transfusion process. These software interfaces were iteratively developed by our interdisciplinary team and via conversations with numerous medical experts. We then evaluated and revised the interfaces based on observations of, and interviews with, practicing nurses.  With respect to the medication history taking process, we developed a process-based training program to help nurses understand when and how to use health IT as they complete this process. The training program was found to be effective based on an experiment with nursing students.    Finally, we identified errors in how nurses complete the process of verifying a patient?s identity (VPID) before giving a medication. Barcoding systems aim to reduce these errors, but we identified how the design of the barcoding system may not adequately improve the safety of this process.  In summary, healthcare rests heavily on complex clinical processes. If health IT is not designed to support these processes, medical errors are inevitable. Our work shows that using technology to replace a human-intensive process is insufficient (as in VPID). We developed two promising approaches to address this problem: process-based health IT design (blood transfusion) and process-based health IT training (medication history taking).
