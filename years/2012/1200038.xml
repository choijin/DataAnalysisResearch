<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to develop a modeling, processing, and fabrication protocol for the creation of a structural, multifunctional metal matrix composite designed for both strength and damping effectiveness.  Damping refers to a material?s ability to suppress mechanical and acoustic vibrations.  It is important as a means to improve material performance, extend a component?s lifetime, and reduce unwanted noise during device operation.  Specifically, this study will explore methods to fabricate composites that contain dispersed structural reinforcements that are capable of exhibiting ferroelectric behavior.  If properly prepared, when placed within structural metallic materials, such reinforcements can be actuated in ways that will improve a component?s ability to dissipate unwanted vibrations.  Implementation and optimization of this beneficial effect will rely on the ability to successfully process microstructural architectures in appropriate phase states.  This will necessitate the adaptation of a low temperature electroforming process capable of preserving the ferroelectric and/or piezoelectric characteristics of the reinforcement through manufacturing.  Phase field modeling will be employed to provide robust sensitivity- and benefit-analyses that will guide the highly-sensitive processing-structure-property-performance relationships that are possible in these material systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will provide the manufacturing foundation for new damping-effective structural composites.  Additionally, the project will exemplify a successful implementation of the advanced and broader design concept of material multifunctionality, wherein traditionally-passive microstructural constituents are instead incorporated in ways that enable an active (or ?smart?) response to a particular application need.  Future development of new multifunctional material systems will most likely proceed in a similar manner; that is, through the innovative development or adaptation of new processing techniques as guided by advanced, physically-faithful, computationally-intensive modeling and predictive methodologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A largely unexplored area of composite design is the use of "functionally-active" materials as reinforcement in structural metal matrices. Such composites offer unique multi-functionality as derived from reinforcement capable of both a tunable "internally-active" response to a given stimulus and their traditional strengthening or stiffening role within the composite. An example is a ferroelectric ceramic-reinforced metal matrix composites where the electrically- and mechanically-active reinforcements offer an enhanced ability to dampen mechanical vibrations. Structural components such as axles and other cantilevered rotating members are prime application candidates since the repetitive tension/compression stress cycles provide an engineering design-based means to exploit the underlying property hysteresis effects that lead to the enhanced energy dissipating capability. This project combined experiments and computations to develop understanding of the passive damping behavior attributed to coupled mechano-electrical character of the composite and develop knowledge of the underlying processing science for opportunistic manufacture of highly processing-sensitive ferroelectric ceramic reinforcement within structural metallic matrices. The project exemplifies an integration of materials theory and materials processing strategies for new material development by design.     Intellectual Merit: Unlike polymer or ceramic (nonconductive) based composites, metallic matrices create natural short-circuit configurations around any embedded electrically-active microconstituent.  In-situ poling of ferroelectric particles embedded in a conductive matrix is not directly possible and thus challenging to develop processing to fabricate composites with poled ferroelectricity inclusions that will benefit from piezoelectric-based mechanisms for improved damping capability. Thus, the opportunity to systematically describe new avenues to enhance material functionality in metallic-based materials from ferroelectric ceramic reinforcement has been developed.  Complementing an experimental effort in manufacturing these composites, phase field modelling was developed to simulate concurrent domain evolution in ferroelectric inclusion composite particles and the electrical conduction in metallic composite matrices under cyclic stress and various composite microstructural states.  The effects of composite microstructural variability including particle size, shape, volume fraction, and coating on the internal electrical and mechanical processes were investigated, which serves to correlate microstructure to properties. The simulation results also explains experimentally observed temperature-dependent damping behavior of the composites.  It is shown that both of two conceived mechanisms of ferroelectric domain switching and phase transition can significantly improve damping capability within certain temperature ranges.  The important roles are analyzed in terms of the electrical conduction in the metallic matrix, the thermal expansion misfit between ferroelectric and metal phases, and the elastic confinement of the metal matrix in activating ferroelectric functionality for effective energy dissipation.  Moreover, new formulations have been developed for phase field modeling of electrical conduction based on the virtual polarization concept, which increases computational efficiency in simulating ferroelectric-metal composites.     Broader Impact: The project has supported a graduate student to conduct experimental research focused on composite materials processing, trained one postdoc in computational materials research focused on understanding microstructural-based mechanisms for damping of ferroelectric-metal composites, and created a research opportunity for an undergraduate student to gain experience in simulation-based materials science and engineering. The participants include one woman graduate student, one postgraduate conducting independent research experience as a means to strengthen his credentials towards a future academic career, and one first-generation college student learning how to apply principles of math and science to the design of new and innovative materials.  The participants attended TMS conferences to gain exposure to professional academia and also gave oral and poster presentations. The research outcomes of this project have also been presented to high school students and teachers as an example of how Materials Scientists invent new materials through demonstrations provided during MTU?s Summer Youth Programs and ASM Materials Camp for Teachers.  A notable outcome of this project is that the research opportunity motivated the undergraduate participant of this project to attend graduate school to obtain a PhD degree in computational materials science.
