<AbstractNarration>In our fast-paced world, people often find themselves making important decisions while sleepy.  Current surveys indicate that tens of millions of Americans are considered sleep deprived and/or have occupations requiring some shift work.  Fatigue can result from insufficient sleep or other factors. For example, some people are naturally more alert in the morning as opposed to the evening.  The goal of this research is to examine how sleepiness or fatigue affects decision making.  The decision-making process involves (at least) two systems: 1) an unconscious system that responds more automatically and without conscious thought, and 2) a deliberative system that makes "high-level" rational decisions.  The investigators hypothesize that when individuals are sleepy, and therefore cognitive resources are compromised, the decisions a person makes will be more the result of automatic processes than deliberative ones, thereby saving mental effort. The investigators will conduct a controlled experimental study that manipulates individuals' sleep quantity as well as the time during the day that decisions are made.  The project will test the hypothesis that decision rules that a person uses while sleepy are more automatic and less a product of high-level deliberation.  This will also allow the investigators to evaluate whether decisions based on automatic processes are inherently worse than decisions based on more complex deliberative processes.  In contrast, relying on automatic processes might lead to better decisions if more thoughtful deliberation makes people overthink the decision task.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of how fatigue affects decision making in areas such as simple social interactions, the incorporation of new information into decisions, or the importance of how a choice is framed.  This is especially critical in our modern society where decisions are often made while one is tired.  In occupations like truck driving, air traffic control, medical professionals, and emergency services, poor decision making can cost lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Co-funded by Perception, Action and CognitionProgram and Decision, Risk and Management Sciences Program]</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project produced several outcomes of importance.  First, the investigators successfully developed and implemented a research protocol designed to study adverse sleep states that are relatively mild but similar to what many individuals experience daily.  This protocol may be adopted by other researchers who wish to study the impact of mild adverse sleep states occurring in a more naturalistic environment.  We also generated a unique data set (of over 100 young adults) on how chronic sleep restriction and suboptimal time-of-day affect decision making.  Our sleep restriction manipulation was similar to the sleep levels of approximately 30% of U.S. adults, and our suboptimal time-of-day manipulation was similarly mild but realistic in terms of what millions of decision makers face daily.  This implies that our findings are more immediately relevant and applicable to everyday decisions than highly controlled (and more artificial) in-lab sleep studies.  Our integration of expertise from several disciplines also enhances the general application of our findings to a wider audience.  Regarding our key results, data analyzed to date (more to come) have focused on the intriguing finding that sleepy decision makers are less prosocial.  Specifically, these decision makers are less altruistic (more greedy perhaps), less trusting, and less trustworthy.  Given how important social interactions are in everyday life, this finding that commonly occurring types of adverse sleep states (i.e., chronic sleep restriction, or decision making at off-peak hours during the early morning or night) reduces basic measures of prosocial behaviors is important.  It indicates that the impact of sleepiness goes into a realm of decision making that has received little attention.  Researchers have shown that basic measures of trust have multiplier effects into the larger economy as others in society eventually interact with those who behave more or less prosocially.  If prosocial behaviors like trust or concern for others' payoffs are an important building block of a well-functioning society, then this result is concerning given recent trends towards increased sleepiness in modern society.  A second result still in the preliminary stage (as of this writing) involves how sleepiness affects decisions requiring the use of multiple sources of information.  We find evidence that sleepy decision makers may make less accurate assessments in environments that present existing (baseline) information along with relevant new information.  Sleepy decision makers also take longer to make decisions, in general, which highlights a limitation of recent conclusions in the literature that link longer response times to increased deliberation.  Longer response times may indicate deliberation, but they may also indicate that decision makers are struggling to focus and process the decision environment.  In this information and assessment task, we also find that sleepy subjects may be more influenced by reward anticipation, which can negatively impact decision accuracy.  This highlights how the impact of increased emotional responses of sleepy decision makers can influence decision making.  A final important project outcome was the training received by several undergraduate and graduate students over the life of this project.  Some of these students have benefited from co-authorship with the investigators on research funded in part by this project, some of the graduate research assistants benefitted from funding to finish an M.A. degree, and one is pursuing a Ph.D. in experimental psychology on the heels of his involvement in this research.
