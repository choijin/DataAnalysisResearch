<AbstractNarration>This project aims to study the basic properties of the random matrices whose entries are basically independent. The main objective is the identification of the eigenvalue  densities, the local eigenvalue statistics and the eigenvector distributions of many different classes of random matrix ensembles. The ensembles considered in this project include Wigner matrix, generalized Wigner matrix, band matrix, Erdos-Renyi adjacency matrix, non-Hermitian (i.i.d. matrix), covariance matrix, generalized covariance matrix, finite rank perturbation of Wigner or covariance matrix, the sum or/and product of random matrix and deterministic matrix. Some open problems will be studied in this project, e.g. Universality of covariance matrix, local circular law, localization-delocalization transition of the eigenstates of band matrix, distribution of the largest eigenvalue of correlation matrix and etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rigorous analysis on the local statistics of random matrix will shed some light on the nature of the highly correlated many body system. The works on covariance matrix will bring collaboration between mathematicians and statistician to better understand wireless communication, economic phenomenon and population genetics. The works on band matrix aims to establish the conducting properties of semiconductors and other disordered systems.</AbstractNarration>

It includes  1.  Study on general deformed matrix.   2.  The bulk universality conjecture at fixed energy level  3.The eigenvalue universality of band matrix.   Besides these papers, PI gave a topic course on random matrix theory in UW-madison.  In addition, the topics and examples  in this project have helped the PI to motivate his undergraduate students in his (Probability) course  in UW.   In lifetime of this project, PI has given  talks on his work in 15 different places.  Especially, he gave 8 talks in the NIMS random matrix summer school.  Right now PI is advising 3 graduate studnets in UW-madison.  Two of them have involved into PI's research projects.           Last Modified: 09/01/2015       Submitted by: Jun Yin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
