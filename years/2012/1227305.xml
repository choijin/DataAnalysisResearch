<AbstractNarration>The contexts for water allocation decisions often involve diverse interests and high levels of competition. Water conflicts in regions experiencing water scarcity and social tensions, such as Guanacaste Province in Costa Rica, might reach critical tipping points if drier conditions occur as projected. Good governance of natural resources is a multi-objective endeavor that requires strong institutional capacity to effectively manage conflict situations. This project explores institutional capacities in a Costa Rican region that has experienced water conflicts. The research combines conflict data from interviews, court records, and previous studies in order to examine why some disputes escalate to become destructive or even violent, while others do not. Through statistical analysis the projects examines the effects of governance arrangements on conflict intensity amid varying environmental and socio-economic conditions. The project also involves stakeholder workshops in a small area within Guanacaste to explore new methods to link regional-scale analysis to community-scale planning efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project clarifies institutional features that make some resource disputes more intractable than others. Many previous water conflict studies have been conducted at a macro-scale; yet, most water conflicts take place on regional or community scales. The regional and local orientation of this project is designed to produce useful information to improve water governance and management schemes and to aid decision-makers in allocating water resources. With fewer funds available for public resource management and drier climates expected in many regions, good governance arrangements are critical to secure the well-being and sustainability of local communities and their ecosystems. Communities play increasingly active roles in managing their resources; yet, linking broader-scale science to local planning efforts remains a challenge. The project attempts to bridge this gap.</AbstractNarration>
