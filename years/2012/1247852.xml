<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to research and develop bio-based materials from high performance poultry feather fiber. Protein fibers like silk and feather have high stiffness and low density, giving them density-normalized properties similar to steel. Silk has proven too costly to manufacture.  Feather fiber, which has comparable properties, can be obtained easily and economically as a waste product of the poultry industry. There is a burgeoning market for bio-based plastics as manufacturers transition from 100% fossil fuel-based plastics to ones with increased bio-based content. Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) account for 54% of U.S. plastics production. Adding feather fiber to PE or PP would increase the bio-based content and properties, thus adding value to the product. The goal of this project is to create a universal feather fiber additive that can be easily shipped to customers and compounded into an existing plastic using the existing processing equipment. The specific goals of the work are to 1) further develop the company's existing feather fiber process to increase yield and 2) research methods to pelletize the feather fibers with binders to create a fiber "concentrate" that is amenable to existing plastics manufacturing processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the creation of a bio-based replacement for traditional commodity plastics that are derived from fossil fuels. The rise in fossil fuel prices, and supply concerns have created opportunities for bio-based plastics from annually renewable biological sources. Compared to traditional plastics, 100% bio-based plastics are expensive, have inferior properties, and require different processing. Market drivers are pushing manufacturers to transition to bio-based plastics incrementally, in order to obtain certification as a bio-based product. To become more integrated and to serve more markets, the intention is to create one universal feather fiber additive that can be shipped and sold to all customers. The feather fiber concentrate will allow more customers to segue to bio-based plastics, which is a market growing at 17.8% per year. This will reduce the plastic industry's reliance on fossil fuels and create more environmentally-friendly products. In addition, it will allow the re-use of an agricultural byproduct, poultry feathers, which are currently land filled or reground to feather mill.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Keratin Fiber Pellet Manufacturing  Biobased plastics production is increasing at a much higher rate than the traditional plastics industry, but current biobased plastics suffer from property disadvantages or high costs that limit their use in many markets. The manufacturing of a keratin fiber pellet concentrate as a "drop in" additive for current plastic processes will allow companies to transition to biobased plastics at a rate each company is comfortable with.  The fiber in the keratin pellet is derived from feathers; which are a by-product of the poultry industry, having little value.  Eastern BioPlastics has developed a patented process to transform the raw feather waste product into clean, feather fibers.     The main objectives of the project were:  Further refine EBPÆs quill/fiber separation process to increase the yield of pure and uniformly-sized feather fiber. Mix the feather fiber with low molecular weight polyolefins PE and PP to create feather fiber concentrates. Assess the mixing of the concentrate formulations into typical commercial grades of higher molecular weight PE and PP matrices and note extent of fiber dispersion and properties Adjust concentrate formulation with additives to affect matrix contraction from the fiber, if any, and to ensure a product of consistent properties for the customer.      The outcomes of these objectives are summarized below.   Prior to the NSF project, Eastern BioPlastics (EBP) used feathers in its manufacture of bioplastic resins that contained both feather fibers and quill particulates.  It was determined that the quill adversely affected the properties of the resin. The initial method for removing the quill was insufficient due to excessive moisture in the fibers and problems with the tank design.  The tank was redesigned and an infrared dryer was implemented.  It was then determined that because of the excellent insulating properties of the feathers, the infrared dryer was not successful at adequately drying them. Research determined that commercial microwave oven drying would be the best available technology for penetrating the layers of the insulating feather, allowing for dramatically improved separation. This discovery of the insulating value of the feather fibers has opened doors for future uses of the feather as an insulating material.  Numerous agents were tested to bind the feather fiber with polyolefins PE and PP to create feather fiber concentrates. None of the binders proved successful, however during this investigation it was determined that when hydrocarbon binders are used, feathers become an exceptional sorbent for organics.  This of course made pure hydrocarbons impractical as a binder since the feather absorbed the tentative binder.  However, using feathers as a pure hydrocarbon sorbent was considered a viable use of the feathers.  In the laboratory it was shown that one pound of feathers could absorb over seven pounds of hydrocarbons such as gasoline, oil and similar agents.  This discovery has launched a new venture for Eastern BioPlastics, using the feather fibers to produce environmentally friendly oil absorbent socks, pillows and pads.        The next phase of our research involved mixing feather fibers with an extrusion grade polyolefin.  A keratin pellet concentrate was created by compounding 80% -95% (by volume) feathers with 20% -5% polypropylene. The keratin pellet will allow product manufacturers to decide what level of sustainable solution they are comfortable with while not hindering the integrity of their current product. Companies can incrementally transition to biobased products, thus leaving their production experience "comfort zone" in a slow, defined way. The mega pellet is like other additives in that customers will be able to decide what percentage of biomaterial (keratin) they need in their final application. Additionally, the use of the keratin pellet concentrate will allow the producer to market their product as more environmentally ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
