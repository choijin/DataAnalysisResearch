<AbstractNarration>This work is part of a collaborative project to collect direct imaging data of exoplanets and then model the atmospheres.  This work focuses on cool giant planets, which are the type expected to be first detected with these techniques (due to their larger orbital distances from the host star).  They will use data collected from direct imaging surveys to test models of the atmospheres, and include clouds, vertical mixing, non-solar abundances, and non-local chemical equilibrium effects in their calculations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also involve public outreach through Lowell Observatory and the American Museum of Natural History, which will develop and present online and in-person programs on the scientific results from direct imaging of planets.  They will also train undergraduate and graduate students in research.</AbstractNarration>

The majority of Dr. Godfrey?s thesis project focused on fitting  synthetic spectra from cool atmosphere models to the low-resolution  near-infrared spectra of T dwarfs, the coolest fully-populated spectral  class of brown dwarfs, in order to constrain their physical properties  and evaluate model performance as a foundation for interpreting the  lower-quality spectra of companions detected by high-contrast imaging  instruments.  Dr. Godfrey defended her thesis in April 2017, and two  papers from her thesis research are in preparation.  Prof. Rice and Dr. Godfrey also contributed to the analysis of  several brown dwarf or planetary-mass companions detected with high  contrast instruments Project 1640 or the Gemini Planet Imager.
