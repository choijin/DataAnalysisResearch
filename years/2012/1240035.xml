<AbstractNarration>This Phase I project establishes the STEM EduGators to increase the quantity and quality of STEM majors who enter the teaching profession.  A total of fifty $10,000 scholarships for undergraduate students entering the final student teaching experience and ninety $4950 summer internships are being awarded. The Program is expanding opportunities for 10 undergraduates per year who need financial assistance as they continue their major in a mathematics or science discipline while acquiring a minor in education. The Noyce Summer Internship Program provides 18 STEM EduGators with job opportunities in informal science education settings.  Project partners include the University of Florida's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and College of Education, the Alachua County school district, and the PK Yonge Development Research School. The project, using formative and summative assessment as well as an external evaluator, is tracking the Noyce scholars to determine outcomes of bringing STEM majors into teaching. The project includes research on and support for Noyce Scholars as they enter the teaching profession. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program operates as a component of the University of Florida UFTeach program. During their first four years of full-time teaching, the Noyce Scholars are expected to impact and enhance learning for approximately 18,000 students. The first cohorts of UFTeach students recruited from fall 2009 through spring 2011 indicate that the program is significantly increasing the number and diversity of STEM majors going into teaching. Over the five-year duration of funding ninety informal science education internships are being awarded. Each intern is reaching out to hundreds of school children and citizens.</AbstractNarration>

However, it is clear from the post internship surveys that they in fact had a different and deeper appreciation for ISE settings. The pre-posttest asked about the experiences and their effect on students' decisions to stay in the teaching career. A strong positive impact on the decision to stay in teaching and especially in understanding how STEM learning can occur in informal settings occurred.  Benefits reported by the internship awardees included:  Increased interest in the field and commitment to teaching Better tools for teaching; acquisition of new skills Deciding factor in choosing teaching as a career Understanding and appreciating the importance of learning science in informal settings Knowledge and availability of resources/peer support   Students were asked about what obstacles a teacher faced when incorporating ISE into their classrooms.  Frequent pretest responses focused on cost, the availability of appropriate locations, and time. Post internship responses additionally listed curriculum requirements, assessment, and need for careful organization as obstacles. Overall the program met its goal of reinforcing/deepening participants' understanding of the importance of ISE.  Dissemination of findings:  The features and implications of the programs were disseminated to the broader community through postings on the university's website, on the Noyce website; and presented at national meetings of STEM EduGators Noyce Program Principal Investigators, during mathematics and science education conferences (both regionally and nationally), with local and state press releases, and through articles published in peer-reviewed journals.
