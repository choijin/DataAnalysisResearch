<AbstractNarration>Conventional concentrically braced frame (CBF) systems designed following current practice can achieve life safety performance but have limited drift capacity prior to structural damage in case of an earthquake event. This structural damage (that is permitted in current design practice under the design-basis earthquake) will not lead to direct collapse of the structure, but often results in residual drift and non-structural damage, causing high post-earthquake direct and indirect costs. This proposal plans to pursue research in demonstration of benefit of self-centering concentrically braced frame (SC-CBF) system rather than a CBF for earthquake-resistant structures. The demonstration of benefit will be judged through performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) and through life cycle cost analysis of the system. The project will consider parameters of probabilistic ground motions, various configurations of SC-CBF, and considerations of uncertainties including structural properties, statistical processes, and capacity/demand models. A key element of this project is to assess life-cycle cost benefit of SC-CBF against CBF. The life cycle cost will include direct cost of damage as well as indirect economic losses in case of an earthquake event. The interdisciplinary research team includes structural and geotechnical expertise as well as economics/accounting expertise. The graduate and undergraduate students working on the project will benefit from the interdisciplinary efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed work will evaluate the effectiveness of SC-CBF systems in terms of seismic performance and financial benefits. The proposed research includes several tasks: 1. Selecting suites of probabilistic ground motions for a site that capture the uncertainties relating to magnitude, distance, soil type, and local effects, to incorporate the stochastic nature of the seismic loading. 2. Consideration of a full range of parameters in the development of SC-CBF designs and the associated nonlinear finite element models. 3. Development of unbiased probabilistic capacity and demand models for SC-CBF systems that properly account for prevailing uncertainties in structural property as well as in statistical procedures, in randomness of the ground motions, and in errors in the capacity and demand models. 4. Conducting damage and loss analyses based on the seismic fragility assessed using the proposed capacity and demand models. 5. Comparison of the life cycle cost of several SC-CBF systems with conventional CBF systems through a case study. Uncertainty in all assessment stages will be examined simultaneously, thereby integrating the entire framework into a single interdisciplinary probabilistic model. This integration combines economic considerations in earthquake engineering with the geotechnical and structural engineering principles. The validation of the SC-CBF system based on life cycle costs will have impact on its use by the industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this research project is to demonstrate, through performance-based seismic assessment, the benefits of implementing the self-centering concentrically braced frame (SC-CBF) system rather than a conventional concentrically braced frame (CBF) system for earthquake-resistant structures.The SC-CBF system is a state-of-the-art modification of the conventional CBF system that allows for larger structural displacements before structural damage occurs. This increased capacity allows SC-CBF systems to undergo earthquakes with damage-free performance, thereby reducing post-earthquake repair costs.  The Intellectual Merit of this research project stems from the integration of four different assessment stages into a cohesive study to consider inherent uncertainties comprehensively. The four assessment stages are: (1) hazard analysis, (2) seismic fragility assessment, (3) damage analysis, and (4) loss analysis.  In the hazard analysis stage, the type and magnitude of earthquake input for structural analysis is determined. In this study, we incorporated the relevant uncertainties in the soil as well as the sources of earthquake generation to create a set of earthquake ground motions for structural analysis. In the seismic fragility stage, we analyzed the structural response to the ground motions. We considered a variety of structural designs and incorporated uncertainty in material properties into the analyses to determine a statistical representation of SC-CBF seismic response. In the damage analysis stage, we associated structural response to damage states for structural and non-structural components, considering multiple severities of damage. In the loss analysis stage, we developed a methodology to quantify the economic direct and indirect losses of each damage state, considering the uncertainty in loss function variables.   This integration of the four assessment stages combines economic considerations in earthquake engineering with geotechnical and structural engineering principles, accounting for all relevant uncertainties in a cohesive methodology.  The Broader Impacts of this research project arise from several components:  Provide data to building owners, public policy decision makers, and other stakeholders about the long-term costs and benefits associated with conventional CBF systems and SC-CBF systems,  The development of life cycle cost models that can be readily adaptable to other types of structural systems and hazards. The graduate and undergraduate students who worked on this research have been exposed to a wide variety of engineering and accounting concepts, helping to bridge the gap between the fields of engineering and cost management.   The most important Outcomes of this research can be briefly summarized as follows:  A method for synthesizing ground motions was developed that inherently includes uncertainties in earthquake generation and soil properties. A life cycle cost estimation methodology was developed that incorporates large-scale economic impacts in addition to more direct structural repair costs. The methodology can be tailored for specific building occupancies or generalized as needed. SC-CBF systems have been shown to have a significant economic benefit for low-rise structures constructed in regions of high seismic activity based on conservative estimates of their relative construction cost with respect to conventional systems. The additonal cost to build a 6- or 8-story structure with SC-CBFs as opposed to CBFs in Los Angeles is expected to have a pay-off period well within the service life of the structure.
