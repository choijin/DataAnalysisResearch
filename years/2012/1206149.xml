<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;A newly developed technique of three-tone intermodulation distortion will be used to examine the nonlinear electrodynamics of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) thin films in the microwave frequency regime.  This method generates multiple orders of nonlinearity at the same frequency, thereby eliminating time-scale and dispersion differences between the different orders.  Using this advantage, the physical origin of even and odd order nonlinearity will be probed in patterned HTS passive microwave devices.  The contribution of patterning to nonlinearity, in particular to time reversal symmetry breaking, will be determined by comparing devices comprised of sloped or vertical line edges.  The contribution of crystalline symmetry will be understood by comparing devices made from yttrium and thallium based HTS materials.  Finally, the contribution of hole doping will be understood by modifying films with nitrogen gas anneals.  The bulk of this work will be done by a team of six to ten undergraduates pursuing degrees in physics and engineering.  Along with learning in-demand skills such as microwave test and measurement and finite element analysis, students will learn to be effective researchers by developing experiment plans, presenting at conferences and contributing to publications in the peer reviewed literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;High temperature superconductors were discovered in the 1980's and since then there has been a variety of commercial applications.  One application area of both commercial and military value is in high frequency electronics where the absence of resistance permits device performance far beyond that seen conventionally.  A limit to high frequency device applications of superconductors results from the tendency of superconductors to distort the electronic signals.  This research seeks an understanding of this distortion at a fundamental physics level by studying how the superconductors violate time reversal symmetry.  That superconductors do not do the same thing when time runs backwards has implications on the application of these materials to electronics, which proceeds largely on the assumption that time is symmetric.  This project will seek an understanding of why superconductors distort signals and will provide insight into how the distortion could be mitigated.  Superconducting devices made by several companies have been acquired for use in this project.  The bulk of this work will be done by a team of six to ten undergraduates pursuing degrees in physics and engineering.  Along with learning in-demand skills such as microwave test and measurement and finite element analysis, students will learn to be effective researchers by developing experiment plans, presenting at conferences and contributing to publications in the peer reviewed literature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  Resistance is often a significant detriment to electricity, to electronics, and ultimately to energy.  Although oftentimes a necessary part of an electronic circuit, sometimes electrical resistance simply degrades electronic device performance or wastes electrical energy.  Superconductors are materials that pass electric current without resistance and this project is concerned specifically with the limitations of the application of superconductors to radio electronics.  Already superconductors have served the United States in both commercial wireless and military environments by providing a highly effective way to clean up interfering radio signals and to reduce radio noise.   A key limitation of the ability of superconductors to serve in this way is a property called nonlinearity, which is the focus of this study.  When strong radio signals are processed through superconducting circuits, the superconducting material generates additional spurious frequencies.  This phenomenon, which gives guitar amplifiers their rich sound, is far less welcome when a radio signal needs to be accurately demodulated.  Our group has developed a method to scan inside a superconducting circuit, find the location inside the circuit where the spurious frequencies are being generated, and investigate the nature of the nonlinearity that produces the spurious frequencies.  During this three year award, a functioning two-dimensional scanner based on a technique pioneered in our group was built and demonstrated.  Measurements of the spurious were performed leading us to conclude that the spurious at different frequencies actually result from different physics.  The new scanning system built with this award will serve us for many years as we continue now to unravel the complex scientific problem of how superconductors produce spurious frequencies.  This RUI project resulted in three publications, all with undergraduate co-authors: one on raster scanning of nonlinearity inside a superconducting device, one on the correlation of inductive nonlinearity to carrier doping in superconductors, and one on the temperature dependence of superconductor nonlinearity.  Other significant outcomes, which will continue into the next period, are the achievement of large area 2-dimensional scans, and the scientific investigation into our recent observation that magnetic fields play a role only in the even order spurious frequencies, something that could reveal new insights into the origin of spurious signals in superconducting devices.  Broader impact: This work is conducted by undergraduate students in direct collaboration with the principal investigator.  A space in the superconductivity research field was created where undergraduates can take the lead on a portion of the project without the usual deference paid to graduate students.  This approach recognizes the two-pronged reality that nearly half of all physics students enter the STEM workforce directly after their undergraduate studies while at the same time gives a high quality of experience to those who are preparing for graduate school.  Most of the results from this project came from the eight undergraduate individuals who worked on it, including two who are physics students from nearby Grand Valley State University and who would not have otherwise had this kind of research opportunity.  Also, because of the NSF support which sustains this project, pre-college in-coming students are able to have research experiences in this project, which bolsters their enthusiasm for pursuing STEM careers.  Finally, in addition to the more conventional dissemination, we have also provided unusual dissemination through on-line videos of some of our methods.
