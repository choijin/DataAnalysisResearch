<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate the effects of a series of earthquakes in the South Island of New Zealand (Christchurch) on the electricity infrastructure. Furthermore, this research study will make projections on what the impacts would look like if smart-grid technologies were integrated into the existing power network. Would the result be better, worse, or a combination of both? In what areas is further research needed? The approach is to carry out a real-time simulation of the New Zealand?s power system with intelligent sensing, monitoring and control technologies in collaboration with New Zealand?s university and utility experts in power systems and smart grids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  &lt;br/&gt;During natural disasters and malicious attacks, intelligent monitoring and controlling power systems with new algorithms will increase real-time responsiveness to changing power loads and component failures, improve the dynamic and transient behavior of the power network, improve grid reliability, ensure local and wide area stability, and assist human experts in control rooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  &lt;br/&gt;Energy security is very important to United States, and thus it is critical to protect our electric grid from different forms of disturbances including natural disasters and malicious attacks by using advanced sensing, monitoring and control technologies.</AbstractNarration>
