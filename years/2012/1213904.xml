<AbstractNarration>James T. Kindt at Emory University is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in lipid bilayer research. The dramatically different properties of lipid bilayers in the ordered gel phase and the disordered fluid phase (found below and above the transition temperature, respectively) have found applications in thermoresponsive liposome technology.  The proposed research activities in the Kindt group will use atomistic molecular dynamics and mixed Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (MCMD) methods to explore aspects of gel phase structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics relevant to these properties.  First, the behaviors of several force-fields will be evaluated for their agreement with x-ray scattering data and experimental gel/fluid transition temperatures. Secondly, hypotheses for origins of the experimentally determined peak in bilayer permeability near the transition temperature will be explored. Comparison of the free energy of ion and small molecule passage through fluid, gel, and interfacial zones of a bilayer at coexistence will be used to test the "leaky interface" explanation, and continuum-based modeling of surface stress relaxation will be used to test the "surface compressibility" explanation.  Thirdly, using MCMD, partitioning of lipid "dopants" within the interior and interfaces of gel phase domains will be evaluated.  Finally, the dynamics of gel-phase vesicle response to ultrafast temperature jumps will be modeled, in close conjunction with experimental collaborators, using atomistic simulation for sub-microsecond dynamics, coarse-grained simulation for longer-time relaxation, and phenomenological kinetic modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lipid molecules tend to arrange themselves in water into double-layer sheets called bilayers.  Living organisms use lipid bilayers to form boundaries between and within cells. Lipids can also be manufactured into nanoscopic capsules (called liposomes or vesicles) to contain a variety of substances, which find uses in biotechnology, drug delivery, cosmetics and personal care products, agriculture and food science.  These are useful if the capsules are designed to empty their contents in response to some "switch".  Some lipid bilayers have a built-in "switch" in the form of an inherent sensitivity to temperature: changing the temperature from just below to just above a specific "transition temperature" will cause the liposome to undergo a change in state, similar to melting. The transition influences the shape and permeability of liposomes -- below the transition temperature, the liposome will release contents very slowly, while above the transition temperature, molecules can escape more rapidly.  For reasons that are not fully understood, the permeability is strongly enhanced at temperatures very near the transition temperature.  Research in the Kindt group will use computer models of molecular behavior to investigate the structure of bilayers and liposomes near the transition temperature, where the lipid structure is partially melted and partially solid, to test hypotheses about this enhancement.  In conjunction with  colleagues who are measuring the rate of vesicle melting in the laboratory, we will also use our simulations to help describe the structure of the lower-temperature phase of the vesicle, which is not uniform and spherical but has facets and ridges, and the factors that determine the rate of the melting transition.  The goal is to discover fundamental reasons for observed liposome behaviors, so that these technologies can be approved and applied more broadly.  As a secondary product of this research, the Kindt group will produce molecular animations of our simulations to educate students and the public about lipid behavior over the World Wide Web.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lipid bilayers are sheet-like assemblies that form when lipid molecules group together in water with their hydrophobic parts facing inward and their hydrophilic parts facing outwards.  These structures form the basis for the membranes that encase living cells and organelles. The arrangement of lipids within the bilayers is typically disordered and fluid, which makes them soft and flexible enough that they will curve around to form spherical shells (called vesicles or liposomes) and that they allow molecules to permeate through them. When cooled below a characteristic transition temperature, however, bilayers made from some types of lipid will undergo a freezing transition that makes them much more rigid and impermeable, forming what is known as a "gel" phase.  The main objectives and outcomes of this project have been the study of the structure of the gel phase and the consequences of this transition using theory and computer simulations of molecular behavior.  The details of how molecules in the gel phase are arranged are not all available from experimental measurements.  The lipid molecules contain two long hydrophobic chains and a hydrophilic headgroup extending from a short segment called the glycerol backbone.  It has been common in molecular simulation studies to assume that the molecules are arranged with their glycerol backbones all pointing in the same direction.  We have shown that if instead, the backbone order is randomized, then certain properties of the simulated bilayers (the tilt angle and area per lipid) are in better agreement with experiment; this provides indirect evidence that the disordered arrangement is the better one, and should improve future efforts to model gel-phase bilayers.  Our experimental collaborators in the Dyer group at Emory have been developing temperature-jump methods to study the dynamics of protein-bilayer interactions.  These experiments use an ultrafast infrared laser pulse to rapidly heat a closed bilayer shell (called a vesicle), initially kept below the transition temperature, to induce rapid melting.  It is possible to follow the extent of melting after the temperature jump and show that melting starts off quickly, slows down significantly within the first microsecond, and then proceeds as a stretched-out process lasting milliseconds. To better understand the origins of this behavior, we have used a simplified molecular lipid model to simulate melting of frozen vesicles.  Our models reproduce the timescale and exponential form of the initial rapid melting and subsequent slowing down. From an analysis of the various driving forces that control the melting process and cause changes to the shape and size of the vesicle and the number of gel domains (see image) we can propose an explanation for the longer-term behavior as well, that a few gel domains will survive the initial stage of melting and fluctuate in size but only rarely disappear entirely.  We expect these insights to be useful for the interpretation of future temperature-jump experiments involving vesicle melting.  The third major research outcome of this project has been the development of a new explanation for anomalous bilayer permeability near the transition temperature.  It is unsurprising that molecules can permeate much more readily through a fluid phase bilayer than through the rigid gel phase.  It was surprising when, over four decades ago, the overall permeability of a bilayer was found to be higher close to the transition temperature (where fluid and gel coexist) than at temperatures where it is purely fluid.  In performing simulations on simple model membranes, we realized that when a fluid domain is surrounded by gel, it shrinks when a permeant passes through it, and that the resulting decrease of interfacial energy at the gel-fluid boundary will tend to draw the permeant in and lower the effective barrier to permeation. Further calculations using statistical thermodynamics showed that, at least under certain circumstances, the enhancement of permeation through this effect can be great enough to counterbalance the permeant being blocked by the majority gel phase, and can thus account for the observed anomaly. The practical relevance of this phenomenon is that gel-phase lipid vesicles are under investigation as a means to encapsulate anti-cancer drugs for targeted heat-triggered release localized at tumor sites.   Improved understanding of how lipid phase affects permeability is important for the prediction of rates of permeability through both of artificial encapsulants and living cell membranes.  The theme of phase behavior in lipids was continued in our outreach efforts, a highlight of which was the production of a narrated pedagogical video that explores why butter is solid at room temperature while olive oil is a liquid, with illustrations that include animations of our molecular simulations.  This video, "Fats vs. Oils: How molecular structure affects melting point" was produced as a collaborative effort among the members of the Kindt group was posted on Youtube and shared with instructors at Emory and elsewhere as a resource for general interest and instruction in organic chemistry and biochemistry.
