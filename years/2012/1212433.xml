<AbstractNarration>This award supports the development of the Einstein Toolkit. The Einstein Toolkit is an open-source suite of computational tools that enables interdisciplinary research in numerical relativity, general relativistic astrophysics and gravitational wave physics, and takes advantage of the emerging generation of petascale supercomputers and new cyberinfrastructure technologies. The work supported by this award adds to the Einstein Toolkit transformative new technology in adaptive mesh refinements and general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics, thus boosting simulation capabilities and unlocking new modeling frontiers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computational infrastructure provided by the Einstein Toolkit has a broad positive impact on the gravitational physics and astrophysics communities. By publicly providing state-of-the-art modeling capabilities that otherwise would stay proprietary, the Einstein Toolkit maximizes the science return of funds invested in basic research. The numerical codes in the Einstein Toolkit support the quick realization of transformative computation and data-driven science stimulated by innovators entering the field. Furthermore, the Einstein Toolkit ensures the sustainability of simulation codes in numerical relativity by providing a straightforward mechanism for the migration of software to new cyberinfrastructure and technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported a collaborative effort to enhance the capabilities of the Einstein Toolkit. The Einstein Toolkit is an open software platform of core computational tools to enable gravitational wave astrophysics research. The collaboration is community driven, with a core team of numerical relativists at Caltech, Georgia Tech, Louisiana State University and the Rochester Institute of Technology. With the support from this award, the Einstein Toolkit was enhanced in a radical way, addressing software engineering, multi-physics and data issues. The effort was organized in the following activity areas:  (1)  Adaptive mesh refinement and multi-block systems: The Einstein Toolkit underwent improvements of its adaptive mesh refinement capabilities provided by Carpet. The effort focused on increasing performance and accuracy for long-term evolutions. In addition, infrastructure suitable for generic multi-block calculations for arbitrary curvilinear coordinate systems was designed, implemented, and tested.   (2)   Magneto-hydrodynamics and Multi-physics: The magneto-hydrodynamic sector of the Einstein Toolkit was enhanced to include constrained transport routines to ensure that the magnetic field remains divergence-free to numerical precision. Modules to incorporate general equations of state, temperature evolution, additional microphysics, and approximate radiation and neutrino transport were developed and tested.  (3)  Software Support: The collaboration continued to provide support to the community of users. In particular, the core team maintained and tested open code for general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics, including regular releases and active user support channels.  Broader Impact:  The Einstein Toolkit is the most widely used computational infrastructure in the numerical relativity community. Some groups use parts of the Toolkit, and many of them contribute regularly to its development. The award enabled valuable opportunities for the training of many undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers as well as research activities related to the Einstein Toolkit. They received training in the underlying physics and astrophysics, and in computational and software engineering methods.
