<AbstractNarration>Social isolation has been found to be as detrimental to health as smoking and obesity, but the neural mechanisms linking social relationships to health and well-being are poorly understood. Evidence suggests that social support may increase endogenous opioid activity throughout the brain, and opioids limit the brain's reaction to stress. The proposed research will utilize a pharmacological intervention--naltrexone--to block endogenous opioid activity during a procedure that combines social support and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using a randomized, double-blind placebo control design, participants will first receive either an opioid antagonist (which blocks the effects of opioids) or an inert sugar pill. Participants will then be subjected to a stressor during brain imaging under each of three conditions: while alone, while receiving social support from a stranger, and while receiving support from a spouse.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dr. James Coan (University of Virgina) and colleagues' past research has demonstrated that threat-related brain activity is attenuated by social support using this experimental design, particularly when the support provider is a spouse. If opioid antagonists block this effect from occurring, that will constitute compelling evidence that at least one key mechanism linking social contact to better health is the activation of opioid activity that buffers us against the effects of stress. This study is unique in providing 1) a critical test of the opioid hypothesis of social support in humans; and 2) a novel approach to the methods used in this area of research by mixing a pharmaceutical intervention, a social support manipulation, and fMRI, all in a broadly representative community sample.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically, the greatest strides in understanding important phenomena follow a detailed account of underlying mechanisms. If naltrexone blocks the impact of social support on the brain's threat response, then vital steps will have been taken toward understanding the nature of well documented links between social relationships and health. Understanding these mechanisms could have a broad and meaningful influence on a numerous and diverse array of scientific and medical questions, paying substantial dividends to society as a whole. Knowledge of the basic mechanisms supporting relationship-health associations will help us to realize full potential of interventions that emphasize social relationships across a variety of disciplines and contexts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Public health advocates have long broadcast messages about the harms of smoking and obesity, but messages about the dangers of social isolation rarely penetrate the media. And social isolation is dangerous. Meta-analyses suggest that social isolation predicts poor health outcomes to a comparable or even greater degree than cigarette use. The effects of social support probably include both indirect and direct effects. Indirect effects are mediated through increased health behaviors and diminished probabilistic risks associated with proximity to others. The mechanisms directly linking social proximity to health are more of a mystery. Endogenous opioid activity is a strong candidate mechanism for the direct mediation of social support. There is now considerable evidence that positive social contact&ndash;especially physical touch&ndash;unconditionally increases opioid activation in both humans and other social mammals. Moreover, opioids are potent stress reducers, decreasing pain, and diminishing hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activity. One difficulty in testing opioid mediation is that opioid activity is not easily captured using imaging methods. Despite this, standard methods exist for blocking the action of opioids at receptor sites using an opioid antagonist. In 52 people, we tested whether an opioid antagonist, naltrexone hydrochloride, administered prior to fMRI scanning, would block the social regulation of threat by supportive handholding. Our design combined a double-blind randomized drug trial (naltrexone versus placebo) with a reliable fMRI-based method for using supportive handholding to regulate neural threat responding, in vivo. (Our handholding tasks asks participants to face the threat of shock while alone, holding hands with a stranger, or holding hands with a relationship partner.) We hypothesized that the naltrexone group would not benefit from the social regulation effects of handholding either at all, or to the same extent, as the placebo group.&nbsp;</p> <p><br />What we observed was puzzling. On the one hand, we did observe an interaction between handholding condition (alone, stranger, partner) and drug (naltrexone, placebo). On the other hand, our results precisely contradicted our hypothesis. Specifically, decomposition of the interaction effect suggested the commonly observed regulatory effects of supportive handholding were manifest in the naltrexone group, but not in the placebo group (see figure 1). For example, in the naltrexone group, we saw significantly less activity during partner handholding than both stranger handholding and the alone condition in regions putatively involved in the activation and regulation of emotional responses, such as the left amygdala, anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, orbital frontal gyrus, and portions of the dorsal striatum. By contrast, in the placebo group, all of the handholding conditions (alone, stranger, partner) were more or less equally activated by threat cues in these same regions. There are a number of possible reasons for this pattern of effects, but none of them include the possibility that endogenous opioid activity is necessary for the direct effects on neural threat responding of supportive handholding. More difficult to explain is the apparent failure to replicate the typical pattern of handholding effects in the placebo condition. One possibility, which we are pursuing in a follow-up study, is that the long wait time (2 hours) at the scanning facility during which participants waited for the naltrexone to take maximum effect created an unanticipated habituation to the scanning facility and the experimental situation that the naltrexone actually blocked. If the naltrexone blocked the habituation effect that manifested in the placebo group, then it remains true that supportive handholding attenuated their threat responses despite the naltrexone. If our follow-up study of wait time effects replicates the pattern observed in our placebo group, this explanation will be supported.<br /><br /></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/22/2017<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;A&nbsp;Coan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261499/1261499_10272676_1487795858576_BeckesIARR2016--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261499/1261499_10272676_1487795858576_BeckesIARR2016--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261499/1261499_10272676_1487795858576_BeckesIARR2016--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In the naltrexone group, activations were lower during partner handholding than other conditions in right anterior insula /inferior frontal gyrus and portions of the dorsal striatum.
