<AbstractNarration>This action funds Grey Nearing of the University of Arizona to conduct a research project, entitled "An approach to evaluate the value of data assimilation," during the summer of 2012 at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.  The host scientist is Dawen Yang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the development of a method to estimate the utility of a general probabilistic data assimilation filter or smoother and to disassociate effects data assimilation inefficiency due to filter assumptions from inefficiency due to observations and the model, e.g. non-injectivity of the observation function and nonlinear state correlations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
