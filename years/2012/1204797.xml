<AbstractNarration>This project is improving technician training and increasing the number of highly skilled workers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) priority areas. The goals of the project are to increase the number of female students in nine programs and to implement the proven educational strategy of problem-based learning for all students. The following nine programs are being impacted: Civil Engineering Technology, Computer Engineering Technology, Computer Information Technology, Electronics Engineering Technology, Information Systems Security, Mechanical Engineering Technology, Networking Technology, Surveying Technology, and Sustainability Technology. The college is partnering with three school systems, industry partners, the YWCA (for community outreach) and benefitting from the best practices of two established ATE Centers: the South Carolina Advanced Technological Education (SCATE) National Resource Center and CyberWatch. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project builds on effective practice as designed and implemented by its two ATE partners. This initiative groups core activities into three components: (1) recruiting female students; (2) retaining these students by supporting gender equity strategies; and (3) providing relevance through problem-based learning to all students, thereby connecting skills taught to the workplace. Student learning is improving through the institutionalization of problem-based learning adopted and adapted from SCATE and CyberWatch in first year courses in the nine identified engineering and technology programs. The comprehensive recruitment, support, and success strategies are being sustained through professional development integrated with program activities. Project development is based on the premise that problem-based learning, relationships, and a network of support are critically important to recruitment and retention of all students, particularly underrepresented populations such as female students in technology and engineering programs. Industry input provides support for adaptation of problems related to a variety of workplaces across the spectrum of technology and engineering. Problems designed by CyberWatch and SCATE are being utilized as well as problems available from other sources such as those developed for the Sustainability Technology program at Wayne Community College. Female recruitment and relationship building are being supported by an Ambassador program modeled after SCATE, professional associations, and other best practices. The membership of the college in the Achieving the Dream network and the Strategic Plan of the college document an institutional commitment to diversity, along with its capacity to institutionalize best practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project is the result of numerous conversations, meetings, and relationships with industry. Growth during the economic downturn has highlighted the need for more skilled workers and drives the project goal of increasing the number and diversity of skilled technicians. Multifaceted outreach, recruitment, and support efforts are resulting in increased enrollment of female students in nine STEM programs. Faculty and administrative involvement are having an impact on the more than 300 students enrolled in these programs. Dissemination is through NC-NET (an online source for the 58 community colleges in North Carolina), the college web site, presentations at national and state conferences, and ATE partners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College (A-B Tech, the College) applied for and received a grant entitled Skilled Workers Get Jobs:  Recruiting Women and Retaining ALL Students in 2012.  The goals of the grant were to improve excellence in technician training and increase the number of highly skilled workers in prioritized STEM technology and engineering areas.   A-B Tech increased female enrollment in identified STEM programs (Computer Engineering Technology, Computer Information Technology, Electronics Engineering Technology, Information Systems Security, Mechanical Engineering Technology, Networking Technology, and Sustainability Technology) from 12% to 18%; but, even more importantly, it created a new institutional culture.  A-B Tech is proud to share the following impressive accomplishments (in addition to the increased female enrollment):  Fall-to-Fall retention for females in the identified programs has improved; overall it exceeded male retention (74% vs. 68.7%). In four of the seven programs, retention of female students exceeded retention for male students. Problem Based Learning (PBL) has been integrated across the college. The grant focus was on first year classes for the targeted programs but, as instructors have seen success, the use of PBL has expanded to other courses.  Focus on the Classroom workshops have been attended by a wide audience of college faculty &ndash; from areas including engineering, computer technologies, math, and science. The workshops were offered each year as Professional Development events and were attended by over 100 instructors. This interactive event included two primary focuses: (1) gender equity strategies for the classroom; and (2) problem-based learning. A-B TechÆs On-line Learning department requested that Co-PIs Jim Sullivan and Steven Marcus develop a hybrid version of the PBL workshop, which they completed in spring 2014. Workshops and materials have also been delivered for more than 90 pre-service high school teachers and counselors through an Innovative Expo. Participants attended a daylong event at A-B Tech that included two primary focuses: (1) why the identified programs are viable options for students; and (2) why women should be encouraged to participate in these programs. Effective and engaging marketing materials were designed to recruit more female students. The College has created marketing materials for the identified programs which are inclusive of all students. The Picture Yourself campaign was created which includes a display board, posters and bookmarks. A Women in Technology group has been created at A-B Tech and is now a recognized student organization that sponsors regular events.  These events have a great impact on female college students. Former student (and graduate), Amy Daugherty, stated, "I know that having the Women in Technology group and the support of women committed to my success certainly made a difference in my life."  The student organization has led to formation of an Asheville Women in Technology Group for local professionals A STEM scholarship was endowed at the college directly as a result of the grant. Information on successful recruiting and retention strategies was shared in numerous venues at both the local, state and national level.   Some of the conferences where dissemination took place are:  North Carolina Computer Instruction Association (NCCIA) Conference, Hi-Tec Conference, Aiken (SC) 2016 STEM Symposium and the National Center for Science and Civic Engagement Summer Institute.      As a result of the success of this grant, A-B Tech received funding for a second grant entitled Skilled Workers Get Job 2.0:  Appalachian Access Grant.  The goals and objectives of the new project will be accomplished through three main activity components: wider adaptation/implementation across six Partner Colleges in the Southern Appalachian Region (North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee); broader institutionalization at A-B Tech; and a learnin...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
