<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on the formation and structure of wall clouds associated with supercell thunderstorms that were observed during the Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment II (VORTEX2).  The study will be accomplished through analysis of photogrammetrically analyzed photos and high-definition video of the hook region of supercells that were also concurrently being scanned by mobile Doppler radars.  The objectives below will be met by integrating the visual data with high-resolution single and dual-Doppler analyses of the supercell hook region.  The Ground Based Velocity Track Display (GBVTD) technique will be used to obtain axisymmetric wind fields for storms with good visual data and coverage with only one radar.  Sounding, mobile mesonet, and surface station data will also be incorporated to document the thermodynamic characteristics of the environment and supercell hook region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first objective is to understand the processes responsible for wall cloud formation.&lt;br/&gt;Current understanding of wall cloud formation is based on idealized numerical simulations published more than 25 years ago and visual observations.  Three hypotheses will be tested.  The first is that lower Ã¨e air behind the supercell gust front is ingested into the updraft and saturates at a lower altitude than the primary cloud base.  Second, the wall cloud is formed by the adiabatic cooling associated with the pressure deficit created by circulation that may be present in the wall cloud.  Third, wall cloud formation is due to rising low-level scud that attaches to the primary cloud base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second objective is to document the three-dimensional structure of the precipitation (reflectivity), vorticity, vertical motion, perturbation pressure, angular momentum, and horizontal wind fields within tornadic and non tornadic wall clouds. This analysis will, for the first time, document the differences and/or similarities between tornadic and nontornadic wall clouds. It will also help to define the relationship between the scale and intensity of the wall cloud relative to the updraft, low-level mesocyclone, and precipitation distribution within the hook region for lower precipitation, classic, and high precipitation supercells sampled during VORTEX2. Finally, it will be possible to compare the visual characteristics of the wall cloud with the kinematic structure derived from the Doppler radar data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The wall cloud associated with supercell thunderstorms has been visually documented in many observational studies.  It is generally accepted to be associated with the low-level updraft and is often the location of tornadogenesis.  Amazingly, no observational study to date has systematically examined wall cloud formation, structure, and evolution relative to the low-level updraft, mesocyclone, and precipitation distribution within the hook region.  Hence, realizing the above stated objectives would enhance our fundamental understanding of the low-level visual structure and evolution of supercell thunderstorms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that results from this research will be incorporated into the National Weather Service Skywarn storm spotter training.  Skywarn spotters are vital to the accurate dissemination of visual weather information during severe weather situations. The project will expose a number of undergraduate students to the research process and will enhance the research infrastructure (also used in teaching) at Lyndon State College. Research results will be incorporated into many of the undergraduate classes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The wall cloud is a localized lowering of cloud base below the primary cloud base of a thunderstorm.  Wall clouds are often observed to form in supercell thunderstorms, a long-lived storm with a rotating updraft.  Over the years, storm chasers and early observational studies have hypothesized that the supercell wall cloud is a visual indicator of a strong updraft and may exhibit rotation.  As indicated in National Weather Service training documents, wall clouds are visually important to identify in that if they exhibit rapid upward motion and strong rotation, they are often precursors to tornadogenesis.     While wall clouds are easily recognized and well photo-documented, our understanding of how they form has been limited to numerical modeling results.  This study is the first to use observational data to understand how wall clouds form.  The data was collected during the Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX2) that occurred during the spring seasons of 2009 and 2010.  VORTEX2 was a large multiagency field program designed to collect comprehensive observations in and around supercell thunderstorms.  Some of the observing platforms used in this study include mobile Doppler radar data, photography, instrumented vehicles that collected thermodynamic and wind data, and balloon soundings documenting the vertical structure of temperature, moisture, and winds within and around supercell thunderstorms.     Two supercell thunderstorms with well-defined wall clouds were analyzed in this study.  The first occurred on 5 June 2009 and the second on 11 June 2009.  A photograph of the 5 June 2009 wall cloud is shown in Fig. 1.  This wall cloud is collocated with strong low-level rotation in the hook echo region of the supercell (Fig. 2).  Our analysis found that there are two mechanisms that are responsible for wall cloud formation, as summarized in Fig. 3.  The majority of the air entering the wall cloud is rain-cooled and comes from a region of the storm northeast of the hook echo known as the forward flank.  This rain-cooled air is close to the ground and ascends upward into the wall cloud.  Because this air is cooler than the air in the warmer inflow, as it rises and cools, it saturates and start forming cloud at a lower level relative to the warmer inflow air.  This result is consistent with numerical modeling results.  A second mechanism concerns the rotation within the wall cloud.  This wall cloud exhibited rapid rotation.  The rotation is associated with lower air pressure at the circulation center.  The lower air pressure is associated with a relatively lower air temperature as the air adiabatically expands.  The adiabatically cooled air associated with rapid rotation will saturate at a lower altitude creating additional wall cloud lowering labeled "local lowering" in Fig. 3.     The well-defined wall cloud observed on 11 June 2009 is shown in Fig. 4.  This wall cloud exhibited no rotation.  Analyses showed that it formed in a manner similar to the 5 June 2009 wall cloud in that rain-cooled air in the forward-flank region of the storm saturates at an altitude consistent with the observed wall cloud base.
