<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2012 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. These fellowships support a research and training plan at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Thomas Koberda is "Dynamics of mapping class group representations and applications to right-angled Artin groups." The host institution for the fellowship is Yale University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Yair Minsky.</AbstractNarration>
