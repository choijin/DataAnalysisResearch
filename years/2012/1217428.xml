<AbstractNarration>This research introduces novel recharging systems and algorithms to supplement existing systems and lead to autonomous, sustainable energy management on sensor networks. Applications such as bridge fault detection that rely on sensor networks operating away from buildings often lack energy for long-term monitoring. In these scenarios traditional recharging methods (e.g. solar panels) are unavailable or cannot provide sufficient energy (e.g. at night). To achieve this, the research has three key components. The first component develops an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to wirelessly recharge sensor nodes, a localization system based on magnetic field intensity, and autonomous control algorithms that optimize power transfer. Based on this system, the second part develops online algorithms for UAV trajectory optimization in systems with multiple UAVs as well as distributed algorithms that induce energy deficits in a subset of nodes to enable efficient recharging. Finally, the third component provides models and distributed algorithms to predict future energy recharging and usage for sensor nodes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research impacts a range of societal, educational, and scientific topics. This project addresses a critical national need of enabling regular monitoring of bridge integrity through autonomous, energy efficient sensor network and robot systems. Improving bridge fault detection is necessary given aging infrastructure and limited local budgets for performing such work through current manual visual inspection processes. Educationally, at the K-12 level, this provides demos and workshops to enhance existing programs, encouraging young students (especially women) to pursue STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

This is motivated by discussions with ecology and hydrology collaborators who were very excited about the possibilities of charging and collecting data from deployed sensors, but also identified that often deploying sensors is challenging and automated systems lack the ability to precisely install sensors in the correct soil times. We developed a UAV that can deploy sensors, but moreover, when it lands on a surface, it uses onboard sensor information to classify the type of surface (e.g. soil, grass, rock, etc.). This can augment existing vision-based classification systems that fail when, for instance, a rock is right under the surface of grass that would prevent automated installation of a soil moisture probe. We found that we can accurately classify the softness of the surface with 90% accuracy just based on accelerometer readings from landings. This is a significant result that will allow us to deploy, charge, and collect data from sensors that need to be installed in hard to access locations for long periods of time. </span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/13/2016<br>      Modified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;Basha</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1217428/1217428_10206191_1473786469814_IMG_1846-sml--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1217428/1217428_10206191_1473786469814_IMG_1846-sml--rgov-800width.jpg" title="UAV wireless power scenario"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1217428/1217428_10206191_1473786469814_IMG_1846-sml--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="UAV wireless power scenario"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">UAV wireless power scenario</div> <div class="imageCredit">B.
