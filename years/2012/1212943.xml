<AbstractNarration>Pervasive computing, such as sensors in smartphones, buildings, automobiles and cities, result in increased sharing of sensor data, whether initiated by users or by other authorities such as service providers, government entities, interest groups, and individuals. Embedded in this data is information which others, even using sophisticated data mining algorithms, can fuse to construct a virtual biography of our activities, revealing private behaviors and lifestyle patterns. Researchers in this project are devising computational methods to let users exercise privacy control over their personal sensory data that is shared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is developing a user-configurable cryptographically-secure ?privacy shield? to run on smartphones and act upon sensor information flowing to other users, apps, and services. To make privacy understandable, the user is presented with a higher level abstraction for expressing privacy and sharing in terms of rich inferences and contexts drawn from sensor measurements. The user can designate some inferences and contexts as private.  To provide privacy while ensuring the quality of service provided by the recipients of the sensory information, the system also incorporates algorithms which, over time, learn a personalized model of the privacy risk from sharing an inference. The theoretical concepts and the system realization are being validated via user studies in mobile health and personal sensing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: By providing better understanding of the behavioral privacy problem and risks inherent in sharing seemingly innocuous data, results from this project will lead to a more educated and informed citizenry, regulators, and policy makers, and provide effective tools for privacy management to those who share sensory information.</AbstractNarration>

The research focused both specifically on mobile personal sensing applications as well as sensor instrumented physical spaces.      Significant advances were made along each front. The grant provided seed funds to build what has now emerged as a large scale pervasive computing  testbed entitied TIPPERS that consists of  (a) an instrumted building with variety of sensor subsystems for localizing individuals inside the building, and for monitoring  the energy usage. These subsystems include beacons, WiFi Access points, cameras, energy meters, plug-load devices, smart phones as sensors, etc.   (b) an experimental  IoT  system technology that embodies privacy by design principle. The system offers higher level semantic abstractions to express privacy policies, supports mechanisms to translate higher level policies to individual sensor control, provides mechanisms to intercept data flow between components to infuse new privacy technologies, and also maintains detaiiled logs to support evaluation of privacy achieved via different technologies.

TIPPERS plays a role of a IoT cluster which includes collaborators working of diverse privacy technologies ranging from secure multi-party computation (Stealth Technologies), differential privacy (Duke, Colgate, Massachussets), and privacy metrics (Galois, Cybernetica) and privacy policies (CMU)  in addition to UCI team.
