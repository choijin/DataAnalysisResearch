<AbstractNarration>This research will study the basic physical mechanisms and effectiveness of plasma surface treatments and nanoscale interfacial layers for improving hole injection from Earth abundant, inexpensive, zinc oxide based transparent conducting oxides.  Transparent conducting oxides that allow good positive charge (holes) injection are critical for high efficiency organic light emitting diodes that can be used as energy efficient, general lighting sources.  Indium-tin-oxide is currently the dominant transparent conducting oxide.  However, it is expensive because of the Earth?s limited supply of indium, and alternatives are urgently needed for both organic light emitting diodes and solar cells.   The experiments will use a combination of x-ray, ultraviolet and electron spectroscopies to measure the structural and chemical changes induced by the surface modification treatments, and electrical measurements to correlate these changes with the expected improvements in the zinc oxide hole injection properties.  Device physics studies will be performed to measure how the expected improvements in the hole injection properties of the zinc oxide films influence the turn-on voltage, brightness, and power efficiency of complete organic light emitting diode test structures.  Computational modeling and simulations using based on Density Functional Theory will assist the understanding obtained from the experimental research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of experimental and computational studies is expected to provide predictive models that facilitate rationally designed reductions in turn-on voltage, and power efficiency improvements in second generation organic light emitting diodes with zinc oxide anodes, and, fewer device layers.  Fewer device layers and zinc oxide anodes are expected to translate into significantly reduced materials and processing costs.  In turn, reduced organic light emitting diode cost is expected to encourage their widespread use for general lighting, which can have a significant impact on reducing the amount of fossil fuel consumed by general lighting.</AbstractNarration>

Computational modeling and simulations using based on Density Functional Theory assisted the understanding obtained from the experimental research.   The research revealed two basic mechanisms by which the workfunction of zinc oxide anodes can be tuned (i.e., increased) to reduce interfacial barriers for hole injection in OLEDs.   Surface dipole manipulation.  O2 and CFx plasma treatments lower hole injection barriers (i.e., workfunction increases) by creating a more electronegative ZnO surface. The dipole induced by this charge redistribution reinforces the original surface dipole, which results in an increase of the surface dipole moment and an increase of workfunction.  The reverse is true for hydrocarbon contamination of ZnO surfaces.  Surface modification with large workfunction adlayers. With modification of aluminum-zinc oxide (AZO) anode surfaces with nanoscale (~3nm) VOx, MoOx or WOx layers, the decrease in the hole injection barrier is due to the larger effective workfunction of the composite AZO/VOx, AZO/MoOx or AZO/WOx anodes.  Spectroscopic measurements reveal that deviations from stoichiometry (oxygen vacancies) result in reduced metal cations (W5+, W4+, Mo4+, Mo5+, V4+ and V3+), which lead to partial filling of the metal d bands, and formation of associated gap states which enable enhanced hole injection by tunneling.     Additional outcomes of the project are:   3. Enhanced electro-optical performance of the composite anodes in  OLEDs was demonstrated (compared to ITO).  The luminous efficiency  (LE), power efficiency (PE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of  OLEDs with AZO/WOx anodes were 62 %, 100 %, and 85 % better than  ITO. OLEDS with AZO/VOx anodes exhibited 62 %, 75 % and 85 % better  LE, PE, and EQE, respectively, than ITO. OLEDs with AZO/MoOx               exhibited a 50 % increase in PE and 71 % improvement in EQE compared  to ITO. The electro-optical performance of OLEDs with CFx or O2 plasma  treated AZO was comparable to ITO.  The enhanced performance is due  to improved hole injection, charge balance and radiative recombination  efficiency.  The outcomes indicate that surface modified ZnO based  anodes are promising alternatives to ITO, particularly when the lower cost  and Earth abundance of Al and Zn compared to In and Sn are considered.   4. Surface and interface models of ZnO were developed and their  electronic properties including workfunctions investigated using Density  Functional Theory calculations. Theoretical methodologies to treat the  polar surfaces and to accurately calculate their workfunctions were  developed. The computation results were in qualitative agreements with  the experiments, and the methodology developed is expected to find  general application beyond the specific material systems studied in this  project.   5. The project fully supported one PhD graduate (now at Intel) and partially  supported two others (one at Samsung Austin Semiconductor), thus  contributing to workforce development.
