<AbstractNarration>The project will provide partial support to hold a Conference on Rock Magnetism and its Applications,&lt;br/&gt;from June 21-24, 2012 in Santa Fe NM, continuing a biennial series of such conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the Santa Fe Conference series is to help advance our understanding of Earth's surface environment and its deep interior throughout in-depth and interdisciplinary discussions of critical developments in paleomagnetism, environmental (and bio) magnetism and rock magnetism. &lt;br/&gt;This year emphasis of the meeting will be on the processing of iron in the biosphere and its manifestations in magnetic records in sediments and extraterrestrial materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, this proposal will contribute to the development of young scientists by providing the opportunity to meet and interact with leading national and international researchers, gaining deeper understanding and broader perspective of the field, and forming the basis for future cross-disciplinary collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organized by the faculty and staff of the University of MinnesotaÆs Institute for Rock Magnetism, the 9th Biennial Santa Fe Conference on Rock Magnetism was held June 21-24 on the campus of St. JohnÆs College in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and was attended by fifty scientists (including 15 students) from twelve countries.  These meetings are designed to allow collaborative exploration of the state of the art in magnetic geophysics and its applications throughout the natural sciences, in an informal, interactive discussion-oriented mode. Frontier research areas covered in the 2012 conference included:  (1) The role of iron oxide minerals in environmental processes and the application of magnetic characterization methods to quantify iron mineralogy and particle size distributions in natural and anthropogenic materials in the environment, with a focus on atmospheric dust.  Can we use these material characteristics to improve our understanding of the sources and transport paths of atmospherically-transported nanoparticulate materials? What are the environmental effects of the absorption and re-radiation of solar energy by iron oxide particles in dust, in the atmosphere or when deposited on mountain snow cover, and how do such particles influence marine ecology when they are deposited into the oceans?  (2) Biomineralization of fine-particle iron oxides or iron sulfides by bacteria, fish and birds, for sensing the geomagnetic field for navigation or other purposes.  How do the physical and chemical attributes of these biogenic magnets vary according to the biological classification of the host organisms, their evolutionary history, and the environments in which they lived?  Do similar magnetic minerals found in Martian meteorite samples indicate the past occurrence of bacterial life and an ancient planetary magnetic field on Mars?  (3) The history of the EarthÆs magnetic field, its polarity reversals and changes in strength and spatial configuration through time.  Direct instrumental measurements of the field are essentially limited to the past two centuries, and for all older time intervals we rely on the magnetization of rocks and sediments, which preserve information on the characteristics of the field in which they formed.  How accurately can the paleomagnetic field be quantified, and what does it tell us about the evolution of EarthÆs deep interior and modern-day processes in the core?  (4) The fundamental physics of fine-particle magnetism in geological materials.  How can laboratory measurements in controlled experimental conditions (temperature, applied magnetic fields, pressure, chemical environment, time) refine our understanding of the behavior of natural magnetic materials over enormous spans of time in uncontrolled natural conditions?   How can we combine laboratory magnetic experiments with scanning microscopy and advanced synchrotron spectroscopic techniques to gain a complete picture of the microscale physical mechanisms responsible for the magnetic behavior of bulk geomaterials?   Each of these research areas is the subject of sustained and intensive study by research groups around the world, and needless to say, the ultimate answers to the questions above still remain to be discovered.  But focused gatherings of leading international and interdisciplinary researchers and students  are an important part of the process of discovery, and the Santa Fe Conference helped advance the state of the art in magnetic geophysics and its Earth-science applications.
