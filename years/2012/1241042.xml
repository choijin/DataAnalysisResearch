<AbstractNarration>Amazonia is Earth's most iconic center of biological diversity and endemism and is among the most important terrestrial biomes due to its contributions to global systems ecology. This project seeks to answer an overarching question in biodiversity science: How was the modern Amazonian biota and its environment assembled across space and time?  The research is designed to understand the evolutionary and environmental-ecological history of late Neogene-Recent Amazonia through a comparative approach that integrates across the disciplines of systematics, population biology, ecosystem structure and function, geology, Earth systems modeling and remote sensing, and environmental history. The project also investigates how biotic and environmental change over this time-period influenced Amazonian functional diversity in biogeochemical flows, and how these, in turn, shaped the dimensions of biodiversity seen today as well as the history of global-scale changes in biogeochemical cycling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, which is a collaboration with Brazilian scientists and funding agencies, represents the most integrative examination of Amazonian biodiversity and its history to date.  The approaches taken describe a methodological template for analyzing information about the history of biotic and environmental change across large, ecologically complex landscapes that can be generalized to other systems.  The project creates a large framework for formal and informal education including the training of students, development of a major museum exhibit on Amazonia, workshops for K-12 STEM teachers, publications in professional educational journals, and a web portal, The Evolutionary Encyclopedia of Amazonian Biodiversity, that will make all results available to the public, as well as serve as an informational platform about Amazonian biodiversity and its global importance. This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Amazon Basin is home to the largest and most biologically diverse tropical forest in the world.  It also hosts the world's largest river system, which delivers 17%-20% of the world's freshwater to the Atlantic Ocean.  The high biological diversity of Amazonia has fascinated scientists for generations, and it has spurred hundreds, if not thousands, of publications seeking to describe and explain its origins. A critical factor in the evolution of the diverse biota has been the geological history of the region, with the time of origin of the modern Amazon River system being of particular importance because it marked the beginning of the modern Amazon Basin.  However, the geology of Amazonia has been, and continues to be, a subject of much controversy.  The objective of this project was to better define the geologic history of Amazonia and present reasons for how and why it might have had an influence on the evolution of the biota of the region.  The Amazon Basin covers an enormous area, with its drainage area comparable to ~90% of the area of the contiguous United States.  Many regions of the basin are inaccessible wilderness. Of necessity, in the course of this project activities were limited to six specific research topics, as detailed below. Analyses of the data obtained in the course of this research continue, so results for all aspects of the research are not yet available.  However, upon completion of all the analyses of the data obtained from the field research I expect a new model for the geological evoution of the Amazon Basin to emerge, as well as how geology impacted the evolution of it's diverse biota over the last 10 million years. This is significant because it will redirect many lines of research into Amazonian biodiversity, as well as broaden societal awareness of the importance of the Amazonian ecosystem and its global impact on such topics as climate change, the effects of biodiversity loss, and the need for proper stewardship of natural systems, both biotic and abiotic.   The research projects pursued in this project are as follows:  1.  Prior to the formation of the modern Amazon River system, drainage from the basin was to the northwest, via the proto-Orinoco River system and to the southeast, through the lowlands of eastern Bolivia.  Field data gathered over the course of several excursions to Roraima State, Brazil, demonstrate that a postulated third outlet, via the Essequibo River to the northeast through Guyana, also existed. Supporting data come from analyses of the stratigraphy and topography, as well as radiometric data from detrital zircons indicating possible ages and provenance, or site of origin, of sediments comprising the Boa Vista Formation.  2. The Belterra Clay is a geologic formation that occurs in eastern Amazonia.  The surface of this formation manifests itself as a virtually flat plain on both sides of the Amazon River, indicating that the deposit existed prior to the formation of the modern Amazon River. The age of the Belterra Clay is unknown, as is a satisfactory explanation for how it formed.  Attempts to date the formation using detrital zircons have proven useful in determining it's maximum possible age, as well as the provenance of a portion of the sediments comprising the formation.  3. It has been proposed that the Madre de Dios Formation of southwestern Amazonia, in southeastern Peru and northern Bolivia, is equivalent to the Ica Formation of lowland Amazonia in western Brazil.  Confirmation of this hypothesis came from field studies of the latter formation.  4. In addition, studies of sediments of the Madre de Dios Formation demonstrated that proposed marine influences on deposition in southwestern Amazonia in the late Miocene/Pliocene (~10.0-2.6 million years ago) could not be substantiated. Analyses of detrial zircons from the Madre de Dios Formation are underway to determine the provenance of the sediments that comprise the formation, as well as to provide support for previously determined age assignments.  5. The "white sands" of lowland Amazonia have long been of interest to biologists because they host large numbers of endemic species.  These deposits occur as relatively small, scattered surficial outcrops, particularly in central Amazonia. Analyses of these sand deposits were initiated to determine if they could be correlated by using sedimentological data and ages derived from detrital zircons, which might also indicate their provenance.  6. Before the formation of the modern Amazon River system, lowland Amazonia served as one very large sedimentary basin. At that time there existed rivers that carried sediment into, and distributed it throughout, the basin. Remnants of the paleo-river systems in existence at the time of formation of the modern Amazon River occur as underfit or dry river paleochannels visible today throughout lowland Amazonia, and they contribute to our understanding of the physical environment at the end of the Pliocene, about ~2.6 million years ago.
