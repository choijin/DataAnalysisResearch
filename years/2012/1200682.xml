<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard award for a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site Program at the University of South Florida (USF) entitled, RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site-Water Awareness Research and Education (RET-WARE), under the direction of Dr. Maya Trotz. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this three year RET is to provide a proactive and well structured research, education and professional development experience for at least 44 middle and high school science and math teachers from the Hillsborough County Public Schools and pre-service teachers from USF's College of Education.  The research theme is framed around three of the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges (i.e. management of the nitrogen cycle, provision of clean water, and urban infrastructure improvement) and the role of formal and informal science education in integrating marginalized, coastal community participants in developing solutions to these grand challenges while broadening participation in STEM fields. RET participants will interact with faculty mentors and their research group in the Colleges of Engineering and Arts and Sciences at USF through individual summer research projects, research seminars, social and community activities, professional training sessions, and online media linked to the RET website.  The RET program will be integrated with 1) two USF courses (Development of Technology-Based Instruction and Engineering Engagement: Beyond the lab and the Drawing Board), 2) an ongoing project of the USF Engineers for a Sustainable World student chapter (WARE in East Tampa, an Environmental Protection Agency People Prosperity Planet Phase II award winner in 2009), and 3) ongoing faculty research and graduate training to ensure year long teacher support in local area schools and communities, especially those marginalized by high percentages of poverty and English as a second language barriers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target audience includes teachers from historically underrepresented groups in the STEM disciplines and those who teach in schools characterized by a high level of poverty and a high percentage of minority and English language learners. Therefore, the project is likely to increase the exposure to and engagement in STEM research by underserved students. The program will benefit from a strong infrastructure of K-12 education and outreach programs already in place at USF (e.g., Engineering EXPO, Tampa Interdisciplinary Environmental Research REU). A unique feature of this proposed RET site is the emphasis on community engagement, as well as partnerships with companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies which provides an opportunity for participating teachers and their students to learn how STEM is applied to solving important problems within societal, political and economic contexts.</AbstractNarration>

Of the in service teacher participants, 60% were female and 30% were underrepresented minorities (URM). Participating in service teachers represented 25 Hillsborough County Public Schools, 88% of which served greater than 50% underrepresented minority populations, 80% of which served students economically disadvantaged students. Of the pre service participants, 55% were female. RET participants worked with 10 faculty mentors and their research group in the Colleges of Engineering, Public Health, and Education through individual summer research projects, research seminars, social and community activities, professional training sessions, and online media linked to the RET website. The RET program was integrated with two USF courses (Development of Technology-Based Instruction and Environmental Engineering Laboratory), 2) an ongoing project community project, WARE in East Tampa, and 3) ongoing faculty research and graduate training to ensure year long teacher support in local area schools and communities, especially those marginalized by high percentages of poverty. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>RET-WARE&rsquo;s intellectual merits were: 1) advanced three of the NAE&rsquo;s Grand Challenges related to how we sustainably manage the nitrogen cycle, provide clean water, and improve urban infrastructure as well as integrate the role of formal and informal science education to engage marginalized, coastal community participants in the development of solutions to these grand challenges whilst broadening participation in STEMs fields. 2) trained the next generation of educators and engineers to grasp and incorporate innovative and locally relevant material into curriculum and research that improves student performance and interest in STEM fields whilst contributing to ongoing faculty research and teaching, and the emergence of sustainable healthy communities. Educational technology projects were developed by RET participants and their faculty and graduate student mentors, field tested in the schools, improved, and 16 e-learning modules were made available online through the project website. 14 different peer reviewed learning products (curricular units, lesson plans, activities) were published with teachers on teachengineering.org.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>RET-WARE&rsquo;s broader impacts were: 1) increased the number of teachers and researchers participating in STEM research, 2) broadened participation of students marginalized by poverty and English language skills in STEM disciplines, 3) shared middle and high school science curriculum through the internet (e.g. ret-ware.net and teachengineering.org) and local (e.g. the USF annual Engineering EXPO) or national conferences, and 5) directly supported 39 science and math teachers or 11 potential teachers and enhancements of the research programs of 10 faculty participants that could contribute to sustainable healthy communities. A collaborative network was established between the university and schools in the Hillsborough County Public Schools (HCPS) with green infrastructure research projects implemented at 1 high school and 3 middle schools by RET participants to improve stormwater management. RET participants also successfully applied for local grants to continue research projects based on knowledge gained through WARE RET.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified:
