<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Human-Centered Computing Program in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, the Political Science Program in the Division of Social and Economic Sciences in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, and the multi-directorate Social-Computational Systems Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks 1) to develop an open-source toolkit of affordable methods and approaches that enables researchers in the information and social sciences to describe, analyze, and visualize how information flows within and between social media platforms and across geographic locations; and 2) to apply these methods and tools to create and analyze a dataset of tweets, posts, related messages and sites.  The initial focus is on Twitter data associated with the social movement that began as "Occupy Wall Street" but broadens to include other venues and even other topics.  This research will both develop tools for social media research and demonstrate how these tools improve our capabilities for research in this social media space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social media platforms are transforming how we work, live together, and govern ourselves.  The many modalities offered by social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook create a complex infrastructure, resulting in a dynamic ecosystem of information flows within and across platforms and among individuals and groups.  The resulting socio-technical system enables both rapid and emergent organizational and relational transformations, but its scope and dynamic structure present conceptual and practical challenges for researchers studying the mechanisms of the transformations.  The combination of volume, scope, complexity, and ephemeral nature of message flows require an interdisciplinary approach to developing research methods and tools for curating, processing, storing, and analyzing that go beyond the typical relational database management approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research is two-fold.  First, the research will combine knowledge of social science, political science, communications, geography, information science, and emerging computing techniques to create a scalable and affordable approach to the selective collection and analysis of data from the huge flows of tweets, "likes," and links associated with the Occupy movement. The approach will be documented and made available as an open source toolkit for other social media researchers, thus enabling a wider scope of inquiry. Second, the research will contribute to knowledge about grass-roots movements, using the Occupy movement as a currently active example that can serve as a test case, by examining the relationships of tweets, geography, and the possible linkages to other groups. The emerging information ecosystem of networks and linkages enabled by social media supplement traditional media such as newspapers and television, and messages may "go viral," crossing community and geographic boundaries with unprecedented speed and quickly reaching remote and previously unconnected audiences.  This work will provide new insights into the mechanisms by which these viral events occur and will help us understand the impact viral events can have on public participation in political discourse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the research is both immediate and cumulative. The toolkit for data curation, analysis, and visualization has the potential for transforming the research questions social and information scientists can investigate using large datasets resulting from social media. These tools can enable us to envision different frameworks within which to understand how new social media communities form and engage in the broader public discourse.  In this way, the research can transform how we think about and study the role of grass roots endeavors in community formation and change.  The techniques developed through this research will lower the technical barriers and costs encountered by other researchers and observers who conduct their own research on such datasets. The research engages a new generation of researchers at both the doctoral and undergraduate levels.  Graduate students working on the project will be developing the approach and methods and will be gaining experience in managing undergraduate students who work on the team. The experience of working on a truly transformative effort can inspire them and give them confidence to try risky and emergent efforts in the future, and they can be leaders in what may become an interdisciplinary area of study of large social media datasets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  This project originated from an observation in 2011 that the "Occupy Wall Street" social movement (OWS) utilized social media, particularly Twitter, for communications.  OWS, started with a single camp in Zucotti Park in New York City, expanded as groups of occupiers set up camps across the U.S. and in other countries.  Preliminary research revealed that Twitter had become a communications hub for people interested in or involved with the Occupy movement  We began collecting publicly available Twitter data related to "Occupy" and examining our collection with two goals:  a) understand how researchers could collect and analyze such data for research, and b) comprehend the significance of the Occupy movement and how those engaged with OWS were using Twitter.  The first goal required research tools that would facilitate the reliable collection and analysis of these ephemeral messages.  We were particularly interested in the technical and social processes that enabled a single message to spread and "go viral," reaching many people in a brief time.  The second goal required that we examine how Twitter was used within and across the Occupy camps for coordination and communication.  For example, was there evidence of links with protest movements in other countries that were associated with political parties?  Project outcomes include observations about OWS and Twitter, insights about information dissemination, and foundations for additional critical understandings about social communication.  Intellectual Merit:  Twitter and Occupy  Our analysis of about half of the 100 million tweets we collected suggest several findings:  We saw no evidence that Twitter was used to coordinate strategy or tactics between and among camps.  Specifically, we observed no evidence of coordination with European political parties or any of the global sites that were using the term "occupy." A large majority of the tweets related to logistical support for those in the camps:  food, clothing, and other essentials to continue their physical presence in the camps.  Place was an important factor in the sharing of tweets and requests for support. A significant number of tweets informed people about what was happening in the occupy camps or events that affected the camps, serving as an alternative to traditional media (TV, newspapers) that did report on the events. Some tweets included links to other, more extensive information sources, expanding the scope of shared information beyond the 140-character text message. Tweet forwarding (retweets) was the most frequently used method to share information, and a tweet could "go viral" quickly.   Intellectual Merit: Process Insights  When tweets were retweeted many times, the retweets could attract the attention of traditional media, and, conversely, the impact of a traditional media story could be amplified through tweets and retweets. Twitter users contributed to public discourse beyond their 140-character message by (a) substituting for other media when conventional media lacked coverage, (b) enabling readers to find additional information with an embedded link, and (c) enabling sharing through retweets. Information (and misinformation) in tweets could become "viral" even if there was little evidence for the assertion.  Distinctive patterns associated with tweets suggested the possibility of associating distinguishing signatures with different motivation and types of information sharing.   Broader Impacts:  Foundations for Further Understanding  The project results are serving as foundations for subsequent understandings.  Results include conceptual ways to think about research on social media data and practical tools and procedures for such research.  The project highlighted the conceptual and practical challenges of research on data from new forms of transitory information sources such as Twitter.  The team combined knowledge and experience from computer, information, and social sciences to develop methods for collecting and analyzing ephemeral data.  The team shared findings and approaches to research challenges through workshops and papers, improving the quality of social media research. Practical tools, shared via GitHub, included procedures and software to select, collect, and store tweets.   The project underscored the social significance of rapid and widespread sharing of information on social media services.  Two members of the team wrote Going Viral (Nahon and Hemsley, 2013; Cambridge:  Polity Press), a well-researched and readable overview of the viral spread of information.  A separate project used this project?s emerging knowledge and resources to study Twitter exchanges during the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, finding that much of the information shared by tweets was incorrect yet difficult to correct Since 2013, there is increased recognition of the social consequences of misinformation and how quickly and widely it can be spread using social media.  This project observed that the frequency and volume of tweets and retweets over time and other tweet characteristics formed distinctive patterns that might be associated with different mechanisms for sharing information.  This helped others find ways to identify Internet robots ("bots"), agents for people or organizations that amplify the impact of misinformation and increase the apparent significance of false information, highlighting the growing significance of social media to public discourse.
