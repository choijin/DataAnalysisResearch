<AbstractNarration>CBET-1246854&lt;br/&gt;PI: Y. C. Lee (Univ. of Colorado)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and molecular layer deposition (MLD) are important thin film deposition processes based on sequential, self-limiting surface reactions.  ALD and MLD can deposit conformal and ultrathin inorganic and organic films with atomic/molecular layer control.  ALD was recognized as the transformative technology when ALD was added to the semiconductor roadmap over ten years ago.  ALD and MLD have the potential to make an even more significant impact if their throughput and cost can be improved using roll-to-roll (R2R) processes.  For example, ALD and MLD could be used to fabricate high quality gas diffusion barrier on polymers for organic light emitting diodes and thin film photovoltaics.  ALD could also be employed to coat the electrodes of Li ion batteries to improve their capacity stability and greatly extend their lifetime.  Laboratory results have already confirmed the excellent performance of ALD barriers and coatings.  Transitioning these laboratory results to the market requires a rapid and cost-effective method to perform ALD and MLD on polymer or foil webs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will build an R2R ALD/MLD testbed with process control for web speeds of up to 30 m/min.  To accomplish this challenging goal, computational fluid dynamics modeling will be performed to understand ALD/MLD and support the systematic design of novel gas source heads for ALD/MLD on both flat and porous substrates.  The gas source heads will be integrated with a R2R web handling machine and this new apparatus will be optimized using studies of in situ monitoring of thickness versus processing parameters.  Reduced order models will be studied and applied to achieve optimal performance.  In addition, new methodologies will be developed for web handling such as the placement of the gas source head in the region of web wrap on a roller.  The interdisciplinary team will also work with ALD NanoSolutions, a local startup company.  ALD NanoSolutions is currently developing an R2R ALD testbed to coat flat polymer web substrates.  The team will also collaborate with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Sandia Labs, Formosa Plastic and Kent Displays for potential scale-up manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R2R ALD/MLD nano-manufacturing will facilitate the commercialization of ALD/MLD for a large number of applications and help to restore U.S. manufacturing competitiveness.  This research will also educate and train undergraduate and graduate students to perform original research in scalable nano-manufacturing.  A new section on ALD/MLD-enabled systems will be introduced into a first-year mechanical engineering projects course.  These projects will develop designs that will be used in the K-12 outreach programs.  R2R manufacturing teaching modules will be also introduced into existing undergraduate and graduate courses.  The results of this research will also be widely disseminated at various scientific meetings and through a project web site.</AbstractNarration>

Thickness distribution could deviate from the target value if there was undesirable chemical vapor deposition (CVD). From the study, we realized it was very challenging to eliminate CVD in atmospheric environment.&nbsp; A new R2R ALD/MLD system has been developed with multiple output ports connected to soft vacuum enclosure. This novel approach was proven very effective for excellent R2R ALD/MLD.&nbsp; In particular, porous substrates represented by anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) with pore diameters of 100nm and lengths of 25,000 nm were successfully deposited with ALD ZnO using the new system. In addition, we demonstrated that R2R ALD Al2O3 on LiCoO2 (LCO) battery electrodes at a speed of 50 meters/min could improve the capacity stability. More importantly, a specific R2R machine was established for R2R ALD/MLD with custom-designed soft vacuum enclosure and controlled tension, speed and temperature. This fully integrated, automated R2R ALD/MLD system is the most effective solution for porous substrates in the world.</p> <p>To support the design, fabrication and characterization of the R2R ALD/MLD, we developed a new probabilistic model to replace commonly used random defect model. With this new model, we can accurately characterize fabrication yields with respect to different sample sizes. We have also demonstrated that ALD coatings could protect copper nanowires in boiling heat transfer; such protection removes reliability as a show-stopper in many nanostructure-enabled applications. As for integrated R2R ALD and MLD, we found out a a thick organic layer could encapsulate most of contaminants such as particles for a super-clean, planarized substrate. Indeed, R2R ALD coating&rsquo;s defects were reduced by 10X after using R2R MLD for the encapsulation and planarization.</p> <p>In addition, we have developed a novel analysis and design environment that allows key components to be optimized for efficient and spatially controlled transport and deposition of reactants. A unique simulation and topology optimization framework was created that describes the geometry of the components by the level set method and predicts the transport of reactants by a Navier-Stokes model, discretized by the extended finite element method. To simulate and optimize the transport of reactants into nano-structured materials, for example to coat particles in lithium ion batteries, we extended the optimization framework onto flows with finite Knudsen numbers. These flows can be modeled accurately by the Boltzmann transport equations with an immersed boundary formulation to account for finite Knusden effects. For the first time, we could solve flow and advective transport topology optimization problems accounting for finite Knudsen numbers.</p> <p>We have disseminated research results effectively: 17 journal articles, 14 conference presentations, 10 keynote speeches, short course, seminars, or tutorials. As for training, the research studies have been conducted by 3 post-docs, 11 graduate students with 3 Ph.D. degrees awarded and 8 undergraduate research assistants. In addition, we have reached out to directly educate more than 200 college students and 50 K-12 students.&nbsp; ALD NanoSolutions, our industry partner, is recognized as the world leader to commercialize ALD technologies for fast charging batteries.
