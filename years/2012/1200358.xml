<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to advance our understanding of mechanical failure mechanisms in arterial tissue, focusing on atherosclerotic plaque failure. Arterial tissue failure leads to several life-threatening clinical conditions, including atherosclerotic plaque rupture and aortic dissection. Arterial tissue has structural similarities to fiber-reinforced composite materials used for engineering and manufacturing applications. In this project, theoretical and analytical approaches developed to describe failure of reinforced composites will be extended to interpret the results of experimental studies of plaque failure in atherosclerotic mice, which develop plaques comparable to those seen in humans. The research will combine experimental studies of the structure and biochemistry of the interface between tissue layers in atherosclerotic mouse arteries with development of theoretical and computational models of delamination mechanisms at both macroscopic and microscopic length scales. The models will be used to simulate controlled peeling/delamination experiments on atherosclerotic mouse arteries using both cohesive zone and micromechanical approaches. The validated models will then be used to predict those conditions that result in arterial tissue failure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continuum and micromechanical modeling approaches developed in mouse studies can be readily modified to understand tissue failure processes in human diseases. The proposed effort has potential to positively impact patient management, while guiding the development of successful interventions. The models developed will also be applicable for analyzing failure of non-biological composite materials having similar structure and material properties. The insight gained into mechanisms of arterial tissue adhesion and failure is expected to prove useful to the biomedical device industry, for example in the development of improved biomimetic surgical adhesives. The educational and outreach aspects of the project include undergraduate training in biomechanics, outreach to high school teachers in STEM subjects through Project Lead the Way, and strengthening the new Biomedical Engineering Program at the University of South Carolina.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes  The overall goal of this project was to advance our detailed understanding of how arteries undergo mechanical failure, especially at the microscopic level. Mechanical failure of arteries lead to several life-threatening clinical conditions, including atherosclerotic plaque rupture, a major cause of heart attacks and strokes, and rupture of aortic aneurysms, which are balloon-like expansions of the major artery in the body. Mechanical failure results from an imbalance between forces acting on blood vessels, such as blood pressure, and the strength of the arterial tissue. Arteries can become weakened by disease or injury, leading to an increased likelihood of sudden failure.  To better understand how much force is required to cause atherosclerotic plaques to fail, we used mice which develop atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries due to fatty lesions or æplaquesÆ) when fed a high fat diet.  We performed mechanical tests to measure the force required to detach plaques from the artery wall.  We also obtained human coronary arteries from patients who had undergone heart transplants, and measured the force required to cause the arteries to tear in between layers of tissue (like peeling an onion).  Based on the human artery data, we developed computer simulations showing how atherosclerotic plaques can fail during balloon angioplasty, a medical procedure used to open up blocked arteries. By comparing the results of computer simulations to actual test data, we were also able to estimate the material properties of human coronary arteries and mouse arteries.  These material property data can be used to predict the behavior of arteries under different sets of conditions.  We demonstrated that a computational method called æcohesive zone modelingÆ, which is a simplified way to describe how much energy is required to cause material failure, was useful for predicting the failure of arteries.  The outcomes of this project include computer models for simulating the process of atherosclerotic plaque detachment from blood vessel walls.  In terms of training students, the project provided research projects for four graduate students, one MS and three PhDs.  One masterÆs student completed his degree and obtained employment at the US Patent and Trademark Office as a patent examiner.  Three doctoral students are expected to graduate in May 2016.  One doctoral student was awarded a Whitaker International Program Summer Internship for 8 weeks study in France to learn how to do computational mechanical simulations. Another minority doctoral student received a travel award to present her results at a national conference in Boston, and she also received a fellowship award from the Southern Regional Education Board. The grant also provided research projects for several undergraduate students. In addition, one high school student received training in experimental research by doing a senior capstone project in Dr. LessnerÆs lab.  Other  Dr. Lessner and her graduate student Shana Watson also made presentations on their career and research highlights to a group of middle school students at Dent Middle School, Columbia, SC as part of the Women in STEM Careers Q&amp;A Symposium, April 14, 2015.
