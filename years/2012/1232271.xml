<AbstractNarration>Under high solar photovoltaic (PV) penetration scenarios, energy storage devices at the community level will become crucial for reducing peak loads and improving grid reliability. Currently, pilot projects are aimed to demonstrate the value of utility-owned community energy storage systems that are centrally operated.  However, the centralized control architecture is prone to single point failure of the control hub, it does not scale well to large regions, and has only limited benefits to electricity customers other than improving the power quality of the utility, and providing limited blackout protection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  The research deals with synthesis of scalable and robust distributed energy storage systems to improve grid load and grid reliability, by exploiting solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Progress will be made on two fundamental issues: first, on the development of quantifiable PV forecast methodologies that can help the effective operations of distributed energy storage. Second, on the theoretical analysis that can guide the design of distributed storage sizing over different communities; investigating community decomposition, optimal joint sizing of community energy storage, and the optimal operation of the storage based on forecasts, anomalies, and distributed algorithms.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  The research will impact higher level of renewable energy penetration by making use of distributed storage devices in the distribution systems. The education and outreach efforts will include a number of activities such as (1) an annual half-day workshop on renewable energy to San Diego K-12 teachers, (2) weekly visits by UCSD undergraduate engineering students to Encinitas Unified School District 5th and 6th grade elementary schools to present lesson plans on renewable energy, and (3) a dorm building dashboard energy display indicating current energy use and current potential for demand response (4) mentoring of minority students through summer internships via the UCSD IDEA student center, and (5) minority outreach efforts via the societies of Women in Engineering at UCSD and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>By applying a new class of intelligent distributed controls in combination with novel PV forecasting techniques, the objective of the project was to investigate the feasibility of the integration of intermittent sources of energy into the power grid by means of storage control, which can help with reactive power control provision, blackout reduction, and power balancing operations (i.e. to reserve the power obtained during high PV generation peaks to dispatch it later). Our research has resulted into the following two types of studies and results. (i) Using novel quantifiable PV forecast methodologies with high spatial and temporal resolution, we assessed the impact of high PV penetration on five different types of common power grid distribution feeders. This study showed that the PV impact is highly dependent on the feeder grid topology and confirmed that, in general, distributed PV resources increase the feeder hosting capacity significantly (i.e. the ability to accommodate many more PV systems while not increasing voltage variations across the feeder.) (ii) We developed novel algorithms for the automatic charging and discharging of batteries for the smooth operation of micro-grids connected with multiple PV systems and miscellaneous loads. These algorithms have been theoretically analyzed and shown to work over tie-connected micro-grids. The algorithms are implementable in settings where storage systems are operated by means of local controllers, and which employ local grid information obtained from a communication network. Our research has been disseminated in technical publications and conferences, as well as in communications with companies investing on the smart grid.
