<AbstractNarration>Last year, antihydrogen was trapped for the first time by the ALPHA collaboration at CERN. By this point hundreds of antiatoms have been trapped for times as long as 1000 s. While this was a remarkable achievement, the ALPHA apparatus is not well configured for most measurements of the properties of antihydrogen, and must be rebuilt to allow laser and better microwave access. Furthermore, the trapping rates, while sufficient to begin studies of the properties of antimatter, are lower than optimal. There are two broad challenges to improving the trapping rate: (1) Understanding the behavior of the positron and antiproton plasmas from which the antihydrogen is synthesized; and (2) Understanding the atomic processes by which positrons and antiprotons recombine. Antihydrogen synthesis lies on the boundary between atomic and plasma physics, and cannot be studied properly without employing tools from both fields. The long term goal of antihydrogen research is to search for differences between the properties of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences might occur between the spectra of the two species. Differences in the spectra could only result from CPT violation. Another place differences might occur is in the gravitational interactions of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences could solve the baryogenesis problem. A third area of potential difference is in the fractional charge of antihydrogen. The net charge of antihydrogen is only known to about 10^-7 relative to the unit charge. Positive results from any of these measurements would completely change our understanding of fundamental particles and fields. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, and 3D PIC codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-¬term goals of this research address the very basis of our understanding of the world around us. Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-¬antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology. At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. The trapping of antihydrogen last year was extraordinarily widely noted in the lay and scientific press. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimentalists learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, UHV practice, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theorists can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The proposed research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Collaborative Research: Experimental and Theoretical Study of the Plasma Physics of Antihydrogen Generation and Trapping  Joel Fajans, Jonathan Wurtele U.C. Berkeley  Since experimenters at CERN first made antihydrogen atoms at CERN in 2002, the goal has been to use these atoms to search for novel fundamental physics; i.e., ways in which these antihydrogen atoms differ from normal matter hydrogen atoms. Ultimately, these experiments might help explain the puzzling shortage of antimatter in the universe: the Baryogenesis problem.   Progress in these studies, supported by a prior NSF grant, accelerated in 2010 when our ALPHA collaboration trapped antihydrogen atoms.  We subsequently published measurements of the microwave spin flip spectra of these antiatoms.  During this grant period we were able to prove that antihydrogen atoms do not accelerate under gravity anomalously quickly, i.e. at not more that 100g, where g is the acceleration of gravity.  While there are many indirect indications that antimatter does not gravitate anomalously, there have been no prior Galilean, Leaning Tower of Pisa type experiments.  Of course, our current bound is crude; with support granted to our Canadian and Danish collaborators, we are designing a new experiment to finally directly investigate the unlikely, but still discussed, idea that antimatter does falls upwards.  Ultimately, the new gravity experiment aims to measure g at the 1% level.  During this grant period we have also performed a novel measurement of the charge of antihydrogen to within one part per billion of the elementary electron charge. A non-zero measurement would have truly profound consequences. This measurement has also allowed us to improve the bound on the positron charge by a factor of 25.  These are the first precision measurements ever made on an antiatom.  Last year, we were able to illuminate antihydrogen with laser light and search for atomic transitions in antihydrogen.  These experiments were performed in an improved apparatus, ALPHA-II, purpose-built with NSF support, for laser measurements of antihydrogen spectra.  The laser power was not yet sufficient for us to observe transitions, but we have improved the power and will attempt to see these transitions in 2016.  All of these advances, including the gravity and charge measurements, rely on sophisticated techniques from plasma and nonlinear dynamics.  We continue to improve these plasma physics techniques with research with research at both CERN and Berkeley into the injection of antiproton plasmas into positron plasmas, lepton plasma temperature measurements, and cavity interactions.  Three graduate students received their Ph.D.Æs during this grant period, and roughly a dozen undergraduates have been involved. Approximately half the undergraduates have spent summers at CERN.  The students include members of our society underrepresented in STEM fields, including women, Latinos, and American Indian.   The research has been published in prestigious journals including Nature, Nature Communications, and Physical Review Letters.  It has attracted much public attenuation, as attested by many tens of thousands of page views of our articles in the Nature family journals, and by Altmetric scores in the 99th percentile.
