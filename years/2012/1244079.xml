<AbstractNarration>DUE - 1244707, 1244079 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLABORATING INSTITUTIONS: &lt;br/&gt;Old Dominion University (ODU)&lt;br/&gt;Norfolk State University (NSU)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION &lt;br/&gt;There is a significant demand for engineers with a solar energy background that possess the problem-solving skills to successfully tackle the challenges associated with implementing new solar technologies. This project is enhancing students' ability to explore the underlying principles associated with solar technology by developing and providing a mixture of virtual learning materials and hands-on activities, in an attempt to transform the ways that organic physics and optics related courses are currently being offered. The project is enriching electrical and computer engineering capstone project experiences by connecting topics to relevant, compelling challenges in solar energy, while simultaneously introducing students to underlying systems-thinking principles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is collecting data to assess the students' reasoning, investigative, and problem-solving skills by analyzing lab reports and poster presentations. The evaluation of student learning outcomes is studying the students' ability to apply their theoretical understanding in real situations. In particular, the project is examining how the use of virtual learning resources can improve a student's ability to perform analysis, conduct testing, interpret results, and solve problems in their hands-on activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER SIGNIFICANCE &lt;br/&gt;The project's focus on solar energy education is helping address the global priority on energy security and the critical shortage of highly qualified scientists and engineers to positively impact the nation and its related economy. The multi-university partnership brings expertise in multiple disciplines of electrical engineering, while also impacting both lower and upper undergraduate level courses. The institutions associated with the project are coordinating and implementing the effort across a diverse set of engineering student populations and locations, increasing the potential for broad exposure and positive impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is creating a scalable model for developing engineering course material that can be adapted for use by a wide range of universities, which are not limited by geography. The collaborative outreach programs of ODU and NSU will also broaden STEM communities by providing: a "NanoDays" nanotechnology educational festival; readily adaptable activities for students, teachers, and the general public; summer research programs that focus on underrepresented minority and female students; and demonstrations of solar technologies in a wide variety of elementary schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project goal is to address the urgent need to prepare undergraduate students in solar energy education by implementing virtual and physical hands-on activities.  In regards to intellectual merit, both theoretical and engineering aspects are reinforced by integrating "interactive virtual laboratories" and "physical hands-on activities" in order to efficiently guide students in preparing, confronting, and tackling open-ended, inquiry-based problems with solid theoretical knowledge and principles. Students were required to form a team and meet weekly to work as a group. After each group identified a term project, students revisited or learned new background theories and principles of organic solar cells and identified and tested a hypothesis of new design before they were actually engaged in physical hands-on activities of device fabrication. Once designed, each group accordingly fabricated and tested organic solar cells. Virtual laboratories were also used to identify the disparity between theoretical and experimental results and additional activities designed to interpret the differences. This practice truly allowed students to experience the entire scientific process from solid theoretical reasoning obtained from virtual laboratories, to designing their own devices and experiments, to initial observations, and to follow-on activities based on the results of earlier activities. In this way, this project enhanced students' critical thinking, reasoning, investigative, and problem solving skills.  The effectiveness of this pilot program was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively by an external reviewer. Our assessment indeed suggested that combined virtual and physical hands-on activities greatly helped students to explore inquiry-based organic solar cell projects with enhanced reasoning, problem solving, and communication skills. Overall, students not only enjoyed this course but also appreciated the importance of collaborative learning.  As part of the broader impacts, our team participated in local outreach programs showcasing photovoltaic technologies to students and parents ranging from kindergarten to elementary schools. Particularly, we presented and demonstrated the solar energy conversion technology focusing on how organic solar cells can improve efficiency and bring the solar energy to future energy sources.  As products, the PI developed i) virtual laboratories for organic solar cells being used by students to test, formulate, and verify knowledge and underlying principles, ii) inquiry-based learning modules that allow students to engage in combined virtual and physical hands-on activities, and iii) assessed the impact of modules on students? conceptual understanding and performance of organic solar cell projects by measuring their knowledge, reasoning skills, attitudes, and perceptions.  One conference paper was published and two presentations were made for the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference and the Symposium on the Envisioning the Future of Undergraduate STEM Education.
