<AbstractNarration>There has been an explosion in our ability to sense and record the world around us. This has led to new discoveries and allowed us to consider new paradigms in nearly every walk of life. While the promise of these developments is significant, the explosion of sensing has also created substantial challenges. These challenges include high-dimensionality of observations and the associated ``curse of dimensionality'', non-trivial relationships between the observations and the latent variables we care about, poor understanding of models, and lack of sufficient training data from which to learn these models. Motivated by such problems, this research studies an approach which we term ``sensing-aware inferencing'' that leverages knowledge about the underlying structure of the sensing process for data-driven inferencing. Such problems are at the frontier of statistical signal processing and advance this frontier by contributing to signal processing theory and practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves both analysis of the fundamental limits to the performance of, as well as the development of new methods for, decision making and inference from high-dimensional data when the data are related to latent variables through a underlying sensing structure. The methods being developed explicitly acknowledge and account for the underlying sensing process in a unified and optimal way. Research is being advanced along two major thrusts: 1) theoretical investigation of the fundamental limits of classification performance as dimension grows faster than available training data under various states of sensing knowledge, 2) development of methods for inference in high-dimensional problems exploiting sensing structure in a unified way. Throughout, the samples available for such learning are severely limited relative to the dimensionality of the observations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project are theoretical. The focus is on developing algorithms and analysis tools for decision making in the context of high-dimensional data when the data are related to   latent variables through an underlying sensing structure. Our goals are to derive fundamental  limits to the performance of, as well as develop new methods for decision making.  This project was successful in achieving the following key outcomes.     Development of theoretically justified approaches for estimation and recovery of latent variables in latent models. Creation of new methods with polynomial sample and computational complexity. Development of application for social data analytics in journalism and mass communication A number of Peer-reviewed publications that appeared in IEEE Trans on Information Theory, IEEE Journal of Special Topics in Signal Processing as well as machine learning conferences such as NIPS, ICML and AISTATS.              Specifically, this project led to the following key milestones:  Information theoretic bounds for structured signal processing:  We developed  fundamental information theoretic bounds for latent variable estimation in structured signal  processing problems unifying linear and non-linear observations scenarios for recovering latent and structured signals.  Topic Modeling with Separable Structures:  In this work we considered a family of  generative models and associated algorithms for discovering the (latent)  topical structure shared by a large corpus of documents. These problems  arise in a number of scenarios and are important for organizing,  searching, and making sense ofa large text corpus. We have developed a  novel geometric approach, with provable statistical and computational  efficiency guarantees, for learning the latent topics in a document  collection. We have explored these methods for social data analytics in journalism and mass communication.       Last Modified: 01/12/2017       Submitted by: Venkatesh Saligrama]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
