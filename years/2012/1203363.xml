<AbstractNarration>The Angelo State Natural History Collections (ASNHC) house 120,000 voucher specimens of plants, mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians of the Concho Valley, other regions of Texas, the U.S. and the world.  The primary goal of this project is to improve researcher and educator access to the specimens and tissues housed in the Collections. The data associated with these specimens and digital images of plant specimens will be made available to researchers around the world.  Faculty curators and students will complete data entry, including geo-referencing specimens, update software, and make all data available through existing biodiversity portals. Specific web-based learning modules for K-12 and university level students will be created.  Holding facilities will be modernized and integrated pest management systems will be updated to protect specimens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project are diverse.  The wider science community will have improved access to ASNHC databases, increasing use of the Collections.  K-12 science education throughout the region will benefit from new outreach resources (e.g. digital images) for teachers and students.  Angelo State University students, including their own Hispanic Serving Institution target group, will benefit from improved specimen-based instructional resources for classroom and laboratory instruction.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Angelo State Natural History Collections (ASNHC) contain almost 93,000 cataloged botanical and vertebrate specimens from the United States and several countries, but the emphasis of each collection is on the flora and fauna of the Concho Valley region of West-Central Texas. This project has increased opportunities for the ASNHC to interact with the scientific community, especially diversity-based botanists and zoologists. The in-house collection database program was updated from Specify 5 to Specify 6 giving us access to many additional features and the size of the database has grown to incorporate newly-acquired collections and a backlog of specimens that had accumulated in each of the collections. The current numbers of specimens that are cataloged in each database are: 57,406 plants, 16,226 mammals, 2,053 birds, and 14,646 reptiles and amphibians.&nbsp; New specimens continue to be cataloged and added to the database. Before the support of NSF, none of the specimen data were available online. There is now improved access to a large number of the ASNHC specimens (mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, and plants) and the associated data.
