<AbstractNarration>The rapidly advancing field of wireless technologies and  mobile health (mHealth) is likely to play an important role in the future innovations that will help in transforming healthcare to be more individual-centered with a focus on prevention and wellbeing. Yet this nascent field requires advances and innovations ranging from theoretical concepts to large scale implementation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project will provide funds to enable students to attend the conference. The participating students will benefit from exposure to computational thinking and advances in in wireless health technologies that utilize real-time data acquisition and inference to support just-in-time interventions. At the same time, they will also learn of the gaps in basic science as well as engineering that need to be addressed in order to achieve the anticipated benefits of the wireless technologies and mHealth. In addition, meeting the leaders in the fields will provide the students with models for selecting and addressing the key difficult problems that need to be solved. Finally, during the workshop, the participants will be meeting their fellow students, giving them an opportunity for scientific networking, so important in a rapidly advancing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Wireless and mobile technologies are likely to have significant societal impacts in a variety of domains.  There are indications that these fields will likely contribute significantly to revolutionizing healthcare, from clinical trials to healthcare delivery. These technologies are already changing the social interactions among individuals and groups. Among the most important potential benefits of these technologies are their impacts on bringing healthcare and education to underserved populations.  This is reflected in the data suggesting that mobile technology frequently provides the only way for underserved populations to connect to the Internet and interact with the healthcare system. Students working in the field will have the opportunity to accelerate these trends. To achieve these goals the proposer is planning to emphasize the recruitment of women and minority students to attend the symposium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Wireless Health Conference Series was held in Baltimore, MD from November 1-3, 2013.  Additional information about the conference is available at: www.wirelesshealth2013.org.  Foundational to the conference is the understanding that facilitating interdisciplinary communication, collaboration and cooperation among participants from academia, clinical practice, government and industry is crucial to address real-world issues of the health care industry.  Wireless Health 2013 offered an outstanding set of peer-reviewed papers and abstracts, interactive workshops, demonstrations, and world-renowned invited speakers. The conference explored new formats for knowledge sharing across disciplines, and included an outstanding set of peer-reviewed papers, interactive workshops, industrial and academic application demonstrations, and world renowned invited speakers.  The intellectual merit of the proposed activity for graduate students includes: 1) Gaining a unique international experience where they associate with scientists from different countries in a beautiful setting, something that helps with people skills and gaining a global perspective of science. 2) Exposure to new application areas of computer science and engineering where their skills are particularly needed. 3) Benefit from learning about new types of computational thinking when applying technologies to wireless health applications. 4) Exposure to some of the latest types of devices, robots, sensors or networks, and see how new mobile technologies. 5) Students of computer science become more familiar with the benefits and the challenges of doing experimental work that will allow them to generate data they can analyze. 6) Students gain more experience in giving presentations, explaining their work, and discussing with persons in other disciplines. 7) The opportunity to discuss how to succeed in an interdisciplinary field, as the ones described in Wireless Health that will enhance career opportunities for graduate students. 8) It is particularly beneficial for graduate students to meet with health domain experts who can use the computational methods and tools produced, such as occupational and physical therapists and neurologists.  The broader impact includes: 1) Establishing research and education collaborations with students and/or faculty who are members of underrepresented groups. 2) Mentoring early-career scientists and engineers from underrepresented groups who will be submitting NSF proposals. 3) Identifying and establishing collaborations between disciplines and institutions, among the U.S. academic institutions, industry and government and with international partners.
