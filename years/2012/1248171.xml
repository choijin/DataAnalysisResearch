<AbstractNarration>Representation theorists seek to quantify, analyze, and predict how a group of motions---like rotations or reflections---act on physical and geometric objects.  The fundamental problem in geometric representation theory is to construct representations using geometric tools. The fundamental problem in combinatorial representation theory is to understand a representation explicitly in terms of essential combinatorial parameters: for instance to decompose a given representation into the fundamental building blocks of irreducible representations. Both kinds of representation theorists seek to understand representations, but a problem that may seem answered to geometric representation theorists, such as `find a natural representation', is only partially answered to combinatorial representation theorists, who seek to `analyze explicitly a given representation'. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses several problems in geometric and combinatorial representation theory, using tools from combinatorics, algebraic geometry, and topology.  The broader impact includes work in many other areas of mathematics, including knot theory and commutative algebra, as well as fields like mathematical physics.  Educationally, the PI will establish programs for graduate student retention and excellence, in both research and teaching.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The fundamental question studied by this research is: how can systems move or grow if they must preserve certain symmetries?  This question of constrained motion or growth is at the heart of problems across fields, from determining how to tile a floor with certain shapes and colors of tiles to how crystals form; from how to folding origami to how to fold and move robotic arms; from how merry-go-rounds rotate on their axes to how planets orbit the sun.  The mathematical framework for all of these problems is called a group action, and the particular kind of group action this project analyzed is called a representation.       Specifically, the goal was to analyze representations arising from a family of infinite-dimensional geometric objects called affine Grassmannians.  This project required several steps: condensing the information of the infinite-dimensional affine Grassmannian into a concise, manageable set of data; developing tools to analyze that data; testing these tools, often using closely-related finite-dimensional geometric objects.     The key results include the following:     *) We developed a tool called generalized splines that extend both a well-known tool in engineering and applied mathematics and a geometric tool that encapsulates key parameters of a geometric object into a system of data called an (equivariant) cohomology ring.  With various coauthors, the PI proved foundational results about splines and completely analyzed splines over both the integers and the integers mod m.  This cross-disciplinary approach also gave us new results about a 40-year-old conjecture of Strang's (the subject of ongoing research).     *) We analyzed the geometry of infinite-dimensional subspaces of affine Grassmannians as well as related finite-dimensional objects called Hessenberg varieties, and proved connections between the two kinds of spaces.  Hessenberg varieties arise naturally in knot theory, geometric representation theory, mathematical biology, numerical analysis, among an increasing number of other fields.     *) We discovered relationships between these geometrical representations and questions in mathematical biology, especially RNA folding.  It turns out that one classic model for how RNA folds is closely related to a representation on certain Hessenberg varieties called Springer fibers.  The PI and her coauthors proved an interrelated set of results about these RNA-inspired questions, some specifically studying how the representation relates to the RNA folding and others describing how to make the classic mathematical model more realistic.     *) We characterized the structure of representations for large families of geometric varieties related to Springer fibers.  With Mbirika, the PI characterized how Springer representations grow, proving that the representation stabilizes (essentially "stays the same") no matter how the Springer fibers increase.  With MacPherson, the PI proved that regular semisimple Hessenberg representations mimic the structure of Springer representations in significant ways.      Intellectual merit: The PI's is an expert in the geometry and representation theory of Hessenberg varieties, which are very active subjects of research and have been the subject of recent conferences both in and out of the US.  The specific work in this project addresses a broadly-important set of questions at the intersection of many fields, bringing theoretical tools to bear to applied questions (both outside of mathematics and to different parts of mathematics).       Broader impact: This work helps level the playing field for mathematicians whose parents don't have doctoral degrees, and is conducted at an institution that has produced a significant number of the nation's female mathematics Ph.D.s in recent years.  The PI 1) leads a seminar on how to thrive in graduate school and the profession and writes essays on topics from the seminar, 2) runs a research lab staffed by undergraduate and post-baccalaureate ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
