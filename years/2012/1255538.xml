<AbstractNarration>NSF Summary Statement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans, particularly children, are often likened to sponges, soaking up patterns and regularities in their environment as they learn new concepts and skills.  However, unlike a passive sponge, human learners are able to alter their experience in important ways by interacting with the world.  For example, when studying for a test, learners can decide how to allocate study effort across materials.  Any complete account of human learning must explain not only what is learned from the information we experience, but also the capacity for our actions and choices to expose that information.  Many laboratory studies of learning used in cognitive psychology are silent on this issue because they limit participants' control over the flow information (emphasizing instead a type of "passive" learning where the learner does not have control over which information is experienced).  This tends to create a blind spot in our theories for how people gather information, when they decide to stop, and for how these ongoing decisions impact learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in this proposal seeks to address this gap by extending theories of human learning to account for self-directed learning behaviors (i.e., situations where learners can control of the flow information they experience by way of their ongoing decisions).   The proposed research addresses two specific questions relevant to the cognitive science of learning.   First, how do people decide what information will be useful to know when learning? Second, what impact does self-directed learning have on the acquisition of novel concepts?  In answer these questions, a computational theory of human learning is tested which attempts to explain how people make decisions to gather more information.  A novel aspect of the theory is that it can account for the differences in learning resulting from either self-directed or passive learning.  Understanding self-directed learning is a core issue in cognitive psychology which has potential implications for education policy.  In addition, the principles identified in this research may translate into assistive learning technologies which may shorten the time required to develop expertise in a domain by tailoring training to the capabilities of individual learners. Alongside this research objective, an overarching goal of this proposal is to integrate research and training activities in computational cognitive science. An innovative training plan will prepare the next generation of psychological scientists for a field that is increasingly organized around computational approaches to the study of the mind.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Despite remarkable recent progress, current machine learning and A.I. systems are limited and inefficient compared to the intelligence of even a young child. Notably, most machine learning systems are passive and "taught" by their designers. In contrast, children are remarkable in their ability to bootstrap knowledge from their independent, self-guided interactions with the world. They ask questions, curiously explore new toys, and push at the boundaries of what they currently know on their own, often without a teacher or parent.   During the funding period, we have focused on understanding the nature of this human ability. How are we able to figure out how something works by tinkering with it? How do we formulate and ask creative questions that reveal useful information about abstract concepts? How do we judge what actions we can take to obtain useful information? How do our choices to gather information affect our learning and memory? How to these abilities develop across the lifespan? Answering such questions strike at the heart of what makes us such an adaptable and intelligent species. Developing computer models that accurately describe this ability has critical applications in A.I. and machine learning, helping to narrow the large gap between man and machine. Finally, this type of research has broad implications for improving education and teaching by helping us better understand how people learn, and how we can help them learn.   In addition to basic research objectives, the project aimed to introduce computational cognitive science methods into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum, provide training opportunities for young scientists, and foster new interdisciplinary collaborations.    The project achieved all of these goals.  During the grant period we published 25 peer-reviewed journal articles and 21 peer reviewed journal articles on these topics.  The topics explored in these paper ranges from machine learning and artificial intelligence papers, studies of basic human intelligence and learning, studies of the developmental trajectory of self-directed learning, and work on the educational implications of self-directed learning.  The grant period ended with the publishing a large and comprehensive review article summarizing what we learned during the grant period about these behaviors but also the open future directions that remain to be tackled.  Four students completed their PhD dissertation and two post-docs were supported in their independent research.  We established a public blog for our research group sharing code and other ideas about cognitive science with a broader community (including accessible summaries of our papers).  In addition, we presented our work at numerous conferences, invited colloquia, and other public lectures including speaking at K-12 schools to spark enthusiasm in STEM careers.  Many undergraduate and graduate students were engaged with the research with many going on to STEM careers themselves.  New course materials were created for both and undergraduate and graduate course in computational cognitive science and these teaching materials have been shared with other instructors online.  In addition, the project funded the initial development of a new open-source software package called psiTurk which enables behavioral scientists to study human cognition through online crowd working websites.
