<AbstractNarration>The Advanced Technology Environmental Education Center (ATEEC) provides resources, support and professional development for educators; curriculum and educational materials for grades 10-14; and environmental and sustainable energy best program practices, articulated 2+2+2 programs, and other ATE center environmental and sustainable energy curricula. The goal of the ATEEC Resource Center is to partner with business, industry, governmental agencies, professional organizations and academic institutions to provide a resource center of exemplary educational materials, curricula and pedagogical practices for the purpose of educating technicians in environmental and sustainable energy technology. The Center has the following objectives: 1) provide support and mentoring for institutions that wish to start or improve educational programs in environmental science and sustainable energy technologies; 2) provide services to ATE projects; 3) establish and support additional industry, business and academic partnerships; 4) promote technician careers and visibility in environmental and sustainable energy technology; 5) address technician knowledge, skills and competencies needed for the evolving, converging and emerging technical workplace; and 6) screen, validate, update and broadly distribute exemplary materials, curricula and pedagogical practices adapted or designed by ATE centers and projects and other sources. The strategies, events, conferences, forums, Institutes, web seminars and other activities lead to an integrated approach to enhance the content of and pedagogical approaches to STEM programs and curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ATEEC Resource Center is important for the nation's economy as green jobs need workers proficient in math, science and technology for the rapidly changing areas of environmental and energy technology. ATEEC works with business and industry, educators and government agencies to disseminate exemplary educational materials, curricula and resources in the areas of environmental and energy technology to high school and community college educators and students as well as technicians across the country. ATEEC?s structure lends itself to efficient and rapid dissemination and is built upon a model of institutional collaboration and networking.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Advanced Technology Environmental and Education Center (ATEEC) was established in 1994 as a Center of Excellence within the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program of the National Science Foundation.  ATEEC defines and disseminates the cutting-edge technical knowledge necessary for educators to provide their students with successful careers in environmental, energy and water-related fields. We work with experts in education, research and industry to develop comprehensive, professionally validated materials and programs.  ATEEC?s mission is the advancement of environmental and water technology education through curriculum, professional, and program development.  Our vision is foster a network of educational communities supported through public and private partnerships, which ensures human health, safety, and global sustainability.  In addition to the National Science Foundation (nsf.org), our core partners include Eastern Iowa Community Colleges (eicc.edu) and the National Partnership for Environmental Technology Education (nationalpete.org).  ATTEC has developed many useful resources over the years and they are available at our online portfolio of seven websites. Links to all websites can be found at ateec.org. In 2018, these websites were improved to allow for a better experience on mobile devices.  Overall user experience was also improved in part by reducing out-of-date resources to keep our information relevant. In the past year, at least one of each of our resources was downloaded from the main site with over 6,200 total downloads.   The reach and impact of our websites are extensive with total unique browser sessions approaching 600,000.  For example, EERL.org &ndash; the Environmental and Energy Resources Library of vetted STEM resources for educators and students &ndash; had 81% of 3,978 unique views result in downloads.  Reports that define technologies and services in the environmental, water and energy sectors are also popular downloads.   In 2014, ATEEC became the first ATE Center to develop online, interactive career charts for water and environmental technologies and allow browsing of specific jobs including job functions, projected job growth, pay scales and educational requirements.  To help those users interested in getting education to obtain a job in these fields, we also maintain an interactive database of all colleges with technology programs &ndash; one or two year degrees and certificates for specific skills &ndash; for environmental, energy and water programs.  We update the college databases annually and there are currently 293 colleges listed with environmental technology programs, with 71 and 254 colleges listed that are unique to water and energy programs, respectively.  Other popular resources available for download include, seven Technology and Environmental Decision-Making modules developed in 2003 in partnership with MIT to help educators incorporate the latest research into their curricula.  ATEEC recently updated four of the most relevant of these modules.   The Best Practices Guide for Developing Educational Programs was also recently updated.  It is a guidebook for implementing and improving community and technical college programs.   As a long-term National Resource Center, ATEEC supports and mentors other colleges who are new to the NSF ATE program.  We serve on advisory boards, review grant proposals and answer questions. Our trained staff have helped with needs analysis, occupational and workforce analysis, evaluation of programs and projects, instructional systems design, and curriculum and development.
