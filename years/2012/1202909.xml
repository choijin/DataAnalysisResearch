<AbstractNarration>This award supports the continued development, assessment, and dissemination of Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILT) and peer-instruction tools for advanced undergraduate courses. QuILTs and peer instruction tools are based upon a field-tested cognitive-apprenticeship model of learning and emphasize modeling, coaching, and scaffolding. The following features make them particularly suited for the challenging task of teaching quantum physics: (1) They are based upon research in physics education and pay particular attention to cognitive issues. (2) They consistently keep students actively engaged in the learning process by asking them to predict what should happen in a particular situation and then providing appropriate feedback. (3) They employ visualization tools to help students build physical intuition about quantum processes. (4) They attempt to bridge the gap between the abstract quantitative formalism of quantum mechanics and the qualitative understanding necessary to explain and predict diverse physical phenomena. (5) They are based on systematic investigations of difficulties students have in learning various concepts in quantum physics. (6) Many of the tools can be used in class by the instructors as supplements to lectures or outside of the class as homework or as self-study tool by students. (7) They consist of self-sufficient modular units that can be used in any order that is convenient. To aid instructors, the concept-based and problem-based QuILTs and peer-instruction tools will be keyed with most of the common textbooks.</AbstractNarration>
