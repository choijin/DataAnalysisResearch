<AbstractNarration>The goal of this CNIC proposal is to catalyze an international collaboration between the University of Southern California (USA) and KIST (Korea). The focus of the research effort is to develop an integrated optical switch and a pulsed laser based on a graphene coated silica micro-toroid resonant cavity. As a result of the extremely high non-linear coefficient of graphene and the long photon lifetime within the optical cavity, femtosecond laser pulses will be generated. This behavior can be used as an ultra-fast optical switch, among other applications. During the course of the program, graphene layers will be conformally deposited on silica toroidal microcavities as well as optical fibers. Subsequently, light will be coupled into the graphene-silica fiber and cavity, and the high frequency pulse behavior will be studied and characterized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultrafast optical switches have numerous applications, most notably increasing the data transfer rate of optical networks. As such, the development of an optical switch with improved performance (speed, lifetime or power consumption) will greatly impact society. The proposal will enable a graduate student to spend time abroad in the collaborator's research group in Korea, immersed in their lab. The outreach effort supported by this CNIC proposal includes recruiting undergraduate students to participate in year-long research projects, and incorporating research experience in an undergraduate course. This CNIC award is funded by the International Science and Engineering section (OIIA/ISE) with co-funding from the Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems division of Engineering (ENG/ECCS).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this program is to initiate or catalyze international collaborations by sponsoring travel from the United States to other countries to begin collaborative efforts in new research areas.  The present program directly aligns with this programÃ†s objectives.  It supported the travel of the PI and one graduate student from Los Angeles (University of Southern California) to Seoul, Korea (Korean Institute of Science and Technology) to begin a collaborative effort in the area of graphene optoelectronics.  While this emerging field has shown significant promise over the past several years, there are still several key technical hurdles that must be addressed.  The collaborative effort brought together two leading researchers in optical engineering (US team) and in materials science (Korean team) to address one of the key challenges: interfacing uniform layers of graphene with optical devices.  During  the course of this research, a novel method for depositing monolayer graphene was developed.  This method is able to conformally coat three dimensional structures.   During their visit to KIST, the US team took part in the design of the deposition process to optimize the parameters to have minimal impact on the underlying device.  Several material characterization tests were performed on the graphene, verifying its purity.  Subsequently, devices were sent to the US for characterization.  However, we ran out of time to characterize the devices before the end of this award.  As direct evidence of how the NSF award has truly initiated a large collaborative effort, the Korean team is arriving in the US in June 2015 (funded through KIST) to continue this line of research.  Because this deposition method overcomes one of the key challenges in interface incompatibility, this work lays the foundation for the development of complex graphene-enhanced optoelectronic circuits.  As an international collaboration grant, this work was accomplished by an international team of researchers including a US PhD student and our collaborators at KIST in Seoul, Korea.  As a result of the findings discovered during this award, researchers from KIST are traveling to the US to continue to pursue this research as a collaboration with the PI.
