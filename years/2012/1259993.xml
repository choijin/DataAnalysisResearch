<AbstractNarration>This project is supporting over 50 academically talented students with demonstrated financial need in attaining baccalaureate degrees in Engineering at Northern New Mexico College (NNMC). Cohort-building and academic-support activities for scholars include faculty mentoring, peer tutoring, participation in engineering-focused first-year experiences and community service, career- and graduate-school awareness events, and opportunities to participate in undergraduate research related to the Solar Energy Research Park and Academy, Northern New Mexico Cisco Networking Academy, and partnerships with the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its comprehensive approach to recruitment and support of scholars in a young, vibrant engineering department that has built strong connections to industry and other educational institutions in the region. Broader impacts include promotion of student success in this impoverished, rural region. 80% of NNMC students are first-generation-in-college, 83% are Hispanic, and 9% Native American. This program is thus expanding and diversifying the engineering workforce in the region, as well as providing a model approach for consideration by similar institutions.</AbstractNarration>

By the end of the project, PEARL provided scholarships to 60 different students.  The demographics distribution for the scholarship recipients was approximately 72% Hispanics, 3.3% Native American, 5% African American and 10% White (non-Hispanic).  Of those students, approximately 32% were female and 68% male.  In this sense, this project has been a contributor to the national efforts to increase participation of minorities and women in STEM.  During the five years of the grant, the PEARL project provided students also with educational activities, seminars, undergraduate research opportunities, mentorship, peer-tutoring opportunities, field trips to research universities, and community building events.   There were some significant results of this project.  First, the project provided 183 different semester scholarships (65 tuition/fees scholarships for up to $2500 each, 77 living stipend/cash scholarships of $2500 each, and 41 combined scholarships for up to $2500 towards tuition in addition to $2500 in living stipends/cash) to 60 different students (13% higher than the proposed target). Secondly, scholarships have been a very successful retention strategy.  For participants of this project, the cummulative dropout rate was 8.3% considering the five years of the project.  This is way lower than the 23% semester-to-semester college dropout rate that the institution currently has.  From all the PEARL?s recipients who have finished their bachelor degree, 90% have started working in the STEM field even before graduation, 23% have started a graduated program, 53% participated in an internship, and 50% got involved in undergraduate research.  Some unanticipated positive outcomes that were enabled by the recruitment efforts done for this project include the partnership and articulation agreements of the College of Engineering at NNMC with local community colleges including Santa Fe Community College and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute.  Lessons learned and the results of the PEARL project were disseminated through one conference paper and a poster that was presented at the American Society of Engineering Education Annual Conference 2018 in Salt Lake City.   A website for the project was also developed and maintain during these years to keep the community informed of the progress made.  Some important lessons learned include the following:  a) In average, receiving a scholarship did not contribute to improving the GPA of the scholarship recipients. In average, the GPA remained equal before and after the scholarship was granted.  b) Receiving a scholarship did contribute for students to enroll more credits per semester after receiving the scholarship: in average students enrolled 1.4 credits more, which represents 11% more enrolled credits.    c) Scholarships were overestimated as an incentive to increase significantly student participation in undergraduate experiences. These type of experiences were not mandatory and, although the target was to involve 55% of the recipients, it was only 50% of the recipients who participated.
