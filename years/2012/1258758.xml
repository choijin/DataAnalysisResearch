<AbstractNarration>There is growing consensus that neighborhoods help to shape the well-being of their residents, affecting educational opportunities, economic outcomes, family formation decisions, and a range of other behaviors. This observation has motivated a good deal of research on the factors that affect where people live and how members of different racial groups and economic classes come to occupy neighborhoods with very different poverty rates and racial compositions. To date, most of the research on movement into and out of neighborhoods with various levels of poverty and different racial composition has focused on the effects of a narrow set of individual characteristics, largely ignoring the strong possibility that individuals' residential decisions may be influenced by their own residential history and the location of their family members. This project is designed to remedy this neglect, using longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) in conjunction with neighborhood-level data from four decennial U.S. censuses to examine how the location and characteristics of the neighborhoods inhabited by nuclear and extended family members (e.g., parents, children, siblings, other relatives) and the characteristics of the neighborhoods inhabited by individuals earlier in their lives influence the likelihood of moving between poor and nonpoor neighborhoods and between neighborhoods of varying racial composition. The project seeks to answer five main questions: &lt;br/&gt;1) Does the presence of kin in neighborhoods of a given socioeconomic and racial composition influence the likelihood that individuals will move out of and into these types of neighborhoods? &lt;br/&gt;2) To what extent does the association between the characteristics of the neighborhoods inhabited by kin and individuals' propensity to move from or to those types of neighborhoods vary by gender, race, socioeconomic status, and life-course position? &lt;br/&gt;3) Can racial and social class differences in the propensity to move between poor and nonpoor neighborhoods and between neighborhoods of varying racial composition be attributed to race and class differences in the types of neighborhoods inhabited by kin? &lt;br/&gt;4) How does an individual's own residential history ( the types of neighborhoods they have lived in throughout their lives ) influences their propensity to move between neighborhoods of varying socioeconomic and racial composition? &lt;br/&gt;5) Do racial and socioeconomic differences in individuals' neighborhood residential histories help to explain racial and class differences in the propensity to move out of or into a neighborhood of a particular socioeconomic or racial composition? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings of this project promise to enhance our understanding of the processes through which families and individuals attain residence in neighborhoods of varying socioeconomic and ethnoracial composition and, in particular, why low-income and minority families often fail to move to, or remain in, relatively advantaged neighborhoods even when their socioeconomic resources would allow them to do so. The project's findings are likely to have special relevance for housing mobility programs that attempt to facilitate the migration of poor and/or minority families from disadvantaged inner-city neighborhoods into more advantaged, often suburban communities. These programs have met with mixed success, perhaps because low-income and/or minority families and individuals tend to remain in, or relocate to, largely poor and predominantly minority neighborhoods in order to provide or to receive social and economic support from nuclear and extended family members. The inter-neighborhood migration patterns of poor and minority families may also be constrained by a housing search process that is often limited to the types of neighborhoods they have inhabited in the past. Thus, the project holds promise for advancing our understanding of the types of families and individuals most likely to be trapped in poor neighborhoods; and hence vulnerable to the pernicious consequences of "neighborhood effects."</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examined how and why the types of neighborhoods that individuals live in change over time, with a particular focus on racial differences in neighborhood environments.  Using over 30 years of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, along with neighborhood- level data extracted from the U.S. censuses and the American Community Survey, the project traced how the economic and demographic characteristics of individualsÆ neighborhoods change as people age, explored the proximate sources of these changes, and examined how the geographic location of family members influences patterns of migration between different types of neighborhoods--in particular, the ability of people to move out of poor neighborhoods into more advantaged areas.  The project reached several important and novel conclusions.   First, among people who first established an independent household during the 1970s, whites experienced substantially greater improvements than blacks in neighborhood average income over their life course, while the racial difference in the percentage of neighbors who are non-Hispanic white narrowed slightly with age.   Second, growing up in an economically advantaged neighborhood generates greater subsequent benefits in neighborhood economic status for whites than for blacks.   Third, as they age blacks experience lesser improvement than whites in the economic status of their neighborhoods not because of racial differences in migration but rather because the neighborhoods that blacks tend to live in improve less, or deteriorate more, than the neighborhoods that whites tend to live in.   Fourth, among blacks and whites initially residing in a predominantly minority or racially-mixed neighborhood, whites experience a much greater increase than blacks over time in the percentage of their neighbors who are non-Hispanic white, a difference driven mainly by whitesÆ tendency to move to predominantly white neighborhoods.   Fifth, the location of non-resident family members influences both the decision to move from oneÆs current neighborhood and the selection of new neighborhood.  Parents and young adult children who live near each other, and low-income adult children who live near their parents, are especially unlikely to move out of their neighborhood.  Movers are particularly drawn to neighborhoods containing aging parents.  And white and higher-income households tend to move closer to parents and children, whereas low-income households are more likely to move towards extended family.  Sixth, in both poor and non-poor origin neighborhoods, blacks and Latinos live closer than whites to nuclear family members, and they are also more likely than whites to have family members living in poor neighborhoods. Close geographic proximity to kin and high levels of kin neighborhood poverty significantly inhibit moving from poor to a non-poor neighborhood, and increase the risk of experiencing "downward" moves from non-poor into poor tracts.  Most importantly, the fact that blacks are much more likely than whites to have family members living in poor neighborhoods helps to explain why blacks are less likely than whites to move out of poor neighborhoods and why blacks are more likely than whites to move into poor neighborhoods.  These findings have the potential to help policy-makers and urban planners construct housing policies that enable individuals to live in the best possible neighborhood and that help to reduce sharp racial and socioeconomic inequalities in neighborhood environments.
