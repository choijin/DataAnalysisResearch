<AbstractNarration>This action funds Graham Kent of University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign to conduct a research project, entitled "Linking Chinese agricultural practices to increased production and environmental integrity," during the summer of 2012 at China Agricultural University in Beijing, China.  The host scientist is Dr. Daoliang Li.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the use of both underutilized and new remote sensing and geographic information system technologies to identify optimal agricultural production strategies.  Conservation and production strategies to improve water quality are a key component in improving these strategies. Steadily increasing demand for agricultural products to satisfy the diverse needs of a growing population for food, fiber and now fuel has long been the main driver behind agricultural water use. Poor water quality contributes to diminished productivity, increased treatment costs, damaged global ecosystems, and increased health risks to humans.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Commercial aquaculture operations must balance production of marine/fresh-water organisms with environmental and economic factors.  Much research has been conducted to characterize how water quality, in particular, dissolved oxygen (DO) content changes over time in aquaculture production.  Depletion of DO may cause organisms to die-off, and they do not feed or grow well in ponds which have chronically low concentrations of DO.  Research has shown a strong correlation between the dissolved oxygen utililization rate to Secchi disc measurements of chemical oxygen demand and water temperature.  Drawing on previous research efforts to forecast dissolved oxygen content, this study synthesized data from four Chinese river crab aquaculture ponds in Jiangsu Province, China to assess alternative potential predictive techniques for dissolved oxygen content using environmental measures.  The aquaculture ponds were monitored by a water quality data collection system based on a wireless network system in real time.  With a way to predict the minimum dissolved oxygen content, farmers can take preventive measures like turning on aerators or releasing DO rich water (both require labor and energy).  This study found that the dominant DO utilization rate overnight is linear in the selected ponds: more than half of all rates are nearly perfectly linear.  And that a basic extrapolation using the first few hours of DO measurements after dusk was not appropriate for predicting minimum levels.  While there exists a stronger correlation using Secchi disc measurements, this project lacked Secchi disc measurements but there was additional environmental data available: measures of solar radiation, air pressure, air temperature, water temperature, precipitation, humidity, DO content every 10 minutes.  Regressing over selected environmental data at dusk resulted in a function to predict minimum DO content at dawn.  This study found that using a 3-day radiation and water temperature moving average  at dusk produces a serviceable DO utilization rate prediction (multiple R^2 = .54).  Tabulating and formatting the data for analysis required the development of automated data collection/formatting scripts.  These tools facilitated proposing new functions and their assessing their accuracy.   Including more data points for an entire growing season and additional parameters like chlorophyll levels, feeding rates, crab-size would be appropriate and improve its accuracy/usefulness.
