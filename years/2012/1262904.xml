<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;This Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) project supported by the NSF Division of Materials Research will recruit undergraduate students primarily from several cooperating Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for a summer research experience focused on materials and nanotechnology at the University of New Orleans. By recruiting at HBCUs, the program will maximize involvement of students that are 1) from underrepresented groups and 2) attending a primarily undergraduate institution with limited research exposure.  Along with conducting research, students will participate in a variety of enrichment activities including: 1) interactive weekly training meetings to provide participants with basic research information, 2) meet the Faculty programs that provide student-faculty interaction in an informal setting, 3) ethics training, 4) end of summer poster presentations by participants (including prior training on preparation and presentation skills), and 5) travel awards to allow students to present their research results at a national scientific meeting. Participating teachers will work in research labs alongside undergraduate students and will participate in all enrichment programs. The teachers will also attend a graduate course that will train them to incorporate research concepts into their teaching practices. Following summer participation, each teacher will introduce into their classrooms at least one new teaching module focusing on nanoscale science or materials science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;Science and technology are major economic drivers in society, and nanomaterials is a burgeoning area of economic importance. This Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) site at the University of New Orleans will provide opportunities for students to become familiar with relevant career and educational paths so that they can enter the growing field of nanomaterials. The REU site will recruit from schools with large minority populations in an effort to help diversify the scientific work force. In addition to participating in cutting edge research, students will also partake in various enrichment activities to sharpen their scientific and presentation skills. The project will also involve high school science teachers, and this aspect will help extend the benefits of the project to even younger students by training the teachers how to engage their students in the study of nanomaterials. Overall, the project will help train American undergraduates to enter the field of nanomaterials and eventually contribute to US technical and economic strength.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported summer research for 31 undergraduate students over the entire course of the project.  These students worked with graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and professors to complete research projects in materials science and nanotechnology.  Each student received a stipend, and non-local students were provided with on-campus housing.  Research projects included preparation and characterization of new nanomaterials with applications in electronics, communication, health, and other fields. Students were trained in how to perform laboratory functions and how to utilize sophisticated scientific equipment. In addition to research endeavors, the students participated in enrichment activities that familiarized them with materials science research, career pathways, and scientific communication. At the end of each summer, participants presented posters on their research in a poster session for all summer research participants.  Some participants disseminated their results at national scientific conferences or via publication in a peer reviewed scientific journal.  Of the participants, 26% were African-American, 26% were Hispanic, 48% were from any minority group, 74% were female, and 48% were sophomores or earlier in school.  The participants gained important scientific and research skills and also learned about career opportunities.  When young students (early in their undergraduate careers) become part of a research team, they gain perspective and insight that is new to them. These students subsequently interact with their peers and pass on important concepts that are not prevalent in the general public. In addition, future scientists and engineers will produce important advances that will have many impacts worldwide. Participants in this program received training and opportunities that will help them to contribute in such future advances and will support U.S. economic growth and technological competitiveness.
