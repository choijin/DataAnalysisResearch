<AbstractNarration>The International Society for Computational Biology is awarded a grant to support student and early-career researcher participation in the annual meeting on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology in Long Beach, CA, July 15-17. The conference holds thematic sessions for invited presentations, tutorial programs on related subjects, and special interest group workshops. Cutting-edge bioinformatics areas presented at the conference include bio-imaging and visualization, databases and ontologies, evolution and comparative genomics, gene regulation and transcriptomics, mass spectrometry and proteomics, population genomics, protein interaction, and molecular networks and structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will assist students and postdoctoral researchers, particularly under-represented minorities, at a critical but resource-limited stage in their careers by partially funding the travel and expenses associated with attending the conference. Through their participation, these students will have the opportunity to be exposed to leading edge research and methods, gain introductions to international and world-renown keynote speakers and senior level scientists, seek out prospective postdoctoral and collaborative opportunities, and meet their peers from all over the world. Results will be disseminated as published proceedings indexed in MEDLINE and Current Contents, and video recordings of selected presentations will be available online.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation Grant 1241290 - ISMB 2012 Conference Support for Students &amp; Young Scientists &ndash; supported 32 young researchers to attend the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in July of 2012.  Of the 32 young researchers who attended, all were selected to give presentations to the broader audience of over 1,100 attendees and 37% were women.  The ISMB conference began in 1993 and was the driving force behind the founding of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) in 1997.  ISCB is the only society representing computational biology on a worldwide scale and its flagship conference, ISMB, has become the largest conference on computational biology worldwide. ISCB continues to see ISMB as its major flagship annual event.  A considerable fraction of all the major scholars in computational biology frequently participate in ISMB.
