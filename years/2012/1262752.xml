<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The WHOI Sea Floor Samples Lab [SFSL] was officially established in 1968 and has matured over the years to become a reliable source of sea floor samples of all types as well as the specialized equipment and tools necessary to collect them.  Continuing support from the National Science Foundation enables the SFSL to provide consistent and quality facilities and services to an international audience of marine scientists.   The collection serves a global audience and provides thousands of samples to hundreds of marine scientist annually.  Access is enabled by fully digitized documentation available at www.whoi.edu/corelab/explore .  This online database is continuously updated as new material enters the collection, and as archival processes proceed.   With continuing support from NSF, our site are labs specially equipped  for archiving incoming sea floor samples.  Core splitting facilities  include manual and automated devices capable of opening core liners of  various diameters.  Rock prep laboratories are equipped with a wide  array of diamond saws, crushing and separation tools and diamond  drilling facilities.  In addition, two labs are currently maintained for  core and rock layout, description, and sub-sampling.  All the required  tools and sub-sample containers are provided to users of the facility. Keeping pace with the expanding demands for material and data related to our extensive collection requires sustained funding to insure that previously acquired marine geological samples housed at the WHOI SFSL can continue to support basic research programs around the world.
