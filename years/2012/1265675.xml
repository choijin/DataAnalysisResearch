<AbstractNarration>Center for Energy Smart Electronic Systems (ES2) &lt;br/&gt;IIP-1265675; Georgia Tech (GT); Yogendra Joshi &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal FROM Georgia Tech seeks to join the Center for Energy Smart Electronic Systems (ES2) comprised of the State University of New York (SUNY, lead institution), the University of Texas at Arlington, and Villanova University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with other ES2 partners, GT will focus on the development of systematic methodologies for operating electronic systems, including data centers, as dynamic self-sensing and regulating systems that are predictive and verified in real time. Algorithms will be developed to control cooling resources and to assist expert system schedulers to schedule and/or migrate workload to achieve optimal energy consumption. Thermal management resources will also be allocated dynamically in response to system needs. This is by nature an intrinsically multi-disciplinary research area integrating software algorithms, control systems, thermal management and hardware. New models will have direct application to a variety of electronic/computing systems ranging all the way from the chip or device level to the system or data center level. Problem-oriented research related to Software Systems, Control Systems, Thermal Management Protocols, and Implementation and Assessment, will be addressed during the Centers first five year program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GT, along with other ES2 partners, will participate in promoting significant reductions in energy consumption in electronic systems, and will contribute to the national agenda of pursing transformative technology breakthroughs that will help us meet our energy challenges. In partnership with other ES2 sites, GT will implement an effective data management plan that promotes the sharing of data, models, and practices generated by the Center with academia and industry. These disseminated resources will strength the competitiveness of our nations industries in this sector. As part of ES2, the GT Site is committed to attracting talented and motivated students from all groups, and will integrate a variety of mechanisms across the partners, including enhancement of existing minority pipeline programs to exceed participation by women (35%) and underrepresented students (20%). Students will have access to research data center facilities to conduct experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a Site for the NSF Energy Smart Electronic Systems (ES2) Industry/University Cooperative Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology engaged in multiple projects on energy efficient thermal management of data centers.  These projects involved computational and experimental studies, in collaboration with the other ES2 Center Sites (Binghamton University, University of Texas at Arlington, and Villanova University), industry members of the Center, and with Keio University in Japan.  A key area of research was data center air flow management to insure adequate air flow to server racks.  Towards this, first-of-kind air flow measurements near data center floor tiles were performed using particle-image velocimetry, which served as benchmarking data for validation of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, as well as reduced-order models.  A new type of reduced order model, termed modified body force model, was developed to reduce computational time by more than an order of magnitude compared to detailed CFD simulations, while maintaining reasonable accuracy.  Characterizations of air flow and temperatures were also made for the improved air flow delivery achieved for the contained cold-aisle configuration.  Another key are of focus was data driven models for air flows and temperatures.  The technique of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) was employed to develop rapid prediction models for server air inlet temperatures.  Subsequently, multiple data driven modeling approaches were evaluated for air temperature predictions in data centers.  Commercialization of research was undertaken by participation in the NSF I-CORPS program. This resulted in a start-up AdeptDC by one of the Ph.D. graduates supported through the project.  The project resulted in training of post-doctoral fellows and graduate students who are employed in academia and industry. Undergraduate students participated in the project under the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Supplement.  The project contributed to increased diversity through the graduation of one woman Ph.D.       Last Modified: 04/13/2019       Submitted by: Yogendra K Joshi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
