<AbstractNarration>This Statistics Living-Learning Community (STAT-LLC) project at Purdue University addresses two transitions in the training of undergraduate statistics students: (1.) The bridge from first-year general curriculum into sophomore year Statistics major courses, and (2.) The bridge into a student's first research experience in data analysis, especially with Big Data.  Each year over a five year period, 20 sophomore trainees will take part in the STAT-LLC that involve a new project-based course in big data analysis, new mentored research collaborations and thrusts, a new seminar series, professional development initiatives, and living together in a new learning community.  The project leaders will schedule 3 core courses (probability theory, statistical theory, and data analysis) and the seminar series in blocks, so students take these courses together as a cohort (and still have plenty of time for individual electives), live together in a dormitory, and participate in a research experience that lasts 12 months (start of sophomore year to start of junior year).  The Senior Personnel are 12 faculty from the Department of Statistics at Purdue University.  Additional faculty mentors will hail from Actuarial Science, Atmospheric/Earth Science, Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Health and Human Sciences, and the Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering and be supported by administrators, academic advisors, and recruiters. Beyond Purdue, Rose-Hulman will host the students for their annual Undergraduate Mathematics Conference.  The Department of Statistical Science at Duke University and the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles will partner with Purdue on a DataFest student competition.  Assessment will be provided by Purdue's Discovery Learning Research Center, and an External Advisory Board has been assembled with colleagues from the American Statistical Association, Duke University, Indiana University, the John N. Gardner Institute for Excellence in Undergraduate Education, the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute, University of Minnesota, University of Wisconsin, University of South Carolina, and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, in Melbourne, Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pairing the academic and residential life experiences is a known best practice for the first-year experience but is rarely used at the sophomore level as it is in the present project.  Furthermore, the Statistics Living-Learning Community (STAT-LLC) will pair this model with an early, team-oriented introduction to big data analysis.  We conjecture that the project will promote retention, instill confidence in the students, help propel the students through the formative second year of college, and prepare them to apply for graduate school.  This holistic experience should result in more students pursuing double majors: Statistics and an applied major in a data-oriented discipline.  Our assessment of this comprehensive training experience should reveal new insights into the way that pairing academic coursework, research, professional development, and residential life at the sophomore level can alleviate the sophomore slump within STEM disciplines.  The Senior Personnel will offer faculty training workshops at national meetings to teach colleagues how to unite the aspects of the sophomore experience in a relevant way for their campuses.  The workshops will be free, to maximize participation by faculty who would not otherwise have access to such resources, networking, partnerships, and professional development opportunities.  As a result, more campuses will be able to offer research experiences for sophomores in the context of a learning community.  Students will communicate their experiences each spring at the Rose-Hulman Undergraduate Math Conference and the Indiana MAA Section meeting.  Diversity initiatives will be supported by Purdue's Disability Resource Center; Emily Mauzy Vogel Sophomore Leadership Development Conference; HORIZONS Student Support for 1st generation students; Purdue's chapter of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS); the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Indiana project; and the Science Diversity Office.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Statistics Living-Learning Community (STAT-LLC) project at  Purdue University addresses two transitions in the training of  undergraduate statistics students: (1.) The bridge from first-year  general curriculum into sophomore year Statistics major courses, and  (2.) The bridge into a student's first research experience in data  analysis, especially with Big Data.  The STAT-LLC students and their faculty research mentors have produced 173 journal papers and conference talks.  The  PI has given numerous talks and workshops at regional and national  meetings of the American Mathematical Society and the American  Statistical Association, and has published several papers describing the  STAT-LLC.  The specific objective of the STAT-LLC has been to unify the academic,  residential, research, and professional development experiences of  undergraduate students across all disciplines.  The key thread through  all of our students' research projects is that they all worked on data  analysis and expanded their domain expertise in their chosen areas of  application. The STAT-LLC students were not all Statistics majors, but  rather, they were all learning statistical methods and data science  tools for analyzing the massive data sets that faculty and professionals  are faced with, in their research.  The STAT-LLC students learned the  full breadth of research and the data analysis cycle.  They met  regularly in seminar, dinners, individual meetings, and professional  society interactions with alumni, faculty whose research relies on data  analysis, professionals in all kinds of applied statistics areas, etc.   The STAT-LLC students can be viewed as having both broad and  deep research interactions and understandings of the entire field of  Statistics and Data Science.  This breadth and depth of student experience has  been integrated into the development of an even larger program called The Data Mine, which will continue to operate at Purdue, beyond the life of the NSF grant.  Students continue  to learn data science tools and to work on projects throughout the  academic year.  We have more visitors than ever.  A steady stream of  alumni, faculty, researchers, scientists, engineers, etc., continue to  visit The Data Mine almost daily, in our External Events program.   Students participate in events with our external visitors and also write  reflections about how these discussions broaden their scientific  experiences.  Even during 2020, while our seminars have been offered  (synchronously) online, our students have continued to work on projects  every week in The Data Mine (individually and in teams), and they have  continued to meet external visitors online, almost every day, throughout  this pandemic.  The STAT-LLC and The Data Mine have further impacted the rest of the campus growth in the data  sciences, because any class on campus is able to request access to the same computational and learning resources that The Data Mine students have access to.
