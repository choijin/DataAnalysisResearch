<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division is supporting the research of Professor Tehshik Yoon of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.   Professor Tehshik Yoon will develop new ways to control the synthesis of aminoalcohols.  These groups are responsible for the selective binding of many drugs and drug-like molecules to biological receptors.  In order for a drug to bind tightly and with high selectivity for one target over countless others in a cell, these N and O groups must be introduced with a specific spatial orientation.  The methods developed in this project employ an innovative strategy that allows for exquisite control over the molecular shape of aminoalcohols using inexpensive, non-toxic iron and copper catalysts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the importance of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compounds in biological chemistry, this work has the potential to impact the manufacture and discovery of a wide variety of medicines, agrochemicals, and biomaterials.  Given that the reactions involve sustainable base-metal catalysts, these methods could also result in the reduction of toxic wastes in the manufacturing of aminoalcohol-based compounds.  In addition, this project will enable the development of new strategies to use social media in scientific and educational outreach, including to populations historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most life-saving medicines are small organic molecules.  The vast majority of these are compounds that have been artificially synthesized by chemists and tested for new biological activities against important diseases. If one looks at the structures of these molecules, one ubiquitous feature is they are invariably decorated with multiple nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The presence of these so-called "functional groups" is responsible for the interaction between the drug and its target molecule, and the precise spatial positioning of these groups is vital for the function of the drug.  This grant funded the discovery of a suite of new reactions that can install nitrogen- and oxygen-containing functional groups onto otherwise unfunctionalized molecules.  We discovered methods to place these groups in multiple orientations and in multiple relative orders. Importantly, these reactions exploited the uniique reactivity of catalysts that are derived from earth-abundant, non-toxic iron and copper salts.  Finally, we have also discovered verions of these catalysts that are able to control the stereochemistry (that is, the spatial orientation) of these functional groups.  The Broader Impacts of these reactions are twofold. First, they collectively offer a new approach for the synthesis of these complex molecules. Second, the research has trained multiple promising young scientists who are now making their mark as leaders in the chemical industries and in academic research.
