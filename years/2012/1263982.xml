<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will expand PI?s prior research in the fields of von Neumann algebras and orbit equivalence ergodic theory. PI will exploit new ideas and techniques to obtain additional rigidity results for von Neumann algebras arising from group actions on probability spaces. The PI is seeking general methods that produce new examples of W*E superrigid actions, a problem of central interest in the theory as it unifies extreme forms of rigidity from both orbit equivalence and von Neumann algebras. In addition, the PI will continue his prior investigation of structural properties of certain von Neumann algebras, such as obtaining additional Bass-Serre rigidity type results for amalgamated free products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last decade, Popa?s deformation/rigidity theory led to the solutions of many long-standing problems in von Neumann algebras, orbit equivalence and descriptive set theory. It also triggered new exciting parallel development, such as Peterson?s derivation theory for von Neumann algebras, a technique designed to bring more insight to the field from cohomological aspects of groups representation theory. Moreover, it generated a new array of open problems concerning the classification of von Neumann algebras and the study of equivalence relations, some of which are the object of the current proposal. The PI anticipates additional connections with infinite group representation theory and geometric group theory. Finally, he will seek to attract new young researchers in the field and to exploit connections with other areas of mathematics by co-organizing conferences and informal seminars in von Neumann algebras.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Seeking a rigorous mathematical formalism for quantum mechanics, John von Neuman introduced in mid-thirties a class of new mathematical objects now known as von Neuman algebras. What was initially just an instrument to understand particle physics eventually morphed into a stand-alone discipline with deep connections with other areas of Mathematics, significantly group theory and ergodic theory. This is best illustrated by an early fundamental result which asserts that groups and their actions on spaces naturally give rise to a class of von Neumann algebras termed factors. Ever since their introduction, classifying factors in term of their group/actions initial data has emerged as a major direction of research in this area and generated overtime spectacular progress and development of new exciting theories.  An unprecedented progress in this area has been made over the last 10-15 years through the introduction of PopaÃ†s deformation/rigidity theory; this marked a new era for the study of rigidity phenomena in von Neumann algebras and related fields, witnessing solutions to many long-standing open problems and initiating new directions of research. Rigidity in mathematics is the condition that allows one to identify an object with its entire structure, just from limited a priory information.  Through this project the PI and his collaborators found new inputs in the deformation/rigidity theory from both geometric and cohomological perspectives in group theory, bringing a fresh insight to the classification of factors. These techniques enabled him to prove several strong structural properties, including a complete classification of so-called Cartan subalgebras in large classes of factors.  As a consequence, this work unveiled many new examples of natural group actions which can be completely reconstructed from their factors - one of the main goals of the proposed project. More importantly, these methods have stirred significant subsequent developments from other researchers in the field.  Many of the investigations done under the proposed project have significant relevance to other areas of Mathematics and beyond, notably: group theory, ergodic theory, free probability, random matrices, logic, computer science, and quantum information theory.  The PI (together with his collaborators and his PhD students) developed new ideas and techniques that established new bridges between deformation/rigidity theory and these areas, ultimately leading to rich interdisciplinary activity.
