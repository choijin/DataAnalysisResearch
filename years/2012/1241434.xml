<AbstractNarration>The Computer Science Department at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), in collaboration with the departments of Biological Sciences, Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, and Psychology, offers an interdisciplinary REU summer program in applied intelligent systems. The program hosts eight students for a period of ten weeks during the summer. It emphasizes interdisciplinary research, where techniques developed in the area of artificial intelligence are applied to real-world problems in science and engineering. This will allow the students to gain a broader overview of science and engineering as a potential career than would be possible in more narrowly-defined research areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student will work on an individual interdisciplinary research project under the co-supervision of a faculty member from the computer science department and a faculty member from one of the collaborating departments. The unifying research theme will be the use of intelligent systems techniques, including machine learning, data mining, optimization, and image analysis, to solve relevant data analysis problems in science and engineering fields. Students will be able to choose from a large list of projects that includes automated analysis of astronomical images, seismic tomography using machine learning, and identifying foreign accents in speech, among many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To assist the development of each student's oral communication skills and broaden their views of science and engineering beyond their project, each student will informally present the progress of their research project to all other REU participants, including mentors, the REU Program Director, and to their fellow REU students at the REU weekly meeting. In addition to the weekly meetings, there is a seminar series with the main goals of improving students' research skills and increasing their understanding of potential career paths in computing-related fields. The program will conclude with a one-day symposium to highlight the achievements of the REU students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>From 2012 to 2016 we ran the Research Experience for Undergraduates in Applied Intelligent Systems program at UTEP. The program offered a unique combination of: a) well-planned interdisciplinary research projects, which could realistically be completed by an undergraduate student during one summer; b) mentorship by at least two faculty members from two different research departments, which enabled students to gain a richer perspective about careers in science; c) emphasis on development of research skills over knowledge about a particular discipline, including oral and written communication skills and self-confidence; d) emphasis on recruitment by individualized invitation over self-selection of applicants, which we enabled us to attract large numbers of minority applicants, who commonly lack the self-confidence and self-awareness of non-minority students; e) mentorship by members of the targeted minority groups, which will allow these students access to culturally and ethnically similar role models.</p> <p>In the four summers the program operated, thirty-two undergraduate students participated. Each of them successfully completed an interdisciplinary research project under the supervision of a mentor from Computer Science and, in most cases, an additional mentor from a collaborating department (Psychology, Biology, Geology, or Electrical Engineering). Projects ranged from analysis of seismic data, to monitoring the behavior of flies, to mapping coordinates in the rat brain, to automatically evaluating bilingual proficiency. All students presented research posters at a local symposium focusing in computer science and another symposium open to the general science and engineering community at UTEP.</p> <p>Promoting diversity was a key objective in our program. Out of 32 participants, 23 were Hispanic, two were African American, and eight were female. It is expected that most of the students who participated in the project will enroll and successfully complete graduate studies and that a significant fraction of them will become faculty members at colleges and universities. This project will thus have a multiplicative effect, as many of our trainees will themselves become role models and mentors for future generations of minority students. Given the extreme under-representation of Hispanics as a fraction of the Ph.D. recipients in computing (less than two percent of the total, according to the latest Taulbee survey), a successful program of modest size in a single institution can have a very significant impact in the nationwide situation. Additionally, our program could be used as a model for other institutions to promote the production of under-represented minority Ph.D.s in Computer Science, and, eventually, be extended to other disciplines.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/26/2016<br>      Modified by: Olac&nbsp;Fuentes</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1241434/1241434_10177704_1474932460125_garcia_poster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1241434/1241434_10177704_1474932460125_garcia_poster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Computer Vision to Automate the Analysis of Courtship Behavior in Fruit Flies"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1241434/1241434_10177704_1474932460125_garcia_poster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Computer Vision to Automate the Analysis of Courtship Behavior in Fruit Flies"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Poster showing collaborative research between Computer Science and Biology.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ricardo Garcia</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Olac&nbsp;Fuentes</div> <div class="imageTitle">Computer Vision to Automate the Analysis of Courtship Behavior in Fruit Flies</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1241434/1241434_10177704_1474932353510_esaw_poster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1241434/1241434_10177704_1474932353510_esaw_poster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Determining the Proficiency of Bilingualism in Both English and Spanish Using Machine Learning"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1241434/1241434_10177704_1474932353510_esaw_poster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Determining the Proficiency of Bilingualism in Both English and Spanish Using Machine Learning"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Poster showing collaborative research between Computer Science and Psychology.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Vanessa Esaw</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Olac&nbsp;Fuentes</div> <div class="imageTitle">Determining the Proficiency of Bilingualism in Both English and Spanish Using Machine Learning</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1241434/1241434_10177704_1474932197320_guevara_poster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1241434/1241434_10177704_1474932197320_guevara_poster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Efficient Smoothing Filters in Seismic Tomography"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1241434/1241434_10177704_1474932197320_guevara_poster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Efficient Smoothing Filters in Seismic Tomography"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Poster showing collaborative research between Computer Science and Geology.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mathew Guevara</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Olac&nbsp;Fuentes</div> <div class="imageTitle">Efficient Smoothing Filters in Seismic Tomography</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1241434/1241434_10177704_1474933348063_perez_poster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1241434/1241434_10177704_1474933348063_perez_poster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Translating Map Coordinates and Plotted Data Between Canonical Rat Brain Atlases"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1241434/1241434_10177704_1474933348063_perez_poster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Translating Map Coordinates and Plotted Data Between Canonical Rat Brain Atlases"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Poster showing collaborative research between Computer Science and Biology.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Aldo Perez</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Olac&nbsp;Fuentes</div> <div class="imageTitle">Translating Map Coordinates and Plotted Data Between Canonical Rat Brain Atlases</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
