<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator proposes several projects in arithmetic geometry and transcendental number theory that focus on the deep links between the analytic and arithmetic information coming from values of special functions.  The investigator plans to continue the study of quantities related to Anderson-Drinfeld motives in positive characteristic, especially periods, logarithms, and special zeta and L-values.  One focus will be to investigate further the Galois theory of difference equations to prove new algebraic independence results for these quantities. Another aspect of these investigations will be to search for and develop log-algebraic power series identities on Drinfeld modules and their tensor powers.  Specializations of these identities will then produce explicit formulas for special values of Goss L-series for Dirichlet characters, Hecke characters, and Drinfeld modules, thus providing input for transcendence and algebraic independence problems. In another project, the investigator will pursue problems relating finite field hypergeometric functions to counting points on algebraic varieties over finite fields and L-series associated to classical and Siegel modular forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is one of the fundamental branches of mathematics, and it serves as the basis for many applications, including cryptography and coding theory.  The proposed research considers questions involving values of analytic functions that somewhat remarkably convey fundamental information about fields of algebraic numbers or geometric objects defined over them.  Such questions have their genesis in work of Euler and Gauss, and mathematicians continue to endeavor to unravel their mysteries.  Several parts of the project lead naturally to problems for graduate and undergraduate research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research under this award encompassed several projects in mathematical research in Number Theory.  The specific areas of study focused on the deep links between analytic and arithmetic information presented by special functions, especially exponentials, logarithms, zeta functions, and L-functions of various kinds.  Problems of this type have their origins at least as early as work of Euler and Gauss, and they are have maintained continued prominence in number theory research for many years.  Working with students and collaborators, the Principal Investigator researched problems involving special values of analytic functions in positive characteristic.  Such analytic functions are defined on complete extensions of finite fields, and by work of Anderson, Carlitz, Drinfeld, Goss, Thakur, and many others, we know that these functions live in convincing parallel to analytic functions of classical interest.  In addition to intrinsic interest in their own right, this study of function field arithmetic often leads to insights about classical phenomena.  The work on this project has settled some open questions about algebraic relations among various quantities in function field arithmetic. These include periods, quasi-periods, logarithms, and quasi-logarithms of Drinfeld modules over arbitrary base rings, as well as special values of Goss L-functions. These solutions have led to additional questions in transcendence theory that require further study.  The work on this project has also led to new understandings of special values of Goss L-functions, especially at positive arguments, including a precise formulation of Dirichlet series in terms of Carlitz polylogarithms.  We also obtain understanding of special values of Goss L-functions associated to Drinfeld modules of higher rank and function field multiple zeta values.  Work on this project has also expanded understanding of the connections between Mahler measures and special values of L-functions of classical modular forms and between finite field hypergeometric functions and counting points on rigid Calabi-Yau manifolds over finite fields.  The Principal Investigator continued to mentor post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students in education and research projects in mathematics.  The present award led to several publications by students and junior researchers.       Last Modified: 10/28/2015       Submitted by: Matthew A Papanikolas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
