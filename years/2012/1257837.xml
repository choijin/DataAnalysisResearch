<AbstractNarration>Red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) populations invaded the U.S. from Argentina and are expanding worldwide. Their success is in part due to the high reproductive ability of fire ant queens and the species aggressive behavior.  Red imported fire ant queens have the privilege of reproductive ability and years of longevity while most females in the colony become non-reproductive individuals (workers). This project advances physiology, endocrinology and neurobiology of social insects by studying reproduction in fire ant colonies with multiple queens, the most abundant social form in the US. Little is known about fire ant reproduction. Limited knowledge is available on key neuropeptide receptors (e.g., short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and insulin-like peptides), which likely regulate gene networks involved in queen ovarian development and/or egg maturation, and/or sensing their nutritional status. The project will focus on immunolocalization of sNPF and insulin receptors and on evaluating the physiological consequences of silencing their genes by transcriptome analysis and RNA interference (RNAi) experiments with queens and workers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include both social and educational benefits.  Millions of dollars are lost annually only in the U.S. to control these invasive ants, in quarantines, or in damage repairs. The discoveries from this project offer potential for novel ant control. Knowledge on the physiological mechanisms by which queens sense their nutritional status, reproduce and how task allocation is determined in worker ants will help recuperate productive land, parks, and pastures currently lost to fire ant invasions worldwide.  Additionally, the PIs are female Hispanics at Texas A&amp;M University. A Ph.D. student and a post-doctoral trainee will participate in the project. Acknowledging the need for scientists to effectively communicate the significance of research to the public, the post-doc and students (grad and undergraduate) will develop scientific content and materials for distribution in English and Spanish. The research team will collaborate with EarthSky (Austin, TX) for mentoring students on script writing of scientific content and production of radio, video and TV programming for broad audiences. The latter will be broadcasted by the Hispanic TV network Univision. The PIs are mentors for Research Experiences for Undergraduates currently supported by the NSF through the Department of Entomology EXCITE program and this project will incorporate an REU-NSF student for a summer program. The PI teaches courses in Graduate Insect Physiology and Insect Toxicology and project findings will impact these graduate courses content. Findings from the research will also be published in peer reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> This project on the red imported fire ant, <em>Solenopsis invicta</em> Buren (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) significantly advanced our knowledge of fire ant queen and worker physiology and neurobiology as well as queen reproduction. Importantly, this knowledge is applicable more broadly to other social insects such as other ants or bees. In these invasive fire ants, queens have the privilege of reproductive ability and years of longevity, while workers (also female) are completely sterile and cannot become reproductive individuals. Our goal was and continues to be researching the red imported fire ant to understand how these ants achieved such high reproductive rates and invasive potential. Our studies spanned from the whole organism to the subcellular and molecular levels analyzing different tissues of fire ant female queens or workers. Our long term goal is to integrate new physiological and molecular knowledge to decipher the mechanisms of fire ant reproduction. Reproductive output (number of eggs) is directly linked to nutritional levels in queens and the colony in general. We aimed at discovering which genes in queens and worker ants control these processes so that we can eventually find and identify how we can intervene to more effectively manage this invasive pest. If we find the &ldquo;weakest links&rdquo; or the &ldquo;most important genes&rdquo;, then we can find molecules to disrupt these physiological processes and reduce the burden of fire ants in our urban areas, pastures, and other productive lands. We are taking advantage of this ant species for our molecular studies because worker fire ants are completely sterile providing a manner to differentiate which genes are involved in nutrition (workers express these genes but not those for reproduction) and those that are expressed for both nutrition and reproduction in queens. &nbsp;Our studies focused on colonies with many queens that live together and cooperate (polygyne colonies), the most abundant social form of this species in the southern US. We discovered the fire ants have a unique neuropeptide (&ldquo;sNPY&rdquo;) that is different from that in other insects and deorphanized its receptor. We studied the expression of genes and proteins in brains of queen and workers, contributing to advancing knowledge in social insect neurobiology. For these experiments, receptor cell expression functional analyses, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy and transcriptomics were approches used. We produced, verified and validated the collection of genes that are expressed in the virgin, newly mated and older mated queen brain and we compared these genes. Through these comparisons we determined which genes are important for the neurobiological or endocrine control of queen physiology. We found genes expressed during the period of virgin queen reproductive maturation inside the nest, which appear to be important for queen readiness and reproductive success.</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts:</strong> A strong commitment and conscientious effort was placed on the achievement of the educational objectives of this project and the open dissemination of the project scientific information as it was being produced. A female Hispanic obtained her Master of Science degree in Entomology researching fire ants physiology and neurobiology under this project, produced her Thesis on this topic and is an author on a publication in an open access journal (PLoS One). A second female Ph.D. graduate student in Entomology partially participated under this project and she will be an author in a forthcoming peer-reviewed journal article. Hispanic undergraduate and graduate student workers enrolled at Texas A&amp;M University were employed to help maintain the fire ant colonies in the laboratory and to dissect their tissues as they learned the biology of this invasive pest. Other undergraduates were enrolled in undergraduate research units for credit as they participated in research activities under this project. Therefore, this project contributed both to the scientific training and financial aid of female and male students. A female post-doctoral student who had a baby during her employment was also an author of another open access publication. Two male post-doctoral students worked in the final objective of this project and learned molecular biology for queen brain transcriptomics. This project and the project directors contributed to the mission of the NSF by actively supporting and promoting the participation and development of a diverse work force in STEM. <strong>Dissemination:</strong> Educational materials were developed and disseminated to communities of interests and the general public.
