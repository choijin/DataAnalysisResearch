<AbstractNarration>This action funds Michael Makoto Yoshizawa of the University of California, Santa Barbara to conduct a research project, entitled "Developing a criterion for the structural complexity of a 3-dimensional space" during the summer of 2012 at Nara Women's University in Nara, Nara Prefecture, Japan.  The host scientist is Professor Tsuyoshi Kobayashi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project aims to improve the understanding of the structure of 3-manifolds, which are spaces with the property that any inhabitants would perceive their surroundings as 3-dimensional.  Thus, 3-manifolds are of interest due to their resemblance to our own universe.  One  tool in studying 3-manifolds is a Heegaard splitting, which is a method of decomposing a 3-manifold into two simpler pieces.  Understanding properties of the Heegaard splitting, such as its distance (a measure of the splitting's complexity), can yield insight about the original 3-manifold.  This research focuses on developing a new criterion to identify higher distance Heegaard splittings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[My area of mathematical research is in the topology of 3-manifolds.    Topology is the study of properties that are preserved under continuous deformations.  In other words, these are properties of an object that are preserved under any stretching of molding of an object that does not involve tearing or gluing.    A 3-manifold is a space that, like our own universe, appears 3-dimensional to its inhabitants.  However, its global structure may be quite complicated.   One method of studying a 3-manifold is a Heegaard splitting, which is a method of decomposing the 3-manifold into two simpler pieces known as handlebodies.  A handlebody can be visualized in the following manner:  A solid ball has a handle if a solid cylinder has been attached to it along both of its ends.  If we attach g handles in this way, the result is a genus g handlebody.   An important property of a Heegaard splitting is its distance.  It is now known that the distance of a Heegaard splitting provides information about the topology of the original 3-manifold.  However, to describe distance we first need to introduce some terminology.   Let S be a surface.  We will consider two curves lying in S to be topologically equivalent if we can slide one of the curves in S, without ever cutting and gluing the curve back together, to look like the other.  Create a complex by associating each group of topologically equivalent curves in S with a vertex and connect two vertices with an edge if there exists curves corresponding to each vertex that do not intersect.  The resulting complex is called the curve complex of S and is denoted as C(S).   Now suppose that S is the outer surface of a handlebody H.  Then we will let the disk complex of H, denoted as D(H), be the set of vertices within C(S) that correspond to curves that bound disks in H.    Let M denote a 3-manifold.  If S is now a surface lying in M that divides the 3-manifold into two handlebodies H and H' of equal genus, then S determines a Heegaard splitting of M.  Note that S is then the outer boundary of both H and H', as these handlebodies lie on either side of S.  The distance of this Heegaard splitting is then defined to be the length of the shortest path in C(S) between D(H) and D(H').   Distance provides a notion of how "complicated" two handlebodies are glued together to obtain the original 3-manifold.  Tsuyoshi Kobayashi, my host researcher, is a pioneer in the study of distance and published the Casson-Gordon rectangle condition, which is a criterion for whether a splitting has distance greater than or equal to 2.  Unfortunately, it remains difficult to determine the exact distance of a given Heegaard splitting, especially if the distance is large.  Therefore, there is interest in constructing examples of high distance Heegaard splittings that have a known distance.   Any Heegaard splitting can be described via a surface automorphism (i.e. the gluing) of the splitting surface.  This idea was adopted by many authors to show the existence of Heegaard splittings of arbitrarily high distance.  In particular, many previous results have used a surface automorphism known as a pseudo-Anosov map in their constructions.  However, the drawback of using pseudo-Anosov maps is that the exact distance of the resulting splitting is usually not known and such methods do not provide concrete examples.   My research focus has been on determining the relationship between distance and a different type of surface automorphism known as a Dehn twist.  Unlike a pseudo-Anosov, Dehn twists are the simplest type of surface automorphism and can be visualized as "twisting" around a curve on the surface.   During my time in Japan, Kobayashi asked if I could replace pseudo-Anosov maps used in his on-going research with explicitly constructed Dehn twists.  I developed an outline of a proof that such Dehn twists can be obtained and I am continuing this work with two collaborators of Kobayashi, Yeonhee Jang and Ayako Ido.   Kobayashi was a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
