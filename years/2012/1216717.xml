<AbstractNarration>This EAGER project explores whether a new conceptual model of social coordination, developed by PI Arthur Mason using data from North American energy companies, can effectively identify new forms of innovation for assessing uncertainty in Russian arctic natural gas development. Previous research in organizational anthropology by PI Arthur Mason illuminates the ways in which North American energy companies culturally define uncertainty in U.S. and Canadian arctic natural gas development; these include (1) reliance on redefined relations between government and industry; (2) reliance on consultant expertise; (3) reliance on future descriptions that catalyze perceptions about risk. The PI theorizes that these three contexts establish "communities of interpretation" among government and industry leaders for how industry operates and thus have implications for the way society will produce, control, allocate and use arctic energy resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order for the PI to test his hypothesis of "communities of interpretation" across the Arctic there is the need to gain access and explore these ideas among Russian energy companies.  This EAGER project will facilitate (1) identifying access to written empirical data on Russian arctic natural gas development, including history of technology transfers, energy demand forecasting, energy policy, market integration and liberalization (2) identifying access to collaborative and field research opportunities in Russia among government officials, industry leaders, community stakeholders and academic institutions. The research addresses a major formative force of our time, the politics of energy markets, and the way emerging transnational networks of expertise are embroiled in the constitution of imagined futures that impact on developments in the energy sector. The research project will potentially determine the effectiveness of applying core anthropological theories and methods to new and challenging research fields often associated with other disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Today, expert formulations of energy futures are constructing the most vulnerable areas of the Arctic into hydrocarbon-rich and accessible landscapes. What is the role of transnational networks of expertise in communicating economic forecasts of Arctic oil and natural gas developments?  This NSF EAGER project has over the past three years developed anthropological theories and methods in preparation for addressing the politics of energy markets and the way intermediaries (consultants) are embroiled in the constitution of imagined futures that impact on oil and gas developments in the Arctic. Through follow up funding, we propose ethnographic fieldwork at consulting firms and at key networking events where we plan to observe how consultants produce, mobilize, and disseminate expectations of Arctic oil and natural gas developments. We hypothesize that energy consultants create visions of Arctic energy futures that elevate the interests of industry and government into actionable views thereby crystallizing an inner-circle of participants with substantial powers. To test this hypothesis our future plans include addressing the following question:  How do intermediary experts assemble, mobilize, and market the future for an industry requiring perspectives that are fundamental for developing Arctic energy frontiers?  With the funded EAGER project, we created the possibility for establishing unique access to data in unique social spaces that will ultimately result in a Consultant Expertise framework for a next generation of scholars involved in the anthropologies of finance, markets, futurity, and expertise, linked to Science and Technology Studies-related genealogies. Examining intermediaries today draws necessary attention to privatized knowledge systems in the Arctic that license the intervention of experts in debates about emerging infrastructures, contracting regimes, and community development plans that accompany concessions being newly put into place at this moment. Energy development is one of several industries reliant upon intermediaries, and understanding the results of this reliance will shed light on a more general phenomenon across society. Our characterization of consultant expertise will provide critical insight into control over the production of Arctic knowledge that is privatized via commodification. Yet, researching consultants is complicated because firms are subject to proprietary client relationships. As part of our forthcoming research, we therefore identify three features of high gain and high risk associated with this project (see Image Box 1).   We hypothesize that intermediary experts have three forms of practices in place for visualizing Arctic energy futures that elevate the interests of industry into objectivized and actionable views: assembling, mobilizing, and performing (See Figure 1).  In this way, intermediary expertise allows the possibility for industry actors to become conscious of an idea of futurity as singular, desirable, and achievable. That is, through these practices, consultants reduce complexity into the kinds of simplicity that can form the basis of decisions which industry considers defensible, suitable, and feasible.  The EAGER provided us an opportunity to draft a follow up plan that allows us to identify and conceptualize the activities of consultants who shape both the production and consumption of Arctic energy futures. As part of this plan, we will raise three research questions and objectives of how practices of intermediary expertise are carried out. The questions and objectives are:  Question 1: How do intermediary experts acquire and assemble their knowledge? Which tools, methods, and models assess the main economic and social issues related to energy technologies for medium- and long-term horizons?  Research Objective 1: Investigate enterprise forecasting techniques to formulate an empirical characterization of intermediary knowledge.  Question 2: How are products created fr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
