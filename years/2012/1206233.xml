<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure contribute funds to this award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational and theoretical research and education on non-equilibrium dynamics of materials involving classical and quantum models.  Two recent algorithmic advances by the PI, one for classical systems and one for quantum systems, will be further developed and applied to specific models.  The main thrusts of this project are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The mathematical underpinnings necessary to bridge disparate time scales in simulations, related to Projective Dynamics and Forward Flux Sampling methods, have recently been shown to be applicable to non-equilibrium dynamics of classical off-lattice systems.  The Projective Dynamics and Forward Flux Sampling methods will be further developed and applied to two simulations with oscillating electromagnetic fields.  One study will be related to fast charging for Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, the other to non-equilibrium processes relevant to the folding of proteins.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;2. A novel quantum algorithm will allow studies of spin systems with a much larger Hilbert space than previously accessible to real-time calculations.  This algorithm will be applied to study decoherence and thermalization of spin systems coupled to specific explicit spin baths.  Both non-equilibrium dynamics and the approach to equilibrium will be investigated.  The methodology will also enable quantification of the relation between physical time and time in dynamic Monte Carlo simulations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Two additional studies of a more speculative nature will also be performed. One study will expand a new Renormalization Group method of the PI to investigate time-dependent electron transport through tight-binding models of nanomaterials with disorder.  The second study will be to perform real-time quantum simulations in order to understand how the ubiquitous classical phenomenon of synchronization is manifest in large quantum systems. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This award also supports education of graduate and undergraduate students, including minority and female students, in the computational study of equilibrium and non-equilibrium materials processes.  In addition, select computer source codes developed in the course of this project and related to non-equilibrium simulations of quantum and classical systems will be made available to the general public through a web site utilizing a GNU General Public License, version 3 or later, in order to encourage code reuse for both research and education.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure contribute funds to this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports computational and theoretical research and education related to the non-equilibrium dynamics of materials.  Recharging the battery of an electronic device is a non-equilibrium process.  Processes related to the approach toward classical behavior of quantum systems are additional forms of non-equilibrium dynamics, which are called decoherence and thermalization.  Performing computer simulations of non-equilibrium processes provides a better understanding of materials properties.  The ultimate goals of such studies may be the faster charging of a battery or maintaining the integrity of a quantum mechanical state of electrons for a longer time.  Sophisticated algorithms are required to enable computer simulations of long-time studies of large non-equilibrium systems.  This award supports developing innovative computer algorithms for non-equilibrium processes in materials, and to apply these algorithms to specific models to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of materials.  &lt;br/&gt;This award supports the education of undergraduate and graduate students, including minority and female students, in the computational studies of non-equilibrium materials processes. Computer codes related to non-equilibrium simulations of quantum and classical systems that are developed in the course of this project will be made freely available encouraging code reuse for research and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award focused on the investigation of quantum effects in classical and quantum mechanics, with the primary methodologies utilized large-scale computational studies and theoretical investigations. Three dominant themes were investigated.   The first theme related to quantum transport of electrons in nanomaterials and nano-devices.  One outcome was the discovery of nano-systems that can have arbitrarily large disorder (strong electron scattering) but still have complete transmission of all electrons.  This phenomena was called 'quantum dragons', and may be useful in future nano-electronics hardware.  The phenomena was not expected, due to considerations of Anderson localization in materials with strong scattering.  The main paper was published in Physical Review B in 2014.  The second theme was related to quantum decoherence and thermalization in closed quantum systems when only part of the system is measured.  Within a formalism called the canonical-thermal-state ensemble, with collaborators, this project allowed theoretical considerations, tested by large-scale computer calculations, to answer interesting questions. One question is how difficult it is to decohere a particular quantum system, independent of which bath is used.  Another question is how good a quantum bath is at decohereing any quantum system to which it is connected.  This main paper was published in Physical Review A in 2016.   The third topic, one not envisioned which this project was submitted, was due to the availability of the first commercial adiabatic quantum annealing machine, a D-Wave machine.  Preliminary studies utilzed the D-Wave in order to investigate its potential to advance scientific computing, and its relationship with the title of the award --- namely computations and quantum systems.  Conference proceedings were published on the preliminary use of such machines, and also in benchmarking such machines.  Quantum computers hold the possibility in the near-term, one to five years, to enable computations which could not be accomplished by any classical computer.
