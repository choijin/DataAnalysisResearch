<AbstractNarration>The University of Central Oklahoma REU Site Grant will provide an international and integrative biological research experience for at least six undergraduates during eight weeks each summer of 2013-2015. This REU program, centered at Uludag University, near Istanbul and the Sea of Marmara, is designated as a Global Venture Fund Award and supported by the NSF's Offices of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO). The research program involves collaboration with scientists at institutions in the United States, Greece, and the Republic of Turkey.  Hypotheses are posed in a biogeographic and phylogenetic context, using the honey bee as a model system for understanding the ecological, behavioral, comparative psychological, and molecular biological aspects of invasive species. Prior to and during the program, students will be immersed in mini-courses and discussions that teach ethics and responsible conduct in research and the nature of scientific research. Students are asked to continue their participation beyond the eight-week period of the program, reconvening to present results at a national conference, as well as being offered opportunities to publish research findings. The program will support a generation of scientists who understand the relationship between human diversity and intellectual innovation. Indeed, students participate in enrichment activities that include visiting some of the most significant locations in the history of human civilization: Istanbul, the Ancient City of Troy, the Aegean islands, and the Ancient City of Pergamum. Because many large-scale ecological problems in the United States (including invasive species, parasites, and disease) originate from outside its borders, the diverse and interdisciplinary collaborations in the program help to develop students who can conduct scientific research in an increasingly globalized setting. Student applications are assessed based upon academic performance, letters of recommendation, research aptitude, and the quality of a brief written essay. Students are tracked after the program to understand the impact the experience has on their career paths; assessment is also made during the program with surveys and the REU Common Assessment Tool. The program is supported by funds from the National Science Foundation?s Directorate of Biological Sciences. Additional information can be found at http://cms.uco.edu/REU/, or by contacting the Principal Investigator (Dr. John F. Barthell at jbarthell@uco.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Invasive species produce billions of dollars of damage to the U.S. economy annually. The honey bee, first brought from Europe to the eastern U.S. in the early 1600s, however, has promoted a modern agricultural economy that is dominated by introduced plant species. Tens of billions of dollars worth of these crops are directly dependent upon this pollination service to survive. Our studies during the last three years help us to understand the biology of honey bees in one of their native environments: the Republic of Turkey. These results reveal that honey bees have responses to sublethal environmental stresses, especially agrochemicals, that threaten colony survival in ways that give us insights into Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), a condition threatening the pollination industry.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neonicotinoid pesticides are becoming a well-studied source of sublethal mortality in honey bees throughout the world, especially the U.S. where the compounds receive little regulation. At commercially recommended dosages, these compounds rarely kill honey bees. Instead, the sublethal effects of pesticides disrupt the integrated function of bees, much like alochol intoxication in humans. We report deficits in their learning skills (including memory and foraging), disruption of motor coordination, and impaired reflexes. These sublethal effects combine with other environmental stressors such as diseases and parasistes to create a "perfect storm" of mutally reinforcing variables in the honey bee life cycle that threaten to worsen CCD. Cumulatively, these new environmental agents (many introduced into the U.S. in the last three decades) are threatening to undermine the apicultural industry and its value as a source of hive products and, most importantly, crop pollination. Early evidence suggests that honey bees may be especially vulnerable to these effects given the manner in which they share nectar, pollen and any other foraging products that are brought to the hive.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feral honey bees have also become critical components of our native ecosystems with various impacts on native flora and fauna. Our studies indicate that honey bee foraging behaviour has considerable plasticity that allows adjustment to the plant communities where honey bee colonies dwell. Our comparison between North American and Turkish ecosystems suggests that honey bees are strongly influenced by the availability and ease of access to nectar, such that a reestablishment of pollinators occurs depending upon the density of honey bees in a given flower patch. As more honey bees accumulate, smaller-bodied native bees tend to be less common in the same patch, and these correlations persist across patch sizes and geographic locales. These findings are relevant to understanding the role honey bees have in natural environments in the U.S. with the distinct likelihood that honey bees can focus their foraging efforts on non-native, high nectar producing species in our ecosystems and thereby promote weed species. These effects are ameliorated by the value that honey bees have in agricultural ecosystems in the U.S. so that the decline in honey bee numbers forecast for the U.S. will have the reciprocal effects of hampering crop pollination while potentially restoring native plant communities to their original form.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/02/2016<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;F&nbsp;Barthell</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1263327/1263327_10240640_1475450208449_IMG_3075--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1263327/1263327_10240640_1475450208449_IMG_3075--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Megachilid Bee Resting on Rock"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1263327/1263327_10240640_1475450208449_IMG_3075--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Megachilid Bee Resting on Rock"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A species of bee in the family Megachilidae on the island of Lesvos (Greece).</div> <div class="imageCredit">John F.
