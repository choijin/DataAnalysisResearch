<AbstractNarration>1233617/ Revzin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported through a joint program between the National Science Foundation and the National Cancer Institute.  Cancers originate in micrometere scale regions of tissues and organs called cancer microenvironment.  This microenvironment consists of healthy as well as cancerous cells that are present in close proximity and signal to each other via soluble molecules.  The study of cell signaling or communication is important as it may reveal why some cancers remain dormant while others become aggressive, metastasizing from the primary site.  The goal of this grant is to investigate a new mechanism of intercellular communication in cancers.  This mechanism is based on lipid particles called exosomes, secreted by cancer cells and carrying within them the payload of nucleic acids and proteins. The researchers hypothesize that uptake of exosomes by neighboring non-cancerous cells may facilitate cancer progression and metastasis.  The goal of the work will be to develop novel sensing techonologies for detection of exosome production and novel cell culture approaches for assessing the impact of exosome-producing cancer cells on neighboring non-cancer cells.  The research efforts will focus on the study of liver cancer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was designed to develop tools for understanding how cells exchange signals via lipid particles called exosomes.  These lipid particles contain cargo of proteins and other molecules that can be taken up by cells and can affect behavior of cells.  For example, it is thought that uptake of exosomes makes cancer cell more aggressive and more likely to proliferate.    It is challenging to detect exosomes, in particular to monitor release of these lipid particle over time.  Our objective was to develop new tools and strategies for monitoring exosome production by cancers.  Over the course of this project we developed a several strategies to detect productino of exosomes by cancer cells.  One strategy was based on changes in electrical signal that occurred when exosomes bound to the electrode surface.  Another strategy involved beads that emitted specific color of fluorescence upon binding of exosomes.  Sensors developed by us were relatively simple to use, produced signal with minimal human intervention and were sensitive enough to allow detection from individual cells.   The biosensors and other tools developed during this project will be valuable for research applications aimed at improving understading of cancer microenvironment.  Furthermore, our devices may be used to detect exosomes and may offer new diagnostic strategies.       Last Modified: 01/11/2017       Submitted by: Alexander Revzin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
