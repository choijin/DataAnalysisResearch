<AbstractNarration>Climate projections for the coastal southwestern United States predict a change in the frequency and magnitude of precipitation, perhaps with an overall drying. Despite the uncertainty in model projections, it is clear that any change to the region's winter dominated, "feast or famine" hydroclimatology will have consequences for the highly-populous, water-stressed region. This proposal develops a decadal to subcentennial scale, continuous sedimentary archive from Lake Elsinore, California using physical (grain size), biological (pollen), chemical (C:N), and isotopic (leaf wax hydrogen isotopes) analyses.&lt;br/&gt;Characterized by exceptional resolution and archive continuity, this unique terrestrial site in the coastal southwest offers an unparalleled opportunity to evaluate hydrologic and ecologic change across abrupt climatic transitions during the late Glacial period (9-33ka). The cores will be characterized using a diverse, multi-proxy approach to capture large magnitude, late Glacial transitions, including leaf wax D/H shifts of &gt;100 per mil, grain size evidence for variable run-off, and palynological evidence for changes in catchment vegetation. Lake Elsinore's exceptional archive is characterized by continuous deposition, high sedimentation rates, and the capacity for very high resolution radiocarbon age control using discrete organic material. Beyond representing a high quality archive of past terrestrial environmental change, Lake Elsinore sediments will enable proposed correlations with published marine reconstructions including local and distal marine records of Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs), as well as Atlantic SSTs and evidence for Meridional Overturning Circulation in order to assess the driving causes of the region's hydrologic and ecologic change. The team will focus on global abrupt climatic transitions including Heinrich events 1-3, and the transitions into and out of the Bolling-Allerod and the Younger Dryas. Although these transitions differ from the projected anthropogenic climate change, they offer large magnitude, abrupt transitions capable of providing maximum insights into forcing-response relationships. The working hypothesis is that hydrologic changes and ecologic shifts are closely in step and responding to local and global abrupt climatic transitions in the late Glacial to early Holocene. The questions are how much and how fast are these local responses demonstrated, and what might be the implications for the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lead investigators institution, Cal State Fullerton, reaches a large number of minority, and especially Hispanic students. The proposal engages two female co-investigators, one of whom is an early career Assistant professor. The proposed study will provide training and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate research at three institutions, with a focus on building the analytical and interpretative skill sets.&lt;br/&gt;This research will also provide the first terrestrially-based, decadal to subcentennial scale record of how the vegetation of the coastal southwest responds to abrupt climatic transitions. The development of a baseline understanding of the causes, responses, and recovery of past hydrologic and ecologic change is of interest beyond the paleoclimate field with implications for ecologists, conservationists, and policy decisions pertaining to the California Floristic Biodiversity Hotspot.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mega Droughts Parched Southern California Thousands of Years Ago. The Clues Are in the Pollen     Ancient pollen spores that were in the air when mammoths roamed Southern California are providing new insights into historic droughts in the region, including how a series of mega droughts 25,500 to 27,500 years ago changed the ecological landscape. A new scientific paper tracks these changes and suggests that warm ocean conditions similar to what we see off Southern California today fueled that period of mega droughts thousands of years ago.     In the paper, paleoecologists Linda Heusser and Jonathan Nichols of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory analyzed pollen levels in a sediment core drilled from the bottom of Lake Elsinore, a climate-sensitive area in the eastern shadow of the Santa Ana Mountains near Los Angeles.       The pollen levels show how pine trees and juniper that had dominated the ecosystem 32,000 years ago gave way to a massive influx of  dryland herbs, shrubs, and chaparral about 27,500 years ago, suggesting that the climate grew more arid and the lake dried up. For 2,000 years, the climate fluctuated, but the pollen levels show that it never stayed cool and wet long enough during that period for the trees to reestablish themselves along the lakeside.     The scientistsÆ high-resolution pollen analysis provides the first continuous terrestrial record at a scale of decades rather than centuries of ecological change in coastal Southern California during the last glacial period, about 9,000 to 32,000 years ago.     Heusser and Nichols also found that the terrestrial changes in that pollen record correlate with records from ocean sediment cores that show that the Pacific Ocean just off Santa Barbara was warm during the same periods of drought, pointing to a likely driver of the mega droughts.     A warmer ocean affects the winds along the coast, causing them to blow from the land toward the ocean rather than from the ocean, where the wind could bring moisture to the land. The moisture that did make it onshore during the mega droughts was likely blocked by the mountains, and very little reached the Lake Elsinore Basin.     The ocean temperature off Southern California during the mega droughts was similar to recent temperatures, but the background is different, Nichols and Heusser explained. Today, the climate is drier and warmer, and human-induced global warming is exacerbating drought conditions, as described in a recent study from LamontÆs Park Williams and Richard Seager.  California has also seen regular swings in modern times from periods of drought to El Nino years.     "This was happening during a glacial period when it was already cool and wet &ndash; cooler and wetter than it is now. If we got a drought like this now, it would be putting a big drought on top of a time which is already warm and dry," Nichols said.     During the mega droughts, the pollen record from Lake Elsinore suggests that the pine trees and juniper at lower elevations around the lake died off and their tree line moved up the mountains to cooler temperatures, while the lake dried out and its bed filled in with herbs and scrub.     "Pollen records are unique in that we can capture the vegetation distribution," Heuser said. "There are no other records of vegetation that extend through this time. The best we had been able to do before for this time frame was stalagmites inferring precipitation in a cave in New Mexico."     Heusser, Nichols and coauthor Matthew Kirby of California State University, Fullerton, published their findings in the October issue of Quaternary Science Reviews.
