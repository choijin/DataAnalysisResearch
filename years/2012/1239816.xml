<AbstractNarration>GNU Radio is an open source software radio project used extensively in industry, academia, and government for research, development, rapid prototyping, and deployment of wireless services. As an open source project, it has a wide-spread and disparate community of developers and users. Bringing members of this community together for a yearly conference helps to build a strong cohesion of ideas and identify and define the goals of the project. This conference also addresses the issues of increasing the development community of the project by getting to know potential developers and educating them on structure, style, and etiquette of a large, world-wide project used by thousands of people.</AbstractNarration>

The following final project report quickly reviews the support provided for the two conferences and provides a few lessons-learned.  Conference Support Review  The student travel support for both years ended up supporting a small number of students:two for GRcon12 and three for GRCon13. Students that were supported came and participated in the conference as expected, many of them presenting their work as part of the conference program.
