<AbstractNarration>Whole genome sequence information has transformed research in traditional model organisms, and now next-generation sequencing technology is at a turning point in its application to non-model organisms. Researchers working in data-rich, but sequence-poor, organismal systems are eager to apply these technologies to their own species. However, the challenges involved in generating useful, high quality, whole genome sequences in these naive systems are substantial. Non-model systems can have many biological features that directly hamper genome assembly, and therefore suffer from limited capacity to benefit from genomic tools.  This research aims to develop a new approach to genome assembly, one that combines next-generation sequencing with recombinant populations made using genetic crosses between individuals.  If the full potential of the method can be demonstrated, it will bring the power of genome-enabled science within reach of a large range of non-model organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tremendous amount of biological knowledge lies hidden within the genetic make-up of every organism on earth.  The secrets of these organisms potentially hold the keys to understanding the origins of biodiversity and the answers to many other biological puzzles.  This research will provide new tools that can be used to unlock the genetic information contained within any species.  The methods developed will therefore be of great benefit to a large number of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In order to understand all of the genetic material contained within any plant or animal, we must be able to assemble all of an organismÃ†s DNA into a readable genome.  New DNA sequencing technologies have transformed much of biology, but many of these advances have been limited to model organisms that have accurately reconstructed genomes.  Consequently, the genetic information contained within many wild species has been inaccessible for study, precluding the study of biologically, economically, and environmentally important organisms.  This grant implemented a new method for genome sequencing that can provide an accurate read-out of almost any genome.  The method takes advantage of the information provided in the offspring of two parents, combining this information with next-generation DNA sequencing to more accurately and cheaply produce an entire genome.  During the grant period we developed the computational tools to enable any researcher to carry out this method on their own, consequently equipping a huge number of scientists with the ability to access genome sequences from a wide array of species.  We also demonstrated the use of this method on one animal and one plant species, carrying out the DNA sequencing and the computational tasks necessary to produce a complete genome.  These examples will serve to highlight the ease with which this method can be used, and will also provide insight into the genome sequences of these species.
