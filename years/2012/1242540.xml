<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the FY12-13 academic year, sixteen (16) K-12 science and mathematics teachers participate as Fellows of the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship program in various directorates/offices across the National Science Foundation (NSF).  The fellowship program is a congressionally-mandated program under the auspices of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE).  NSF participates in this program through a grant to the Triangle Coalition (TC) that assists DOE with the management of the program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the program are to: (1) provide outstanding STEM teachers the opportunity to bring to Congress and appropriate branches of the federal government the insights, extensive knowledge, and practical experience of classroom teachers; (2)  increase the understanding, communication, and cooperation between Congress and Federal agencies; (3) increase the understanding, communication and cooperation between the Federal government and the science, technology and mathematics education community; and (4) gain insights and an understanding of national educational issues which can then be transferred back to the classroom.  While at NSF, the Fellows gain general as well as discipline-specific knowledge based on their placement within Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the 11-month fellowship, Fellows engage in a wide range of STEM experiences, work-related tasks, and activities organized by their host sponsor and the Triangle Coalition.  These Fellows also have access to a wealth of experiences provided by NSF and other federal and education agencies in the greater Washington, DC area.  In FY12-13, the Fellows represent 13 states and Washington, DC (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Virginia).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other agencies participating in the program include NASA, NOAA, and DOE.</AbstractNarration>
