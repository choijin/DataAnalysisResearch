<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this Gordon Research Seminar (seminar) is to match the Gordon Research Conference (conference) to expand the impact to this conference to graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and other junior researchers at comparable experience (young scientists).This seminar will focus on bringing together young scientists from the highly interdisciplinary community of organic electronics and allow them to discuss recent progress and new ideas on their own level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is to contribute to the understanding and, in turn, the ability to control the basic current- and light-driven processes in organic materials. The emphasis of the seminar will be on the latest progress and challenges regarding: artificial light-harvesting systems, organic electronics devices, inorganic/organic hybrid nanoscale systems, and especially on the synergy effects between these topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts are that this seminar will not only offer opportunities for new interdisciplinary collaborations among attendees to address future challenges but also it will provide the opportunity for young scientists to substantially increase their benefit from their conference experience. The speakers and discussion leaders will represent the highly interdisciplinary nature of this field with young scientists from chemistry, physics, material science, engineering, and chemical engineering, with both experimental and theoretical approaches. A primary goal of this funding request is to assist young US scientists to be able to participate the seminar and to join this community. The seminar will enhance their research programs and proposals by providing inspiring goals and ideas at the leading edge of the field.</AbstractNarration>
