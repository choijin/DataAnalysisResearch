<AbstractNarration>1204251---Wilhelm   &lt;br/&gt;Public Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kankakee Community College (KCC) in Illinois, in collaboration with the Midwest Renewable Energy Association (MREA), is developing a renewable energy job market transformation model for community colleges to incorporate into their renewable energy technician programs. The project is simultaneously helping to improve the training of renewable energy technicians while also working with employers to expand the renewable energy job market in the Midwest.  The primary project goals are: (a) to improve undergraduate technology education with a focus on training of community college faculty in solar photovoltaic technology and teaching skills, (b) to establish a renewable energy job transformation model for community colleges to incorporate into their existing renewable energy programs, and (c) to enhance the infrastructure and support for renewable energy technician training at community colleges by linking faculty in an online community of practice.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This forward-thinking, three-year project is creating a technician-training model to be replicated at six other community colleges in Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Through faculty professional development and curriculum dissemination and adaptation, this project addresses predicted, increased, regional demand for renewable energy technicians to install, maintain, and repair renewable energy equipment and systems. The project is designed to increase faculty technical knowledge about solar photovoltaics, enhance teaching skills about renewable energy, train local electrical practitioners about solar photovoltaics installation, maintenance and repair, and increase the number of certified solar site assessors to enhance solar installations. The project promotes renewable energy job growth through collaborations with renewable energy businesses, employers, homeowners, and MREA so that students graduating from these community college renewable energy programs will have immediate opportunities for employment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrated renewable energy technician training and job market transformation model is unique in addressing both the demand and supply side components of renewable energy technician training and job growth. The project will produce a replication handbook to guide other community colleges in the Midwest and across the nation in creating or strengthening similar AAS degree and certificate programs and in integrating these programs with regional job market transformation models. The resulting community of practice will further strengthen these efforts by supporting faculty to share effective practices in recruiting, training and supporting the success of students as renewable energy technicians, and by sharing knowledge about effective practices in engaging renewable energy employers as partners in the creation of additional renewable energy jobs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Project-C4 addressed a proverbial "chicken-or-egg" question about Midwest renewable-energy technician training at the time the proposal was submitted.  The conundrum summarizes, thus:  1) It?s generally accepted we need to transition from our fossil-fuel paradigm to a more sustainable energy strategy; 2) Midwest renewable energy deployment cannot effectively launch and grow without access to a properly trained workforce; 3) Community colleges typically do not support technician-training for fields with no current job demand.  This conundrum, leads to sensible questioning, "Which must we do first?  Do we begin training renewable-energy (RE) technicians and hope RE jobs soon arrive; or, wait until RE deployment is well underway and hope to subsequently, and quickly, train the needed workforce?"  The C4 answer is, "Neither; and, both."  C4 asserts it is appropriate for community colleges to engage in solar market stimulation while simultaneously training solar technicians.      Goals and notable outcomes of Project-C4 are:      "Goal 1) To improve undergraduate technology education by training community college faculty to advance their knowledge of solar photovoltaic technology and teaching skills."       We developed the C4 model at Kankakee Community College (KCC) as a demonstration site.  Then, aiming toward replicating C4 elsewhere, we gave training to instructors outside KCC on RE course and curriculum development, giving free access to KCC?s training materials. C4 replication was guided by the Midwest Renewable Energy Association (MREA), a C4 sub-awardee.      Resulting from C4 efforts, project PI Wilhelm was recognized by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) as their 2013 Clean Energy Trainer of the Year.  KCC was also recognized by IREC as their 2014 Clean Energy Training Provider of the Year.  These national awards are justified by the high pass rates of KCC?s student-cohorts who sat for the NABCEP (North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners) Solar-PV Entry Level exam.  The national average pass rate for the exam is about 60% -- 60% of those who sit for the exam, pass.  KCC?s pass rate was never lower than 78%; and, continually improved to the most recent pass rate of 100%.      Supporting project replication, C4 produced promotional and educational videos, freely shared with other colleges.  A recent email from Jenny Heinzen of the MREA said:  "As Training Coordinator and instructor for the MREA, I adore good [short] tutorial videos I can play in the classroom or in an online course that help students understand an otherwise complicated concept to visualize&hellip;Tim Wilhelm of KCC has made such videos and posted them on YouTube.
