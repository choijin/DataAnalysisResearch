<AbstractNarration>Project researchers have found there is a scientific as well as public need for persistent Earth and space remote sensing applications. The availability of dense global measurements could enable new techniques in geosciences for imaging the Earth, yielding important observations that could test theoretical models and improve understanding of the planet. Constellations of satellites could additionally be used to provide observations on climate, aurora, radiation belts, albedo clouds, lightning, radiation belts, gravity-hydrology and space weather among many other topics.  By placing sensors as ride-along packages on constellations of existing satellite there is the potential to increase the coverage, distribution and amount of data that could be used for scientific and public benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placing additional instruments on existing satellites could ameliorate the need for costly satellite programs. Global imaging capabilities, possible through this technology have the potential to mitigate global issues that impact the public including but not limited to; monitoring of volcanic ash clouds for airplane flights or global monitoring of crop health and the global carbon cycle. Data streams from this technology may provide necessary data for improved weather prediction, climate, space weather and disaster response and recovery.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  The emerging proliferation of commercial satellite constellations means that getting these sensors in space costs millions, not billions! This cost advantage comes from putting science sensors as ride-along packages (called hosted payloads) on constellations of commercial satellites. Commercial space will achieve vastly greater coverage/distribution of data by riding on constellations of satellites &ndash; greater numbers than have ever been launched before.  These greater numbers result in superior information products such as: real-time persistent global imaging, i.e. a "Google Earth Live" (InSpace) vs weakly imaging revisits (present GEOEye, WorldView), and new cutting-edge sensors can provide new products not currently available such as global vegetation/crop health, and a first-ever real-time, global, space-weather system. These informmatino products have significant science and commercial potential.  We entered the i-corp program to evaluate the commercial potnential for these new space applications.  The program was sucessful and a company was formed that is actively commercializing several ideas.  The proposed activity trained a post-doc and two co-PIÆs on entrepreneurship, enhancing the nationÆs capacity to transition innovation into economic activity, ultimately creating high paying American jobs.  In the government sector, placing our identified, low-cost instruments on commercial satellites could ameliorate the need for the US government to spend $500M annually on government only satellite programs. On the commercial side, global imaging of volcanic ash clouds could save the airlines billions in unnecessary cancellations, and global monitoring of crop health and production is critical for understanding the global carbon cycle, but could change how multi-trillion dollar commodities markets predict futures prices.
