<AbstractNarration>This award supports approximately 20 US-based students to attend the 2012 USENIX Security Symposium, the premier forum for advanced professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds to meet and discuss the newest advances in the security of computer systems and networks. Participation in Security 12 and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field and exposes students to leading work in the field. This award will enable students to participate who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. Security 12 will be held August 8-10, 2012, in Bellevue, WA. The conference will consist of a three-day technical program, with numerous workshops co-located. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers, practitioners, system administrators, system programmers, and others interested in the latest advances in the security of computer systems and networks. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well suited as a target for student participation, and this event has always drawn a large number of student attendees. Students receiving assistance will be strongly encouraged to present posters and works in progress as part of the selection process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Description     The 21st USENIX Security Symposium (SEC Æ12) is the premier forum for discussing security and privacy issues.  The goal is to bring together researchers, practitioners, system administrators, system programmers, and others interested in the latest advances in the security of computer systems and networks.  This year's program included 43 technical papers carefully selected out of 222 submissions.  The high-quality papers presented new research in a variety of subject areas, including detection of network attacks, privacy, Internet security, and Web security.  The symposium was held in Bellevue, WA, August 8-10, 2012.     Activities and Findings     USENIX received 84 stipend applications from students, and 77 were awarded grants.  Some of the funds were covered by the $20,000 from the NSF.  All students attend US based schools.  USENIX appreciates the financial support of the NSF, which allowed us to grant awards to many more qualified applicants than we would have been able to otherwise.  There were 630 total attendees the week of SEC Æ12 and 489 attendees specifically at Security.  Non-US attendees came from:  Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and United Kingdom.     Participation in Security 2012 and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience.  It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field, and exposes students to leading edge work in the field.
