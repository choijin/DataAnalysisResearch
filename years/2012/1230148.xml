<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a wireless, needle implantable miniaturized (0.5 x 0.5 x 5 mm) sensor for continuous glucose monitoring, with provisions for internal self-calibration that ultimately eliminates the need for frequent, external finger-pricking.  As part of Phase I project, the internal calibration routine has been developed and its ?proof-of-concept? has been demonstrated on an implantable glucose sensor unit operating in porcine serum for a period of 3 weeks.  Along these lines, a proximity communicator (wrist-watch like unit) has also been developed which is in operable communication with the implantable unit.  Phase II aims to further enhance the reliability of this calibration routine by demonstrating its efficacy in an in vivo environment (rat model) along with advancement of the proximity communicator unit in order to establish a two-way communication with a smartphone capable of real time data processing and implementation of the internal calibration routine.  At the end of Phase-II, the completion of developmental activities for the self-calibrating glucose monitoring platform is envisioned, thereby, bringing it a step closer to commercialization in the pre-clinical animal research market (first market of Biorasis Inc.) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this project are enormous considering that there is an urgent need for continuous glucose monitoring devices in view of the growing number of diabetic patients.  Implantable glucose sensors that afford minimal user intervention present a viable alternative, although their ?user-independent? nature is often undermined by the need for frequent external calibration via painful finger-pricking. The proposed project will result in a truly ?user-independent? operation of implantable glucose sensors. The successful implementation of such an advanced glucose monitoring technology, which can also be adapted for the management of other disorders (such as obesity and cardiovascular complications) will pave way for new jobs in our Stare of Connecticut and neighboring regions in the sectors medical devices, wireless communication and biosensors. The project will be performed in the University of Connecticut (UConn) Technology Incubation Program (TIP) in partnership with UConn collaborators.  This industrial/academic collaboration provides training for the graduate and undergraduate students in the field of biosensors, optical powering, chip design and wireless data communication and will motivate them to US industrial competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes  The aim of this NSF-SBIR project was to improve and develop crucial components of the Biorasis implantable glucose sensor platform.  This included the testing of a PVA/PLGA biocompatibility coating which is intended to reduce the body?s foreign body response, allowing the sensor to operate in-vivo for prolonged periods.  Sensors were tested both in-vitro and in-vivo   using rat and other animal models.  Sensor performance was analyzed and enhanced using an internal calibration routine.       In addition to sensor optimization we developed our proprietary smartwatch-like proximity communicator (see image) which wirelessly communicates with the implant to receive glucose data in real time.  Sensor data was communicated to a custom cellphone app using Bluetooth that  runs a noise reduction algorithm.  Furthermore, we addressed packaging methodology, to ensure that the implantable electronic circuits are protected from the body fluid, allowing long term operation.         Societal Impact  The development of the smallest and most accurate continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system to vastly improve the quality of life of diabetics and restore their active lifestyle. Diabetes has become a major health crisis in the United States and around the world.  It is estimated that 422 million people currently have diabetes in the world and it is projected that the number will increase to approximately 650 million by the year 2030.  Diabetes mellitus is the 6th leading cause of mortality globally.  If left untreated, Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) can cause complications including cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, amputation and damage to the eyes.
