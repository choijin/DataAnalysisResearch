<AbstractNarration>A team of three scientists from Kansas State University, Michigan State University and the Desert Botanical Garden will investigate polyploidy (the condition of having more than one set of chromosomes) and diversity in the plant genus Phlox (Polemoniaceae). The Phlox species P. amabilis, P. nana and P. woodhousei all exhibit variation in ploidy level and occur as diploid (two sets of chromosomes, 2X), tetraploid (4X) and hexaploid (6X) populations in the southwestern United States. Geographic patterns of ploidy level variation will be documented for these groups using flow cytometry and chromosome count data. By combining phylogenetic, population genetic, morphological, and ecological analyses the researchers will infer relationships among populations, reconstruct their origins, estimate patterns of gene flow, investigate the effect of polyploidy on phenotypes, and identify whether particular ploidy types are more commonly associated with different ecological niches. Data from these approaches will also be used to revise the taxonomy of the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While polyploidy is considered to play an important role in plant evolution, our current knowledge of ploidy level variation relative to diversity is limited. This project investigates questions of general interest on polyploidy and diversity and integrates findings to advance a broader understanding of the role of polyploidy in the diversification of plants. Educational modules relating incorporating this research will be developed for public school and botanical garden audiences, and participants from the undergraduate to postdoctoral level will benefit from training and collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

Polyploidy, the condition of having extra sets of chromosomes in cells, is a common phenomenon in flowering plants and is considered to play an important role in plant evolution. This research focused on several species of the plant genus <em>Phlox </em>distributed in the southwestern United States and applied multiple lines of evidence (including study of morphology, phylogenetics, population genetics and ecology) to improve our understanding of the effects of polyploidy on aspects of diversity. Scientific products included data sets documenting chromosome number, physical measurements of plant features, DNA sequences, and DNA variation at fine-scales across numerous populations; herbarium specimens documenting new and historic locations and supporting all data sets; and journal articles communicating research findings. Overall, this study highlighted substantial diversity associated with polyploidy in each species, underscoring the importance of recognizing ploidy level variation as an aspect of biodiversity. Work relating to Broader Impacts centered on educational activities and training. The research team worked collaboratively with public school teachers to develop and implement an educational module on polyploidy and diversity at the high school level. A botanical garden workshop for volunteers provided learning opportunities and, in turn, informal science education to a broad audience of garden visitors. A video on the research was developed for a general audience. Throughout the program, the project provided a strong, multidisciplinary training for one postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students and numerous undergraduate students.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/10/2017<br>      Modified by: Carolyn&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ferguson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258167/1258167_10241468_1499279062670_Phlox_nana_small--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258167/1258167_10241468_1499279062670_Phlox_nana_small--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Phlox nana"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258167/1258167_10241468_1499279062670_Phlox_nana_small--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Phlox nana"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Phlox nana, one of three focal species of Phlox exhibiting variation in ploidy levels across its distribution in the southwestern United States.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mark Mayfield</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Carolyn&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ferguson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Phlox nana</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
