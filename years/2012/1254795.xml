<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;PI Yi Zuo&lt;br/&gt;1254795&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pulmonary surfactant (PS) plays a crucial role in maintaining the normal respiratory mechanics by reducing the alveolar surface tension to near-zero. The research goal of this proposal is to study the biophysical mechanisms of PS and PS-drug interactions, using combined experimental and computational methods. There are 2 objectives: Objective 1. Study of biophysical mechanisms of natural pulmonary surfactant. Objective 2. Study of interactions between natural pulmonary surfactant and therapeutic agents (corticosteroids).&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies include combinations of state-of-the-art methods that are being used in novel ways to gain a complete understanding of the mechanisms involved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is important to the general public because it will provide new insight into the role that PS plays in health and disease, thus advancing neonatal care in the United States. The primary educational goal of this proposal is to improve participation and success of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and students from other underrepresented groups. The PI will also collaborate with the March of Dimes Foundation Hawaii Chapter to disseminate basic knowledge of prevention and management of preterm birth to Hawaiian youth.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Pulmonary surfactant plays a crucial role in maintaining the normal respiratory mechanics by reducing the alveolar surface tension to near-zero. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which the pulmonary surfactant films reach near-zero surface tension in the lungs are still unclear. A number of neonatal and adult respiratory diseases are found to be related to surfactant deficiency and/or dysfunction. Despite their success in treating premature newborns with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), animal-derived clinical surfactants alone have only limited success in treating other lung diseases, such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome in adult patients and the chronic lung disease in very preterm infants. It was found that clinical surfactants can be used as a carrier for delivering therapeutic agents into the lungs to treat diseases other than RDS. Nevertheless, how these drugs interact with surfactant and their potential inhibitory or synergetic effects on surfactant are still unknown. Therefore, the research goal of this proposal is to study the biophysical mechanisms of pulmonary surfactant and surfactant-drug interactions, using combined experimental and computational methods. This work is important to the general public because it provides new insight into the role that pulmonary surfactant plays in health and disease, thus helping advance neonatal and respiratory care in the United States.</p> <p class="Yi-Thesis-Heading-2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit:</span><strong> </strong>We have successfully achieved our research goal by accomplishing the following three innovative objectives. First, we have invented a novel instrument called the constrained drop surfactometer (CDS) that is capable of high-fidelity <em>in vitro</em> assessment of surfactant preparations (Image 1). The main advantage of CDS over existing methods is that it takes only a single droplet of the surfactant preparation for assessment. It makes possible to evaluate the surfactant samples extracted from individual mice. For the first time, using CDS, we have learned detailed biophysical mechanism by studying surfactant samples extracted from individual transgenic mice and by tracing single lamellar bodies of the pulmonary surfactant (Image 2). Knowledge obtained from this body of research shed light on pharmaceutical advances of the surfactant therapy. Second, using combined experimental and computational methods, we have revealed the detailed molecular mechanism by which the surfactant film interacts with inhalable drugs of various physicochemical properties. Most importantly, we have demonstrated the existence a biomolecular corona that we named the pulmonary surfactant corona, which modifies the biological identity of inhaled drug particles. Our research suggests that all studies of particle/drug inhalation, for the purpose of either designing pulmonary drug carrier or understanding inhalation toxicology, should consider the pulmonary surfactant corona (Image 3). This study provides direct translational knowledge to improve the efficacy and safety of surfactant therapy in pediatric and adult patients (Image 4). Third, we have invented the worlds first smart drop shape analysis technique that we named the closed-loop axisymmetric drop shape analysis (CL-ADSA). This method allows a full control of droplet oscillation so that it turns the traditional drop shape analysis from a surface tension measurement technique into a novel platform of performing chemical and biological experiments (Image 5). With combined CDS and CL-ADSA, we have performed the worlds first study of melting and freezing in two-dimension (Image 6). Our study has significantly advanced the current knowledge of surface thermodynamics, and provided novel insights into the understanding of a wide range of biophysicochemical phenomena in two-dimension.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts:</span> The broader impacts of this research project are multifarious and interdisciplinary. Understanding the biophysical mechanism of pulmonary surfactant helps expand the use of surfactants to treat various lung diseases and lay a solid foundation for developing less-expensive synthetic surfactant preparations. The study of interaction mechanism between surfactant and drugs is a necessary precautionary approach and a cost-effective measure for the development of new therapeutic interventions. This project also made a significant impact on technology transfer. The constrained drop surfactometer (CDS) developed in this project has become a transformative tool to evaluate pulmonary surfactant and other surface active materials. The CDS has been adopted by a number of hospitals and research labs worldwide, such as St. Joseph's Health Care London of Canada, and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. To date, this technique has demonstrated far-reaching impacts on a range of scientific and industrial fields, including physical chemistry, plant biology, biomaterial, thin-film, pediatrics, thermodynamics, and engineering. The educational activities are intimately integrated with the research objectives. Our project has provided opportunities of participation and success of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and students from other underrepresented groups. Through a wide range of research and outreach activities, innovative curriculum development, concept-based learning, and design of simple low-cost home experiments, our project has attracted a wide range of participants, from K-12 to graduate students, to learn fundamental knowledge of colloid and surface sciences.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/09/2019<br>      Modified by: Yi&nbsp;Zuo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1254795/1254795_10233424_1567473312042_Image-4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1254795/1254795_10233424_1567473312042_Image-4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 4.
