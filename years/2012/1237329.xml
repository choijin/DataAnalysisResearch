<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was intended for designing and organizing a workshop to help junior faculty from a diverse set of backgrounds to write successful CAREER proposals. While some junior faculty in the nation's research institutions receive mentoring and help when writing their CAREER proposals, some faculty are unware of the review criteria, review process, and the differences between regular and CAREER proposals.   The workshop is organized into three sessions. The first session is an information session which represented the experiences by CAREER award receipients. The second session was parallel mock panels, in which the participants were given a real panel experience. The third session was a question and answer session where the participants were free to ask questions to any of the program directors as well as the presenters from the first session.  The feedback from participants has indicated that the workshop has been very useful in organizing their thoughts and career plans to write a sucessful proposal.  The outcomes of this project are as follows:  (1) Educate juior faculty in how to organize thoughts and write a career proposal.  (2) Hold representative panels so junior faculty can have the experience from the reviewer's perspective.  (3) Hold Q&amp;A sessions so that junior faculty can ask specific questions regarding to their own case or ideas.  Participants came from a diverse background with 45% of participants being from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.
