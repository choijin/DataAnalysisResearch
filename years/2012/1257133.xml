<AbstractNarration>Nearly all living things, including humans, have daily biological rhythms. This "internal clock" helps regulate physiological and behavioral changes over the course of a twenty-four hour period.  This study will test the hypothesis that the internal clock conveys an advantage to individuals by allowing them to anticipate, and adjust to, changing conditions.  The project will explore connections between rhythms in aggression and wariness and the internal clock in orb-weaving spiders.  Spiders are a particularly good model organism for such work because they are both predators and prey, and, thus, must balance aggression and wariness to be successful.  Spiders are also practical because their behaviors are easily measured and experimentally altered.  Initially, this study will describe the relative influences of the internal clock and external cues of a variety of aggression-related behaviors. The role of brain chemistry and in regulating aggression will also be studied by measuring hormone levels in individuals.  Finally, this study will test how daily changes in aggression levels relate to changes in the organism's environment.  This work will provide much-needed insight into the regulation of behavioral rhythms, and how the environment influences them.  Along with gains in basic research, this project will provide substantial educational opportunities for students in the Southern Appalachian region.  This project will support three graduate students and provide six summer fellowships for undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is commonly assumed that circadian rhythms are adaptive, enabling the organism to perform each of its various functions, including behavior, at the most appropriate time of day with respect to its environment. In many cases, the possession of a circadian clock empowers the organism with the ability to anticipate important daily events in its ecosystem, such as the occurrences of food, potential mates, and predators. However, there are surprisingly few studies which have actually demonstrated an advantage to having a circadian clock.  In this study we set out to explore the ecology and underlying mechanisms of circadian rhythms in aggressiveness in spiders.  Spiders are particularly well-suited to test behavioral adaptiveness because they are both predators and prey themselves, and their behaviors are readily quantified in the lab and field.  Specific objectives of this project included: 1) to describe the chronobiology of web-building, activity, foraging, and antipredator behavior, in nocturnal and diurnal species, 2) to test the adaptiveness of rhythms in aggression/wariness, and 3) to begin to describe the mechanisms of rhythms in aggressiveness by quantifying potential changes in in their neurochemistry.  To date, we have determined the period of circadian clocks for eleven species of spiders by recording their locomotor activity when kept in constant darkness.  We are finding that most species have internal clocks that cycle at about 24 hours, which is typical and predicted by theory, as this would keep them in sync with the 24 hour daylength.  However, we have discovered a group of closely related species which have exceptionally short-period clocks of 17-19 hours.  These are the shortest known naturally occurring clocks, and are similar to laboratory created mutants in fruit flies.  We believe that these species can provide great insight into the ecology and underlying genetic mechanisms of the circadian clock.  We have also identified at what time of day the internal clock is ?reset? to re-sync with the natural cycle for three species (Zeitgebers), and how light at different times affects the timing of the internal clock (phase response).  Most studies of circadian biology have been conducted on a few ?model? laboratory species (e.g. fruit flies and mice).  This study offers the first of its kind comparison of related species collected from the wild and, thus, offers new insights into the role of the circadian clock.  To assess the adaptiveness of daily rhythms in aggression level, we combined data from field and laboratory studies into a comprehensive mathematical model.  Focusing on Cyclosa turbinata, a species which forages in its web both day and night, we measured how its overall boldness fluctuates over the course of a day, finding that they are generally bolder and more aggressive at night.  We also found that their behavioral response to the threat of a predator changes from day to night.  We measured daily cycles in availability of potential prey for the spiders, as well as potential predators of them.  We constructed a dynamic optimization model to calculate the relative value of prey items at different times of day, given that attacking prey in the light is more risky for spiders as it can attract the attention of predators.  The model predicted that the spiders would be more likely to ignore prey in their web late in the afternoon, and we confirmed this prediction with a field study.  We found that we can experimentally elevate and reduce the aggressiveness of spiders with neurochemicals (octopamine and serotonin respectively).  We hypothesized that the levels of these chemicals naturally fluctuate in the spiders over the course of the day, leading to the observed behavioral changes.  We analyzed the levels of these chemicals in both the brain and blood over the 24 hour cycle, and found no consistent changes which correlated with the behavioral changes (though levels did predict the individual aggressiveness of the spiders).  This led us to hypothesize that the spiders? sensitivity to the chemicals changes over the day.  A preliminary analysis of gene expression for associated receptor proteins suggests that this may be the case.  This study was a collaboration of three faculty from East Tennessee State University, an institution which serves the southern Appalachian region.  The grant supported summer research for six undergraduate students, as well as the work of three MS students, and one PhD. Student.
