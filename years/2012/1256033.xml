<AbstractNarration>A team of three lead scientists from The Morton Arboretum, Washington State University, and McGill University and 14 collaborating scientists from ten countries are undertaking a taxonomic revision of the flowering plant genus Carex, an ecologically and geographically widespread plant group with more than 2,000 species. The project will (1) develop new tools for online biodiversity data management; (2) solidify a broad international team through online collaboration, international field-collecting expeditions, and training of students and young researchers; (3) estimate the phylogenetic placement of ~1,360 species based on DNA sequences; (4) assemble a database of morphological, climatic, and biogeographic data; and (5) publish a revision of the higher level taxonomy of Carex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The taxonomy of global plant and animal groups provides information essential to species and habitat conservation, ecological restoration, and our understanding of biodiversity. This project will produce a phylogenetic framework for one of the largest flowering plant genera, providing an essential tool for understanding global plant biodiversity. At the same time, this project (1) trains the next generation of sedge taxonomists; (2) increases taxonomic readiness in students and teachers; (3) publishes diverse datasets online through eMonocot and Encyclopedia of Life; and (4) contributes to global biodiversity conservation through an enhanced barcoding resource and new informatic tools.</AbstractNarration>

Carex is among the four largest flowering plant genera worldwide and has not been revised globally since 1909. The classification within Carex ("sections") is the usual gateway into species identification in Carex, and researchers typically circumscribe Carex research projects according to sections. A revised sectional classification would greatly facilitate both conservation of and research on the genus.  Our specific themes and associated goals were:  Research Community and Tools: Create a virtual research environment for the Cyperaceae community &mdash; We collaborated with developers at ViBRANT/Scratchpads to develop new tools for data management and collaboration in a virtual research environment we have established for this project.
