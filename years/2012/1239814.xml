<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Principal Investigator on this project, Prof. Terence G. Langdon of USC, was selected to receive the 2012 Acta Materialia Gold Medal.  The award was presented at the European Materials Research Society Fall Meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in September 2012.  In connection with the award, a special symposium was arranged entitled "Recent Developments in the Processing and Properties of Ultrafine-Grained Materials."   This symposium was attended by most of the major researchers in the field of ultrafine-grained materials and selected papers from these presentations were subsequently published in a special issue of the Journal of Materials Science (Volume 48, Issue 13, 2013).  In addition, the P.I. gave the 2012 Acta Materialia Gold Medal Lecture.  This NSF award was provided to enable the P.I. and a female graduate student, Ms. Jittraporn Wongsa-Ngam, to travel to Warsaw and attend and participate in the conference.  This was an enriching experience for the graduate student because she was able to meet many of the major materials scientists in her field.  She also gave an oral presentation describing her research for a Ph.D. degree at USC.  The P.I. gave the 2012 Acta Materialia Gold Medal Lecture which was set up in a special afternoon award session attended by all participants at the meeting.  The result was an exceptionally good experience for both the P.I. and the graduate student.          Last Modified: 07/01/2013       Submitted by: Terence G Langdon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
