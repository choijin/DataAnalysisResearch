<AbstractNarration>This project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Mikhail Barybin of the University of Kansas will study charge delocalization and transport within the 2,6-azulenic framework. The approach is to synthesize novel azulenic and bis-azulenic molecules linearly terminated with isocyano, mercapto, or cyano groups; to form and characterize self-assembled monolayer (SAM) films and nanografted patterns of these compounds on metal surfaces; to synthesize and study discrete metal complexes of these ligands to understand the ligand interactions with metal ions; and to probe the conductivity of the azulenic and bis-azulenic SAM films  The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students in an interdisciplinary research environment, developing a new freshman honors course on the "Nanotech Revolution," and working with Northeastern State University (a predominantly Native American student institution) to bring students to the University of Kansas for undergraduate research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computing using molecules has the potential to generate ultrasmall devices that use little power; however, many significant technical hurdles must be overcome to realize the benefits of molecular level devices.  This work will further our understanding how molecules transport charges between two contacts and will afford novel platforms for developing advanced materials relevant to a variety of nanotechnological areas, including organic electronics.   Such work could also impact the design of solar cells, molecular switches, and conducting polymers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Transporting electric charge by using molecules offers the potential of designing ultra-small devices that use very little power.  However, many fundamental technical hurdles must be addressed in order to realize practical benefits of molecular level devices.  In this project, Professor Barybin?s research group at the University of Kansas employed atom-economical isocyano (-N&equiv;C), and mercapto (-SH) "alligator clips" to harness conducting, azulene-based organic molecules to electron-rich metal atoms and surfaces.  Azulene is a molecular diode comprised of fused 5- and 7-membered carbon rings.  The resulting novel platforms furthered our understanding of how molecular bridges can delocalize and transport charges between metal termini (contacts).  The quantitative insights into tuning electronic characteristics of azulenic and polyazulenic molecular wires that emerged from these NSF-sponsored investigations will facilitate the design of new functional materials relevant to organic electronics applications (e.g., molecular rectifiers), solar cells, and molecular switches.   The broader impacts of this project include training of graduate and undergraduate students in a collaborative interdisciplinary research environment, developing and implementing a new freshman honors course "Chemistry in the Context of Nanotech (R)evolution," and providing summer research experiences to six undergraduates, three of whom are members of the underrepresented minorities (two Hispanic and one African-American).  In addition, the PI and his team donated a diverse collection of samples of azulenic substances prepared in this project for use in the inquiry-driven Lab "Tuning Color through Substitution at the Azulenic Ring," which is a part of the honors general chemistry curriculum at the University of Kansas. Our freshman students have been excited to have the opportunity of exploring "real" research compounds synthesized at their own institution.
