<AbstractNarration>Developers and researchers at the Illinois Institute of Technology and Iowa State University are initiating an innovative approach to pre-K students' development of quantitative reasoning through measurement. This quantitative approach builds on measurement concepts and algebraic design of the pre-numeric stage of instruction found in the Elkonin-Davydov (E-D) elementary mathematics curriculum from Russia. The project team is adapting and refocusing the conceptual framework and learning tasks of the E-D pre-numeric stage for use with four-year-olds. The adaptation is being done in collaboration with experts in Russia who were involved in the original E-D development.  A primary goal of the project is to obtain a proof-of-concept and lay down a conceptual and empirical foundation for a subsequent research and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research progresses using teaching experiments involving six students.  Each student is engaged in 15 minute one-on-one sessions twice each week.  Sessions are videotaped and transcribed for further analysis.  The analysis of the data is conducted by the project team in collaboration with Russian consultants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research findings and methodology will provide grounds for supporting more complex and sophisticated mathematical ideas that will inform curriculum development for pre-K students and teachers.  Results will be published and reported widely.</AbstractNarration>
