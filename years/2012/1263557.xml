<AbstractNarration>This project plans to combine two capabilities, the tunable atom-like electronic quantum states of nanostructured materials and ultrashort-pulsed laser sources based on fiber-optics, to provide a route to making nanostructure materials economically and efficiently. The versatility of this approach is a major driver of the project: condensation of nanoparticles from a femtosecond laser-generated plasma can produce nanoparticles of essentially any material deposited as a thin film, including semiconductors and different kinds of metals that are useful for energy-critical applications. This versatility is the key to developing a wide range of applications for a variety of users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research may provide a new route to achieving the goal of inexpensively fabricating nanopartical films in sufficient density and quantity or industrial-scale applications.  Sustainable, environmentally friendly, affordable, energy supply is challenge facing today's society. New materials development can be essential to this task; for example, efficient solar energy harvesting, by catalytic splitting of water molecules or by photovoltaic power generation could benefit greatly from cost-effective materials for utilizing renewable energy. Research conducted through this project may serve as the basis for a scalable technological solution to the need for energy-critical materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the project was to identify new markets for our FemtofilmTM technology, a new materials capability based on the ability of femtosecond lasers to create coatings of nanoparticles in thin-film form.   An i-Corps team was formed for this purpose consisting of the Principal Investigator, a graduate student Entrepreneurial Lead, and a Business Mentor.  After completing the NSF  i-Corps training program at Georgia Tech in Fall 2012,  including extensive customer discovery interviews, the team developed a value proposition and a business canvas to address market opportunities in the energy storage sector.  As part of the i-Corps process, the team took every opportunity to proactively seek out potential customers, including attending workshops,  conferences, trade shows,  and visiting industrial sites where advanced manufacturing and R&amp;D is being pursued in the energy sector. The participants in this project developed a strong sense of what is needed to identify commercial opportunities and customer needs, as well as an appreciation of what it takes to bring a product to market. We found the i-Corps approach to be extremely informative as to all aspects of commercializing important  research discoveries.   As a result of this experience, the team has formed a start-up company, Vanova Technologies (VT),  and  begun to develop investor interest.  The development of the ultrafast laser, especially fiber lasers, has opened the doors to new and exciting fields of research as well as a viable platform for laser-based manufacturing technology.  VT is currently pursuing SBIR funding opportunities as well as internal funding through the University of Michigan and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.  A patent application has been submitted and further invention disclosures are in process. Prototype energy storage devices with superior charge acceptance characteristics have been constructed and are undergoing scale-up testing.   A recent joint initiative has been signed between the University of Michigan Energy Institute and Ford Research Laboratories to build a new battery testing facility. These capabilities will be critical for the success of the commercialization effort going forward.       Last Modified: 10/30/2013       Submitted by: Roy Clarke]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
