<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of Michigan (UM) that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013-2015.  The program will expose students to the nature of interdisciplinary research.  Participants will be engaged in hands-on experimental training and independent investigation in the areas of biochemistry, biophysics, cheminformatics, enzymology, molecular biology and plant biology.  The research projects featured in this program all involve studies of the structure and function of proteins and are representative of seven departments at UM, which further emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the training offered.  In addition to the research experience, students will participate in a series of weekly enrichment seminars focusing on ethics and scientific integrity, scientific communication, graduate school admissions and scientific career options.  Opportunities for integration into the UM research community will be provided through periodic meetings with REU faculty mentors, graduate students, and undergraduate students from other UM summer research programs.  It is hoped that the REU experience will promote persistence in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines at the undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels.  Students will be recruited from across the nation via email postings, website listings and announcements at local/national conferences.  Undergraduate students, who are US Citizens or Permanent Residents, majoring in a STEM discipline will be considered eligible for participation.  Applicants will be selected based on their potential for research and their interest in obtaining a graduate degree in a STEM discipline.  Special consideration will be given to individuals who are from underrepresented ethnic/racial groups or from institutions with limited resources for research.  Students from community colleges and those with no previous research experience will also be given special consideration.  All participants will receive housing, meal and travel allowances and a stipend.  The Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA), available to BIO-funded REU PIs, will be the primary summative evaluation tool.  Electronic tracking surveys will be sent to program alumni annually to determine their current level of engagement in the STEM disciplines.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Interdisciplinary REU Program in the Structure and Function of Proteins (IREU) at the University of Michigan (UM) was initiated in 2009 and is designed to expose students to the nature of interdisciplinary research around studies of protein structure and function.  This report provides details regarding outcomes for the 2013-2015 award period.  Information regarding 3 students from the 2016 cohort who were supported on this award as part of a no-cost extension are also provided.  Each year the IREU program recruits 10 students from across the nation to participate in a ten-week summer research experience at the University of Michigan.  The projects featured span a variety of disciplines (e.g. biochemistry, biophysics, cheminformatics, molecular biology and plant biology) and are representative of seven departments at the University of Michigan, which further emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the research training offered.    The objectives of the Interdisciplinary REU Program are to: 1) enhance the educational experience of program participants, 2) assist program participants in confirming and clarifying their educational and career goals and 3) encourage participants to pursue graduate (M.S./Ph.D.) degrees and careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines.   In support of these objectives, students are provided with:  An interdisciplinary research      experience Fundamental principles of      effective oral &amp; written communication in science First-hand exposure to the culture      of graduate school Information regarding the graduate      school application process Opportunities to interact with      peers, graduate students and faculty members      Key outcomes:  A program website and flier were used to promote the IREU Program broadly on national websites, at undergraduate conferences and via emails to ~300 contacts nationwide. These recruitment efforts resulted in an average of 354 applications from over 46 states.  Approximately 24% of the applications were from students from underrepresented ethnic/racial groups.  The importance of scientific communication (oral and written) was emphasized through seminars and mandatory assignments.  Upon completion of the program, students were strongly encouraged to present their research at local, regional and national conferences. IREU students from the 2013-2015 cohorts collectively made 16 research presentations and 2 students were listed as co-authors on publications in peer-reviewed journals.  The Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA) tool was used to assess the level of educational enhancement of the students.  The 2013-2015 students consistently reported high gains in their "ability to work independently" and in their "confidence in their ability to do research."  With regard to overall program impact, 100% of the students, who provided feedback, attributed the IREU Program to helping them to confirm, clarify or alter their educational and career goals.   With regard to persistence in STEM disciplines, 25 (83%) of the 30 NSF-funded students over this award period are currently pursuing PhD degrees (17), industrial careers (6) or additional training (2) in a STEM discipline.  As mentioned above, 3 students from the 2016 cohort were funded on this award as part of a no-cost extension.  Two of these funded students were attending community colleges at the time of their application to the program and have since transferred to 4 year institutions. The third student funded from this cohort will begin PhD studies in a STEM discipline this fall.  One of the intended broader impacts of the program is to provide research experiences to students from institutions with limited resources for research and to those who are from underrepresented ethnic/racial groups and disadvantaged backgrounds.  The program has achieved success in this regard as 80% of the students involved in the program over the 2013-2015 award period have been from institutions with limited resources for research. Additionally, 14 (46%) of the students served have been from underrepresented ethnic/racial groups (Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, Native American or Alaskan/Pacific Islander) and a total of 10 (33%) were 1st generation college students and 14 (46%) self-reported as being economically disadvantaged. The 3 students from the 2016 cohort were all from institutions with limited resources for research and two were from underrepresented ethnic/racial groups.  With funding from a UM Faculty Allies for Diversity grant, the infrastructure of the REU program was leveraged to provide support to an additional 13 students over the award period. These students were fully funded (stipend, housing, meals and travel) by other program sources (e.g. NIH MARC-USTAR - Maximizing Access to Research Careers &ndash; Undergraduate Student Training in Academic Research - Program) and the grant covered miscellaneous program expenses. This effort allowed us to serve an additional 7 students who were from underrepresented ethnic/racial groups or who self-reported as being economically disadvantaged.  An additional outcome was that a significant number of students from these cohorts (10 NSF-funded and 4 non-NSF funded) decided to pursue PhD studies at the University of Michigan and 2 students transferred to UM to complete their undergraduate studies.  Each year IREU alumni at UM are invited to various program events to meet the current IREU students.           Last Modified: 09/05/2017       Submitted by: Cherie R Dotson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
