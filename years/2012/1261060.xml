<AbstractNarration>The research team includes researchers at Caltech and Virginia Tech with expertise in Economics and Cognitive Neuroscience.  They will study how the human brain works when faced with the tasks that are part of buying and selling in asset markets.   They plan to use lab experiments with market designs that encourage the formation of market bubbles, periods where the price paid for an asset is well above the actual value of the asset.  They want to determine whether traders who buy at high "bubble" prices are systematically different than other more cautious buyers.  They will use brain imaging techniques and analyze the resulting data to test whether neural activity can predict how large a bubble will become and how long it will last.  Because market bubbles can have serious consequences on the broader economy, understanding more about the possible causes of bubbles is important for financial market regulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project studies the behavioral ecology of trader types, predictive 'decoding' of when bubbles will form and crash, and neural activity during bubbles.  For economics, the project contributes to our scientific understanding of bubble dynamics by helping us understand why and how people participate in bubbles.  For cognitive neuroscience, studying asset prices is one way to advance the science of understanding how the brain computes a complex dynamic value that changes over time depending on the reactions of others.  The combination of behavioral observation and neural measures will give us data that will help us better understand how emotions such as 'irrational exuberance', social influences like 'herd behavior', and momentum trading all affect asset markets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Public Outcome Report for NSF Grant Understanding and Predicting Asset Price Bubbles from Brain Activity        There have been multiple periods in history where a seeming "irrational exuberance" has gripped investors and resulted in the prices of stocks or other assets soaring to levels believed to be way above "fundamental value." Such episodes are referred to "asset price bubbles." Asset price bubbles are a major concern for both policy makers and the general public. Indeed, it is generally agreed that asset price bubbles - and their bursting - have contributed to depressions or recessions (for example 1929, 2000, 2008).     While asset price bubbles are a major concern and a substantial literature has been devoted to them, many major questions remain about their causes and dynamics. A major gap in our understanding is to what extent do characteristics of human cognition and decision-making contribute to the formation, sustenance, and bursting of bubbles. In particular little is known about how the function of the human brain is connected to bubble dynamics.     The overall goal of this project was to begin to fill in this gap in our knowledge about bubbles through the use of experimental market experiments in humans designed to generate (or replicate) price bubbles in an experimental "stock" while simultaneously monitoring the brains of the subjects through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). What we have found so far is that areas of the brain related to reward processing are active while the bubble is building and that low earners' tendency to buy the stock is related to this activity, but that in high earners areas of the brain related to tracking risk are active right before the peak of the bubble.     We have also developed a database (behavior and brain imaging) of approximately 100 people making decisions in a replay of the markets generated experimentally. So far, the results from the replay version replicate the results from the actual experimental market, and also show promising preliminary new results, showing that this database will be invaluable in furthering our knowledge of the relationship between human brain function and bubble formation and bursting.
