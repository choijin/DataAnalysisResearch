<AbstractNarration>In 1995, several hundred municipalities in the southern state of Oaxaca, Mexico, formally gained the right to govern themselves autonomously, according to local customs based on indigenous communal traditions. This political development may represent one of the most extensive experiments with indigenous autonomy in all of Latin America, given the degree of autonomy granted, its formal-legal nature, and the sheer number of citizens involved (approximately 1.25 million Mexicans, just over 1% of the national population, now live under "traditional" local governments). No other Mexican state has ever replicated the Oaxacan reform, and even in Oaxaca autonomy was granted only selectively, to a subset of the state's indigenous communities. This has resulted in a complex mosaic of local political institutions, in which some indigenous-majority towns are governed by local custom, while others are not.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars and policy makers have divergent views about the effects of this type of political arrangement. Proponents of the Oaxacan reform, for example, argued that autonomy would help maintain strong communal attachments in indigenous communities, thus protecting their languages and cultures while reconciling local political customs with state and federal political institutions. Yet for the most part these claims have not been tested against empirical facts, and there is some reason to be skeptical that autonomy has had purely salutary effects. To give just two examples: some scholars have argued that autonomy would increase the power of local strongmen while inhibiting the federal government's ability to protect individual rights. Others have speculated that the Oaxacan reform might harm indigenous communities in the long run by exposing indigenous customs to greater federal scrutiny and oversight. Importantly, these specific claims about the effects of local autonomy in Mexico are also applicable to other areas in which federal governments might consider (or might have already implemented) autonomy arrangements for indigenous minorities, including in the United States and Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is associated with its intensive study of institutions in multi-ethnic societies. While many countries are faced with the challenge of integrating minority groups into the larger political system in a way that is respectful and acceptable to both, the nature of the political reforms in Oaxaca has created a particularly good research setting for investigating the effects of different strategies for integration. In a narrow sense, this research will determine whether or not local autonomy in the Mexican context actually confers several of the effects that are commonly attributed to it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the study extend from its focus on how political institutions can protect or harm the rights and cultures of ethnic minority groups. The results of this research project should interest scholars and policy-makers in countries that struggle with the types of political conflict common to multiethnic societies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project has been to understand the effects of institutional heterogeneity among southern Mexico?s local governments, many of which are indigenous communities that have autonomy to use traditional forms of governance.  The partial and complex nature of institutional reforms in the region has provided a valuable opportunity to bring empirical evidence to bear on theoretical debates about the merits of autonomy, because institutional practices vary in a context where many other factors hold constant.  If we think of a national government?s stance towards ethnic minority communities on a spectrum running from strict assimilation and conformity on one end, to self-determination and respect for cultural difference on the other end, the current institutional arrangement in southern Mexico falls closer to the multicultural end of the spectrum.  Have the consequences been salutary?    To find out, I conducted extensive research over a period of five years.  The research included fieldwork in the southern states of Puebla and Oaxaca.  I interviewed mayors, state government officials, and leaders of political parties.  I visited numerous indigenous communities and met with their local leaders.  I put together a team of Mexican students to help me conduct social experiments at several field sites, and I contracted with a firm from Mexico City to collect survey data in a larger set of cases.  With the help of several Syracuse University graduate students, I also collected statistical data from state and federal government agencies.    Not all of these research efforts were as successful as I had hoped.  In particular, the lab-in-field experiments proved impossible to complete in a satisfactory manner, both because of unanticipated difficulties in organizing the research team, and because unstable political conditions arose in several field sites and made continued fieldwork impossible.  Nevertheless, the bulk of the proposed research was completed without complication, and has resulted in a wealth of research material that I will continue to examine for many years.  In particular, I have compiled 1) extensive field notes describing local political practices; 2) official records of electoral processes and oversight by state government agencies; 3) a public opinion survey dataset taken in a total of nine field sites across the two states; and 4) a statistical dataset recording political, social, economic, and demographic data for over 2,400 Mexican municipalities, with sub-municipal data collected in some instances.  Most of these data will eventually be made available for other scholars to use as well.  In terms of the substantive findings of this research effort, additional analysis remains to be done.  But I have found evidence that granting autonomy to indigenous communities in southern Mexico can have a variety of noteworthy effects.  Among others things, I can report the following.  Some evidence shows that autonomy does enhance the ability of local governments to provide public services to their citizens.  However, the data also show that in many cases, autonomy can cause political conflict in communities that did not have well-established political traditions in place prior to the granting of autonomy.  Other evidence shows that autonomy can actually challenge the continuation of traditional political practices by subjecting those practices to the scrutiny of federal law; most notably, practices of female political exclusion have been profoundly undermined by state and federal courts.
