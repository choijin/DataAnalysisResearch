<AbstractNarration>This is an award for the replacement of an aging master oscillator in the sodium wind/temperature lidar at the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO), located in Cerro Pach√≥n, Chile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ALO is an upper atmosphere observatory that houses the Na lidar, several airglow instruments, and a nearby meteor radar. The suite of instruments provides comprehensive measurements of the upper atmosphere (80-110 km) in a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The master oscillator to be replaced is a Ring Dye Laser that has reached the end of its useful lifetime after 20 years. The new frequency-doubled, high power, tunable diode laser will be easier to operate, more reliable, and less expensive to operate.  The measurement made by the sodium lidar is a key component for the investigation of wave dynamics in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere over the Andes Mountains.  With other co-located remote sensing instruments, the ALO will provide the most detailed study to date of the characteristics of instabilities, gravity waves, tides, planetary waves and mean winds in the southern hemisphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increased reliability and lower operational cost directly translate to more data collected, which will enable and enhance these research activities.  The upgrade will not only make it possible to enhance ALO research projects, but will also provide new education and training opportunities for students expanding their exposure to upper atmosphere research. In addition, unique opportunities exist for international collaborations including El Leoncito, Argentina and the University of Adelaide, Australia. The data collected at ALO will be available to the scientific community for research on a wide range of scientific topics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A sodium Lidar is a ground-based remote sensing instrument that uses laser to probe the atmosphere and measure temperature, wind and sodium density in the altitude range of typically 80-105 km (50-65 miles).  This measurement is very important for scientists to understand the state of the atmosphere in this region, and how it varies over time.  Many atmospheric waves are known to be propagating in this region, and generate disturbances that can affect the ionosphere above, which affect radio wave propagation and satellite communication.  These waves also affect the atmosphere below and the data is an important piece of information to understand the global atmosphere system.  The sodium lidar relies on accurate, stable lasers to operate propertly.  One of the lasers in the lidar system at the Andes Lidar Observatory is over 25 years old and was becoming very diffucult to maintain.  This grant supported the replacement of this laser with a newer, much more stable, and easier to operate solid state laser, as well as other upgrades in various parts of the lidar system. This upgrade was carried out successfully in May 2014.  After the upgrade, the lidar became much more reliable and easier to operate.  Instead of a two-person operation before the upgrade, the upgraded system only reuires one person, therefor saving in operation cost.  In the six observational campaigns conducted after the upgrade, there was almost no downtime due to instrument problem, which was quite frequent before the upgrade.  As a result, many more hours of data were collected, and the data are also of much higher quality because of the improved efficiency in the lidar system in retrieving signals.  This significantly improved sodium lidar system has already resulted in several new scientific findings.  One example is the detection of weak sodium signals at even higher altitude, up to 150 km (93 miles) altitude.  The existence of such sodium is intriging and is of great interest to scientists.  It also enables the sodium lidar to extend the range of temperature and wind measurement up to 140 km (87 miles).  This significantly incraeses the capability of the sodium lidar by more than doubling its measurement range.  The higher quality data also enables research of smaller scale disturbances that were not possible to detect before.
