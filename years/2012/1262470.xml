<AbstractNarration>The University of New Hampshire and the University of California, Davis are awarded a grant to develop a Research Coordination Network focused on eukaryotic biodiversity research using high-throughput sequencing (RCN EukHiTS). Microscopic eukaryote species (organisms &lt;1mm, such as nematodes, fungi, protists, etc.) are abundant and ubiquitous-yet invisible to the naked eye-in every ecosystem on earth. The biodiversity and geographic distributions for most of these species are largely unknown, and represent one of the major knowledge gaps in biology. High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies now allow for deep examination of virtually all microscopic organisms present in an environmental sample. For microbial eukaryote taxa, en masse biodiversity assessment using traditional loci (rRNA genes) can be conducted at a fraction of the time and cost required for traditional (morphological) approaches. Despite this promise, current bottlenecks include the lack of useful distributed tools for analysis and common data standards to allow global comparisons across individual studies as well as missing links between molecules and morphology. The EukHiTS RCN will focus on developing community capabilities for computational approaches focused on eukaryotic taxa and the infrastructure, both cyber and human, needed for effective interpretation of large high-throughput datasets. The steering committee of RCN EukHiTS includes expertise from computational biology, functional genomics, computer science, taxonomy, ecology, database resource management, and representatives of end&amp;#8208;user communities to ensure that all aspects of the community are well-represented. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RCN EukHiTs will offer extensive scientific outreach, education and training, including a heavy focus on technology and social media tools. Key network activities will be devoted to training the next generation of scientists to take up the challenges of global biodiversity assessment; a strong focus on undergraduate opportunities ("Bioinformatics Bootcamps" and institutional research exchanges) will enable students to develop their research skill set through interdisciplinary training, and gain career insight though planned social interactions with established researchers at different career stages. Research coordination activities will include yearly catalysis meetings (held as satellite events to well-attended, interdisciplinary scientific conferences), working groups, and RCN-sponsored conference symposia. An RCN portal website will disseminate RCN activities and inform the wider community of eukaryotic biodiversity research priorities and long-term goals. Similarly, web-based content, including blog posts and Twitter feeds, will serve to engage public audiences and raise awareness of new DNA sequencing technologies and the role of microbial eukaryotes in natural ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the course of this award, bioinformatics training was provided in 12 different workshops, with 373 participants.  Two of the workshops were conducted with a focus on training underrepresented undergraduate students in bioinformatics, as well as mentoring two faculty sponsors in their endeavors to integrate bioinformatics into their curricula at their home institutions.  The participants in the other 10 workshops had a variety of education and experience levels (undergraduate, Master’s, Ph.D., and faculty) and focused on the development and application of bioinformatics tools for understanding eukaryotic biodiversity.  Workshops focused specifically on bringing together researchers doing molecular work with researchers with expertise in morphological identification to foster the development of multidisciplinary collaborations to advance inclusive expertise in the field.     In addition to the workshops described above, two symposia for Ecometagenomics were held at the national/international Ecological Society meetings and were attended by ~225 participants.  Drs. Thomas and Bik gave 19 invited lectures over the course of the award in addition to conducting the workshops described above.       The PIs published 1 book chapter and 3 peer reviewed manuscripts.  From the final EukHiTS workshop in 2019 (31 attendees), a review paper and white paper are currently being prepared for submission by the core organizers and attendees that have been involved throughout the project and shaped the narrative of the workshops and meetings.     During the last 5 years, RCN EukHiTS has focused on developing community resources and infrastructure for the effective interpretation of large, high-throughput datasets generated for microscopic eukaryotic species.  The target cohort for the training and education in the application of various "-omics", bioinformatics, and other technologies will impact the future of how these technologies and resources are applied in the future.  For the participants (both students and faculty mentors), understanding how these technologies affect downstream aspects of everyday life, biomedical relevance, and societal implications will be critical to the ongoing development of future leaders I these research areas, as well as education and training future policy makers about the applications and impacts of these technologies.
