<AbstractNarration>The Sustainable Futures North project addresses the question of whether synergies can be found among the related goals of food security, water security, energy security, and resource development in the North American Arctic. Historically, development in one or more of these areas has presented trade-offs in others; for example, petroleum exploration and development is often associated with negative impacts on traditional subsistence species and practices. Similarly, residents of the Bristol Bay region of Alaska are currently embroiled in a debate over the risks and benefits of developing of a copper and gold mine, which would ostensibly provide jobs and economic development opportunities, at the headwaters of a watershed that supports the world?s largest sockeye salmon run. With an eye toward eliciting best practices for community development and resource management that target synergies rather than trade-offs, we plan to combine integrated regional assessments of water, food, and energy systems in three regions of the North: Bristol Bay (Alaska), Baffin Island (Canada), and Kotzebue Sound (Alaska), where people and communities share a variety of challenges relating to climate change, socioeconomic change, and industrial development. The research methods that make up our interdisciplinary toolkit include key informant interviews, integration and analysis of secondary datasets, climate change downscaling, engineering best practice and gap analysis, and rural-urban network analysis. We will link these qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore cause-and-effect relationships between development activities and societal and environmental changes, and will integrate social and ecological datasets with climate change scenarios to project future community responses to climatic and environmental change. The findings of this research will inform a collaborative education and outreach program designed to build capacity through workforce development, STEM internships, and post-secondary curricula and programs in environmental management and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>As a contribution to the interdisciplinary Sustainable Futures North (SFN) project, researchers at the University of New Hampshire built and analyzed a database containing demographic and environmental information on 43 predominantly Indigenous towns and villages (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). The complete database, and also a "graphical library" visualizing yearly population changes in each of the 43 communities from 1990 through 2016 (one example in<strong> Figure 2</strong>), have been archived and published online.<br /><br />Analysis of this place/year database led to a number of discoveries:<br /><br />Many Alaska towns and villages face serious threats from erosion and flooding caused by thawing permafrost, and shorter ice seasons protecting their shorelines. These problems, linked to Arctic warming and climate change, pose risks not only for infrastructure such as housing and water supplies, but also for safety in the event of a storm. Government relocation efforts are not yet in place, but in the meantime the populations of some threatened communities continue growing -- so there are more people at risk. We find no detectable difference in outmigration rates from at-risk and other communities (<strong>Figure 3</strong>); "climigration" (climate-driven migration) does not appear to be happening yet.<br /><br />Contrary to some predictions, our data also show no increase in outmigration following the oil price rise and global recession of 2008 (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). Many Alaska Arctic communities exhibit patterns of net outmigration (more people leaving than moving in), but these are offset by higher rates of natural increase (more people born than dying), so that overall their populations grow slowly.<br /><br />The Alaska pattern of high outmigration, high natural increase, and slow growth contrasts with two other predominantly Inuit northern regions: Greenland, and the Canadian territory of Nunavut. Greenland municipalities instead show a pattern of high outmigration, low natural increase, and consequently population decline across all but three municipalities. Nunavut exhibits a third pattern: little outmigration, high natural increase, and consequently rapid population growth.&nbsp; <strong>Figure 5</strong> plots the quite different rates of population change among communities in these three regions. <strong>Figure 6</strong> graphs the overall result of contrasting growth rates.<br /><br />Disproportionately higher outmigration rates for locally born women lead to imbalanced sex ratios (relatively, too many men) in many small northern communities. This pattern, first observed several decades ago in data from Arctic Alaska, remains evident for Alaska and Greenland communities today.<br /><br />More discussion of these results, with details on data and methods, can be found in two open-access research articles:</p> <p>Hamilton, L.C., K.
