Topics of interest for the series of symposia include the primacy of biological materials to the development of biomaterials and biomimetic materials, novel applications, and understanding the complex structure-property relationships of these materials.  This year the symposium will encompass the following themes:  biological materials (tissues, cells, etc.), biomaterials (implants), biomimetic materials, bio-enabled materials and systems, and bio-based applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  The symposium provides a forum in which materials scientists working in the areas biological materials, biomaterials, and biomimetic materials can report on recent advances in the field.  The funds requested from NSF will support the attendance of students and young faculty who will make presentations at the Symposium.  Travel awards will be made to attendees from this group on the basis of abstracts submitted prior to the symposium.</AbstractNarration>
