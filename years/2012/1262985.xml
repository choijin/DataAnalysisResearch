<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Johns Hopkins University that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students for summers 2013-2017.  The organizing scientific theme for this intense and immersive research program is the application of imaging and structural techniques to achieve better understanding of biological systems.  In the course of pursuing a research project, students will be exposed to reading scientific literature, designing experiments and controls, learning various experimental techniques, and collecting and analyzing data.  In addition, students will engage in activities designed to improve oral and written communication skills as they build a sense of community.  Students will be instructed in the responsible conduct of research and will be expected to conduct their research accordingly.  Participants will be recruited nationally through the NSF REU website, informational booths at SACNAS and ABRCMS meetings, and contacts at various institutions across the country and in US territories, in addition to the program website.  Students having limited research opportunities at their home institutions, or belonging to groups underrepresented in academics will be especially encouraged to apply.  Selection will be based on recommendation letters, grades, and statements of research interest and career goals.  Following the program, participants will be contacted annually to determine their progress toward a degree, their career plans, and enrollment in graduate or professional school.  Outcomes of the program will be determined using a common assessment tool.  Information about the program may be obtained from the director, Joel Schildbach (phone: 410-516-0176; e-mail: joel@jhu.edu), or at the program web site (http://www.bio.jhu.edu/BioREU).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The original application, submitted to NSF in 2012 and funded as DBI-1262985, included the following:          Objectives of the REU Site (Targeted Student Participants):  This REU Site provides quality research experiences for students from predominantly undergraduate institutions and from groups (ethnic, economic, first generation of family in higher education) underrepresented in scientific research and academe.       During thefunding period of DBI-1262985, our site hosted 5 summer sessions of 10 students each.  Of the 50 students participating, 60% were from groups underrepresented in science and over 50% were from institutions that do not offer PhDs.  All told, over 85% of the participants were from at least one of our target groups.     Two measures we set to determine the success of the program were the frequency with which participants engaged in subsequent research, and the frequency with which participants pursue graduate studies in science. By these metrics, the program is clearly successful.  As of the last check, of the students in the five cohorts, a very large majority report engaging in subsequent research experiences, either at their home institutions or in other summer programs.  Of the 50, 7 are still undergraduates.  Of the 43 graduates, 28 subsequently enrolled in Ph.D. programs at schools including Johns Hopkins University, Emory University, University of Pennsylvania, Virginia Tech, University of Connecticut, University of Colorado, University of California-Davis, University of Minnesota, University of Utah and North Carolina State.  Five are in professional (medical, dental, pharmacy) school.  Two at last report were in postbac research programs, three were applying to graduate programs, one was applying to physical therapy programs, two were working as lab technicians, and another working as a computer programmer. One has not responded to attempts at contact. In sum, the large majority of REU participants pursued subsequent biomedical education, most of those in biology Ph.D. programs.
