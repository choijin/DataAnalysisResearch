<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small-Business/ ERC Collaborative Opportunity (SECO) grant will help ePack, Inc., commercialize the Environmental Resistant Package (ERP), which is a platform technology developed in the Wireless Integrated Microsystems (WIMS) Engineering Research Center (ERC). Microsensors (as well as many other electronic components) are fragile and sensitive to particles moisture, vibration, shock and temperature changes in the environment. Packaging therefore is a key factor for protecting these device in real world applications and therefore for their commercialization. In fact, packaging is one of the biggest limiting factors for the commercialization of new microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is why ePack was founded and then fully spun out of the WIMS-ERC at the University of Michigan (U of M) in 2010 and has an exclusive license for the patent on the ERP technology. The ERP technology enables vacuum packaging, vibration isolation and low power oven control of devices. The purpose of this SECO grant is to prototype commercial inertial sensors and oscillators in the ERP in order to demonstrate 10 / 100 times improved vibration resistance or temperature stability (and therefore that level of improved performance) in several different application areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact (Applications of the Technology)&lt;br/&gt;This will enable a next generation of cost efficient, high performance and high reliability applications including: handheld navigation systems for firefighters and troops; navigation of unmanned air vehicles for police, military and commercial applications; motion control for industrial robots; and mobile broadband for commercial trucks and small jets.</AbstractNarration>
