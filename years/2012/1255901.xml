<AbstractNarration>A team of three lead scientists from The Morton Arboretum, Washington State University, and McGill University and 14 collaborating scientists from ten countries are undertaking a taxonomic revision of the flowering plant genus Carex, an ecologically and geographically widespread plant group with more than 2,000 species. The project will (1) develop new tools for online biodiversity data management; (2) solidify a broad international team through online collaboration, international field-collecting expeditions, and training of students and young researchers; (3) estimate the phylogenetic placement of ~1,360 species based on DNA sequences; (4) assemble a database of morphological, climatic, and biogeographic data; and (5) publish a revision of the higher level taxonomy of Carex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The taxonomy of global plant and animal groups provides information essential to species and habitat conservation, ecological restoration, and our understanding of biodiversity. This project will produce a phylogenetic framework for one of the largest flowering plant genera, providing an essential tool for understanding global plant biodiversity. At the same time, this project (1) trains the next generation of sedge taxonomists; (2) increases taxonomic readiness in students and teachers; (3) publishes diverse datasets online through eMonocot and Encyclopedia of Life; and (4) contributes to global biodiversity conservation through an enhanced barcoding resource and new informatic tools.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this 4-year project, collaborators at The Morton Arboretum, Washington State University, McGill University, and institutions from more than 10 other countries investigated the evolutionary history of the genus <em>Carex</em>, the sedges. The genus <em>Carex </em>is remarkably diverse, with approximately 2000 species worldwide, making it arguably the most widespread and ecologically significant flowering plant genus in the northern temperate zone. The project produced an evolutionary (or phylogenetic) tree that lays the groundwork for a revised classification of this large genus as well as the foundation for ongoing work in the ecology, conservation, and species-level taxonomy of the group. Collaborators integrated their expertise in phylogenetics (inferring evolutionary history), ecology, biogeography, data management and taxonomy to make numerous fundamental contributions to our understanding of sedge biodiversity and to the tools used to investigate plant biodiversity. Accomplishments include:</p> <p><strong>A large body of collections and data for use in these and future studies. </strong>The group has assembled a central database of more than 8150 specimens and 6000 DNA extractions that are being used by the collaborative group, representing ca. 1400 of the named <em>Carex </em>species. These specimens and DNA extractions will provide a foundation for ongoing work on the genus for years to come.</p> <p><strong>Understanding of classification and evolutionary relationships in the genus. </strong>Through three papers already published under the group authorship of <em>The Global Carex Group</em> and numerous other individual papers, we have begun the process of reclassifying <em>Carex</em> into more useful sections (levels of the classification within the genus) that can easily be learned and applied globally. We have also created a framework for understanding evolutionary relationships of the entire genus.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Practical tools for identifying species.</strong> We have created a collaborative database of sedge taxonomy, specimen records, species descriptions, photos, and maps at <a href="http://cyperaceae.e-monocot.org/">http://cyperaceae.e-monocot.org</a>. This resource is under continuing development and freely accessible to users all over the world.</p> <p><strong>Training students, teachers, and early career scientists, the next generation of biodiversity scientist. </strong>Through this project, we have provided direct training at The Morton Arboretum in various aspects of plant biodiversity science to three postdoctoral researchers, four graduate students, numerous undergraduates, and three early-career scientists. Many other undergraduates and visiting scientists passing through our lab but not directly involved in the project have also received training in skills developed through this project. The PI on this project has provided public seminars and sedge identification workshops that bring our research findings and practical advice to oak practitioners to a broader audience.
