<AbstractNarration>Research on modeling and analysis tools for management and design of smart grids has become an active area of research in several communities. This workshop will bring together ECCS and CMMI/SES communities to discuss the state of the art and identify research priorities for the future.   Papers from the workshop will be published in two outlets: a special issue of the Journal of Energy Systems, and the Handbook on Smart Grids, both published by Springer.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop on smart grid management and design recognizes that there is a two-way path: from research to practice, and from practical issues to important unsolved research questions. Both researchers and practitioners will contribute to the dialogue, which will inform future research priorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "Systems and Optimization Aspects of Smart Grid Challenges 2013" workshop held in March 21~23, 2013 at The University of Arizona in Tucson (http://sgc2013.arizona.edu/) has allowed us to bring together researchers, decision makers, and practitioners from academic, government, and industry to share their research works, new ideas and requirements for advancing the knowledge and progress for building smart grids.  The workshop program included six (6) plenary talks and twenty (20) regular talks.     The plenary talks were given by world-renowned researchers in the field of smart grid and energy, where the presented topics include 1) Optics for Cheap Solar with CPV Cells (Dr. Roger Angel at University of Arizona), 2) Systematic Optimization of Transmission Expansion and Transmission Charges based on Benefits (Dr. Ross Baldick at University of Texas Austin), 3) Sustainability Challenges: The Need for a Holistic View (Dr. Bert Bras at Georgia Institute of Technology), 4) Model Predictive Control Strategies for Post-Disturbance Corrective Action (Dr. Ian A. Hiskens at University of Michigan), 5) Branch Flow Model: Relaxations, Convexification, Equivalence (Dr. Steven Low at California Institute of Technology), and 6) Optimization and Modeling in Energy Systems (Dr. Panos M. Pardalos at University of Florida).  In addition, twenty (20) regular talks have been grouped into 7 sessions, where the topics of presentations focused on system and optimization aspects of smart grids, such as 1) power grid expansion, 2) integrating heterogeneous generation sources, 3) controlling and monitoring power grids, 4) energy markets, and 5) interdependence to other sectors.  The full program of the workshop is available at http://sgc2013.arizona.edu/SGC2013_Program.pdf.     The works that were presented at the workshop are being published via 1) a special issue of the "Energy Systems" Journal and 2) the "Handbook of Smart Grids" published by Springer on Energy Systems based on the materials of the workshop.  As of October 2013, several papers have been submitted for both the special issue as well as the handbook, and they have been being reviewed.  It is anticipated that both publications will be available sometime in 2014.     The workshop has provided opportunities for potential collaborations among participants with diverse backgrounds. In addition, the workshop also promoted education and development in this multidisciplinary research area.  Several students have participated from multiple universities, and the workshop has helped them broaden their views in research areas related to energy sustainability and smart grids.
