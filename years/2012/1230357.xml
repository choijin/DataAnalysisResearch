<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 0847742      Date: December 25, 2008&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Claville       Institution: Southern University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Michelle Claville of the Chemistry Department at Southern University in Baton Rouge LA, will afford new insights into the effect of ionizing irradiation on methionine (Met) and methionine-containing peptides (Met-peptides). More specifically, the overall goal of this project is to determine the reactivity of distonic radical cations that derive from modified Met and Met-peptides. The modifications chosen will afford the formation of distonic radical cations and distonic radical anions, depending on the substrate. The presence of the positive or negative charge determines the reactivity of the radical site, or promotes novel reactions that have gone unreported thus far. This project will discover how charges within a peptide framework affect the reactivity of a radical within the same framework, and provide a comparison for radicals that derive from the analogous uncharged systems. It will also show how neighboring amino acids affect, or respond to the reactive intermediates formed within the substrate. The study of each reaction in aerobic versus anaerobic conditions will afford insight into how different distonic radicals respond to the presence or absence of oxygen. Any subsequent formation of newly formed distonic peroxyl radicals will form new species that may have deleterious effect on the peptide substrate. Ultimately, by studying the proposed reactions in the suggested conditions, insight will be provided regarding the potential reactivity of distonic species that may form in peptides as a result of ionizing radiation in aerobic versus anaerobic conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Claville will pursue a project where a number of different sectors (e.g. government, industry and scientific education) will benefit. Some government and industry groups within the United States of America (USA) currently advocate the use of gamma irradiation for the purpose of food purification, in accordance to the current practices of countries such as Belgium, France, The Netherlands, and India. The NSF CAREER award will also impact the research and teaching community at Southern University and A &amp; M College, and the Chemistry departments at other campuses within the Southern University System (SUS), a system of primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI). Faculty members who participate in the educational component of the project will get the opportunity to collaborate in a structured setting for the purpose of positively impacting each represented campus. This effort will result in a network of ACS-approved Organic Chemistry programs throughout the SUS that will serve as a model for other comparable PUIs. Ultimately, both the research and educational components of the proposed CAREER award will not only impact students and faculty within the SUS, but will also impact other PUIs within the USA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Our project complemented the ongoing, and vastly studied, research on oxidation mechanisms of different amino acids, peptides and proteins. More specifically, our intent was, and still is, to better comprehend how methionine (Met) responds to various oxidants in various oxidative environments.  Recognizing that Met is one of the more important amino acids in defending the body against oxidative stress, extensive work has focused on deleterious consequences that are associated with its the one-and two-electron oxidations. We purposed to design one-electron oxidation reactions to generate distonic radical ions (radicals that also have separate charged sites within the same reactive intermediate) from Met and Met-peptides, then follow their subsequent reactions to get some insights into (1) the effect(s) of ionizing irradiation, and (2) the pathogenesis of various biological disorders such as AlzheimerÆs disease.   Our efforts to focus on the one-electron process did not exclude study of the two&ndash;electron process since the resulting products from the latter process were always evident.  Results thus far suggest that the only competing mechanism is a bimolecular oxidation.  Our results agree with published data concerning similar peptides that amino acid sequence does impact the ease of oxidation of Met-peptides.  We also discovered that the rates of oxidation of the naked Met-substrates differ from analogs that are protected at the N-terminus and/or the C- terminus.  Such data suggests that certain methionyl residues in naturally-occurring proteins will be more susceptible to biochemical oxidations than others.  Our efforts to efficiently detect/quantify peroxyl radicals in certain of our studies have led us to develop a modified approach to the well-known ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange (FOX) assay. Most recently, we have begun exploring electrochemical oxidations of our peptide substrates.   Our optimization of conditions for electrochemical and cyclic voltammetric reactions of our peptides allow us to further explore the mechanism of oxidation of Met-residues. Overall, funding for this project has generated five publications (3 published, 2 under review), more than 30 conference presentations, and five awards to undergraduate students.        Broader Impacts  This project has bolstered efforts to the integrate education and research at no less than two historically black college/university (HBCU).  Thus far, at least 25 undergraduates from Hampton University and Southern University and A&amp;M College, both research undergraduate institutions (RUI), have actively participated in this research project. All of those students were from groups that are under-represented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Fifty one percent of those students were female, while the other 49% were males from African descent.   Students had the advantage of being the primary operators over the duration of the project, and utilized knowledge learned in courses that include, organic chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology, among others.  All students had extensive exposure to organic synthesis via traditional and automated modes, especially with regard to peptide synthesis.  Product characterization was also emphasized and included the use of various forms of spectroscopy and spectrometry.  Most of the students (24, 98%) have gone on to pursue graduate degrees in STEM-fields, or are working in the chemical industry.  We are also pleased to report that six high school students from the Hampton Roads area (Virginia) also engaged in chemical research as a result of this award. All of those students have declared their intent to pursue baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields. Almost all the students (undergraduates and high school) who were funded by this award had opportunities to present their results in one or two conferences (regional, as well national level). Some of the students also won awa...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
