<AbstractNarration>Under this funding, the Principal Investigator (PI) will study oscillations in the global record and their effect on the deduced anthropogenic warming trend. In particular, the relationship between global variability at a 70-year scale and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation will be examined. The deduction of the anthropogenic trend in data is often complicated by the presence of this large amplitude low-frequency variability, since its trough-to-peak excursion is one half of the observed warming trend for the past 150 years. When it is added to the underlying anthropogenic warming trend, it creates the accelerated warming seen since 1978 and the cooling experienced in the 1970s. The early twentieth century warming was probably largely caused by the previous positive phase of this oscillation. The global oscillation appears to have its origin in the sea surface temperature variability of the North Atlantic, as a manifestation of a high frequency variability of the thermohaline circulation, but the mechanisms involved are not yet well established. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current data analysis methods may not be adequate for studying such low-frequency variability given the limited time span of the observation. New methods are for analyzing the global data record, to provide a quantification of errors due to the fact that even the longest quasi-global climate records (1850-present) are not long enough. On the other hand, a longer instrumental record at Central England (1659-present) and several even longer ice-core data records from Greenland will be studied to establish the existence of this oscillation in the pre-industrial era. The global temperature and sea-level pressure will be studied in more detail to understand the propagation of the signal from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Correlation studies will be performed with the Arctic ice-melt to determine if the latter is involved as a negative feedback necessary to establish an oscillation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will establish the significance of multidecadal natural variability in the North Atlantic and thus improve the detection and attribution of climate change. This is an important problem in climate science that has substantial broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The observed global-mean surface temperature has been warming in the presence of increasing atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, but its rise has not been monotonic.  There were periods, such as the late and early 20th century, when global warming was rapid, and in between and during the early 21st century, periods when the warming slowed.  This low-frequency variability about the rising trend has led to confusion concerning the interpretation of anthropogenic response to greenhouse gases.    The major goals of the project are:  (1) To analyze the low-frequency variability of surface temperature in instrumental and proxy data.  (2) To understand the contribution of the internal variability in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans to the global-mean surface temperature variation in the decadal and interdecadal time scales.  (3) To understand the physical mechanisms responsible for generating decadal and multidecadal oscillations in the sea-surface temperature data.  Accomplishments:  The proposed goals have been accomplished.  The results are described in journal publications.  The variations are caused by unforced, internal variability of our climate system.  The Pacific basin is responsible for the high-frequency (interannual) variations caused by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. At decadal and interdecadal time scales, there is a prominent climate mode known as Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).  This climate mode however contributes little to the global-mean surface temperature because of its compensating warm and cold centers of actions. Most of the variations in the global mean surface temperature in the decadal and multidecadal time scales are shown to be caused by a center in the North Atlantic. These results are obtained by using a new method that we developed, called rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis.  In the process we clarified some of the misinterpretations of results from a previous method. Below the surface, newly available data show that Pacific is not the ocean that sequestered most of the heat from anthropogenic forcing. Whatever it stores is in the shallow upper layer (above 300m) associated with interannual changes. Instead it is the high latitude Atlantic and the Southern Oceans where heat is sequestered in the deeper layers of the ocean through deep convection associated with the downward branch of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). We showed, using in situ and remote sensing data, that the AMOC has natural variations with period of about 65 years.  Such variations have been seen in Greenland ice cores, and in the longest instrumental temperature record in Central England.  During its accelerating phase, more heat is carried deep in the subpolar region of the North Atlantic, and hence not available for warming the surface.  During its low phase, more of the heat stays near the surface, contributing to rapid surface warming.             Last Modified: 12/28/2017       Submitted by: Ka-Kit Tung]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
