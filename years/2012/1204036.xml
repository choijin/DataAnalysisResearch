<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Conference on Probability, Control and Finance, to be held at Columbia University in the City of New York,   &lt;br/&gt;04-08 June 2012, with website http://www.math.columbia.edu/department/procofin/.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the conference is to analyze, using mathematical models, interactions between numerous financial market participants, and the consequences of such interactions. It will deal with issues impacting the market as a whole, rather than focusing only on the behavior of a single market participant. The objective is to bring together domestic and international researchers working in the areas of probability, financial mathematics and economics, control and estimation of stochastic optimization processes, as well as stochastic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a consequence of the crisis of 2007/2008, new regulatory changes are facing financial markets and it is important to maintain and improve the training and support available to young researchers who may play an important role in implementing, in the future, those changes related to mathematical modeling of the markets. By mixing researchers with different skills and perspectives, including those from under-represented groups, the conference aims to foster enriching interactions between people who would rarely interact&lt;br/&gt;otherwise. Even though the field of Financial Mathematics has attracted many graduate students in the last decade, many of them have looked for careers in industry; this conference may help attract top students to careers in academia or regulatory agencies, and increase the pool of US researchers in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Financial Mathematics and Economics enjoyed a great success,both in theory and in practice in the period between 1990 and 2007. The emphasis was on finding optimal ways to trade and hedge, often from the perspective of an investment bank. The events of 2007 and 2008 then showed in an emphatic way how in practice  this perspective was pushed too far, and that there was a need for a broader perspective, that would analyze  interactions between numerous market participants, and the consequences of such interactions. The conference dealt with issues impacting the market as a whole, rather than focusing only on the behavior of a single market participant, and related questions arising in Probability andStochastic Control.  In order to achieve such  a broad perspective,  the conference brought together domestic and international researchers working in the areas of financial mathematics and economics, control and estimation of  stochastic optimization processes, as well as stochastic analysis. By mixing researchers with different skills and perspectives in a relatively small meeting,  the conference aimed to foster enriching interactions between people who would rarely interact otherwise. A significant  number of the participantsof the conference are in the early stages of their careers, namely, graduate students and junior academics, including forty-three presenters in the poster sessions.The event will facilitate  the further development of young faculty and stimulate the careers of the next generation ofmathematicians. As a consequence of the crisis of 2007/2008,new regulatory changes are facing financial markets and  it is important to maintain and improve the training and support available to young researchers who may play an important role in implementing those changes in the future.  The meeting contributes to their  feeling of pride to being members of such an intellectual group  of high standards, and  inspire them to continue holding to those standards in further developing the field, whether in academia, regulatory institutions, or in financial industry. Even though the field of  Financial Mathematics has attracted many  graduate students in the last decade, many of them have looked for  careers in industry, especially in US. The conference may help attracting top US students to careers in academia  or government, and increase the pool of US researchers in the field.
