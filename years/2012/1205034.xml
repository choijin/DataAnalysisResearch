<AbstractNarration>PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS:&lt;br/&gt;Lake County High Schools Technical Campus (LCHSTC)&lt;br/&gt;Indian Hills Community College in Iowa&lt;br/&gt;National Center for Optics and Photonics Education (OP-TEC)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;The College of Lake County (CLC) is developing a regional Photonics program for a Laser/Optics/Photonics Associates degree in Applied Science (AAS). The program offers innovative instruction, delivery and scheduling; relying on a modular curriculum that is delivered through a hybrid, early entry/early exit system to reduce the time a student needs to complete a degree. It seeks to solve the problem of student recruitment into technical workforce education by creating a new pipeline of students from Lake County High Schools Technical Campus, which is located on the college campus. Students are able to complete a Photonics Certificate at their high school in two years (obtaining full college credit), also having a career pathway built into the AAS degree at CLC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This initiative first provides students with a hands-on experience with Class 1, 2 and 3 lasers until they are able to operate them in a safe environment. Students are then trained on class 3b and 4 powered lasers for applications such as interferometry, holography, and spectroscopy, and finally on high powered lasers used in the military and manufacturing applications. They are exposed to lasers using different lasing media and are provided with opportunities to explore biomedical applications to understand the context of laser utilization. The effort is creating an integrated pipeline from technical high school to community college and from community college to four-year institutions, all with emphasis on completion of degrees and certificates achieved through unconventional and innovative delivery methods. In addition, the project is examining the possibility of creating an AB degree with 4-year transfer institutions that support such an option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER SIGNIFICANCE&lt;br/&gt;This project takes advantage of the co-location of a technical high school and a community college to add value to both, creating a pathway to high-wage, high growth technical jobs for high school and community college students. The CLC Photonics Initiative provides a pathway to available jobs in the area hardest hit by the economic downturn by offering an innovative approach to STEM education. The project offers broad applicability for the nation and Midwest, particularly in preparing students for Photonics careers. The team is creating a Regional Photonics Program in collaboration with Indian Hills Community College and OP-TEC. CLC is also part of OP-TEC's Photonics College Network, which can obtain community equipment that would be difficult for one school to purchase alone - offering students access to state-of-the-art equipment (e.g., a fiber laser and articulating robot). The program offers a model that can be replicated elsewhere, further providing widespread access to high-tech education and training.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ College of Lake County-Regional Photonics Initiative  CLC?s goal was to create a photonics program fulfilling a demonstrated need for photonics technicians in the Chicago metro area.  Photonics, the study of light with optics controlling light, has many local applications and opportunities for students.  Local industrial uses of light consist of defense systems protecting our military aircraft, monitoring of our atmosphere and water for contaminants, manufacturing of life saving medical devices, night vision optics used by rescue personnel and marking for product identification of all kinds.  The need for photonics and optics technicians far out paces the supply leading to lucrative opportunities such as paid internships and high salaries for our students and graduates.  Following our mandate, the College of Lake County has successfully created a new ANSI safe, state of the art Laser and Optics lab, a curriculum adaptable to high school and post-secondary education, transfer opportunities to major universities and graduates partially filling the need of local industry for photonics technicians.  Through the mentoring of NSF?s OP-TEC and MPEC centers, CLC conformed the program to other programs in the US and at the same time address the unique aspects of local industry needs as well as our students? needs.  Students graduating from our NSF supported program fall into two categories, direct employment and transfer to college or universities.  Students who transfer can select an engineering management program option from one or more other state institutions, technology programs from other state institutions, and university physics programs such as the University of Arizona Optical Science Program, and the University of Northern Iowa.  These students receive rather effortless admittance, scholarships, research opportunities, and lab employment immediately upon arriving on campus.  Although students have transferred to universities to continue their studies, our program is designed to meet the needs of local industry and students desiring to complete an AAS in Lasers, Photonics and Optics (LPO).  To that end, we have branched out to a local technical high school as a certificate program, an AAS, and local industry.  The secondary program has reduced the time needed for students to obtain an AAS and thus reduce the cost, with some of these students transferring to universities.  High school students are encouraged to enroll at CLC and many do, however lack of numbers in the program still remains our main problem and continued focus.  Students attending CLC find there are not only jobs upon graduation, but paid internships starting at about $45,000 per year with benefits.  Industry in dire need of photonics technicians provide the internships to help students and in turn industry receives an early opportunity to recruit students upon graduation. Graduating AAS students are seeing job offers at leading manufacturers from $50,000 to about $90,000 per year.   Intellectual Merit  Students all receive instruction in the physics and math of light as well as its applications.  Students who are math deficient are allotted a special math enhancer as part of the introduction course and are capable of completing necessary calculations.  The experiences and education our students receive propels them into job opportunities and technologies they would not have seen without the program and sponsorship by the NSF.  At CLC students are exposed to VIS and IR spectroscopy leading to research opportunities at CLC as well as their destination school or place of employment.  Students are exposed to UV and infrared systems allowing students to compare ablated materials and even analyze deposits given off during the lasing process.  VIS lasers make up the bulk of student experience do to their low power and visual aspects.  Students are introduced to optics, optical alignment, and metrology through an interferometer and 3D micro-meter surface profiler leading to entry level positions in optical inspection and assembly at one of our participating employers.  Students learn multiple methods of determining spot-size and M-squared beam locations of an applied laser.   Broader Impacts  Students have successfully transferred to universities from both the High School certificate program and CLC?s Associate in Applied Science degree program.  CLC transfer students receive credit for their photonics courses as well as full credit for courses deemed transfer.  Meeting the needs of transfer students, faculty substitute calculus and calculus based science courses for the program requirement of Technical Math.  Typical demographics have most all STEM talented students attending a university upon high school graduation, yet many are not ready for the rigors of competition found at major schools.  Although course content is the same, competition at those schools is intense leaving moderate and even talented students at risk.  CLC has given transfer students a running start at some of the top photonics schools in the country and students are doing well.  The CLC Photonics program has reached out to all students and provides a curriculum lauded by local industry properly preparing students for the workforce.
