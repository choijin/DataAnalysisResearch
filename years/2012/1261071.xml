<AbstractNarration>This EAGER award funds an experiment to test the possibility of directly measuring neural activity in the human brain with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This project is led by Dr. Yoshio Okada, who is an Associate in Neurology at Children's Hospital in Boston and also a Clinical Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, MRI has become a useful technique for non-invasively determining the anatomy of the brain and its axonal fiber connections. MRI has also been very useful for estimating functional activity of the human brain. Anatomical and functional studies of the human brain using MRI have also made important contributions to the understanding of the human body and have also been useful in clinical medicine. Unfortunately, MRI has been severely limited by the fact that these techniques estimate neuronal activity only indirectly.  The PI of this proposal has developed a unique experimental arrangement which is ideally suited for testing the possibility of directly measuring MRI signals due to the magnetic field produced by neuronal activity without any time delay. Funding through the EAGER program will therefore enable the PI and his collaborators to solidly establish their preliminary findings in the isolated intact cerebellum of the turtle.  This will thereby provide ways to test the basic concepts of neural current MRI without the contaminations that would otherwise arise due to blood flow and other difficulties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is also expected to have significant broader impacts. Because this work will refine experimental investigations into the neural functioning of the human brain, it has many direct implications not only for basic research but also for clinical medicine.  The proposed work will also provide valuable training in experimental neurophysiology and MRI to a postdoctoral researcher with a PhD in biomedical engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This was an exploratory project funded by the EAGER program of the NSF until 12/31/2015. Our objective was to demonstrate that neuronal activity in the brain can be directly measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Neuronal activity today is being measured indirectly using MRI, by detecting changes in oxygenation of the blood due to increased oxygen consumption by active neurons. While this approach has been useful, it has two fundamental limitations, namely that the measurement is indirect and a time resolution is very slow, being on the order of seconds. Due to these fundamental limitations, MR scientists have attempted during the past 20 years to measure neuronal activity directly. But there is still no definitive demonstration that direct measurement is reliable and useful.&nbsp; This background served as the motivation for our study. When a group of neurons become synchronously active, they produce electrical currents along a certain direction, namely along the main axis of the neurons say perpendicular to the cortex. This ensemble of currents produces a local magnetic field in the vicinity of the active neurons. This field in turn is expected to change the phase of the precession of water protons if the brain is placed within a magnetic field. Thus,&nbsp; if one places a brain tissue in the MRI scanner, it should be possible to measure the neuronal currents by measuring the phase shift in each volume of tissue produced by the local magnetic field. This was the basic idea of our project. We designed our study with two aims. We wanted to show that: (1) the phase shift is synchronized with an independent measure of the neuronal current and (2) this information can be used to estimate the location, size and current density of the active tissue. &nbsp;We placed an isolated whole cerebellum of turtle in a chamber and positioned it in the middle of a 4.7 Tesla scanner. We then activated a group of neurons in a focal area of the cerebellum by stimulating the afferent axons in the cerebellar peduncle innervating these neurons. This stimulation produced a local magnetic field within and around the active tissue. The field in turn produced a phase shift in the water protons precessing in the scanner. We measured the phase shift with a conventional gradient-echo sequence. The accompanying figure shows the bipolar stimulating electrodes on the right side of the cerebellum (red dots) and the recording electrode in the ipsilateral side of the cerebellum (blue dot); the cerebellum is facing up with the peduncles at the bottom, thus the right of the cerebellum is on the left side of this figure. The stimulation produced a slowly varying current in the cerebellum, mediated by a type of receptors called metabotropic receptors in the Purkinje cells. This produced the local field potential (LFP) and the phase shift as shown in the middle. They have the same waveform, demonstrating that the phase shift reflects the local magnetic field produced by the neuronal currents, which also produce the LFP. The peduncular stimulation activated a patch of the cerebellum as shown in the bottom right panel for one cerebellum. This produced the expected phase shift: The phase shift was positive in the top left corner and negative in the top right corner of the figure (left top panel). There was also a pair of positive and negative phase shifts at each peduncle. These signals disappeared when a blocker of synaptic transmission was added to the bath (top right panel). The spatial pattern of the phase shift can be used to estimate the active tissue, since the phase shift is due to the local magnetic field and the latter is in turn due to neuronal currents.
