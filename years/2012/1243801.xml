<AbstractNarration>Understanding the complexity of living systems and how they work is a major challenge for biology.  At present, we do not understand what properties of complex living systems allow them to be flexible, and change in response to the environment, versus those that cannot change without disrupting the whole system.  This is particularly important for organisms that must deal with current and future climate change.  For example, many of the processes that are essential for animals to function are temperature dependent.  Even small changes in temperature could disrupt development or functioning of individuals, thereby affecting species and systems on which humans depend.  Some organisms successfully adapt to environmental change, while others cannot and go extinct.  This project will support an important workshop that will be held in November 2012 in Arlington, Virginia.  The goals of this workshop are to address this grand challenge question, to identify key research and information needs, and facilitate the collaborations that will be needed to make progress addressing this question.  This workshop will bring together scientists from very wide ranging fields who do not normally interact so that they can bring the expertise of their fields to others, build bridges and develop a common language.  This effort will allow knowledge and solutions to be transferred, and identify key areas where we need new information that will form the basis of new research that is needed to address these critical questions.  To make sure that the best scientists from a broad range of fields are included, there will be a steering committee that will meet in August 2012 in Cold Spring Harbor, NY to select workshop participants, set the specific agenda of the workshop, and communicate with participants beforehand so that they come to the workshop fully prepared for the work at hand.  The broader impacts of this workshop include the central focus on this research question that has been identified as a Grand Challenge in Organismal Biology.  The workshop and the steering committee will include a diversity of scientists including those from small and large institutions, members of groups underrepresented in the sciences, and a diversity of research areas. This workshop will be used to develop a research agenda to address this important question facing organismal biologists in the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the grand challenges of animal biology is understanding how the complex, integrated components of living animals can simultaneously maintain stability to function properly and yet be flexible and able to change across an animal?s life span and under different environmental conditions.  All animals must develop, gain nutrition, reproduce, and interact with other species and the physical environment.  Traditionally, biologists have specialized by examining one part of an animal?s life history, or a specific type of biological system, such as physiological or hormonal or neural responses.  However, specializing on any one component system of an organism or part of an animal?s life span is inadequate for fully understanding these complex systems.  Therefore, biologists need new approaches to study complex animal systems.  Applied mathematicians and engineers face these same challenges, and have developed systems-level modeling tools that can help integrative organismal biologists to make headway in answering important questions about stability and change in organismal systems.  An interdisciplinary workshop was held to determine the best avenues that organismal biologists can pursue to make headway answering this complex suite of questions for integrative animal systems.  The workshop included a range of engineers, mathematicians and biologists working on a wide array of species and trying to answer different questions about stability and change in animals.    Intellectual Merit: The result of the workshop was the development of a research agenda to increase collaborations among traditional organismal biologists and engineers and applied mathematicians, and address important questions about stability and change.  It was determined that such collaborations would not only benefit biologists, but would also benefit engineers and mathematicians.  Biological systems are often inherently non-liner, and change does not follow a regular pattern.  Mathematicians and engineers have, to date, found development of non-linear models challenging, but could gain insight from working with nonlinear biological systems.  The results of the workshop and recommendations for new, quantitative modelling and systems-level approaches to address questions of stability and changer were published, as were a number of studies illustrating and using these modelling approaches.   Broader Impacts: As a result of the workshop, many new collaborations have formed between engineers and applied mathematicians and biologists, and new research has become possible.  Students are now beginning to be trained across disciplines as the value of applying mathematical modeling and engineering systems-level modelling approaches is now becoming apparent.  Professors are now including such modelling and quantitative training in the classes they teach, as well as in training new graduate students.  Additional training of new scientists and retraining of senior scientists is needed, as are opportunities for biologists to find collaborations with applied mathematicians and engineers using systems-type modeling.
