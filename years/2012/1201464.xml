<AbstractNarration>The award provides support to defray the expenses of US participants in the "Special Meeting: Focus Program on Whitney Problems". The program will consist of three activities (a 7-day workshop; a graduate course; and a lecture series) that will take place August 27 through September 3, 2012, at the Fields Institute for Research in the Mathematical Sciences in Toronto (Canada). The special meeting is focused on some of the most vibrant developments in function theory related to the celebrated Whitney extension and trace problems for classes of smooth functions. These include new analytic and geometric methods in the study of Lipschitz structures on finite sets, extension and trace problems for functions in Sobolev spaces, simultaneous extensions of Lipschitz functions from subsets of metric spaces, Helly-type Lipschitz selection problems, geometric descriptions of Sobolev extension domains, etc.  New developments in these areas will continue to have an impact on a broad range of fields, including function theory, geometric analysis and complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funding for this program will be used to pay for the expenses of US based participant support, with priority given to graduate students, post-docs, younger faculty, members of underrepresented groups, and those without their own source of funding. This program will bring together researchers in   Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, Geometry,to discuss recent advances related to the Whitney Problem and in particular the overlap between these areas of mathematics. The program will be an opportunity to attract some of the leading experts in function theory, partial differential equations, and harmonic analysis together to discuss this question and related research questions of interest.  This program will create an environment in which students and early career researchers could profit from the interaction with such top experts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of the grant was to support the activities of the Thematic Program on Whitney Problems at the Fields Institute, University of Toronto, Canada, in August-September 2012. The goal if its no cost extensions to 2013,2014, 2015 was to partially support the subsequent Whitney Problems  Workshop at the Banff International Research Station in April 2013, and research by the PI on a problem of geometric description of planar Sobolev extension domains.  All three goals have been successfully achieved.  The Thematic Program on Whitney Problems at the Fields Institute brought together practically all active researchers in the field, and allowed them to share their new ideas, and approaches. This exchange of ideas have led to an important progress in developing new tools which allowed to successfully attack analogues of the Whitney extension problems for Sobolev spaces, which were previously considered very much beyond the reach. Since then our understanding of Whitney extension problems for Sobolev spaces has achieved roughly the same kind of maturity which was earlier (in the 1990s and 2000s) achieved only for uniform spaces of smooth functions.  The work of the 2012 Toronto meeting was followed by very important developments reported at the Banff meeting a year later.  In particular, P. Shvartsman and N. Zobin reported a breakthrough in an old problem of geometric description of planar Sobolev extension domains, based on several novel geometric and analytic ideas. The completion of their work, which was partially supported by the grant, took another two years, and the related long paper will appear in the Advances in Mathematics in March 2016.  Whitney Problems have their origins in seminal papers by Hassler Whitney of 1934, which have attracted a lot of attention, but the progress in the area has been very slow until 1990s and 2000s when a number of old problems have been successfully solved (C.
