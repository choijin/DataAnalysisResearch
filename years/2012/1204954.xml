<AbstractNarration>This project led by Polk Community College is enhancing an existing Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Technology program and converting it to an Open Entry/Open Exit (OEOE) format. In the OEOE format, course objectives are divided into single credit hour units that can be scheduled to fit time constraints of students. The program addresses the needs of working students and provides a learner centric focus. Through outreach activities, student interest in advanced manufacturing and enrollment in the program is increased. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OEOE format is modeled on other successful programs but tailored to fit the local constraints within the Florida College System. NSF sponsored ATE Centers are partnered with Polk Community College to assist with the curriculum development efforts. The project is responsive to local industry needs and has industry involvement throughout the planning and implementation. Students can also be placed in industries to obtain practical experience and by collaborating with four year institutions; the project is enabling students to transfer to four year schools to continue their studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OEOE format and a partnership with the Polk County Public Schools enable secondary and college instructors to strengthen their knowledge of Advanced Manufacturing principles by completing selected units of study. This instructor development ensures a strong sustainable program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Default">Higher education is experiencing both internal and external pressure to drive innovation, to transform program and content delivery, enrollment and registration practices, financial aid, instructor roles, and the technology systems required to support these models.&nbsp; Access, affordability, compression, completion, and career pathways are all national themes that have emerged from industry, funding agencies, government, and media that are driving fundamental change and innovation in higher education. CBE, along with personalized approaches, has become an emerging model that a number of institutions are exploring to better respond to local employer needs and to facilitate student success. To empower students through the educational process and align to the needs of non-traditional students in an affordable, accessible, and targeted manner, Polk State College has implemented a ground-breaking competency based education (CBE) Engineering Technology degree program that was initiated as a result of NSF-ATE funding, which is now in the third year.&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">The Open-Entry / Early-Exit (OEEE), Engineering Technology Associate of Science degree is a hybrid, CBE, modular, non-term, self-paced, learner-centered, faculty-mentored format that serves to educate two-year students creating career pathways into the high-performance field of applied engineering / advanced manufacturing.&nbsp; Polk State&rsquo;s OEEE Engineering Technology program has implemented:</p> <ul> <li>educational reform through the transition of a traditional AS degree in Engineering Technology to an open-entry / early-exit, hybrid competency-based, modular, open-lab, degree program; </li> <li>professional development &ndash; technical skills professional development for the college and secondary program faculty and pedagogical professional development for the college staff and faculty on competency-based program development and delivery; and </li> <li>outreach programs &ndash; increased collaboration with secondary feeder programs in the college&rsquo;s service area, disruptive innovation applied to advisory council collaboration, and greater engagement with industry.</li> </ul> <p class="Default">In the 60 credit hour degree program, the 42 credit hours of Engineering Technology courses have been converted from 14, three-credit courses to 42, one-credit courses to allow for greater student flexibility, industry certificate content mapping, and modularized completion.&nbsp;The flexible modular format is a true non-term OEEE registration process, operating within the guidelines of the Florida College System. The open lab non-term program is increasingly accessible to working learners and is learner-centered rather than faculty-centered; building a collaborative relationship between the secondary system and the college that embeds certification-based articulation resources and pathways into the program; and providing pathways to baccalaureate degrees. Faculty roles are shifted, advising and support pathways modified, registration and student information systems altered, and financial aid processes amended (as a designated U.S. Department of Education Experimental Site for CBE) to accommodate this revolutionary program design.</p> <p class="Default">There are a number of elements that require alternate modes for assessing excellence and student success given the CBE and rolling enrollment patterns associated with the program. After almost two full years of implementation, Polk State has demonstrated increasing program enrollment trends, improved completion and success rates, accelerated time to completion, and improved student and employer satisfaction.</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">In addition to the complete program overhaul, the program has also created a new regional model for multi-level interinstitutional program advisory council. The Polk Engineering Technology Education Council (PETEC) &ndash; recognized as a statewide best-practice by STEMflorida and the Manufacturers Association of Florida. PETEC is a countywide engineering technology / advanced manufacturing / engineering advisory and oversight council comprised mainly of industry representatives with strategic academic, training, and economic and workforce development partners.&nbsp; The advisory council is specifically chartered to provide guidance and input for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) related secondary career academies, technical center certificate programs, college degree programs and corporate college training initiatives serving the sector to ensure relevancy to the engineering technology / advanced manufacturing / engineering employers.</p> <p>The Council is structured so that each career academy, technical center, and college has an industry partner that represents the program quarterly at the PETEC meetings.&nbsp; Additionally, the council has representatives from industry at-large, economic development (CFDC &amp; the Chamber of Commerce), the regional workforce board (CareerSource Polk), the Florida Engineering Association, and the regional manufacturing association (Mid-Florida MSCA).&nbsp;The Council members provide active involvement through participation in quarterly meetings by providing subject matter expertise and advocating for a latticed and credentialed STEM workforce preparation system aligned with unified educational pathways.&nbsp;</p> <p>The primary outcome is ONE county-wide industry advisory council that serves to offer guidance and support to the entire STEM-aligned engineering technology / advanced manufacturing / engineering talent development system. This inclusive advisory model has industry and academia partnering to serve students by providing an educational pathway that is consistent with industry needs. Additionally, redundancy is minimized by the structure and framework of the council. Issues can be addressed at a single meeting (rather than twelve &ndash; the number of programs served by PETEC) and employers no longer have to serve on multiple siloed committees. As a best practice, the PETEC model can be replicated in any county / college service area.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/27/2016<br>      Modified by: Eric&nbsp;A&nbsp;Roe</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1204954/1204954_10198893_1477594780508_IMG_20140113_180016981_HDR--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1204954/1204954_10198893_1477594780508_IMG_20140113_180016981_HDR--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Polk State College"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1204954/1204954_10198893_1477594780508_IMG_20140113_180016981_HDR--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Polk State College"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The new Advanced Technology Center at Polk State College</div> <div class="imageCredit">E.Roe</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Eric&nbsp;A&nbsp;Roe</div> <div class="imageTitle">Polk State College</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1204954/1204954_10198893_1477595094094_ImpactDiagram--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1204954/1204954_10198893_1477595094094_ImpactDiagram--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Engineering Tech OEEE Impact Diagram"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1204954/1204954_10198893_1477595094094_ImpactDiagram--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Engineering Tech OEEE Impact Diagram"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Various programs and systems impacting or being impacted by the shift to CBE at Polk State College</div> <div class="imageCredit">E.
