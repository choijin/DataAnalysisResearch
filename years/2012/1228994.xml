<AbstractNarration>Despite the Internet's status as critical infrastructure, there is little scientific instrumentation dedicated to monitoring global Internet behavior. In particular, we have no rigorous framework for measuring, analyzing, or quantifying the impact of network outages, filtering, or other abnormal connectivity dynamics on a global scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project applies successful research results in analyzing recent macroscopic Internet connectivity disruptions to the development, testing, and experimental deployment of an operational capability to detect, monitor, and characterize such large-scale infrastructure outages.  The investigators are seeking to validate and extend a methodology for identifying not only which networks have been affected by an outage, but also which mechanisms have been used to effect a deliberate disruption.  The two intellectual themes of the research are: (1) extracting signal from malware-induced background radiation in Internet traffic (IBR); and (2) combining multiple types of data (active probing, passive IBR, routing data, geolocation, and registry databases) to delineate the scope and progression of the outage.  The project will also develop quantitative indicators to gauge the impact of geophysical disasters on Internet infrastructure, including the dynamics of loss and restoration of service.  A transition of these research outcomes into practice will yield a system specification, implementation, and experimental operational deployment to detect and monitor global connectivity failures on a planetary scale.  In addition to improving our understanding of how measurements yield insights into network behavior, and strengthening our ability to model large scale complex networks, such a system will illuminate infrastructure vulnerabilities that derive from architectural, topological, or economic constraints, suggesting how to mitigate or eliminate these weaknesses in future Internet architecture and measurement research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Public and private sector stakeholders around the world seek ways to ensure that the Internet provides the level of reliability and resilience we have long taken for granted from the telephony network.  Unfortunately, in spite of the societal and economic impact of Internet connectivity disruptions, we lack near-realtime, scalable and validated methodologies and tools to identify and understand large-scale Internet outages.  Based on experimental work in which we combined measurements at the control plane, active probing and passive traffic analysis, CAIDA developed an operational prototype system, IODA (Internet Outage Detection and Analysis), that monitors the Internet, in near-realtime, with the goal of identifying macroscopic Internet outages affecting the edge of the network, i.e., significantly impacting an AS or a large fraction of a country.  One of the first research platforms offering a multi-source view of large-scale Internet outages, IODA enabled us to design, create, deploy, and support powerful instrumentation for outage detection and analysis, This project spurred several collaborations with researchers to experiment with integration of new detection methodologies, and improve our own.  Partners have included the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, and a large Internet broadband service provider (ISP) who already uses IODA to support their own research on Internet reliability and performance.  During this project, we reported and documented several relevant episodes of connectivity disruption, including outages affecting large U.S. residential broadband ISPs, as well as entire countries almost entirely disconnected from the Internet (e.g., North Korea, Sudan, Syria).
