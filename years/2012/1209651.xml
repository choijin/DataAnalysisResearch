<AbstractNarration>This action funds "AJ" (Wendy) Harris of Oklahoma State University to conduct a research project, entitled "How many species of buckeye trees exist in China?" during the summer of 2012 at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.  The host scientist is Professor Chengxin Fu. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to resolve the current uncertainty regarding the number, diversity, and geographic extent of Chinese species of buckeye trees, Aesculus L. Thus, the research contributes to a better understanding of plant diversity in China. While preliminary, this study is expected to facilitate future collection efforts by identifying locations of populations and to generate interest in further work on Chinese species of Aesculus, including the development of Aesculus as a model system for better understanding the modern distribution and composition of Northern Hemisphere temperate forests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
