<AbstractNarration>Troubleshooting undesirable network events, such as poor connectivity or performance, is difficult at best. The high-speed link techniques that work on LANs, such as dumping packets and analyzing the detailed traffic, are impossible due to massive data volume.  This project will explore mathematical techniques and network tools that will reduce the amount of data that has to be captured and stored while still allowing network operators to troubleshoot their networks.  The project's objective is to extract from high-speed packet streams on individual network links an approximate and highly compressed representation of the link traffic that is orders of magnitude smaller in size than the raw traffic stream but which permits almost the same degree of troubleshooting as the raw data.   The project will develop the algorithms and mathematical theory needed to design intelligent sampling algorithms for compressing network traffic.  Specific areas to be studied for purposes of developing sampling techniques include identifying what constitutes the representative flows for troubleshooting purposes and investigating how to best encode and decode the sampled data, and how the samples can be gracefully shrunk over time so as to reclaim space for new data as they arrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide research experience for undergraduates.   Undergraduates at Georgia Tech, Denison and other institutions will be recruited via undergraduate workshops and research symposiums.  Additionally, the project will integrate education and research via inclusion of the research into courses.    In addition to publishing in appropriate scientific venues, the PIs will expand the Wikipedia entries on topics related to data streaming algorithms as part of the process of disseminating general information about the topic area to the scientific community.    In terms of commercial impact, the project will lead to better methods for the diagnosis of large-scale networks, thereby reducing the cost to maintain and operate them.  As part of the transfer of research findings into commercial practice the PIs will collaborate with members of AT&amp;T's Network Management and Engineering Department.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  Co-PIs Lall and Xu, and Ph.D. students of PI Xu's have worked together with collaborators on three research problems closely related to this project.  First, they worked with researchers at AT&amp;T Labs to develop a new technique, called Crossroads, for summarizing large data sets that can be used to mine logs of cellular voice and data traffic for rapid diagnosis of network performance anomalies, an important research objective of this NSF project.  Through this work, they have realized the vision laid out in the proposal on extracting information via intersecting two sketch (synopsis) data structures.  They have also proved that, surprisingly, it is impossible to intersect three or more sketches (in an attempt to extract even more information), when these sketches belong to the most popular and frequently used Gaussian sketch family.  Second, they have designed a new type of error-estimating codes (EEC), called idEEC (insertion/deletion EEC), for measuring the BER (bit error rate) of wireless transmissions.  The design of the idEEC scheme was motivated by AT&amp;T's need to monitor the BER -- which reflect the channel conditions -- of their wireless access links, over which insertion, deletion, and bit flipping errors could happen.  This work of designing sketches (each idEEC codeword can be viewed as a sketch) for network performance diagnosis is clearly related to the aforementioned objective of this project.  Third, co-PIs Xu and Lall collaborated with a team from East China Normal University on an application of intersection sketches to the database area:  the distributed error estimation of functional dependency (FD).  This is considered a very important problem, because measuring/Estimating the number of errors in (i.e., violations of) a functional dependency (FD) offers valuable information about data semantics and quality.  Their joint work was among the first to tackle the problem of distributed FD error estimation over distributed datasets/databases.  Their solution is to let each site (i.e., distributed dataset/database) generate a intersection-capable sketch based on its local data.  Then FD errors are then inferred from such sketches, which are several orders of magnitude smaller than the datasets/databases themselves.  All three works were published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings or journals. In addition, both co-PIs have made separate research efforts in the scope of this project, and have obtained the following findings.PI Xu has collaborated with AT&amp;T researchers to answer the following research question:  How to provision a cellular access and transport network so that the performance impact of the failure of one or more network elements (e.g., a transport network circuit or a cell tower) is minimized?  They have also implemented their approach in a system named TOIP (Tower Outage Impact Predictor), which will soon be used by AT&amp;T for the resource provisioning and capacity planning of their cellular network infrastructure.  Co-PI Lall has developed a novel algorithm for computing a very commonly used statistical test (the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) efficiently on big data.     Broader impact:  This project has resulted in several publications in premier international conferences and journals, and an open source software package called StreamStats (https://github.com/ashlall/StreamStats).  The aforementioned Crossroads work helped solve an important and challenging data mining problem posed by AT&amp;T.  It has since been incorporated into their network service diagnosis toolkit and used by AT&amp;T engineers.  Co-PI Xu served as a Program Committee co-Chair for ACM Sigmetrics 2013 and a General co-Chair for ACM Sigmetrics 2015.  Both are tremendous undertakings and have had significant community impact.  Over the course of the project, co-PI Lall has worked with five undergraduate students (two female) on research related to the project.  Two of those students now have a publication at a premier conference, a rear feat by undergraduate students.    Co-PI Lall also organized a Kids Tech University (KTU) event jointly with the Newark (Ohio) Works in which 60+ nine- to twelve-year olds from the area were introduced to what it is like to be in college and to help excite them about STEM in general and CS in particular.
