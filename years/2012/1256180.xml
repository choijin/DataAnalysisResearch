<AbstractNarration>Carbon cycle models are used to assess how future carbon policy scenarios will influence atmospheric carbon pools and climate. The accuracy of those models depends on our understanding of major pathways in the carbon cycle. One such pathway, the decay of dead plant material (litter), is responsible for releasing more carbon into the atmosphere each year than the combustion of fossil fuel. Litter decay in forests is reasonably well understood, but both the rate and temporal pattern of litter decay are different in deserts. The effects of direct sunlight on litter may increase the rate of decay, while the lack of moisture may reduce microbial activity and decrease the decay rate. This project will test whether the optical properties of litter produced by desert plants contribute to the different pattern of litter decay. Laboratory and field experiments will be used to test the importance of sunlight as an agent of litter decay relative to other mechanisms such as microbial activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research, which will be conducted in the Sonoran Desert, will contribute to our understanding of carbon cycling in deserts and in other ecosystems where litter is exposed to intense sunlight (e.g. grasslands and agricultural systems).The investigators will develop a website that contains a guide to litter decomposition for K12 students, a companion guide to aid teachers in conducting litter decomposition experiments, and they will solicit K12 teachers to take part in this experiment. This project will provide research experience for K12 students and teachers, and undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Understanding and modeling the global carbon (C) cycle is critical for assessing how natural and human activities influence atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and climate. The decay of dead plant material (?litter?) is a key pathway in the global C cycle, releasing more C into the atmosphere annually than fossil fuel combustion. Hence, accurate models of the global C cycle require an adequate understanding of mechanisms controlling litter decay. While litter decay in many ecosystems can be reasonably well predicted based on climatic factors and litter chemistry traits, this is not the case in arid ecosystems such as deserts - the mechanisms controlling litter decay in deserts have puzzled scientists for decades, hampering efforts to accurately model C cycling in deserts. The overall goal of this project was to assess what mechanisms drive litter decay in arid ecosystems, with a focus on the Sonoran Desert. We found that exposure to sunlight significantly accelerates the decay of desert litter, increasing its breakdown rate by an average of 50%. The mechanisms of this process of sunlight-driven decay, termed photodegradation, are not well understood or characterized. We found that photodegradation of litter is driven primarily by the ultraviolet waveband of sunlight (responsible for 70% of the breakdown), with violet and blue wavebands responsible for the remaining 30%. Along with this direct breakdown by sunlight, we found that sunlight exposure indirectly accelerates decay by partially breaking down compounds, making this litter more decomposable by microbes. Our results suggest that hemicellulose and cellulose, both polysaccharides found in plant cell walls, are the most likely compounds being partially broken down by sunlight. We estimate that this indirect effect of sunlight is substantial, probably contributing as much to decay as the direct effect of sunlight exposure. Our finding that much of the faster decay of litter in sunlight was due to accelerated microbial decay was surprising, since microbial activity in deserts is assumed to be negligible most of the time because of lack of rainfall and moisture. However, we found that precipitation or liquid water is not a requirement for microbes to become active and decompose litter: litter absorbs water vapor during periods of high relative humidity, such as during the night, and in many cases this uptake is enough to activate microbes and promote litter decay. Our findings illustrate that litter decay in deserts is governed by mechanisms that differ from those that dominate this process in wetter ecosystems, such as forests, and offer insights into how modelers could incorporate these mechanisms to improve models of C cycling in deserts and other arid and semi-arid ecosystems. This project provided research training and experience for one postdoctoral fellow, two graduate students, and 18 undergraduate students at Arizona State University. The project also involved interactions and exercises with several K-12 science classes in Arizona in which facets of the C cycle and decomposition were explored. We anticipate several additional journal publications reporting on the project, stemming in part from graduate student dissertations.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/16/2019<br>      Modified by: Thomas&nbsp;A&nbsp;Day</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1256180/1256180_10232484_1565976849640_DSC_2868generalplotsDec192013--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1256180/1256180_10232484_1565976849640_DSC_2868generalplotsDec192013--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Monitoring litter decay in the desert."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1256180/1256180_10232484_1565976849640_DSC_2868generalplotsDec192013--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Monitoring litter decay in the desert."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Envelopes containing dead leaves (litter) of several different plant species in the desert.
