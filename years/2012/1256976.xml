<AbstractNarration>Researchers from the University of Arizona will use molecular phylogenetic, morphological and ecological data within Ant Nest Beetles (genus Paussus) to explore the evolution of bizarre phenotypic traits and host ant shifts across geographic landscapes at two taxonomic scales. This project investigates putative "replicated adaptive radiations" within this group, a rare phenomenon in which geographically separated lineages are composed of species exhibiting the same sets of convergently evolved phenotypes and ecological niches. It also will provide a framework to investigate the drivers, stages, and relative rates of phyletic and phenotypic change within an adaptive radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes formal and informal education and training components, including postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate training in the areas of evolutionary biology, insect systematics, taxonomy and identification, and biogeography. It will help to formalize collaborations between young scientists and students from the United States, Italy, Sri Lanka and India. Beetle identification workshops, involving up-and-coming students and faculty, will be offered in these countries covering modern beetle classification, morphology, collection, and identification resources. Researchers will generate online tutorials that clearly demonstrate examples of species radiation and convergent evolution that will be immediately understandable by the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Using time calibrated molecular phylogenetics, we have shown that Ant Nest Beetles (the genus Paussus) have undergone at least three large, rapid species radiations, one each in Madagascar, Indo-Malaysia, and sub-Saharan Africa.  While each radiation contains species with highly divergent morphologies and are endemic to one biogeographic region, they each contain species with strikingly similar phenotypes that evolved by either convergent evolution or parallelism.  A matrix of 120 morphological characters was created and scored from a new collection of cleared and fully disarticulated specimens.  Using this data matrix we conducted a detailed morphological study of Paussus utilizing novel character systems and discovered anatomical apomorphies diagnostic of the major clades of Paussus strongly supported by molecular data.  Bayesian inference of molecules alone, morphology alone and varying combinations of the two data types reveal that our new morphological data set is informative for placing Paussus species, despite the extreme phenotypic diversity and convergence prevalent in the group.  Based upon this work established a new classification for Paussus based on this phylogeny which has been widely adopted by our community.  This project provided PI Moore, co-PI Robertson, and three graduate students with hands-on experience obtaining and processing Next Gen sequencing data and comparative genomic processing techniques. It provided us the opportunity to add new genomic techniques into our research and teaching portfolios. Deep knowledge and experience with these methods are crucial for modern systematists to effectively train members of the next generation of students interested in pursuing careers in insect systematics and related biological disciplines.  Results have been disseminated through a combination of peer-reviewed publications, theses and dissertations, and talks at professional meetings. In addition to these offerings to the scientific community, we also presented descriptions and results of our research during the annual Arizona Insect Festival in Tucson Arizona.  This annual event, originally founded by PI Moore in 2011, is offered free to the general public and reaches approximately 5000 people every year.
