<AbstractNarration>DataBridge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are currently thousands of scientists creating millions of data sets describing an increasingly diverse matrix of social and physical phenomena. This rapid increase in both amount and diversity of data implies a corresponding increase in the potential of data to empower important new collaborative research initiatives. However, the sheer volume and diversity of data presents a new set of challenges in locating all of the data relevant to a particular line of research. Taking full advantage of the unique data managed by the "long-tail of science" requires new tools specifically created to assist scientists in their search for relevant data sets.  DataBridge is an e-science collaboration environment tool designed specifically for the exploration of a rich set of sociometric tools and the corresponding space of relevance algorithms, and their adaptation to define semantic bridges that link large numbers of diverse datasets into a sociometric network. Data from several large NSF funded projects will be analyzed to develop relevance-based data discovery methods.  Sociometric network analysis (SNA) algorithms will be used to explore the space of relevancy (different ways data can be related to each other) by metadata and ontology, by pattern analysis and feature extraction, and via human connections. By linking data, human interactions, and usage methods and practices, rich models of social networks inter-connecting massive long tail science data can be created that enhance scientific collaboration and discovery.  DataBridge supports advances in Science and Engineering by directly enabling and improving discovery of relevant scientific data across large, distributed and diverse collections. The system will also provide an easy means of publishing data to the DataBridge and incentivize data producers to do so by enabling collaboration and citation. The design will be domain-agnostic and highly extensible and adaptive, supporting inclusion of new relevance algorithms and indexing techniques. DataBridge will be distributed under an open source license enabling wider use and crowd-sourced improvements of the technology. The concepts developed in the project - semantically linking data through sociometric network analysis - will have an impact on non-scientific data collections and will effectively improve access and discovery of information over the web.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   NSF Big Data: Outcomes Report    One part of Big Data research includes the use of large numbers of small to medium size datasets created and shared by individual researchers - what is usually referred as the long tail of Big Data. The goal of this project is to increase the discoverability of datasets belonging in this long tail. To accomplish this, one must ensure that 1) these datasets are shared by individual researchers, 2) the datasets have sufficient metadata to be discoverable, and 3) the repositories hosting these datasets provide APIs to enable other systems easily find the data. The Dataverse software platform is a critical piece of this project by providing an open source framework to build data repositories for sharing of research data. Since Dataverse (http://dataverse.org/) was released in 2007 by the Instutute for Quantiative Social Science (IQSS), it has provided incentives for researchers to share data by giving researchers credit through data citation and control over terms of use and access of their data.    In this project in particular, we have expanded the metadata, the APIs, and harvesting protocols  of the Dataverse software to facilitate discoverability of all the datasets shared and published using Dataverse repositories. Currently, there are more than 20 Dataverse repository installations worldwide. Our group maintains one of them, the Harvard Dataverse (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/), which hosts more than 60,000 datasets published by thousands of researchers from more than 500 institutions. In addition, the Dataverse has an active and growing community of users and developers. Our project deliverables released with the open-source Dataverse software and instantly deployed in the Harvard Dataverse repository, have a direct and immediate impact to research.    The accomplishments of the IQSS team at Harvard University towards this project have included the delivery of:   An open Application Programming Interface (API) for searching all metadata fields associated with datasets deposited in Dataverse repositories, as well as an API for accessing the variable (column) metadata associated with datasets that contain tabular data.    Support for the Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) for all Dataverse repositories. The OAI-PMH allows to harvest metadata from one repository to another, so that a dataset can be searched in any repository (or discovery tool) after being deposited and archived in a specific Dataverse repository.   Integration of Dataverse with ORCID to provide persistent identifiers to researchers( or data authors), to unambiguously distinguish one researcher from another, and to eventually share reliable information about each researcher. ORCID support means that data authors can sign up in Dataverse repository with the ORCID credits, and associate their public information in ORCID with their datasets. This facilitates finding datasets  that are associated with a researcher or group of researchers, in an unambiguous way.
