<AbstractNarration>This project supports a Future Internet Architecture (FIA) principal investigator meeting in October 2012. The goal of this meeting is to allow a technical assessment and critique of the projects. The meeting is organized to give each of the projects feedback on their designs, and to inform each of the projects about the work being done by the others. Periodic investigator meetings are critical to overall success of the FIA program and the goal of the FIA program is not just the funding of distinct architecture projects, but also the generation and sharing of design insights and architectural concepts among the various teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feedback and assessment of each project is intended to allow each project to improve its technical approach, and to build upon the work of other projects as appropriate. As such, the technical merit of this proposal is the enhancement of the work being done as part of the NSF-funded FIA projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader goal of the NSF FIA program is enhancing the relevance and impact of the NSF program of network research, intellectual enrichment of the network research community, and the contribution of new concepts and thought leadership to the future of the Internet. The results of this workshop, which will be posted on the FIA website for public dissemination, will be a contribution to this broader goal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported a workshop for investigators in the NSF Future Internet Architecture project. Recurring investigator meetings are an integral part of the FIA program, and are a means to exchange insights and results among the various funded projects. The workshop was held October 1-2, 2012 in Washington D.C.  The major activity at this workshop was a comparison of five FIA schemes. The meeting started with a summary of the five projects. Following this introduction, the meeting used a series of scenarios as a method to compare the different projects. The scenarios were as follows:      Scenario 1: Mobility: a smartphone user walks out of Starbucks and starts driving.  What changes from the earlier picture?      Scenario 2: Phishing: what assurance does the user have that the data they receive when surfing is not spoofed?      Scenario 3: Operations: How does the job of a network operator differ in your architecture from how it is today?      Scenario 4: Transparency:  With a search warrant for a router, what can you discover about an ISP's users?      Scenario 5: DDoS: suppose you had 1M zombies, what is the easiest way to disrupt communications in your system?      Scenario 6: Data: a million people with cellphone cameras arrive in Times Square for New Year's Eve.   They are all both content producers and consumers.  How does your architecture support massive and spontaneous traffic production and consumption, as well as the potential for added value network services in this setting?      Scenario 7: Byzantine resilience: if network state becomes corrupted, what is the worst case outcome in your system?
