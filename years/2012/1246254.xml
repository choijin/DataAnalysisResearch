<AbstractNarration>This project is supporting a special themed issue of The Earth Scientist, the quarterly journal of the National Earth Science Teachers Association (NESTA) on climate-change education. The issue includes submissions from climate-change educators that compile existing resources, many recently developed, that are suitable for K-12 Earth- and Space-Science classrooms and based on peer-reviewed science. The issue is being distributed at NESTA and the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) events and conferences and is available for download at the Windows on the Universe website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to  develop a special themed issue of the National Earth Science Teachers  AssociationÆs (NESTAÆs) quarterly journal, The Earth Scientist (TES) on the  topic of climate change education.  The issue is available at http://www.nestanet.org/cms/sites/default/files/journal/Fall12.pdf.  In order to accomplish this, we shared information  about the opportunity widely  within the federally-funded climate  change education community.  We also  developed a process for peer  review of submissions, to ensure adequate  vetting of submissions and a  high-quality product.  We solicited  reviewers from among the K-12 Earth  and space science educator, climate  change education and scientific  communities to participate in this  process.  We received a total of 10  submissions for the issue, six of  which passed peer review and were  published in the Fall 2012 issue of  TES (Volume XXVIII &bull; Issue 3.).  The six papers included in the issue are:  The Carbon  Cycle Game: A Regionally Relevant Activity to Introduce Climate Change by  Jo&euml;lle Clark, Jane Marks, PhD, Carol Haden, EdD, Melinda Bell, Bruce  Hungate, PhD  The ELF (Environmental Literacy Framework with a Focus on  Climate  Change): Building Climate Change Science Knowledge Through  Hands-On  Activities, by Louise Huffman, Jean Pennycook, Frank Rack, and  Betsy  Youngman  EarthLabs - An Earth System Science Laboratory Module  to Facilitate  Teaching About Climate Change, by Tamara Ledley, Nick  Haddad, Erin  Bardar, Katherine Ellins, Karen McNeal, and Julie Libarkin  Teaching Controversy, by Mark McCaffrey  Lesson Plans and Classroom  Activities from the Climate Literacy  Ambassadors Community, by Margaret  Mooney, Steve Ackerman, Galen  McKinley, Tom Whittaker, and Tommy  Jasmin  Predicting the Impacts of Climate Change on Ecosystems: A High  School  Curricular Module, by Vanessa Peters, Tanya Dewey, Andrew Kwok,  George  Hammond, and Nancy Songer   The journal issue was printed and  distributed to NESTA members, as well  as made freely available to  educators at NESTA professional  development events across the country.   We also reached out to the  climate change education community, to find  out if any groups wanted  copies to distribute in their workshops.   Several groups asked for  copies, and we sent along the number of  requested copies to each of  them.  Finally, we posted the issue on the  NESTA website as openly  available, and shared it by email with the  climate change education  community for open distribution.  Intellectual Merit:  The project resulted in a compendium of scientifically accurate educational resources on climate change for K-12 science educators.   Broader Impacts:  In addition to providing valuable  resources to K-12 educators seeking  quality resources to teach about  climate change, we also developed a  peer review process for our journal  which we have continued to use  since the production of the Fall 2012  issue.  This has provided a  significant improvement in the journal, and  also helps to engage a  broader community in our publications and  organizations, all benefiting  the qualify of the resources and programs  we provide K-12 teachers.
