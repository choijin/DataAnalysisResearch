<AbstractNarration>This is a workshop to bring together the Users of Experimental Rock&lt;br/&gt;Deformation data with the Practitioners of Experimental Rock Deformation. Users are those who&lt;br/&gt;make direct use of laboratory data in models, calculations, or in the interpretation of geological&lt;br/&gt;or geophysical observations. Practitioners are those actively engaged in laboratory-based&lt;br/&gt;experimental research on the mechanical properties of Earth materials; some Practitioners are&lt;br/&gt;also Users. The purpose of the workshop is to assess the scientific and technical needs of these&lt;br/&gt;groups and to begin a process of responding to those needs. There are important research&lt;br/&gt;objectives in geomechanics that can be identified, from both a scientific and societal&lt;br/&gt;perspective, and there are recognized needs for technological and community resources in&lt;br/&gt;order to meet the scientific needs. The workshop will focus on geomechanics of the relatively&lt;br/&gt;shallow portion of the Earth. This will include the mechanics of the upper mantle and lower-to-mid crust, the seismogenic zone, accretionary wedges, energy- and waste-related subsurface systems, and the role of thermalhydro-chemical processes in all these environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will support attendance by early career scientists and students. The results will be broadly disseminated and will produce a strategic, community-building document for rock deformation.</AbstractNarration>
