<AbstractNarration>In an effort to advance Continental Scientific Drilling in the USA, DOSECC is organising a&lt;br/&gt;series of topical workshops. The workshop proposed here has two objectives, firstly to advance&lt;br/&gt;scientific studies of active high-enthalpy hydrothermal systems, and secondly to foster collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between academic scientists, government agencies, and industry. Such collaboration is highly&lt;br/&gt;desirable because the scientific study of active hydrothermal systems requires drilling and&lt;br/&gt;sampling boreholes whose costs far exceed budgets normally available to academic scientists,&lt;br/&gt;whereas the geothermal industry commonly drills wells that access them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) represents an excellent example of such a collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;From the outset academic scientists have been deeply involved in that project. The IDDP is&lt;br/&gt;investigating the economic feasibility of producing electricity from supercritical geothermal&lt;br/&gt;reservoirs. To test this concept an industry consortium planned to drilled a deep well in&lt;br/&gt;the volcanic caldera of Krafla. However drilling had to be terminated at 2.1 km depth when&lt;br/&gt;900C rhyolite magma flowed into the well. Today the well is highly productive, estimated to&lt;br/&gt;be capable of generating &gt;35 MWe of dry superheated steam at a well-head temperature of ~440C.&lt;br/&gt;There is a significant undeveloped potential for developing high-enthalpy geothermal systems&lt;br/&gt;in the western USA, Hawaii and Alaska. Although drilling into these deep unconventional geothermal&lt;br/&gt;reservoirs is more expensive, the higher productivity per well should offset this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to compile and distribute a report that addresses industry's interest, abilities,&lt;br/&gt;research needs, and potential for collaborative projects that drill high-enthalpy systems.&lt;br/&gt;This will be based on the results of a broadly distributed questionnaire, and a three day&lt;br/&gt;workshop with participation by industry, government and university scientists. Hopefully this&lt;br/&gt;will help create a national program that enhances the scientific, technological and institutional&lt;br/&gt;basis for the development of new and more economic sources of alternative energy.</AbstractNarration>

Future growth in developing geothermal resources is limited by the economics of competing sources of energy. Today a typical geothermal well, costing several million dollars, produces a mixture of hot water and steam at 200-300oC, enough to generate only about 5-10 MW of electric power. The workshop discussed increasing the power output of geothermal wells by an order of magnitude by drilling deeper to reach higher temperatures (&gt;400oC), where water exhibits supercritical behavior.  Not only do supercritical fluids have higher energy than conventional geothermal reservoir fluids, but they also exhibit extremely high rates of mass transport.

Although drilling to reach these deeper hotter geothermal zones is more expensive, this is offset by the higher productivity per well, thus reducing the number of wells needed for a given power output.  Plans for resource assessment and drilling into such higher temperature geothermal systems are already underway in Iceland, New Zealand, and Japan. There is also considerable potential for similar developments in countries that already have a large production of electricity from geothermal steam, such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico, and Italy, as well as the USA.  The most advanced national program is the Iceland Deep Drilling Project, (IDDP).  In 2009 the IDDP drilled the first well  in a planned series of three 4 to 5 km deep wells in search for supercritical geothermal resources.  However, drilling was terminated at only 2.1 km depth when 900oC rhyolite magma flowed into the well, creating the hottest geothermal well in the world.  Figure 1 shows sub-critical, superheated steam flowing from that well at a temperature of 450oC at the surface sufficient to generate ~38 MW of electricity.  The next well in the series will be drilled in the summer of 2016 on the Reykjanes Peninsula which is the landward extension of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge into southwest Iceland.  To meet the higher costs of drilling deeper, the IDDP is funded by a consortium of Icelandic energy companies and the Icelandic Energy Authority, a government agency, plus StatOil, an international oil and gas company. The science program of the IDDP was largely supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP).  Projects comparable, but differing in approach to the IDDP, are also underway in both Japan and New Zealand.

The plan is to use a combination of government and industry funding to begin drilling in two or three years. A similarly ambitious project is underway in New Zealand. HADES (Hotter and Deeper Exploration Science) is a long- term program of geothermal exploration that aims to use geological, geochemical and geophysical data to assess the resource potential of up to 7 km deep geothermal systems in the Taupo Volcanic Zone.
