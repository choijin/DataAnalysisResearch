<AbstractNarration>Many objects in our Galaxy and in the universe are difficult to observe because their light is obscured by dust between earth and the objects. This is a particular problem for observing in the visual part of the spectrum as the dust is very effective at absorbing and effectively blocking visual light.  In order to study objects embedded in dust (often true of the environments where stars and planets are initially formed) telescopes must look in the infrared part of the spectrum as infrared light can more readily penetrate through dust.  Dr. Dan Jaffe and his collaborators at the University of Texas at Austin have developed a new technology infrared spectrograph.  Spectrographs disperse the light into a band of colors (much like a rainbow) and the resulting "spectrum" can be analyzed to reveal the presence of and identify various atoms and molecules and also to measure the velocities that objects have relative to earth.  Dr. Jaffe has developed a new type of diffraction grating (the optical element that disperses the light into its spectrum) that is much more compact and efficient  than standard gratings.  Thus the new spectrograph is smaller and less expensive than spectrographs of similar capabilities.  The new spectrograph will be installed on the McDonald Observatory 2.7-meter telescope for commissioning and initial science verification.  Discussions are underway with NSF-funded observatories Gemini and NOAO about the possibility of putting the spectrograph on their larger telescopes which are available to all astronomers though a competivie merit-review process.  NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences is funding this work through the Major Research Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

IGRINS visited the DCT in year 5 and then returned to McDonald Observatory. The instrument is being used for a broad range of science and there have been 25 published papers in refereed journals based on IGRINS observations.

The IGRINS team assists all observers to improve the operation and data quality, including queue observing at the DCT.     Broader Impacts:  IGRINS had &gt;500 scheduled nights on the telescopes.  The observations were carried out by a broad base of UT and Korean astronomers as well as a variety of national and international institutions.  As the reputation of IGRINS grows, we expect to broaden the user base even further.  We are reaching out to the astronomical community through an IGRINS newsletter, circulated every trimester, and through talks by team members at other institutions or in national and international meetings including the "Extreme Precision Velocity" meeting (July 2015), the "30 Years of Photodissociation Regions" meeting (June 2015), the 50th Anniversary Meeting of the Korean Astronomical Society (April 2015), and Cool Stars 19 in Uppsala Sweden (June 2016).  We have now been awarded a Gemini-South Large and Long Program to take IGRINS there in 2018A. This will not be funded by this MRI grant, but is a natural progression of the mobility that this MRI provides to IGRINS.  We have made good progress on a joint Korean-UT program to produce a large catalog of H and K spectra of MK standard stars across the HR diagram.  This dataset will be reduced and made available to the astronomical community.  We have now completed the data taking and are working on publication of that data.  There have been three IGRINS Postdocs. Dr. Mike Pavel was the first IGRINS Postdoc and he oversaw the instrument development and early commissioning. Dr. Gregory Mace was the second IGRINS postdoc, and he completed commissioning and managed the instrument along with the Korean Postdoc from KASI (Dr. Hwihyun Kim). The third IGRINS Postdoc is Dr. Kimberly Sokal, who has taken over the science and observational requirements of the instrument. The primary graduate student on this grant, Kyle Kaplan, has completed his PhD and is now a postdoc at the University of Arizona.
