<AbstractNarration>It is critically important for engineering graduates to have the appropriate knowledge to respond to the nation's energy need.  This project will create interactive web based visualization materials and tools and will evaluate their effectiveness for enhancing student understanding of fuel cell theory and design. This will provide a greater number of engineering graduates who possess the required abilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interactive nature of the web based materials will enable students to easily navigate the learning materials so they can investigate areas of interest to them. This will increase student interest, retention and amount of time spent learning. An interactive forum tool will also allow active learning to be implemented more easily in a classroom setting.  Active learning is a proven method for enhancing student learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Products from this project include interactive fuel cell learning materials that can be implemented nationally. Another product is an innovative material navigation system enabling students to easily identify materials that interest them. This navigation system will contribute to more time studying, and increase student retention. An interactive forum being developed will help instructors create active classrooms that will enhance student learning. The project also includes data driven assessment and evaluation of the effectiveness of interactive visualization materials on student learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project is to develop and assess an interconnected and interactive software package for students to better understand fuel cell technologies from a system perspective.  There are five levels in this visualization module including "introduction", "application", "fuel cell subsystem", "cell level", and "fuel cell science".   In these modules, visualization and hardware demonstration videos are included.  Three tools were developed to assess student learning, motivation and the relationship between learning styles and the effect of using the modules. The researchers implemented the three completed modules in two large upper level engineering classes in 2014-15 and in 2015-16.  Students using the modules scored higher on the posttest than the pre-test. Students who used the modules showed higher motivation on the post-survey than the pre-survey. Thus, interactive visualization modules is effective in terms of students? learning, and this concept can be extended to other engineering fields. The research findings have been published in 1 journal and 2 conference papers.  This Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.
