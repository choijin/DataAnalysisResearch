<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a three-dimensional (3D) scanning laser vibrometer (SLV) system. This instrument features precise, automatic, and rapid measurements of 3D surface vibrations of complicated 3D structures. It acquires data in a noncontact manner with a broad bandwidth, wide measurement range, and high resolution. The research that will be pursued with this diverse instrument can be grouped into three thrust areas: i) model validation, design, and testing; ii) vibration-based damage detection and health monitoring; and iii) renewable energy and energy harvesting. Acquisition of the equipment will enable researchers to work together to address challenging problems in damage detection and health monitoring, or renewable energy and energy harvesting, and their collaboration will foster opportunities for breakthroughs in these multi-disciplinary fields. Various health monitoring applications will be investigated. New damage detection methods that integrate such diverse disciplines as vibrations, fracture mechanics, composite materials, ultrasonics, laser vibrometry, system identification, and signal processing will be developed. The development of a new all-mechanical speed converter will enable generation of grid-compatible electricity from wind, water, and tidal energy, and produce a large torque at a low speed for vehicles. New theories in joint mechanics, machine dynamics, fracture mechanics, system identification, and signal processing, as well as new designs in various applications, will be developed and validated. Other examples of research cover a diverse range of topics including turbine blades, flexible multibody dynamics, satellites, compliant mechanisms, thin-walled structures, and microscale resonators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acquisition of the equipment will greatly improve research infrastructure and promote collaborative research among universities, government labs, and industry. Since a 3D SLV can visually demonstrate the 3D vibrations of a structure under different excitations in an engaging and intuitive fashion, it is ideally suited for educational purposes for students at all levels, from high school students to Ph.D. students. The equipment will be incorporated into various undergraduate and graduate courses at UMBC and other universities; test samples and results will be shared. Underrepresented students in such programs as a summer program for high school students in the Baltimore region and the Meyerhoff Scholars Program will have opportunities to use the equipment. The research results on a diverse range of topics will benefit society and various industries by advancing technical knowledge, and will especially impact the infrastructure health monitoring and energy initiatives.</AbstractNarration>
