<AbstractNarration>Over five decades the large scale properties of the solar wind have been described. These observations have shown that the solar wind flow is turbulent. This research project will refine the description of the solar wind by separating the ordered and disordered structures in the solar wind. The proposal posits that hypothesis that space weather is strongly influenced by the cumulative effects of many small disturbances. The researchers are interested in learning if the properties of the turbulent flows in the solar wind are biased by the presence of small scale "fossil" structures whose source is the Sun. The team has proposed to develop and use a series of analysis techniques not currently used in space physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will support graduate students including training them to use the new techniques. The characterization of the solar wind will be useful for others in studying space weather at Earth.</AbstractNarration>

The solar wind is a supersonic plasma (ionized gas) blowing out from the Sun and filling the solar system.

Learning about the properties and origin of this structure is important for at least two reasons: (1) the structure affects the Earth (for example the Earth?s aurora turn on and off as the solar-wind structures pass the Earth) and (2) the structure may carry scientific clues about processes acting at the solar surface (a region where spacecraft measurements can?t be made).     The standard picture of solar wind structure is that it is a manifestation of active flow turbulence in the wind, with the turbulence pulling the solar-wind magnetic-field lines into large eddy structures.
