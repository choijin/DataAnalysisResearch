<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a "rectenna" device that simultaneously collects and rectifies solar radiation from infrared to visible. The approach is to use selective atomic layer deposition, a process developed by the investigators, which is capable of fabricating arrays of thousands of nanoscopic, geometrically-asymmetric tunnel junctions in a reproducible manner. An integrated program of device fabrication, characterization, and numerical modeling will provide insight into device design aimed at creating larger arrays (to harness more power), and smaller junction gaps (to reach the visible spectrum).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Until the advent of selective atomic layer deposition, developed by the present team of researchers, it has not been possible to fabricate practical and reproducible rectenna arrays that can harness solar energy from the infrared through the visible. The fabrication, characterization, and modeling of the proposed rectenna arrays will lead to increased understanding of the physical processes underlying these devices, which will add greatly to the fields of solid-state device physics and solar power conversion technology research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The solar power conversion device under development by this collaboration of two universities and an industry subcontractor has the potential to revolutionize green solar power technology by increasing efficiencies, reducing costs, and providing new economic opportunities. A large, diverse group of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will acquire extensive research experience and training. The four faculty members and two industry subcontractors have proven experience working with underrepresented groups including, women, minorities, and international colleagues and students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the major challenges to efficient harvesting and conversion of electromagnetic energy into electricity is the lack of a broadband device that will collect and rectify electromagnetic radiation from the IR through the visible (1014 - 1015 Hz).  To address this major challenge, we fabricated 50 &mu;m &times; 50 &mu;m arrays of nanoantennas using electron-beam (e-beam) lithography (FIG. 1), each one consisting of a metal dimer with a small gap (a few tens of nanometers).  By varying the size, shape, gap, and material (gold and palladium), we characterized the optical behavior and determined the necessary properties that allow the nanoantenna arrays to absorb and scatter light from the visible to the near infrared (400 nm &ndash; 1800 nm).  This was accomplished through experimental measurement of the optical extinction (a measure of the antenna absorption and scattering) as well as extensive finite-difference time-domain simulations, which examined the agreement between theory and experiment and provided a feedback mechanism for device design modification.      In order to achieve rectification and efficient energy harvesting via electron tunneling, antenna dimer gaps on the order of 1 nm are required.  To this end, we employed atomic-layer deposition (ALD) of copper on palladium to close the gap down from the initial size as produced by e-beam lithography.  The ALD process adds copper atoms to the antenna surface, one layer at a time, changing the overall size and shape and closing down the gap.  In doing so, the addition of the copper layers also modifies the optical response [R.A. Wambold, B.D. Borst, J. Qi, B.G. Willis, G.J. Weisel, D.T. Zimmerman (2016).  Tunable plasmonic response of metallic nano-antenna heterodimer arrays modified by atomic-layer deposition. 10. (2). Journal of Nanophotonics, 10. 026026. DOI. 10.1117/1.JNP.10.026024].  Extracting energy (in the form of electrons at an elevated voltage) from the antennas, requires that the nanoantenna arrays be electrically connected to an external circuit.  Over the course of the project we progressed from fabricating unconnected arrays to connected ones.  Adding connecting wires &ndash; a "busbar" &ndash; to the arrays also modified their optical response significantly.  Further experimental and computer simulation studies demonstrated the important differences between arrays whose devices are isolated and those that are electrically connected.  The outcome of the fabrication, experimental characterization, and computer modeling of connected nanoantenna arrays has led to an increased understanding of the physics of these important devices and has paved the way for further technological development of high-frequency energy-conversion devices that will have enhanced efficiencies over existing green technologies and lead to a new generation of energy conversion devices.     The project has also provided transformative educational opportunities for two graduate and 15 undergraduate students, and has enabled the professional development of three faculty members at Penn State Altoona and the University of Connecticut.  The work has allowed these students to be immersed in an outstanding research environment where they have learned to become scientists by participating in aspects of the research program, including dissemination of results with oral and poster presentations at regional and national meetings.  Since our studies involved collaboration between two universities and a start-up company, these students also had the opportunity to exchange ideas with other students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty.
