<AbstractNarration>One very bizarre thing that we learn from quantum mechanics is that it is possible for an object to be in a superposition of two or more states at once.  For example, in our experiment we will use optical transitions driven by pairs of laser beams to put strontium ions into a superposition state in which the ion is essentially in two different places at the same time.  Quantum mechanics also tells us, however, that if you look to see what state an object is in, the process of measuring will collapse the system into a single state.  So, although we will be able to "split" ions and put them in two different physical locations at the same time, we will never be able to detect them at two different locations at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fact that we can never actually "see" the ions in two places at once might make it sound like there is no point in doing the experiment.  But there is a trick to making this superposition useful. What we will do, as has been done in neutral atom interferometers, is to put the two pieces back together, such that each ion is in a single location, before measuring its state.  When we put the pieces back together, the ions will "remember" things it felt at both of the locations they occupied when they were in the superposition state, and that "memory" will affect the internal state of the ions when the pieces are put back together again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because ions are very sensitive to electric fields, the state that the ions end up in will be determined in part by the difference in the electrostatic potentials at the different locations that the ions experienced.  Using laser fluorescence to probe the state of the ions at the end of the experiment, we should be able to detect electric fields with unprecedented precision.  This will allow us to do fundamental tests of the laws of electromagnetism - to see if there are perhaps some subtle differences between nature's laws and our mathematical description of them.  We will also be able to probe electric fields above surfaces coherently, allowing us to study things like scattering of electron pairs in superconductors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to create a laser-cooled ion interferometer.  This was a very ambitious goal, opening a new subfield of physics.  And while we haven't completed our final goals for the project, we made significant progress, found solutions to problems, and developed techniques and technology which has benefited and will continue to benefit both our work and work in research labs worldwide.  We will continue to work on our project goals and to seek additional funding to push this project forward.  Our research has led to new techniques to control and characterize lasers.  To address the stringent requirements of the multiple laser systems on this project, we have developed ways to improve our laser systems.  We studied ways to make and modify optical resonators / build up cavities without the need of custom parts, we have developed an inexpensive and extremely mechanically robust laser wavelength meter with picometer precision, we have studied ways to detect and prevent laser mode hops using laser frequency noise, and we have studied ways to keep lasers injection locked for long periods of time.  This project has had a large impact on the education of undergraduate students.  Most of the research done was carried out by undergraduates.  Rather than just serving as helping hands, these students took primary reponsibility for their projects.  This has resulted in numerous senior thesis, presentations, and publications with undergraduate lead authors.  Numerous undergraduates, as well as four graduate students,  have used their experience in this research to pave the way to success in graduate school and their careers.  The work has also impacted how we educate undergraduates in laboratory courses.  In particular, we have used the techniques developed in this project to add experiments on laser cavities and precision spectroscopy to our advanced laboratory techniques class.  As part of this project, I have run an outreach program called "Girls and Light," which has given young women the chance to learn about and experiment with physics and optics over the last four summers.  In each event, a group of junior high and high school-aged young women spent several days on campus doing things like holography, constructing laser interferometers, making and understanding thin-film interference, and learning to program computers to solve wave-related physics problems.  As part of this program I facilitated the interaction of the young women with several female physicists.  The feedback I have received from the young women and their parents was very positive.  The young women went away with greater confidence in their ability to do math and science and their ability to excell in a scientific career.  Several parents told me that their child had brought things they had created in the program to school or other activities to show their friends, and had discussed things they had learned with others outside of the activity.  One parent told me that their daughter had changed their shcool schedule in order to take more science courses after attending our outreach program.
