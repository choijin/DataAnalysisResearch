<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the almost completely uncharted linguistic area of Papua New Guinea.  Linguists see the urgency in documenting these typologically interesting languages since many are on the verge of extinction as speakers are switching at an alarming rate from their traditional languages to the lingua franca, Tok Pisin.  Through this ambitious project, six of the nine languages of the Sogeram family spoken in the Madang Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG) will be documented.  The project involves ten months of fieldwork over the course of three trips.  The resulting documentation will include detailed grammatical descriptions of each of the six languages.  By applying rigorous comparative historical linguistic methods, comparison between the descriptions will lead to a reconstruction of the morphology of a postulated parent language.  This study will allow for investigation into topics as diverse as historical phonology, drift, pronominal reference, and comparative kinship terminology.   The project will increase the profile of Sogeram languages at local universities and will create language documentation materials for use pedagogical use by speakers.  This project will also support the graduate training of a promising junior scholar.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Sogeram language family is a family of ten languages spoken in Papua New Guinea. Before this project, we knew next to nothing about these languages -- we didn't even know that one of them existed! So for this project, Don Daniels traveled to Papua New Guinea and conducted fieldwork on seven of the Sogeram languages. He transcribed hundreds of words in each language, documented how their grammars work, and recorded people telling stories and having conversations in these languages. This work needed to happen soon, because most of the Sogeram languages are dying out -- for example, one of them, called Mand, only has eight fluent speakers left.<br /><br />Don then took the materials he recorded for these seven Sogeram languages and combined it with materials other people had recorded for the three other languages. He compared all ten languages with each other and reconstructed the ancient language from which all the Sogeram languages descended. This language, which is called Proto-Sogeram, was spoken around 3,000 years ago. Don was able to reconstruct 317 words for Proto-Sogeram as well as the language's sound system and a lot of grammar, including verb suffixes, noun prefixes, and 21 words for 'this' or 'that'.<br /><br />After reconstructing Proto-Sogeram, Don was able to describe how each of the Sogeram languages that is spoken today developed.
