<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The overarching objective of this CAREER proposal is to identify the surface fatigue crack initiation mechanisms in nanocrystalline face-centered-cubic metals as a function of three material parameters (grain size, generalized stacking fault energy curve, oxidation behavior) and three loading factors (maximum plastic strain, frequency, environment); Nanocrystalline metals (grain size &lt; 100 nm) exhibit extraordinary mechanical properties and can combine ultra-high strength with considerable ductility. However, there is so far little quantitative, mechanistic-based understanding of their fatigue properties, such as the observed improved fatigue limit compared to their coarse grained counterparts (grain size &gt; 1 micrometers). Accordingly, this proposal seeks to monitor cyclic plasticity and measure initiation fatigue life on nanocrystalline face-centered-cubic nanobeams tested with a state-of-the-art MEMS device, for Al, Cu, Ni, and Au, as a function of three loading factors. In addition, this proposal seeks to identify the fatigue crack initiation mechanisms using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, and whenever possible, establish relevant statistics of the operating mechanisms (such as frequency of occurrence) as a function of the aforementioned experimental parameters. Particularly, quantitative in-situ TEM fatigue testing will be performed to observe fatigue damage accumulation during cyclic loading. The proposed research offers original contributions to obtain mechanistic insight into the length-scale effects in fatigue processes. Particularly, this research program is expected to yield a mechanistic model linking the characteristics of cyclic plasticity (including, importantly, irreversibility mechanisms) to surface fatigue crack initiation in nanocrystalline face-centered-cubic metals. Such a model can provide a scientific basis for predicting the fatigue behavior of this class of materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Nanocrystalline metals are a promising class of ultra-strong materials. The reasons for the increase in strength due to decreasing grain size are fairly well understood, and several plastic deformation mechanisms have been identified to operate in this grain size regime. However, there is currently no satisfying model linking the plastic deformation mechanisms under cyclic loading and the resulting fatigue degradation properties of nanocrystalline metals. This proposal seeks to investigate the governing fatigue mechanisms of nanocrystalline metals using a state-of-the-art experimental technique, and to use this understanding to promote research and teaching in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics to high school students and teachers. Particularly, the PI will create a summer enrichment program, entitled FAMED (Failure Analysis for Mechanical Engineering Detectives), targeted for high school students, that will involve high school teachers, graduate and undergraduate students to develop and implement it. During the one-week-long program, the students will learn about the fundamental science related to the failure of materials in the form of short lectures and hands-on demos. They will also have a chance to act as failure analysis experts in idealized litigation cases whose outcome depends on the correct analysis of a failed object.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The plastic deformation properties of metals are known to be strongly affected by grain size, since the grain boundaries can act as obstacles to the carriers of plasticity such as lattice dislocations. For coarse-grained metals (grain size above 1-10 mm), the plastic deformation mechanisms for both monotonic and cyclic loading are well understood. However, for nanocrystalline and ultrafine-grained metals (average grain size below 100 nm or between 100 nm and 1 mm, respectively), these mechanisms are much more complex, due to the increasing role of grain boundary kinetics in accommodating plastic deformation. Atomistic simulations are great tools to investigate and see these mechanisms but can only do so for small ensembles of small grains (e.g., a few grains, each of size 10-20 nm at most) at extremely small timescales (nanoseconds). <strong>One of the main outcomes of this CAREER project was to develop a state-of-the art experimental technique capable of seeing (tests performed inside a transmission electron microscope (TEM)) the plastic deformation mechanisms in nanocrystalline and ultrafine-grained metallic microspecimens while measuring the mechanical properties of these specimens</strong>. This quantitative <em>in situ</em> TEM technique is essentially a miniaturized version (width: 2mm, length: 3mm, thickness: 0.6 mm) of a laboratory-scale mechanical testing machine that fits inside a TEM to see deformation mechanisms while measuring mechanical properties. It is based on a microelectromechanical system (MEMS): applying electrical current and measuring electrical signals provides the means to deform a microspecimen and measure the resulting stress and plastic strain (see Fig. 1a and b). The stability of the MEMS device allows multiple stress relaxation tests which can be used to extract a signature parameter (true activation volume) whose value is directly related to the governing plastic deformation mechanism (see Fig. 1c). <strong>As such, it is a great tool to combine with atomistic simulations to investigate the governing plastic deformation mechanisms in these materials</strong>.</p> <p>The technique was employed in this project to investigate the deformation and cracking behavior of ultrathin nanocrystalline gold microspecimens. In situ TEM tension-tension fatigue tests of these specimens were performed with simultaneous measurements of the stress-strain curves (see Fig 2). While fatigue failure did occur, the experiments revealed a ratcheting behavior (typically observed for materials undergoing time-dependent plastic deformation). Hence the stress relaxation properties were also investigated. <em>In situ</em> TEM observations revealed that the relaxation behavior is initially accommodated by highly localized, sustained, intergranular and transgranular dislocation motion (see example in Fig 3). Over time, the dislocation sources become less operative or exhausted, leading to a transition to grain-boundary-diffusion based mechanisms. Multiple stress relaxation experiments were also performed and the measured true activation volumes (around 5-10 b^3) were consistent with the observed interactions between dislocations and grain boundaries (see Fig 4). The crack growth mechanisms were also investigated inside the TEM for gold microspecimens of two different thicknesses (30 and 100 nm, the thinner films having smaller grains as well). The governing crack growth process is in both cases dominated by extrinsic grain boundary dislocation activities leading to grain boundary sliding. For the thinner specimens, secondary nanocracks are generated (as a result of grain boundary sliding) ahead of the main crack and coalesce together (see Fig. 5). Instead, secondary nanocracks do not form ahead of the main crack for the thicker specimens; the main crack extends as a result of sustained grain boundary sliding at the crack tip. <strong>These examples highlight the versatility and strength of the technique in understanding size effects on defect interactions and their roles in the measured mechanical properties.</strong></p> <p>The outreach activities of this project were centered on the creation of summer camp for high school students. In collaboration with high school teachers, Georgia Tech undergraduate students, and with the support from the existing infrastructure available at Georgia Tech for running summer enrichment programs (CEISMC), the PI developed and ran a summer camp called It's Make or Break Time.&nbsp; Twenty one high school students, rising 9-12<sup>th</sup> grade, attended the week-long experience from July 14-18 2014 at Georgia Tech.&nbsp; The camp ran from 9am to 3pm daily and featured use of the Georgia Tech Invention Studio (prototyping lab) and the Material Properties Research Lab (MPRL).&nbsp; The overall theme of the camp was for the students to make or design solutions to problems and also break different materials and artifacts to understand how material properties affect the overall function of different products.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/15/2019<br>      Modified by: Olivier&nbsp;N&nbsp;Pierron</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1255046/1255046_10233524_1568588135368_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1255046/1255046_10233524_1568588135368_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1255046/1255046_10233524_1568588135368_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(a) and (b)  Schematic and illustration of the in-situ TEM setup.
