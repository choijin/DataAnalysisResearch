<AbstractNarration>This is a dissertation improvement grant award.  Under the supervision of Dr. Ted Goebel, Mr. John Blong will conduct his doctoral research in the central Alaska Range, undertaking a study of human use of upland landscapes from earliest colonization to less than 1,000 years ago. The primary focus of this project is to explain the timing, environmental context, and nature of human colonization of the uplands, and to explore how the environment and use of upland landscapes changed throughout prehistory. This project will be the first comprehensive study of human upland adaptations in central Alaska. There are several models describing human use of the uplands, but there has been no focused exploration of upland settlement and land-use strategies. The study area for conducting this research is the upper Susitna River basin, where a pilot study resulted in the location of 19 new archaeological sites, two of which have been radiocarbon dated, with cultural components spanning the early through late Holocene. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five specific objectives drive this research: (1) to establish the paleoenvironmental history, and (2) record of human occupation of upland landscapes of the upper Susitna River basin, (3) to reconstruct lithic technological activities carried out over time in the uplands of the central Alaska Range basin, from initial colonization to less than 1,000 years ago, (4) to interpret technological-organization strategies carried out in the uplands of the central Alaska Range, especially as they relate to subsistence/settlement organization, and (5) to put the upper Susitna basin study area in the greater context of the prehistoric record of central Alaska. To address these objectives, the proposed research will include reconstruction of the paleoenvironmental context of human activity through pollen coring and analysis, archaeological survey and testing, and lithic analysis of assemblages recovered from fieldwork and from eight previously known archaeological sites in the central Alaska Range.</AbstractNarration>

A tangible result of modern climate change in the subarctic is a shift in the geographic location and composition of northern biomes, i.e., the tundra and boreal forest, a shift likely to impact subsistence-based populations. As such, this research is significant to existing populations, as the subarctic of Alaska is one of the few regions of North America where Native peoples with direct ethnic ties to historic and prehistoric populations still engage in traditional subsistence practices.

In addition, this study found that volcanic ash fall had a significant effect on hunter-gatherer subsistence practices in marginal upland ecosystems, resulting in discontinued use of some upland areas for a signifiant amount of time following ash fall. On a broad scale, this research enhances our understanding of the impact of climate change on small-scale societies around the globe.              This research has a local, yet still significant, impact on human populations in the upper Susitna River basin, central Alaska. The Ahtna are a federally recognized Native American group with traditional ties to the upper Susitna basin. They have a rich oral history highlighted by a practice of transmitting territorial knowledge and identifying significant places on the landscape through "place-names." Place-names are used to distinguish traditional Ahtna territory and identify culturally valued or sacred Ahtna sites, and as such are an important part of Ahtna cultural identity. There are several Ahtna place-name sites located within the study area,; this research provided prehistoric archaeological data for understanding the environmental and cultural context of these culturally significant sites and surrounding landscapes. These data complement land-use information obtained from Ahtna oral histories, raises awareness of place-name sites, and helps preserve Ahtna cultural knowledge by providing information on prehistoric use of these locations.
