<AbstractNarration>In this project, the team will use two photon polymerization and micromolding in order to prepare functional microscale medical adhesives that overcome complications associated with liquid wound sealants and other conventional wound closure materials. In recent work, the team created two-pronged, eight-pronged, ten-pronged, and sixteen-pronged out of an acrylate-based polymer using an indirect rapid prototyping approach that involved two photon polymerization and micromolding. In current work, they are creating "functional tissue barbs" by modifying tissue barb materials with rose bengal. Rose bengal is a biocompatible material that has been used to facilitate tissue bonding and wound sealing after photoactivation by green light. Resources from the I-Corps project will support two photon polymerization/micromolding of polymeric tissue barbs containing photoactivated tissue bonding agents as well as characterization of functional tissue barbs using biological, mechanical, and functional (e.g., cadaveric swine skin joining) studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wound site inflammation and scar formation are complications that are associated with conventional wound closure materials. An indirect rapid prototyping approach that involves a combination of two photon polymerization and micromolding will be used for high-throughput replication of functional tissue barbs from rose bengal-modified polymers. These barbs must exhibit biocompatibility and appropriate mechanical properties for clinical use. Functional tissue barbs containing photoactivated tissue bonding agents will be inexpensively produced using two photon polymerization and micromolding for use by medical practitioners in a variety of clinical settings, from the primary care physician's office to the surgical suite.  If successfully commercialized, this technology has the potential to significantly impact, in a positive way, the way the health care industry treats a wide area of wounds.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this project, we examined novel materials and processes for creating functional microscale medical adhesives. For example, we are evaluating the use of piezoelectric inkjet printing for creating patterns of biologically functional materials on the surfaces of small-scale medical devices. We have demonstrated processing of microscale patterns containing functional pharmacologic agents (e.g., miconazole and amphotericin B) on the surfaces of microneedles. The pharmacologic activity of the inkjet-printed pharmacologic agents has been demonstrated using tabletop biological studies. In addition, we are examining use of matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation to deposit ultrathin coatings of biologically active materials on surfaces. For example, we created poly(d,l-lactide)&ndash;gentamicin composite thin films using matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation and demonstrated the functionality of these films against against Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. We also created films containing the antifungal agent voriconazole and demonstrated that these films possess antifungal activity. Finally, we are working with pharmacologists at UNC to grow holmium and yttrium films on microscale materials devices; these devices will subsequently be exposed to a neutron source and be used for radioembolization therapy.
