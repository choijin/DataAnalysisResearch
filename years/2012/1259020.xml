<AbstractNarration>This grant is part of a larger effort centered on the Ontario Winter (OW) Lake-effect Systems (LeS) field project, to be conducted December 2013-January 2014.  OWLeS will focus on two complementary lines of research, each tracing to a preferred wind regime, characteristic cross-lake fetch and corresponding distinct mesoscale mode of winter storm organization.  Activities led by this sub-group will focus on "short-fetch" events in which prevailing low-level winds are oriented at large angles relative to Lake Ontario's long axis.  These investigators will seek to advance process-oriented understanding of atmospheric boundary-layer circulations over adjacent complex land cover, factors controlling the location and downwind persistence/spatial extent of lake-effect circulations and associated bands of heavy snowfall, as well as those precipitation events associated with smaller bodies of water as are found in the Finger Lakes region.  Observational assets to be deployed during OWLeS will include the University of Wyoming King Air instrumented aircraft, the CSWR Doppler on Wheels mobile radars, multiple mobile rawinsounding systems, the Millersville University Profiling System, the UAH Mobile Integrated Profiling System, and a variety of other surface measurement systems.  The intellectual merit of this sub-group's activities is centered upon determination of (1) how upwind land-surface and atmospheric factors determine the three-dimensional structure of the short-fetch convective LeS PBL that develop over a relatively-warm, open water surface; (2) how organized, initially convective cloud and precipitation structures under short-fetch conditions persist far downstream over land, long after leaving the buoyancy source (i.e., the ice-free waters of Lake Ontario); and (3) factors controlling the development of, and interactions between, complex atmospheric stratifications embodying a internal planetary boundary layer and residual layers resulting from airmass advection over multiple mesoscale bodies of water and intervening land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of OWLeS will include improved physical understanding and model-based representations of conditions that impact populations and associated major transportation corridors along the shores of the Great Lakes region, as well as extensive opportunities for enhanced classroom and hands-on field project based educational opportunities for a large number of students who will be actively engaged in field campaign planning, instrument preparation, data collection and analysis.  Outreach efforts will extend to K-12 students and college students enrolled at nearby institutes of higher learning.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Pa6">Snow began to fall on the evening of 17 November 2014, the night before an international headline-making lake-effect snowstorm. Less than two days later, more than 150 cm of snow covered parts of Buffalo, New York; roofs had collapsed; thousands of motorists were stranded; and power went out from falling trees and branches. Much of the same region was blanketed by up to an additional 125 cm over the following three days (19&ndash;21 November 2014).</p> <p class="Pa5">The November 2014 Buffalo storms provide an ex&shy;ample of the frequent, sometimes intense, lake-effect snowstorms produced by the Great Lakes of North America during the cool season. High snowfall rates, low visibility, and heavy accumulations have large impacts on busi&shy;nesses, transportation, and health systems in regional communities, but some economic sectors benefit such as building supply, snow removal, and winter sports.</p> <p>To better understand and improve forecasts of intense lake-effect storms, the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) project was conducted over a 2-month period spanning December 2013 and January 2014. An extensive array of instrumentation was deployed via funding from the National Science Foundation to understand processes ranging from the microphysical evolution of lake-effect clouds and snow to lake-scale circulation patterns that organize the convection into coherent bands. &nbsp;</p> <p class="Pa5">The OWLeS project was organized around three major components: 1) surface and atmospheric influ&shy;ences on lake-effect (SAIL) convection, which focused on the response of atmospheric flow over varying land, water, and ice surfaces; 2) long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) snow systems, associated with some of the most intense snowfalls in the eastern Great Lakes; and 3) interactions between lake-effect systems (LeS) and Tug Hill east of Lake Ontario. These complementary components provided an opportunity to enhance the understanding and prediction of lake-effect snowstorms.</p> <p class="Pa21">The collaborative research conducted through this grant (Collaborative Research: Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems-Surface and Atmospheric Influences on Lake-effect Convection (OWLeS-SAIL) extended the observational and associated numerical weather prediction studies by several previous investigators, which revealed much about the complex evolution of LeS. OWLeS-SAIL addressed four important scientific questions, while also supporting the scientific initiatives of the overall OWLeS project.</p> <p class="Pa21">1) How do multiple internal boundary layers develop and interact as an air mass progresses over multiple mesoscale stretches of open water and intervening land or ice?</p> <p>2) What effect does the variation in these multiple internal boundary layers have on the circulation patterns, longevity, and intensity of lake-effect snowstorms?</p> <p>3) How does the interplay between dynamics and mixed-phase cloud processes produce long-lived LeS persisting far downwind of open water?</p> <p>4) How are PBL circulations and lake-effect snowstorm intensity affected by coastal transi&shy;tions? The key objectives of the SAIL IOPs were to take observations during lake-effect conditions, including cases when there was evidence of cold air consecutively crossing more than one lake, which allowed for a better understanding of these boundary layer processes in LeS situations.</p> <p class="Default">During most SAIL IOPs, the University of Wyoming (UW) King Air (UWKA) research aircraft flew stacks of straight and level flight legs at various heights within and above the PBL, approximately perpendicular to the mean boundary layer wind direction. Those observations, together with those from various combinations of mobile sounding systems, vertical profiling systems, and Doppler on Wheels radars (DOWs) provided the opportunity to better understand the evolution of the boundary layer, clouds, precipitation, and circulation patterns from over the lake surface to far downwind.</p> <p class="Default">OWLeS provided a unique research opportunity for students who were heavily involved with operating and maintaining various instruments during the field campaign. In total, 23 undergraduate and three graduate students participated from Millersville University (one-third of the overall total). They provided daily support for the Millersville operations at fixed sites near Stanley and Tug Hill, NY, and mobile facilities such as the DOWs and the mobile mesonets. Millersville hosted over 100 K&ndash;12 students and their teachers at their Stanley location on eight separate occasions, providing introductory presentations and tours of their instrumentation.</p> <p class="Default">The results from this research reveal that lower tropospheric lake-effect elevated mixed layers (EML) can form when lake-modified convective boundary layers are undercut by statically stable flows associated with background meteorological features, such as a sea level pressure trough, and when lake modified convective boundary layers overrun statically stable air. Results also show that EML can form within the upper-level outflow branches of lake-modified convective boundary layer mesoscale solenoidal circulations. The upper-level outflow branches are occupied by evacuated lake-modified convective boundary layer air while within the lower-level inflow branches is found statically-stable air from overland. In addition, results show that EMLs can extend for hundreds of kilometers downwind of their associated lake. Thus, there is considerable opportunity for EMLs to interact with lake-modified convective boundary layers over which the EMLs are found. OWLeS analysis is still a work in progress and new findings will be forthcoming.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/31/2017<br>      Modified by: Richard&nbsp;D&nbsp;Clark</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1259020/1259020_10234690_1504197631671_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1259020/1259020_10234690_1504197631671_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Radiosonde launch at Tug Hill"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1259020/1259020_10234690_1504197631671_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Radiosonde launch at Tug Hill"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Millersville students launching a radiosonde at Tug Hill, NY.
