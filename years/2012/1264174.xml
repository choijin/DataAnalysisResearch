<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT  CBET - 1264174 &lt;br/&gt;Ratner, Daniel  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to advance silicon photonic biosensor technology towards clinical use by dramatically reducing the size and cost of the optical source while enhancing performance through (1) the combination of novel integrated silicon nanophotonic devices designed for use with low-cost lasers and (2) interfacial chemistries optimized for label-free detection in complex biological media?including blood, plasma, and serum. Specifically, they will develop highly sensitive slot-waveguide Bragg grating and ultrathin interferometer waveguide sensors that are compatible with low-cost laser sources. These devices will be designed to detect small analytes (e.g. proteins and small molecules) and larger particles (e.g. cells, cell fragments, viruses), providing the flexibility to support the diverse needs of biomedical researchers and clinicians.</AbstractNarration>

In short, the hope is that these technologies can democratize access to medical diagnostics in the same way that low cost computing has democratized access to information through the creation of the Internet. Yet, an affordable, distributed, and portable device remains out of reach without the development of photonic circuits capable of performing biological sensing in real-world biological samples such as blood, saliva, and urine using low-cost lasers.

To support the community, we have created an open-source photonic testing platform capable of automated testing and characterization of photonic devices.
