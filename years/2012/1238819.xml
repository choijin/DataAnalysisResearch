<AbstractNarration>The Targeted Infusion Project entitled - Development of an Engineering Physics Program Concentration at NCCU - has the goal to design new courses and laboratories that infuse engineering principles and design into the curriculum with special emphasis on problem solving and developing communication skills. Students in the program will gain substantial experience with laboratory methods, data analysis, and computational methods. Graduates will be well equipped to pursue research and development careers in new and emerging technologies in industry that cut across engineering and science disciplines or to pursue graduate studies in science or engineering. The engineering physics curriculum is intended to recruit students to the physics program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned activities are to extend physics-based laboratory courses to the engineering physics curriculum; infuse engineering physics into relevant courses in the Physics Department course inventory; develop new theme-based engineering physics courses and laboratories; establish a 3-plus-2 program with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University; develop the engineering physics curriculum; and recruit Engineering Physics majors. The proposed activities are centered in a department where African American students compose about 2/3 of the undergraduate population. The results of the project activities will be disseminated to the broader Physics community through presentations at meetings of professional Physics educators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the U.S. economic competitiveness, global leadership and security depend on a vibrant STEM workforce, physics programs have been suffering from declining enrollments at a number of historically black colleges and universities. Whereas, more than half of physics bachelor?s degree recipients who are employed in the private sector actually work in the fields of engineering or computer science, the "Development of an Engineering Physics Program Concentration at NCCU" was proposed to attract more students to physics at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and provide an applied sciences-focused curriculum that would prepare majors for industry jobs or for graduate work in an engineering field.   Intellectual Merit:  The "Development of an Engineering Physics Program Concentration at NCCU" grant is a course and laboratory development project that infused engineering principles and design in the undergraduate physics curriculum at the institution. The new engineering physics concentration was designed and launched and provides students with a multidisciplinary perspective while developing basic engineering skills and fostering an understanding of basic engineering concepts.  Engineering design in the curriculum targets electronics and laser systems engineering; nano materials science; computation and simulation; and instrumentation and measurement. Students get substantial experience with laboratory methods, data analysis, and computation.  Although, there were existing 3+2 dual physics/engineering degree programs between NCCU and a local private university and a distant out-of-state university, the very high educational costs to NCCU students in transitioning to those partner institutions significantly limited the number of students who can afford to participate. From this project, two new 3+2 dual degree programs were established between physics at NCCU and engineering at North Carolina State University (NC State) and are:  B.S in Physics from NCCU and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from NC State  B.S in Physics from NCCU and B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from NC State  NCCU and NC State are two of the 16 constituent institutions that make up the multi-campus University of North Carolina system of universities for the state of North Carolina, and with the educational costs are not dramatically different.     Broader Impacts:  This project produced substantial improvements to the curriculum and teaching facilities at the university. The existing physics degree curriculum was restructured in course content, core program required courses, and course sequence to better serve students in the new Engineering Physics concentration and the new 3+2 engineering programs which resulted from this project. New engineering physics lecture and laboratory courses were developed to include Analog and Digital Circuits, Instrument &amp; Measurement, Materials Science, and Engineering Design. Requisite instrumentation, equipment, software, and tools were purchased in support of the curriculum and faculty training was provided as needed on the systems and on instructional delivery of the new courses.

University approval was secured for the Engineering Physics Concentration curriculum and 3+2 dual degree programs followed by strong student recruitment effort. The total enrollment in the NCCU physics program has increased substantially with the increase in numbers coming from new freshman and community college transfer students.
