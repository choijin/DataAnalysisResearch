<AbstractNarration>To engage undergraduate students in problem-based learning relevant to environmental issues in their own urban communities, this project is creating, implementing, and evaluating new curricular materials focused on student investigations of water pollution at three EPA Superfund sites in New York City. The project involves students enrolled in three courses at different levels (science majors studying instrumental analysis, non-science majors studying environmental science, and senior students participating in research internships) at John Jay College of the City University of New York, which is the largest four-year, Hispanic-serving institution in the Northeast. These students work together to collect, analyze, interpret, and report out on data that have been collected from the Superfund sites. Student learning objectives that are being evaluated as part of the project include: development of collaborative learning skills that help students understand how to communicate their ideas and how shared responsibilities play important roles in science; and student understanding of the process of science, including how scientists reason with data. The curriculum and instruction being developed is a working model for colleges and universities, including five current partner community colleges in the NY City area, who are interested in bridging the gap between research scientists and science-informed citizens.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The central goal of this project was to create, implement and evaluate curricula that connect STEM, the environment and civic responsibility involving three different cohorts of students: environmental science students (non-science major); analytical chemistry students (science major) and upper-level science research students.</p> <p>The design of new curriculum focused on actively engaging students in problem-based learning relevant to environmental issues in their urban communities in and around Manhattan, NY where our college is located.&nbsp; Our curriculum design included new laboratory field work experiences and research for three cohorts of students who previously had never worked together. &nbsp;We approached this by requiring students to plan for field work within their cohort, and to share their knowledge and skills with students outside of their cohort. That is, Environmental Science students performed field work collecting water parameters with Instrumental Analysis Chemistry major students, and the Instrumental Analysis students explained to the Environmental Science students their instrumentation and analytical techniques for monitoring organic and inorganic pollutants in river systems around New York City. The research students visited the Instrumental lab every week to answer questions raised by the Instrumental students, and they gave presentations about their research to the Environmental Science Students. At the end of the semester, all cohorts got together for a final presentation of their work.</p> <p>The major outcomes were:</p> <p>1. Creation of new curriculum/teaching materials that have engaged students in their research and their field experience. The long-term outcome is that students understand the value of science for assessing the health of their community and how scientific data may be used to address issues of community awareness. This was measured by the final project that students created for both classes and also by comparing the control and treatment groups in the Environmental Science Class.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>2. During the semester, students saw how collaborative learning can facilitate the understanding of problems. Students have learned how to assess their own ability to collaborate and what it means to work well in a group. These outcomes were more positive for the Instrumental Analysis class where the number of students was 12 &ndash; 15 and they were able to work closely with their professor.&nbsp; The outcome for the Environmental class of nearly 96 students (two collaborative labs of 24 each) was mixed; some semesters the students expressed positive outcomes and other semesters they did not. Students learned how to use new instruments in an authentic environment; however, the level of interest in collaboration varied between some group members.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>3. In terms of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, the outcome was that students learned how to use new instruments and to collect data as well as learn how professionally collected data may add to their understanding of a bigger problem. This was a part of students&rsquo; literature review of primary documents and downloading of near real-time data from professional sources. Environmental science students did think that working as a citizen scientist was helpful for collecting and interpreting data.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>4. For the instrumental analysis students and the research students, they learned the entire protocol procedure of chemical analysis in an authentic environment. They are also trained on how to effectively communicate their findings and results through conference-type poster and oral presentation, and journal-paper-style report.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>5. Research students were encouraged to attend national and regional professional meetings to present their work. Environmental Science students produced a &ldquo;newsletter&rdquo; that they could disseminate to their community.&nbsp; They were required to discuss data collected from the semester as proof of evidence for their reasoning about water pollution.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>6.
