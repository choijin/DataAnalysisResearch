<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award from the National Science Foundation Division of Materials Research (NSF DMR) supports a new international Research Experiences for Undergraduates (IREU) program organized and managed by the American Chemical Society (ACS) for the summers of 2014-2016. This IREU takes a non-traditional approach by connecting U.S. students with undergraduate research experiences throughout Europe and Asia while reciprocally, at no cost to US National funding agencies, international students will be placed into summer U.S. Materials Research REU sites. For 2014-2016, partner institutions include the National University of Singapore (NUS), the Universita degli Studi di Perugia (Italy), and the University of Strathclyde (Scotland, UK) all offering substantial research projects with a high potential for resulting publications. Nine U.S. students from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and from institutions with limited access to research (three to each international site) will be recruited nationally to participate in this ten-week IREU program. Conversely, international students from the three international sites are placed throughout existing NSF DMR sponsored REU programs in the U.S., nurturing the global networks of these domestic programs. Participants are matched with research mentors and projects with a focus on materials science for sustainable energy. All IREU participants present their research at the Spring American Chemical Society National Meeting; prepare an official abstract; create and present a research poster; consider ethical issues of research; gain respect for scientific professionalism, other cultures, and collaboration; and communicate scientific findings.  The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The globalization of science requires students to graduate with practical laboratory experiences, multicultural understanding, and an international perspective in order to compete in the global marketplace. All three are abilities that U.S. employers feel are lacking in the current crop of recent graduates (2008 Association of American Colleges and Universities employer survey). Clearly, a need exists to improve these skills but the rigorous course load for students in materials science-related degrees makes it difficult to study abroad during the academic year. Summer research allows students to gain international experience without disrupting their studies; increases national competiveness, innovation, and knowledge base; and assists in solving challenges of a global scope (e.g., energy, health, food/water). The ACS international research experiences for undergraduates (IREU) program funded by the National Science Foundation Division of Materials Research (DMR) yearly connects nine U.S. materials science students, recruited nationally from diverse backgrounds and institutions, with research experiences at recognized producers of scientific knowledge in Singapore; Glasgow, Scotland; and Perugia, Italy. While fostering intellectual growth and maturity, the IREU experience is intended to catalyze student's desire to enroll in advanced degree programs, instill a respect for other cultures and science professionalism, and provide an appreciation for the global scientific enterprise. Reciprocally, at no cost to U.S. institutions or funders, international students are matched to and placed at domestic DMR sponsored REU sites to nurture international dimensions and establish additional networks at these host universities.</AbstractNarration>
