<AbstractNarration>Technical description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biogeochemical cycling of iron in aqueous geochemical environments is intimately linked to the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur, and strongly impacts the solubility and speciation of trace metals and metalloids in these systems. The research proposed here focuses on coupled Fe and trace metal cycling in riparian soils, which are located at the interface between dryland habitats and aquatic environments and play a key role in the transfer of nutrients and contaminants between upland and aquatic ecosystems. We observe the formation of layered Fe(II)-Al(III)-hydroxide minerals during reaction of aqueous Fe(II) with Al-oxide and clay mineral substrates under geochemical conditions common to submerged soils. We hypothesize that these previously unrecognized Fe(II) phases play a critical role in the biogeochemical cycling of Fe and trace metals in riparian environments. These secondary minerals form fast (on a time scale of hours in model systems, and within several days in experiments performed with wetland soil) and are therefore expected to be a major sink for Fe(II) released during reductive dissolution of Fe(III)-oxides. In addition, owing to small particle size, layered structure, and high Fe(II) content, these Fe(II) minerals are likely to be highly reactive towards redox-active contaminants such as Cr(VI) and may control retention of divalent metals such as Ni(II) and Zn(II) through adsorption and coprecipitation reactions. We hypothesize that the Fe(II)-Al(III)-hydroxide phases formed during initial reaction of Fe(II) with Al-bearing substrates are metastable transitional phases which over time will age into more crystalline Fe sorption products with reduced reactivity towards trace metal(loid)s. We will study the thermodynamic, kinetic and mechanistic aspects involved in the formation of these novel Fe(II) phases, and to characterize their structure and reactivity over a time span ranging from seconds to years. A suite of state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques, including Q-XAS, bulk XAS, and Mossbauer analyses, will be used to address these issues. This project will fill a major gap in our knowledge of Fe cycling in reducing and riparian environments, and will improve our understanding of contaminant fate and transport in these dynamic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader significance and importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 4-6% of the Earth's land surface is intermittently or permanently submerged. Soil flooding causes drastic changes in the chemistry of soil pore waters, driven mostly by microbial activity as soil microbes are forced to switch from using oxygen to alternative electron acceptors for respiration of organic carbon. Use of Fe(III)-oxide minerals in microbial respiration causes reductive dissolution of these minerals, which leads to the build-up of  high aqueous concentrations of dissolved Fe(II) and release of toxic metal(loid) impurities associated with the Fe(III)-oxide minerals. The research addresses the fate of Fe(II) and metalloid pollutants released to solution during flooding. We have identified a previously unknown precipitation mechanism which may repartition released Fe(II) and trace metals back to the solid phase. The precipitation process is activated by reaction of dissolved Fe(II) with Al-bearing soil minerals causing precipitation of secondary Fe(II)-Al(III)-hydroxide minerals. Precipitation of these new Fe(II) phases occurs rapidly and extensively under conditions typical of flooded soils, and is therefore likely to be an important process governing the fate of released Fe(II) in these systems. Formation of the Fe(II) minerals removes toxic metals from solution as well as metals are incorporated into the structure or adsorb onto the surface of the new phases. The research proposed here will characterize the main geochemical parameters controlling the formation and reactivity of these Fe(II) phases in flooded soils, and provide quantitative thermodynamic data allowing for prediction of their occurrence in natural systems. The results of this project will fill a major gap in our understanding of the geochemical processes controlling soil and water quality in riparian systems, which includes environments as diverse as polar bogs and fens, tropical swamps, coastal and freshwater wetlands, paddy rice fields, and floodplain soils. The work is of importance in assessing the restoration of former wetlands (through re-establishment of riparian conditions) as a management option for floodwater control and restoration of biodiversity at sites where (re)mobilization of previously accumulated pollutants is a concern. Our work is also expected to be of major significance to remediation strategies involving biostimulation of metal-reducing microbial populations to immobilize subsurface contaminants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Fe(II)-Al(III)-layered double hydroxide (LDH) phases have been shown to form from reactions of aqueous Fe(II) with Fe-free Al-bearing minerals (phyllosilicate/clays and Al-oxides); however, these phases have not been observed in the natural environment due to limited data and technical limitations on Fe(II) solid phase speciation in anoxic environments.  Potential locations of Fe(II)-Al-LDH phases in nature include areas with suboxic and anoxic conditions.  Because these areas can be environments of significant contaminant and nutrient accumulation, it is important to understand the possible interactions and impacts of redox-sensitive and contaminant elements on LDH phase formation.  One such contaminant, Zn, can also form as an LDH and has been found to form as a mixed divalent layered hydroxide phase.  The effect of small amounts of structural Fe(III) impurities in natural clays and the effect of the environmental contaminant Zn on Fe(II)-Al-LDH phase formation were examined.  The potential for Fe(II)-Al-LDH phase formation from the reductive dissolution of soil Fe(II)-oxides was also examined to better understand if and how these phases may exist in the natural environment (Figure 1).  Understanding the kinetics and sorption products of other Al-bearing minerals becomes especially important when impurities such as Fe(III) are present in the mineral due to the changes in phase stability and redox processes that may occur.  The goal of the first study was to examine the kinetics and characterize sorption products of Fe(II) sorption to pyrophyllite with Fe(III) impurities in anoxic conditions.  Through extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), precipitation of Fe(II)-Al(III)-LDH  phases was observed, consistent with earlier studies using pure minerals (no Fe(III) impurities).  57Fe M&ouml;ssbauer analysis also indicated the formation Fe(II)-Al(III)-LDH phases as well as small amounts of Fe(III) containing solids, most probably a hybrid Fe(II)-Al(III)/Fe(III)-LDH phase.  This research provides evidence for the formation of both Fe(II)-Al(III)-LDH and Fe(II)-Fe(III)/Al(III)-LDH-like phases during reactions of Fe(II) in systems that mimic the natural environments.  The objective of the second study was to examine Fe(II) and Zn co-sorption to an Al-bearing oxide and phyllosilicate to determine the effects of Zn on sorption products and kinetics, and ultimately determine if formation of a mixed divalent metal (Fe(II)-Zn-Al-LDH) phase will form from these reactions.  By understanding how Zn may interact with Fe-sorption, we can better understand natural environments in which Fe(II)-Al(III)-LDH phases may occur.  Fits of Fe(II) and Zn co-sorption EXAFS samples with pyrophyllite show the formation of a mixed divalent metal (Fe(II)-Zn-Al) layered hydroxide phase, while Fe(II) and Zn co-sorption samples with &gamma;-Al2O3 produce Fe(II)-Al-LDH phases and Zn in inner-sphere complexation with the &gamma;-Al2O3.  This study demonstrates the formation of a mixed divalent metal layered hydroxide and further iterates the importance of sorbent reactivity on LDH phase formation.   Because of the technical limitations associated with analyzing bulk soils for LDH phases, the potential for Fe(II)-Al-LDH phases to form from the reductive dissolution of soil Fe was examined through a laboratory batch reaction system.  This batch system used &gamma;-Al2O3 as the sorbent for Fe(II) released from reductive dissolution which was isolated from the bulk solution by dialysis tubing.  Fe(II)-Al-LDH phases were not observed in the EXAFS spectra of the &gamma;-Al2O3 sorption samples.  Other elements that complex Fe and Al or that inhibit the dissolution of &gamma;-Al2O3 were also part of the sorption products, as observed by acid digestion and X-ray fluorescence.  Because EXAFS is a bulk technique, an average of all species of the element of interest (in this case Fe) is taken.  Although a mononuclear surface species is likely the dominant sorption form, other Fe phases may have formed with the complexing elements in this system, such as carbonates, P, S, Si, and organic matter.  Further systematic research is required to better understand the conditions in the natural environment that are ideal for LDH phase formation.
