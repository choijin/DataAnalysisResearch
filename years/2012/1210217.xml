<AbstractNarration>This action funds Natalie Juda of Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego to conduct a research project, entitled "Evaluating the mantle source composition of Antarctic oceanic and continental lavas" during the summer of 2012 at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.  The host scientist is Jifeng Xu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit lies in isotopic analysis of samples collected along a transect from oceanic to continental crust in the northern Ross Sea, Antarctica.  Combining petrographic, geochronologic, geochemical, and isotopic analyses of samples provides estimates of age and composition of intraplate magmatism in the Adare basin of the northern Ross Sea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These geochemical data are fundamental to a full appreciation of regional and local scale patterns in mantle composition, mantle geodynamics and crustal production in Antarctica. The proposed characterization of the Adare Basin Seamount lavas is a necessary first-order constraint for modeling the mantle source and origin of Cenozoic magmatism in West Antarctica and SW Pacific region, as well as the tectono-magmatic processes associated with continental rifting as a whole. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

However, the more terrestrial lavas are variably affected by contamination from the continental crust through which they erupt as well as the sub-continental lithospheric mantle which obscure the signature of the asthenospheric mantle source of the volcanism.  The isotopic system of rhenium (Re) and osmium (Os) is used to characterize the source of the magma from which the volcanic rocks were produced.

The rocks show an increasing Os isotopic ratio in more continental samples as expected with greater continental contamination. Within the samples from the seafloor, there is an increasing trend in isotopic ratios towards the continent. Therefore, data for the oceanic samples also indicate increasing continental contamination landward.  In fact, the two samples from above 1000m depth are on continental crust though still below the ocean; these have the largest Os isotopic ratios of the oceanic samples.
