<AbstractNarration>The project awards approximately 95 scholarships to students enrolled full-time in biology, chemistry, physics, geology, vacuum and thin film technology, computer science, computer technology, engineering, and mathematics associate degree programs at Normandale Community College. It builds on two successful prior CSEMS and S-STEM projects in which the scholarship programs exceeded goals of retention, transfer, scholar GPA, and minority participation. This project provides an innovative model and evaluates its effectiveness for supporting STEM success in a community college, especially for underrepresented minorities and women. The new program, SciMath III, adapts and combines components from the previous two programs which have a record of fostering student success and develops new interventions to meet the challenges experienced in the past. The project is assessing the success of the model in comparison with previous projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project contributes to STEM education by creating a STEM scholarship model with a STEM specific student support program that can be emulated by other institutions.  The model provides not only an opportunity for promoting STEM participation through scholarships but also demonstration of the effectiveness of STEM specific support programs in student success. The project benefits the local economy, especially the high-tech industry by providing qualified STEM graduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project SciMath III at Normandale Community College succeeded on multiple levels: recruiting and funding talented students; meeting project goals regarding student participation and academic achievement; testing a model of student support; helping students finish their programs and transfer; and providing a good foundation for the sustainability of the project elements.  This project followed two other SciMath programs at Normandale: one a CSEMS funded project (2004) and the other an S-STEM funded project (2008). The SciMath III program was organized under the Normandale Academy of Math and Science (AMS), an independent student support initiative that provides scholarships, one-on-one advising, and cohort activities to attract and retain students in STEM disciplines.  The ongoing work of the AMS provides a strong basis for the sustainability of the project initiatives. Normandale has a strong commitment to the AMS as the does the Normandale Community College Foundation which was instrumental in helping establish the AMS.    The SciMath program accomplished its primary purpose of providing financial and academic support for students pursuing STEM careers. The program supported 57 SciMath scholars in four cohorts over a period of five years in accordance with the original proposal.  The average scholarship award per student, per semester was $2872. The intent of the generous scholarships was to recruit and support academically talented STEM students who might otherwise be unable to pursue and complete a degree.  Scholars received incentive-based scholarships with amounts based on the number of credits. Over the five years of the program, 57% of the scholars enrolled for 15 credits or more.  Central to the SciMath program was the additional student academic support provided along with the scholarships. The intent of Normandale?s proposed program was not just to help students pay for their education but also to help them succeed in their STEM-related education and career goals.  The primary innovation incorporated into SciMath III was co-enrolling SciMath scholars in Normandale?s AMS.  Every scholar had an AMS advisor for one-on-one support and activities with their cohorts and the advisors.  SciMath scholars participated in additional support and cohort activities that included faculty mentoring and a SciMath colloquium in each year of the program.  The project succeeded in meeting its recruiting goals with respect to academically talented students, financially needy students, underrepresented minority students, and female students. Of the 57 scholars accepted into the program 50% identified themselves as part of an ethnic/racial minority, 52.6% were female, 47% scholars first generation college students, and the scholars? average financial need was $18,063.   The SciMath scholars were successful &ndash; the average GPA of all SciMath scholars over the project period was 3.51. Of the scholars, 76% remained in the program for more than one year and 50% remained in the program all four semesters. Of the students who have left Normandale and we can clearly account for, over 95% have transferred to a four-year institution.  The SciMath program was primarily a scholarship and student support program, it was not an educational research project.  Nevertheless, the project team was interested in contributing to a wider body of evidence-based best practices in STEM education.   The intellectual merit of the project was "to provide and evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative model for supporting STEM success in a community college, especially for underrepresented students of color and women."   In every category of comparison the results for SciMath III scholars were higher than the results for two previous SciMath programs.   The primary changes among the three programs involved increased levels of student monitoring and support.  Comparison between the SciMath III scholars and other students in the AMS during the same time period suggests that, in most every category of comparison available, results for the SciMath III scholars were better than the results for the AMS students.  We have good evidence that the higher levels of support helped achieve a higher level of participation by female students and higher levels of student success (transfer, graduation, and retention).   The project also assessed broader impacts of the program through feedback from students on their experiences. Scholars evaluated their experiences relative to several important dimensions: their own personal experiences as a scholar, their experience in the SciMath colloquia, their experience with their faculty mentor, and their experience as scholars receiving scholarship support. Surveys of scholars conducted over the entire program provide evidence of strong positive responses to all dimensions of the program.  Overall, scholar feedback indicated that the SciMath and AMS experience provided community, networking, information, and support. In addition to those connections, scholars indicated that the cohort provided opportunities for reflection and debate. Scholars reported satisfaction with faculty mentors and that the colloquia helped them understand what it means to be a scientist. Lastly, the scholarships not only helped scholars financially, they acted as an affirmation of the scholars? worth and motivated them to work hard.
