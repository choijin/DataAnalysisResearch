<AbstractNarration>A researcher from the University of Southern California will determine the water column distribution of soluble, reduced iron [Fe(II)] during the 2013 U.S. GEOTRACES Zonal Transect in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.  The study will focus on two important sources of Fe to the Pacific Basin, reducing eastern boundary margins associated with the Peruvian Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) and hydrothermal inputs along the East Pacific Rise were Fe enters the water column as Fe(II), is rapidly oxidized and partitioned onto particles as Fe(III) which constrain the importance of these sources.  The data will compliment measurements of total dissolved Fe, particulate Fe and particulate Fe(II), short-lived and particle reactive isotopes, as well as manganese and iodine which have comparative redox chemistries to determine the importance of redox chemistry to the strong horizontal and vertical gradients observed for iron in this section.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The project would strengthen international collaborations with scientists in Peru and Chile.  One postdoc, one graduate, and one undergraduate student would be supported and trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are many areas of the world's oceans where oxygen concentrations are low or zero.  The most well known are 'bad places' where nutrient runoff and other forms of pollution have created 'dead zones', often in coastal areas.  However, there are vast undersea areas where similar conditions exist, are natural and have endured for thousands of years.   The combined area of the three largest "oxygen minimum zones" is about the same as the continental United States.    The chemistry of these unique places is very different than in most oxygen-replete seawater, and it provides a window into conditions prevailing in primordial seas before the advent of photosynthesis and oxygen on Planet Earth.    One element strongly affected by oxygen is iron.    In the presence of oxygen, iron forms rust, a mixture of iron and oxygen that is familiar to everyone.    In the absence of oxygen, iron in seawater forms a greenish salt (Fe(II)) that dissolves readily in seawater.     Ancient seas were full of it, but with the advent of photosynthesis, vast quantities of rust-like minerals were removed from seawater, forming large mineral deposits.  To this day, however, Fe(II) exists in oxygen minimum zones.   In some places, like coastal shelf waters off Peru and Mexico, it constitutes 100% of the total dissolved iron.    We studied Fe(II) off the Peruvian Oxygen Minimum Zone as part of the US GEOTRACES Eastern tropical Pacific Zonal Transect cruise. Our project showed that this was the case, and that the Fe(II) extends in a plume over 500 miles off the Peruvian coast.     Our data indicate that Fe(II) is closely coupled to the marine nitrogen cycle.  People study nitrogen in these regions because, in the absence of iron, bacteria convert nitrate to nitrogen gas in respiration.   This reaction  is the major sink for nitrogen in the ocean - including nitrogen fertilizers used by humans!    We believe this close coupling arises from the requirement of Fe by metalloenzymes that catalyze nitrogen cycle reactions.  Moreover, comparison of our data with data from Phoebe Lam's group suggest that Fe(II) was being oxidized in the absence of oxygen, possible by bacteria that use nitrate rather than oxygen as the oxidant.    This is an exciting finding which has implications for the co-evolution of the nitrogen and oxygen cycles in ancient oceans.   Our findings also suggest that the high Fe(II) in the plume may be an important source of iron to surface waters of the central South Pacific Ocean, where it can help stimulate phytoplankton growth .
