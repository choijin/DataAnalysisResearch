<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) funding will support the acquisition of a thin film materials deposition system for materials and Nano/micro-electronics research. The objective of this research is to support the fabrication and development of low-cost, efficient Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films and solar cells research. This MRI instrumentation will also support research at the High Performance Polymer and Composites Center at Clark Atlanta University (CAU) by examining the potential use of cured graphene as flexible substrates for CZTS solar cells. The approach is to fabricate and characterize thin layers of materials comprising the CZTS solar cell device, using the deposition system to sputter the device?s back contact (molybdenum), window layer (zinc oxide), front contact (aluminum doped zinc oxide), and evaporate the absorber layer (CZTS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The use of renewable green resources, such as photovoltaics (PV) offer a favorable and promising alternative to the worldwide energy problems. Expensive materials and processes limit the potential for future long term cost reductions in PV. CZTS is a semiconductor material consisting of abundant, low-cost, low-toxicity elements. The support of this MRI proposal, the PIs recent award of a NSF BRIGE grant, and the PI?s collaborations with CAU, Georgia Tech and SPSU, predicts a successful path toward breakthroughs and success in research and training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT: Support of this MRI proposal will help to continue broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in an emergent area of national need ? alternative renewable energy systems, in several STEM disciplines, and in research and training activities.</AbstractNarration>
