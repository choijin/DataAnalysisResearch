<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research project is to obtain an understanding of how to fully characterize the dynamics of structures by using non-contacting ultrasonic radiation force excitation. Although modal analysis has matured significantly in the last three decades, existing empirical approaches do not effectively address the ultrasonic frequency range (above ~20kHz) which hinders quantitative validation of numerical structural models. This holds particularly true for small structures, such as engine turbine blades, that have very high, closely spaced, resonant frequencies and cannot be appropriately excited by using physical attachment. The project will address several critical needs that are required to move ultrasound radiation force excitation from being a qualitative laboratory technique into a methodology that can be widely adopted by the engineering community. One of these involves calibration and real-time monitoring of the imparted force by utilizing interferometric methods and innovative fiber-optic pressure sensors. Another major task involves correlation of resonant frequencies for structures excited in air and the same structures in water or other fluids. The combined measurement and modeling required for this task are important since the higher intensity available for the ultrasound radiation force excitation in water would allow shorter testing times, improved signal to noise ratios, and the possibility of driving structures with sufficient force to identify non-linearities for damage detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will have a broad impact in a wide range of applications since it will enable non-contact, high-frequency characterization of structural dynamics of small components that cannot be adequately characterized using conventional techniques. Ultrasound radiation force excitation techniques will aid in understanding the dynamics of turbine blades; this is of critical importance to help reduce high cycle fatigue failure, which has relevance to companies in the aviation and power generation industries. The techniques demonstrated will also be applied to hard-drive suspensions, naval propulsive components, and similar applications that would benefit from excitation without physical contact. Both graduate and undergraduate students involved in the research will be exposed to technical and nontechnical problems crucial to industry. A strong outreach effort will be implemented using planned demonstrations to motivate women, K-12 students, and underrepresented minority groups to become interested in science and engineering. Undergraduate music students, taking a general education course, will be exposed to the research results and have the opportunity to study vibrations of their instruments. The Principle Investigators will be developing a collection of videos, and corresponding curriculum guides, that will be posted on YouTube and related sites showing vibration of musical instruments, sporting equipment and other common objects. Outreach will also extend to national laboratories and companies that may benefit from understanding the new measurement approaches and analytical methods created, as well as local, regional, and national media so as to effectively capture the imagination of the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Collaborative Research: Enabling Non-Contact Structural Dynamic   Identification with Focused Ultrasound Radiation Force     Award Number: 1266019  PI: Peter Avitabile   Awardee: University of Massachusetts Lowell   Program Officer Name: Jordan Berg  Program Officer Email: jberg@nsf.gov  Program Officer Phone Number: (703)292-5365     The main goal of this research project is to obtain an understanding of how to fully characterize the dynamics of structures by using non-contacting ultrasonic radiation force excitation, therefore extending modal analysis to frequencies higher than ever before. Although modal analysis has matured significantly in the last three decades, existing empirical approaches do not effectively address the ultrasonic frequency range (above ~20kHz) which hinders quantitative validation of numerical structural models. This project is concerned with understanding how to use ultrasound radiation force excitation to determine frequency response functions and perform modal analysis without contact to a structure.     Work on both flat and curved ultrasonic transducers involved developing acoustic boundary element models for acoustic pressure identification validated with measurements with traditional microphones as well as a unique fiber optic pressure transducer specifically designed to minimize effects on the radiated pressure field.  Very good agreement is found in terms of both pressure profile and pressure amplitude, validating the effectiveness and validity of the new BEM model; typical results from analytical simulations and microphone and fiber optic pressures are shown.     For the ultrasonic transducers studied and used in this project, a highly focused region is found with a focal length of ~140 mm and the size of the focal spot is ~3 mm in diameter. These findings indicate that the size of the generated ultrasound field focal spot is comparable to the tip of modal impact hammers, thus is a good fit for modal excitation. The vibrational frequency response functions (FRFs) of the transducer surface were measured and its operational deflection shapes were acquired to determine the frequency range of large vibration response.      In order to provide more useful measurements, calibration of the transducer to identify its applied force is necessary.  Both time domain and frequency domain techniques were developed to calibrate the transducer; good comparison of calibration results were obtained from both methods.  In addition, an inverse method of force estimation was applied to further calibrate the transducer; these results provided actual forces measured and were further used to validate calibration done.       In total there were 12 journal and conference papers written on various aspects of this work along with 10 conference presentations made.
