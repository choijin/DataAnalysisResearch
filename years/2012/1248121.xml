<AbstractNarration>This project is developing a Northwest Biosciences Consortium (NWBC), a community of biology faculty of all ranks, diverse pedagogical experiences and scientific training who adopt a "bottom-up" approach to the Vision and Change: A Call to Action initiative. We are creating a series of learning outcomes and customizable modules that can be incorporated into any first-year or introductory biology sequence that reflects our commitment to scientific literacy for majors and non-majors alike. We are especially interested in developing course descriptions to facilitate curriculum design and student transition, especially from the 2-year to 4-year institutions. The NWBC also fosters professional development, provides support, promotes dissemination, and facilitates curricular reforms at our institutions. The development of a comprehensive framework to advance evidence-based STEM pedagogies for all students, and the attention to faculty mentoring and support are the hallmarks of this proposal. The development of commonly used (and evidenced-based) instructional strategies based on the Vision and Change core concepts and competencies will facilitate discussions on curriculum development and credit transfers at institutions in our region and beyond. This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts towards support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Northwest Biosciences Consortium (NWBC) is a multi-institutional effort connecting introductory biology instructors from across the Pacific Northwest. Each year we hosted groups of faculty to accomplish the following specific goals:</p> <ul> <li>Align the introductory biology courses with the Vision &amp; Change concepts and competencies for biology education, allowing students to gain appreciation for the scientific process and reflect on their learning,</li> <li>Generate a series of course objectives and customizable student-centered modules for the introductory courses for both majors and non-majors characterized by active learning,</li> <li>Streamline articulation between institutions and facilitate credit transfers and student transition from lower-division to upper-division courses and from 2-year to 4-year institutions, </li> <li>Provide faculty development opportunities and ideas for collaborations among the faculty in the NWBC institutions and beyond.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p>The major accomplishment in Year 1 was creating a culture of trust among all colleagues, facilitating open exchange of ideas. In Year 2 we organized a workshop to help faculty align their introductory biology course syllabi to Vision and Change.&nbsp; At the Year 3 workshop we developed a set of goals, prioritized content and threshold concept based modules for the introductory biology majors course (emphasizing both concepts and competencies), and followed that up at the Year 4 workshop with development of a set of goals, prioritized content and V&amp;C competency based modules for the non-majors introductory courses. Finally, in Year 5 we created a map for vertical transfer and articulation for students and developed a set of student learning outcomes to share across all institutions in the state for introductory biology for majors; our work spearheads efforts on articulation among Oregon institutions led by the Higher Education Coordination Commission. All material generated by this effort (model syllabi, course and laboratory modules, articulation plans) have been shared through the NWBC site on the QUBES hub at <a href="https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/nwbc">https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/nwbc</a>.</p> <p>The outcomes from this network grant have been shared through multiple conference posters, presentations, and workshops. Three manuscripts presenting the products of these workshops are in various stages of development.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>Each year, as the work progressed the number of faculty increased (35 in Year 2, 50 in Year 3, 75 in Year 4, and 92 in year 5). Similarly, the number and diversity of participating institutions also increased at every workshop (7 in Year 2, 17 in Year 3, 32 in Year 4, and 35 in Year 5) including 15 Community Colleges, 7 Liberal Arts Colleges, 6 Research-1 Universities, and 7 Regional Comprehensive institutions in the last year of this effort.
