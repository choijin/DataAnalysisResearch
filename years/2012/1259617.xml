<AbstractNarration>The S-STEM program at Western Kentucky University (WKU) provides financial, academic, and career assistance for twenty financially needy and academically talented students (freshmen and transfers), with an interest in the broadly defined area of biotechnology. Retention and success are supported through early development of a structured cohort, targeted academic and career assistance, and encouragement of engagement opportunities including research training in biotechnology. Established partnerships with 20 regional high schools and regional community colleges in underrepresented counties with significant educational and/or economic needs support recruitment efforts to specifically target underrepresented groups. Regional biotechnology industrial partners are also providing internships to promote workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potentially transformative strategies such as a common advising day for incoming S-STEM students, courses to develop early research and laboratory skills, faculty research and career mentors, and workshops for first year students are unique features of this program. Program objectives include an increase in retention and graduation of the S-STEM students versus the university average, participation of the students in biotechnology training and undergraduate research, and development of introductory research courses. Formative and summative evaluation measures from the program inform recruitment and retention efforts at WKU. Successful practices are disseminated through regional and national presentations and publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Western Kentucky University hosted an S-STEM program in the broadly-defined area of biotechnology.  Over the first 3 years of the program, a total of 22 students were selected as S-STEM scholars, including 17 incoming freshmen and 5 students who had transferred to WKU after obtaining an A.S. degree from a community/technical college.  Our scholars included nontraditional students, first-generation college students, racial minorities, LGBTQ members, and students from Appalachia. The scholars were typically awarded scholarships in the $8-10K dollar range annually.  The S-STEM program hosted meetings approximately every two weeks during the first semester for each new class of scholars.  These meetings were to answer questions and also to share information about undergraduate research, summer opportunities (internships, REU programs), relevant resources and organizations on campus, and other information requested by the students.  We often invited faculty whose research was broadly related to biotechnology to come and discuss their research with the scholars.  The Office of Scholar Development, a partner in the S-STEM program, worked regularly with several of our scholars; in part due to these conversations, the director of the office developed on-campus workshops for first- and second-year students to encourage four-year development plans for all majors across campus.  These workshops are expected to continue and will assist majors both within and beyond the STEM areas.  While some of our scholars remain enrolled, many outcomes can be summarized (see accompanying pie chart for visual summary).  Of our 5 transfer awardees, 4 graduated on time from WKU with a STEM degree and the other student dropped out of WKU for undisclosed reasons.  Of our 17 freshman-entry awardees, three have graduated to date and another six are currently enrolled and expected to graduate on time with a STEM degree.  Two students are close to completing a STEM degree but are not enrolled this fall, making their graduation status uncertain.  Two students left the program due to changes of major outside the supported area but are expected to graduate with a non-STEM degree.  Two students dropped out of school altogether, and the final two transferred from WKU for personal reasons but planned to remain in STEM.   In summary, we expect 15-17 of our students to graduate from WKU on time, with 13-15 of those graduating with a STEM degree.  Thus, approximately 60-70% of the S-STEM students will graduate with a STEM degree from WKU, or 65-75% if the two students who transferred and whose STEM status cannot be verified are excluded from the count.  A total of 10 students (3 transfer, 7 freshman-entry) participated in undergraduate research while at WKU.  This represents 45% of our entire S-STEM population and 67% of the population that reached junior standing (either by entering as a transfer or by remaining in the program for more than 4 semesters).  Interestingly, all 10 of the students who participated in research have either graduated or are expected to graduate in the current academic year.  The program covered the expenses for three of these students as they traveled to national meetings to present their undergraduate research.  Our external evaluator's reports consistently showed good satisfaction of the program by the student participants, with the financial assistance, research opportunities, and networking with other students in the program often listed among the most positive aspects of the program.
