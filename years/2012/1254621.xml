<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program, Professor Connie Lu at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities will develop first-row bimetallic complexes with metal-metal bonds. Two complementary classes of first-row bimetallics are being targeted: (i) the early-late transition metal pair (e.g. a late metal particle adsorbed on an oxide support is typical of heterogeneous catalysts), and (ii) the mid-to-late transition metal pair (c.f. the multimetallic sites found in metalloenzymes). By using a novel ligand platform, diverse metal pairs will be constructed in a modular fashion and compared systematically. Structural, spectroscopic, and electronic characterization of the bimetallic species will reveal intimate bonding relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will result in fundamental knowledge of how to tailor the electronic properties and reactivities of metal-metal bonds through scholarly choice of the metal pairings.  In particular, activation of small molecules such as carbon dioxide by the proposed bimetallic species may lead to transformative discovery in sustainable chemistry. In a related effort, a student-created and community-edited online resource will provide public access to the results and relevant literature of this research field. Professor Lu will adapt the popular Solar Hydrogen Activity Research Kit (SHArK), an outreach program in several high schools and universities, to a solar energy workshop for middle school girls.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project, "CAREER: Configuring New Bonds Between First-row Transition Metals" aims to significantly extend the examples of bonding between two first-row transition metals within a molecule.  Metallurgy is the study of the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, including intermetallic compounds and alloys. Although metallurgy has been practiced since the Bronze Age, the chemical bonding between metal atoms has not yet reached its full potential, nor is it well understood. New material properties are still being sought through combining different metal elements, from which new magnetic, electronic, and physical properties may emerge. The project has produced new tools that enable chemists to pair diverse transition metal atoms, which are primarily earth abundant. The tools allow scientists to study the chemical and physical properties that arise from any given metal-metal pair. Hence, using the precision and versatility of modern chemical syntheses, single metal atoms or ions can be exquisitely assembled to explore how the sum of two metal atoms may be greater than their parts.  The aims of the this project are to: (1) build a library of bimetallic molecules, where any two first-row transition metals can be coupled to forge a metal-metal bond; (2) determine their electronic and magnetic properties; and (3) study their use as catalysts for upgrading abundant small-molecules such as dinitrogen.   To this end, we have reported a vast library (over 50 examples) of new metal-metal bonded compounds; discovered that these molecules are capable of multiple electron-transfers and complex magnetic behavior that is greater than the sum of the individual metals' properties; and discovered bimetallic cobalt catalysts that transform dinitrogen into trisilylamines, an important chemical for the microelectronic industry.   Our scientific publications include 16 peer-reviewed research articles, 8 doctoral theses, 1 book chapter, and a co-edited virtual issue on the topic of metal-metal bonding.   Beyond the scientific success, graduate students have successfully entered the US workforce. Seven PhD students who trained on this project are now gainfully employed in the chemical industry. During their training, several of these PhD students had opportunities to engage in short research stays abroad in Germany with our collaborators and in US national laboratories.   Another acheivement is the development of public outreach activities to educate and engage K-12 students with science. Hands-on workshops on the timely topic of energy and catalysis were developed and lead by Prof. Connie Lu for middle and high-school girls.
