<AbstractNarration>Topological structures are central to many different branches of physics, at a variety of different energy and length scales. Quantized vortices, for example, express the rotational properties of a superfluid system; and, cosmologically, Dirac monopoles have long been sought in the magnetic field since evidence for their existence has implications for the quantization of charge. Here, several experimental aspects of topological structures in the pristine and highly controllable context of dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates are explored. The dynamics of small clusters of interacting quantized vortices and their response to changing environmental conditions, including temperature and the strength of the interatomic interactions, are explored using real-time imaging techniques under development as a central part of the project. More exotic topological structures in spinor condensates are also sought for study, including merons (two-component vortex "molecules") and Dirac monopoles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on topological structures engages fundamental problems in basic physics and the nature of the world. Progress toward answering these questions contributes to the understanding of increasingly complex phenomena and ultimately to its application to problems of significance. Here, one might envision a study of superfluid rotation as leading to the creation of more sensitive rotation detectors. Of more direct and immediate benefit is the emphasis on education and training of undergraduates of diverse backgrounds in the performance of cutting-edge research in physics. This training takes place much earlier than is typical of research universities. The participating students then become active members of the next generation of scientists and citizens.</AbstractNarration>
