<AbstractNarration>The desire to hide the transmission of information has existed since antiquity. This has included the need to conceal the very existence of transmissions; exposing the presence of transmissions may reveal the location of the sender or an increase in the frequency of transmissions may indicate the impending occurrence of an event.  Research is underway to determine if communications can be hidden in the midst of the RF emissions of current and future broadband packet-based wireless networks. These systems use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) along with protocols that adapt to the environment, e.g., adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), Hybrid ARQ (HARQ), and opportunistic scheduling.  This research is based on the key insight that the adaptive nature of the protocols used in wireless systems makes the networks vulnerable to exploitation. This research is discovering those weaknesses and exposing how those vulnerabilities can be used to enable communications by covert ad hoc networks.  Theoretical systems analysis combined with laboratory prototyping is quantitatively demonstrating the information transfer and low probability of detection capabilities that covert systems can achieve as well as their impact on the performance of the target wireless system. The effort could lead to new covert communications techniques. Conversely, exposing the vulnerabilities of wireless networks has to potential to help to guide the creation of new protocols or motivate the modification of existing techniques to make them less susceptible to exploitation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The desire to hide the transmission of information has existed since antiquity, including hiding the very existence of the transmission. The overarching goal of this project is to create new technologies to hide the transmission of information within the RF environment created by packet-based wireless (infrastructure) networks, like today?s smartphone systems.  Current and future infrastructure networks use complex management procedures to achieve high transmission rates; those rates are needed to support a wide range of applications, e.g., video. This research effort leveraged the key insight that the adaptive nature of those management procedures makes them vulnerable to exploitation. This research discovered ways to use those vulnerabilities to enable communications by a covert ad hoc network.   The main intellectual merit outcomes of this project include:  1) Created a definition for a new metric to quantify the covertness of multi-node covert ad hoc networks.  2) Developed new efficient sensing and resource allocation algorithms for covert ad hoc network users operating in the RF spectrum of infrastructure network.   2) Developed and validated the theory to predict the average communication distance between two covert ad hoc network users operating under specific transmission rate requirements while meeting interference and covertness constraints.  3) This research quantifiably showed that a covert ad hoc network can operate within the spectrum of an infrastructure network: with limited and controlled impact on the infrastructure network and with a measurable level covertness.  The broader impact outcome of this project include:  1) Quantitatively demonstrated the potential of covert communications using the same spectrum used by infrastructure networks.  2) The analysis and results of this effort can be applied in other applications such as interference analysis in device-to-device (D2D) mobile communications and wireless sensor networks.  2) This project provided a research opportunity for eight undergraduate students, including three women and one African American.  These students conducted research, participated in group research meetings, presented their results to the group and produced reports describing their results.  3) Two PhD students participated in the research and successfully completed their graduate program. As a result of their participation in this effort they have acquired and demonstrated the ability to conduct advanced independent research. They have successfully published the results of their research in peer reviewed venues.       Last Modified: 09/29/2016       Submitted by: Victor S Frost]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
