<AbstractNarration>This is a project to improve understanding of practices critical to the design of curricular materials for implementation in a broad range of educational contexts. Three organizations - TERC, the University of California-Berkeley's Lawrence Hall of Science, and the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center - will collaborate to explore and codify practices that enhance the success of efforts to design K-12 science curriculum materials for large-scale implementation. Investigators from these three organizations will conduct and synthesize results from a series of retrospective and live-design practice, broad and 'deep dive' studies, with the goal of articulating a conceptual model of educational design for large-scale use. Of particular concern are the processes and strategies designers employ to address key challenges to producing curricular materials capable of having meaningful impacts on large numbers of learners (e.g., to achieve deep understanding and rich performance, to connect to and leverage diverse social and cultural experiences, and to facilitate implementation in diverse and resource-limited settings). These issues will be explored from a variety of perspectives, including: interviews with designers and document reviews to identify structural project characteristics that appear to be empirically associated with scaling success; retrospective case studies to identify salient features and lessons learned from more and less successful large-scale design initiatives for science education; and deep dives (involving participant-observation, interviews, focus group discussions, and document analysis) into sustained design practices over an extended period to explore how design teams address key design challenges while developing educational materials for large-scale use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project sought to improve understanding of practices critical to the design of curricular materials for implementation in a broad range of educational contexts. Three organizations - TERC, the University of California-Berkeley's Lawrence Hall of Science, and the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center - collaborated to explore and codify practices that enhance the success of efforts to design K-12 science curriculum materials for large-scale implementation.  Of particular interest are the processes and strategies designers use to address key challenges to producing curricular materials likely to have meaningful impacts on large numbers of learners (e.g., to achieve deep understanding and rich performance, to connect to and leverage diverse social and cultural experiences, and to facilitate implementation in diverse and resource-limited settings).     These issues were explored from a variety of perspectives, including: interviews with designers and document reviews to identify structural project characteristics empirically associated with scaling success; retrospective case studies to identify salient features and lessons learned from large-scale design initiatives for science education; and deep dives (involving participant-observation, interviews, focus group discussions, and document analysis) into sustained design practices over an extended period to explore how design teams addressed key design challenges while developing educational materials for large-scale use.     Intellectual Merit  Our analysis revealed a number of changes in curriculum materials developed in the period between 2001 and 2010, including a rise in computer-based materials, a drop in comprehensive curriculum materials, a shift to public rather than commercial distribution methods, fewer projects continuing professional development after the end of the grant, and fewer projects that included information about students? ideas on the science topic in the teacher materials. These changes have consequences for both student and teacher learning.  Statistical analyses revealed that teacher supports, rather than student supports, had positive impacts on both student and teacher outcomes. Specifically, positive student outcomes were associated with curriculum materials with a larger scope and with materials that provide teachers with information about students? ideas and recommended instructional strategies. Positive teacher outcomes were associated with the presence of information about targeted standards and recommended instructional strategies. Overall, these results reveal the broad importance of embedding teacher supports and ensuring sufficient scope of content across coordinated curriculum units to support the development of conceptual understanding over time.     In-depth case studies of K-12 science curriculum design projects revealed a number of themes:  (1) successful curriculum design projects work hard to maintain alignment across different curriculum representations (Intended Outcomes, Intended Enactment, and Manifestations in Curriculum Materials), often developing design processes (e.g., tracking and personnel procedures) to ensure alignment throughout an iterative design process; (2) community inputs play a valuable role in the curriculum design process; and (3) while teacher supports are positively associated with student and teacher outcomes (see above), the manner in which curriculum design teams develop and embed those supports in curriculum materials can vary in accordance with designer beliefs and curricular goals.       Broader Impact  We believe this work holds intrinsic value for other curriculum designers.  Our research examining trends in curriculum design helps the field understand how the characteristics of different curriculum materials can shape outcomes for students and teachers.   Our in-depth work examining curriculum design processes will help designers create curriculum materials likely to have lasting impact, by providing guidelines to help new designers engage in the type of iterative work required to design curriculum for scale.
