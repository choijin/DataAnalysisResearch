<AbstractNarration>Support from the NSF Division of Engineering Education and Centers will establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site focused on the sustainable management and beneficial reuse of residual wastes and byproducts.  Faculty at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo will manage the REU site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU program at Cal Poly will engage undergraduates on research leading to the discovery of new knowledge, provide mentoring for a diverse research team, promote graduate study as a future professional goal, and provide instructive and appealing learning components.  The program will support ten undergraduates per year for a period of three years.  Extensive time will be provided for research and discovery.  In addition, specific periods will be set aside for structured learning and professional development activities designed to provide the participants with skills, tools, and training essential for success in research.  These activities include workshops and seminars on interpersonal communication, research best-practices, ethics, data analysis, project reporting, graduate school expectations, and contemporary issues.  As part of the research experience, the participants will formulate a hypothesis, develop a research plan, carry out a research investigation, prepare progress reports using a variety of technology-enriched approaches, present findings to a group of peers and research mentors through a variety of presentation modes, and reflect on achievements.  Assessment of participant knowledge, skills, and abilities will take place before, during, and after the research appointments to evaluate the level of achievement of program objectives and student learning outcomes.  The REU program will engage students on research supported by the Global Waste Research Institute (GWRI), an interdisciplinary organization at Cal Poly focused on promoting collaborative and cutting-edge research and educational activities.  Institute goals are to advance current practices in resource management and to conduct research on and provide anticipatory solutions to the entire lifecycle of large quantities and wide varieties of wastes and byproducts.  The GWRI fosters collaboration between the colleges of Engineering, Science, Agriculture, and Business, where experts from complementary disciplines work together to develop innovative and sustainable solutions to existing and emerging challenges in waste and byproduct management.  Fundamental research to be undertaken as part of the REU program involves waste management, pollution prevention, waste to energy conversion, and beneficial reuse of wastes and byproducts.  Focused GWRI research topics, conscientious recruiting, targeted mentoring, open communication, and emphasis on generating publications will ensure state-of-the art research by the undergraduates, leading to rapid dissemination of research findings into the scientific literature.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All members of society are affected by wastes and byproducts due to the ubiquitous nature of these materials.  The REU program at Cal Poly will engage undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty members, and collaborating engineering practitioners on interdisciplinary research related to the sustainable management and beneficial reuse of wastes.  Advancements in the management of existing, new, and emerging waste and byproduct streams will contribute significantly to the protection of the environment as well as human health and safety.  Opportunities for entrepreneurship will be encouraged through various ongoing programs and projects.  The well-developed dissemination strategy will affect stakeholders at the home institutions of the undergraduate participants as well as the engineering research and education communities at large.  A primary objective of the REU program is to have faculty and graduate students mentor a diverse team of undergraduates, thereby broadening research opportunities for women and minorities.  A focused and well-targeted recruitment goal calls for at least sixty percent of the program participants to be members of underrepresented groups.  Graduate students will be trained as program mentors using current best-practices.  Each graduate student will receive regular feedback on his or her mentor performance to motivate interest in research careers and/or further graduate study and to help ensure successful research experiences for the undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Beginning in 2013, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Global  Waste Research Institute (GWRI) at California Polytechnic State  University (Cal Poly), San Luis Obispo supported a Research Experiences  for Undergraduates (REU) site focused on the sustainable management and  beneficial reuse of residual wastes and byproducts. Geoenvironmental engineering themes and cross-disciplinary collaboration were emphasized  in the projects undertaken by the undergraduate participants and  supporting research personnel (i.e., faculty advisors, research mentors,  and graduate and undergraduate student assistants). The REU site  provided participants with the opportunity to contribute to the  advancement of fundamental research while developing personal and  professional skills important for continued work in geoenvironmental engineering, environmental engineering, and related fields.  The objectives of the REU program were: to engage undergraduates on research projects that provide an opportunity for discovering new knowledge; to mentor a diverse team of undergraduate researchers; to promote graduate study as a future professional goal; and to provide instructive and appealing learning components.  The program supported 10 undergraduates per year for a period of 3 years; research activities took place during the summers over 10 weeks.  Extensive time was provided for research and discovery.  However, specific periods were set aside for structured learning activities designed to provide the participants with tips, tools, and training essential for success in research.  These activities included well designed workshops and seminars on information literacy, interpersonal communication, research best-practices and ethics, data analysis, project reporting, graduate school expectations, and current topics in geoenvironmental engineering and sustainability.  The REU program engaged undergraduate students on interesting and important research projects.  All 30 of the REU participants completed their projects and summer research experiences.  Fundamental research undertaken by the project participants involved waste management, pollution prevention, waste to energy conversion, and beneficial reuse of wastes and byproducts.  Specific projects focused on the following topics, among others:   Beneficial Reuse of Waste Products in Slurry Mixtures and Drilling Fluids Temperature Effects on Swelling and Bentonite Extrusion Characteristics for Geosynthetic Clay Liners Numerical Modeling of Landfill Heat Generation and Extraction Investigation of the Physical Properties of Municipal Solid Waste Impact of Nanomaterials on Biochemical Methane Potential of Municipal Solid Waste Heat Generation in Mining and Municipal Solid Waste Estimate of Landfill Gas Generation for Waste Diversion Scenarios Surface Flux Analysis of Trace Gas Landfill Emissions Use of Recycled Materials as Thermal Insulation in Underground Construction   Strong mentoring, open communication, and conscientious recruiting  ensured  high quality research by the undergraduates, leading to rapid  dissemination of research findings into the scientific literature.  Project results from the program were included in 25 conference and journal publications currently at various levels of development (i.e.,  published, in press, accepted for publication, in review).  In addition, during each year of the program, project participants  were nominated for and selected to participate in the annual Research  Experiences for Undergraduates Symposium (REUS) organized by the Council  on Undergraduate Research (CUR).  By the end of the project, 13 of the 30 undergraduate participants had served as co-authors on at least one project-related publication.  The goal was 9 participants.  A primary objective of the REU program was to mentor a diverse team of undergraduate students, thereby broadening research opportunities for women and minorities.  Of the 30 total participants, 17 were female and 5 were from underrepresented groups.  In addition, fifteen of the participants were recruited from research-limited undergraduate programs.  The undergraduate major degree programs for the participants included civil engineering (10), environmental engineering (10), chemical engineering (4), biological Engineering (1), biosystems engineering (3), mechanical engineering (1), and biology (1).  Currently, 17 of the 30 project participants have applied to, enrolled in, or completed graduate school.  The goal of this project was for at least 15 participants to enroll in graduate schools as a means for further developing their research skills.
