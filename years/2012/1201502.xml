<AbstractNarration>The investigator plans to  adapt his simplified algorithm of Hironaka's resolution of singularities to different types of resolution problems. By a suitable modification of the basic notions  (like order, marked ideals and etc) introduced in the algorithm in characteristic zero the investigator plans to approach the problem of resolution of singularities in positive characteristic. In particular, the investigator plans to apply the resolution algorithm to some special classes like locally binomial varieties. Already in this case the existence of canonical embedded resolution is highly nontrivial and it is a good testing ground for the general approach. On the other hand by using the theory of Deligne Weight filtration  on the cohomology groups the investigator plans to study new invariants of singularities describing the cohomological properties of the fibers of resolutions of singularities and their links. The investigator plans also to study generalizations of the Weak factorization theorem from the point of view of its further potential applications. The theorem allows to factor any birational maps between nonsingular varieties into a sequence of blow-ups and blow-downs with smooth centers. It is  a very useful tool, especially for studying, so called, birational invariants. The problem is that  the resolution of singularities is not unique. The Weak factorization theorem can be thus used to compare the invariants resulting from the desingularization process. The technique of a generalized Weak factorization theorem was used also in the recent study of the invariants of the fibers of resolutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying the singularities is of critical importance in many areas of Mathematics. The Hironaka theorem on resolution of singularities plays a central role  in Algebraic Geometry. It constitutes a basis  of proofs of many theorems not only in Algebraic and Analytic Geometry. The theorem on desingularization is proven in characteristic zero and is known only in special cases in positive characteristic. This is a major drawback for many theorems which rely on desingularization and which can be proven in characteristic zero only. The project deals with studying new ideas and developing new relatively simple approach to the resolution problem in positive characteristic. It also opens some new possibilities in general topic of singularities in positive characteristic. On the other hand the investigator plans to study new interesting topological invariants describing the resolutions of singularities in characteristic zero. He also plans   to further develop and generalize birational techniques (like the Weak factorization theorems) relevant for studying  topological properties of the resolutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The investigator worked on the problem of Hironaka desingularization  in characteristic zero and positive characteristic. He worked on the development of new tools and extension of methods and results related to the problem of desingularization . The investigator worked on studying singularities and developing new invariants which describing them. The investigator studied  the singularities of the fibers of maps of algebraic  varieties.     The investigator proved the following results  related to the project, and showed their applications:  1. Singular implict function theorem. The theorem can be considered as an extension of the classical implicit function theorem to the highly nontivial situation of singular varieties. It allows to describe the desingularities in the reduced simplified form (in any caharcteristic). It roughly states that upon  invertibility of generalized Jacobians defined with respect to some "leading" monomials  one can find generators of the ideal describing singularity in the optimal reduced form on  a certain \'etale neighborhood.   One of the main application  of the theorem is a highly simplified proof of the strongest vesrion of Hironaka desingularization with normally flat centers.     2. Singular inverse function theorems.  As in the classical situation on the manifold one can relate the singular implicit function theorem with singular inverse function theorem. The theorem roughly says that for any morphism of smooth varieties with a finite fiber of a certain dimension d   one can find some etale neighborhoods of the fibers so that the induced morphism on the neighborhhods is finite flat and surjective morphism , that is a d- branched cover.  3. Generalized Hironaka-Weierstarss division theorems. The theorems extend Weierstrass and Hironaka Henselian division to much more general situations.  The above  theorems  are proven in algebraic (any characteristic), analytic and in differential setting.   Another version of Generalized Hironaka-Weierstarss  division, proven by the investigator, allows to show the strongest version of Hironaka's desingularization for analytic spaces using quite elementary methods.  4. Equisingular desingularization with simple normal crossing fibers. The theorem says that in the characteristic zero there exists a canonical resolution of varieties with all fibers having simple normal crossings. Moreover there exists a stratification on a variety for which all the points in the strata have fibers with isomorphic dual complexes.  Another version of the theorem can be applied to proper morphisms of the varieties.  5. Constructibility of the zero weight Deligne filtration of the cohomology of the fibers of proper morphism. It is one of the corollary of Theorems in 4. It is an analog  of the classical result of the constructibility of the  cohomology of the fibers of proper morphisms.  The investigator introduces new algebraic , and analytic tools used in his proofs like filtered Stanley decomposition, generalized Jacobians, Stabilization theorem, dominating monomials with respect to norm.  The investigator introduces and studies a new notion of combinatorial type of varieties. The notion is strictly related to, so called, Berkovich analytifications of algebraic varieties, and can be (conjecturally) understood as a new approach to studying  topology of the Berkovich spaces.  The investigator shows various applications of the newly introduced techniques.  The obtained results and projects were discussed with students and various mathematicians on the seminars and conferences.  The  Hironaka desingularization theorem, considered in the project, has numerous applications in many different areas of Mathematics beyond Algebraic and Analytic Geometry.   The results have been disseminated through the seminars, conferences and websites.                 Last Modified: 09/30/2016       Submitted by: Jaroslaw Wlodarczyk]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
