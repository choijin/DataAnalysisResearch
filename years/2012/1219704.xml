<AbstractNarration>This award (OCE-1219704) will support two NSF funded sea-going programs by providing access to research vessel Pelican, operated by Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON).  R/V Pelican as a designated UNOLS vessel adheres to all UNOLS safety standards, NSF inspections, and reporting requirements.  Historically LUMCON has run an efficient and economical operation to support sea-going activities primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.  This award represents the start of a new five-year cooperative agreement, and for each year of the cooperative agreement annual funding will be re-negotiated based upon the number of days at sea in direct support of NSF peer-reviewed research.  This award is for platform support for NSF programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Project Outcomes 2012-2017, R/V PELICAN  The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium maintained a five year Cooperative Agreement (CA) with the National Science Foundation from 2012 thru 2017 for the operation of the R/V PELICAN (NSF Project #1219704) and included a number of Rapid Response Research Grants days aboard another vessel (R/V POINT SUR).  Over the course of this CA, the R/V PELICAN was able to successfully complete over 1100 days at sea in support of science while maintaining an average schedule of 187 days at sea per year.  Twelve different federal agencies and research groups represented a diverse source of funding, funded these days.        There were a total of 144 sea-days aboard the R/V PELICAN funded by NSF during this CA which consisted of approximately 13% of the total ship days.  Nineteen discrete cruises were included in the 144 sea-days funded by NSF which averaged 8 days at sea per project.  NSF-funded RAPID cruises consisted of 32 sea days aboard the R/V POINT SUR, a vessel owned by University of Southern Mississippi but managed and operated by LUMCON.  RAPID cruises were primarily focused on research activities involved in sampling oceanographic conditions associated with Hurricane Harvey.  This RAPID funding was utilized during the fall and winter months of late 2017.     The R/V PELICAN was designed and outfitted to conduct a variety of oceanographic research missions. The reliability, utility and seaworthiness of this vessel have been well demonstrated. The R/V PELICAN successfully conducts scientific trawling, large box core sampling, piston cores, shallow seismic surveys, current meter array and benthic boundary array deployment and recovery, plankton sampling, hydrographic casts with CTD-rosette system and underway sampling with towed water sampling systems     The NSF projects onboard R/V PELICAN were:  Microbial Observatory Examining Abundance, Diversity, Associations and Activity at Seafloor Brine Seeps?

Based on actual expenses as of June 30, 2018, all funds associated with this Cooperative Agreement have been expended.  Also, as of June 30, 2018, we have a balance of $72,600 in the MOSA account which will be used to support future large-scale maintenance projects that require the approval of the NSF Ship Operations Program Manager.
