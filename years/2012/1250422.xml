<AbstractNarration>Granites are unique to Earth's continental crust, and granitic magma is the source of the planet's largest explosive volcanic eruptions.  Granitic magmas are generally considered to originate in the middle or shallow crust, where water and appropriate source rocks that partially melt to produce granitic magma are abundant.  However, the Athabasca Granulite Terrane of northern Saskatchewan, one of the largest exposures of lower crustal rocks on Earth, provides evidence showing that large volumes of granitic magmas form in the lowermost crust (approximately 30 km beneath the Earth's surface).  The rocks presently on the surface in the Athabasca Granulite Terrane were part of the lower crust approximately 2.6 billion years ago.  This location provides the opportunity to document the magma-producing processes now occurring at the crust-mantle boundary in zones of collision of tectonic plates.  Rocks in the Athabasca Granulite Terrane were invaded by mafic magmas (the 2800-km-long Chipman dike swarm) that caused the lower crustal rocks to partially melt.  The partial melts mingled and mixed with the mafic dike magmas, showing that hybridization processes commonly identified in the shallowest magma chambers are common in the lowermost crust as well.  In this project, the lineage of granitic magmas of the lower crust will be traced, from the origin of the parent rock from which they partially melted, through the contaminating magmas that they encountered on their journey from the lower crustal site of their origin.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that the lowermost crust is a common site of granitic magma production and contamination, and of contamination of basalts that began as continental underplates or interplates.  Major, trace, and rare earth element geochemistry and Nd and Hf isotopic analyses both on whole rock samples and on zircon, garnet, and plagioclase crystals in situ will be used to identify: 1) the source material characteristics of felsic and mafic end member magmas in the near-Moho setting; 2) the compositional range of hybrids between Chipman dikes and melts produced by two distinct melting reactions in the 2.6-Ga Fehr granite, 3) the degree to which the Chipman dikes retain their near-Moho compositional characteristics after migrating to the middle crust, and 4) the isotopic and compositional characteristics of mantle partial melt that underplated and interplated the lower crust during both the Archean (2.6 Ga Fon du Lac basaltic sills) and the Proterozoic (1.9 Ga Chipman dikes).  This study will quantitatively evaluate the degree to which the fingerprint of heterogeneity in both granites and basalts of the middle and shallow crust is a remnant of the lithologically diverse magma environment of the hot, partially liquid mantle/crust transition zone.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Athabasca Granulite Terrane of northern Saskatchewan hosts one of Earth?s largest exposures of lower crustal rocks.  The lowermost crust is generally thought to be dominated by mafic rocks, but in this study area, 2.6 Ga granites are abundant.  The excellent exposures clearly show that the 2.6 Ga Fehr granite was invaded by the vast Chipman dike swarm, which from previous work we know occurred around 1.9 Ga.  The Chipman dikes caused the Fehr granite to partially melt.  The melted Fehr granite mingled and mixed with the Chipman dike magmas, producing hybrid rock types.  The hot Chipman dike magma caused two styles of melting in the Fehr granite.  First, at a lower temperature, 'eutectic' melting occurred, during which each mineral in the rock contributed to the melt. Second, the granite was heated to a temperature at which biotite in the Fehr granite broke down to produce garnet along with melt. The melt that was produced when the Fehr Granite was invaded by the Chipman dikes is the material that ultimately migrates upward in the crust and presumably collects in magma pods and larger bodies in the middle crust to yield plutons.   We used major, trace and rare earth element analyses as well as U-Pb zircon analyses to characterize these small melt bodies (leucosomes) that were produced by partial melting of the Fehr granite.  We found that trace and rare earth element concentrations in Fehr granite leucosome is controlled by: 1) the dominance of biotite-consuming, garnet-producing peritectic dehydration melting or disequilibrium eutectic melting, 2) the relative volume of partial melt produced during partial melting, 3) the concentration of sodium versus potassium in the Fehr granite that underwent partial melting, 4) the accessibility of trace and rare earth elements stored in accessory minerals, and 5) the influence of volatiles provided by eutectic dehydration melting reactions. We have shown that leucosomes from the northern and southern parts of the Fehr pluton resulted from eutectic melting and did not equilibrate with the source during partial melting, possibly because of relatively rapid removal of partial melt from the site of generation. In contrast, leucosomes from the central exposures of the Fehr granite host garnet that resulted from peritectic melting, and are in equilibrium with their source.  We identified the reactions that produced melt in both settings.   The broader significance of this work is in characterizing the melts that give rise to the great batholiths of the middle crust, and that ultimately may feed the largest felsic eruptions on Earth.  Magma generation begins in the lowermost crust and the Fehr granite has provided an excellent setting in which to study every aspect of the origin of felsic magma.  This grant has provided the opportunity for a Ph.D. student, Amanda Van Lankvelt, to travel to northern Saskatchewan and to study lower crustal exposures from a float plane-based camp. . The grant provided partial support for a second Ph.D. student, Jeffrey Webber, to participate in the field research while investigating magnetic properties of deep crustal plutons. The award further supported analytical work by two undergraduate geology majors who are planning, at least partly as a result of this opportunity, to continue their education in graduate programs.
