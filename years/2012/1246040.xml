<AbstractNarration>The overarching goal of this award is to quantitatively investigate lightning and energetic particle precipitation from the Earth?s radiation belts using the extremely and very low frequency (ELF/VLF, ~5 Hz?32 kHz) observations on the Antarctic continent. A coordinated effort will fully characterize individual lightning return strokes occurring in the Northern hemisphere while simultaneously observing the associated ELF/VLF radio atmospheric (sferic) in the Antarctic (and other global locations). A special effort will focus on a class of large-amplitude ELF sferics known as Q-bursts in order to quantify global ionospheric conditions and the characteristics of the causative lightning flash. Narrowband VLF observations of lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP) will be simultaneously conducted in the Northern and Southern hemispheres in order to validate a new LEP model that accounts for the lightning current waveform and return stroke speed. Furthermore, this program critically evaluates whether rocket-triggered lightning may be detected in the Antarctic, allowing for controlled broadband ELF/VLF propagation studies, and whether it may produce LEP in the conjugate hemisphere. The broader impacts of this award are in identifying direct effects of space weather events for the studies by atmospheric and space electricity research communities. The project introduces a new platform from which to conduct controlled lightning-related ELF/VLF experiments using rocket-triggered lightning in Florida, it provides real-time access to experimental observations via the Internet, and it exposes the program to youths through the operation of VLF receivers at high schools in the United States. The dissemination of program results also takes the form of refereed journal publications and conference presentations. The project will train graduate students with the development and operation of the deployed instruments, as well as with space weather science investigations. Use of these data to validate space weather models can provide benefit to society as a whole.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Formally, the principal ourcome of the research conducted during the entire life of this award consists ot two peer reviewed papers.  The content of these two papers differs significantly between the papers.  We will not combine the outcomes of these papers into one discussion but will discuss the outcomes separately.  Paper 1:  Fraser-Smith, A. C., and S. N. Kjono, "The ULF Magnetic Fields Generated by Thunderstorms: A Source of ULF Geomagnetic Pulsations?" Radio Science, 49, doi:10.1002/ 2014RS005566, 2014.  By analyzing the ulta-low-frequency (ULF, 0.01-10 Hz) measurements made by two independent systems located near an isolated thunderstorm that passed over the San Francisco Bay area we confirmed that the magnetic fields were sufficiently inntense to stimulate ULF hydromagneteeic waves in the ionosphere above the thunderstorm, thus becoming a source of ULF magnetic field fluctuations at distant locations within the ionosphere, magnetosphere, and on the Earth's surface.  This source description is a competitor to the traditional description of the ULF signals originating in interactons between the solar wind on the magnetosphere.  Also, importantly, if these thunderstorm-generated ULF waves propagate in the magnetosphere they may well interact with energetic particles in the radiation belts, thus producing an unanticipated loss mechanism for these particles.  Paper 2: Koochak, Z., and A. C. Fraser-Smith, "An Update on the Centered and Eccentric Geomagnetic Dipoles and their Poles for the Years 1980&ndash;2015,"Earth &amp; Space Sci., 4, 626-636, doi:10.1002/2017EA000280,2017.  Although this paper is labelled an update, the updating of earlier results (published by the second author) leads to some significant changes in the conventional view of the Earth's magnetic field, which are discussed in this new paper.  Most particularly, it is pointed out that the Earth's field is not centered on the Earth's center - the conventional view - but it offset by almost 10% of the Earth's radius.  The Earth therefore joins the rest of the planets in our solar system with global magnetic fields: the fields are all offset.  In addition, none of the axes of all these planetary fields are aligned along the rotation axes (although Saturn comes close).  These offsets and misalignments are not explained by any current theories for the planetary fields.  Even the most advanced theories for the Earth's magnetic field, which most people, including scientists, consider relatively well understood, are unable to predict the actual measured values of the fields, as detailed by the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) summaries.  In other words, there is a disconnect between the theory for the Earth's magnetic field and its measured values; scientifically, the theory is in not established.  To summarize, our research has provided new information about the Earth's magnetic field.       Last Modified: 03/31/2018       Submitted by: Antony C Fraser-Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
