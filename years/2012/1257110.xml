<AbstractNarration>Rotifers are critical members of freshwater communities because of their important roles in energy and nutrient cycling. Rotifers have also proven to be valuable models for aging and toxicology studies, and are a key early diverging lineage for understanding the pattern of evolution within the animal clade. Despite this importance, rotifer species remain difficult to identify and few phylogenetic relationships within the clade are well supported. This collaborative effort linking researchers at the University of Texas El Paso, University of Massachusetts Lowell and Ripon College will increase phylogenetic and taxonomic resolution within phylum Rotifera by using a combination of advanced molecular and morphological techniques.  This research will result in a new phylogenetic classification for the clade, in addition to insights into the rates of molecular evolution and the rates and drivers of cryptic speciation within the rotifer lineage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide scientific training focused on rotifer systematics to graduate and undergraduate students at each of the three collaborating institutions. An undergraduate laboratory module, newly designed museum exhibit, and scientific workshops will all help disseminate the results broadly. The public will be able to access an interactive tutorial and key to rotifer species, plus other results from the project via the Encyclopedia of Life website.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phylum Rotifera is a group of approximately 2,000 species of microscopic, planktonic invertebrates that are some of the most abundant animals in freshwater lakes and ponds. They feed on microbes and are in turn prey for larger invertebrates and fish, and so function as an important link in most freshwater food webs. The superorder Gnesiotriocha is a highly specialized lineage within the phylum that comprises mostly benthic forms, many of which are permanently attached to submerged vegetation and have evolved unique strategies for dispersal and protection. Our team of three researchers focused their efforts on this superorder to achieve four goals: 1) produce a molecular phylogeny for the taxon; 2) investigate the evolution of rotifer body forms and life histories; 3) analyze the structure and function of rotifer jaws; and 4) improve scientific training in rotifer taxonomy.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PI Hochberg's role was to assist in all four goals but place a strong focus on goals 2 and 4, which played to his strengths as a microscopist and histologist. He trained 10 students (1 high school student, 2 undergraduates, 5 MS students, 2 PhD students) in scanning and transmission electron microscopy, as well as energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. These techniques were used to study the morphology, chemistry, and development of sessile (attached) rotifers that build protective tubes around their bodies. This research resulted in the first detailed descriptions of the tube-building process for several species and the chemistry of their tubes. It also revealed that some sessile rotifers produce asexual females that go through a remarkable metamorphic process involving the replacement of their larval head with a developmentally unique adult head, thereby being one of the only groups of animals to have two heads at once during a portion of their life cycle. This research has so far led to the production of one MS thesis, one PhD dissertation, numerous presentations at scientific conferences, and the production of 11 published manuscripts:</p> <p>1.
