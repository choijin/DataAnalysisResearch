<AbstractNarration>Predicting and understanding hurricane formation is one of the most challenging problems in atmospheric science. A part of the difficulty in predicting hurricanes stems from the complex interactions of mesoscale vortices in developing systems. This research project aims to elucidate the physics of mesoscale vortex interactions in developing systems and the consequences of such interactions on the formation of hurricanes. The following fundamental questions will be addressed:&lt;br/&gt;1. What are the conditions and prevailing mechanisms for the merger of moist-convective mesoscale vortices, and what is the time-scale for merger to occur?&lt;br/&gt;2. How does the intensification rate of surface winds depend on the variability of mesoscale vortex interactions, such as whether or not merger takes place?&lt;br/&gt;3. How do prior mesoscale vortex interactions affect the size, intensity and asymmetric structure of a young tropical storm or hurricane?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above issues have been addressed in the past, but only in the context of narrow case studies, or somewhat broader studies using simplified models with questionable applicability to the problem at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present investigation will consist of carefully designed computational studies using a state-of-the-art cloud system resolving numerical model.  These studies will involve variation of the vortex parameters, the moist-thermodynamic state of the atmosphere, the properties of the broader flow in which the vortices are situated, and the parameters regulating air-sea interaction. Additional numerical experiments will examine the sensitivity of results to details of the microphysics and subgrid turbulence parameterizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to a comprehensive, quantitative understanding of moist-convective mesoscale vortex interactions and their consequences in developing tropical systems. As noted earlier, knowledge in this area is currently limited to disparate case studies, and simplified modeling studies with insufficient realism. In a general sense, the results of this project will not only advance dynamic meteorology, but also the broader field of fundamental fluid dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will improve current understanding of when accurate hurricane prediction requires the accurate initialization or assimilation of mesoscale vortices in forecast simulations.  Reducing the uncertainty of hurricane prediction is clearly important for planning maritime activities and safety measures for coastal communities. The educational components of this project will include the advanced training/mentoring of a postdoctoral researcher, and presentations at university seminars. The results of this project will impact the broader atmospheric science and physics communities through journal publications, conference presentations, and a research web page.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of a tropical cyclone from its embryonic state to maturity is complex and far from fully understood.  Observational and computational studies have shown that multiple mesoscale vortices may coexist during the formation period.  The question arises as to whether the interactions of such vortices have an important effect on the time scale for development or on the properties of a newly generated tropical cyclone.  The primary objective of this research project was to improve current understanding of the nature and consequences of mesoscale vortex interactions in tropical weather systems with the potential to become hurricanes.  The primary methodology involved idealized numerical experiments with a cloud-resolving weather research model.  Although previous studies had emphasized that the merger of meso-&beta; (20-200 km) scale vortices may assist tropical cyclone formation, our numerical experiments suggested that binary interactions leading to merger in the middle troposphere may sometimes hinder genesis [Schecter,  J. Atmos. Sci., 73, 1223 (2016)].  Delayed or suppressed development generally traced back to medium-range interactions that caused the weaker surface sections of each vortex to become radially separated from the merging midlevel cores.  Complementary theoretical work correctly predicted the conditions required for thorough separation.  In experiments where a mature tropical cyclone formed after merger, the magnitude and radius of maximum wind speed at the time of peak intensity were found to depend on specifics of the initial vortex configuration.  Of particular note, a greater initial distance between the two vortices in the original binary system resulted in moderately weaker tropical cyclones with larger eyewalls.  Regarding the mechanics of meso-&beta; scale vortex coalescence, our experiments challenged the generality of earlier studies suggesting that diabatic processes such as moist convection tend to accelerate merger.  An unexpected diabatic slowdown of merger was demonstrated under a variety of circumstances [Schecter,  J. Adv. Model. Earth Syst., 9, 1366 (2017)].  For such cases,  the affected adiabatic merger mechanism involved the rotations of core misalignments that are induced by the vertical shear flows imposed by each vortex on the other.  If the misalignments are able to become sufficiently large, their rotations cause the vortex cores to converge and coalesce in the layer of the atmosphere where the winds are most intense.  The slowing of coalescence in a number of our numerical experiments coincided with diabatic processes hindering the growth of misalignments.  In the broader picture, a diverse range of adiabatic and diabatic merger mechanisms were found to have potential relevance to vortices in developing tropical weather systems.  Each mechanism evident in our experiments was analyzed in detail using a combination of conventional and novel methods.  An additional objective of this research project was to advance current understanding of the mechanics of perturbation growth that may cause or modify the progression of intensity change in a tropical cyclone.  New insights were obtained through in-depth examination of vortex instabilities in a reduced model that excluded the potential influence of a mean secondary circulation but otherwise kept the essential dynamics of interest.  Two techniques were developed for quantitatively assessing the relative importance of different mechanisms that may simultaneously contribute to a complex instability.  One technique involved analysis of the wave-activity budget associated with an instability mode [Menelaou et al., J. Atmos. Sci., 73, 3345 (2016)].  The second technique involved a subtle procedure for decomposing the forcing of local perturbation growth into parts attributable to Rossby-like waves, critical layer disturbances and the radiation of inertia-gravity waves [Schecter and Menelaou, J. Atmos. Sci., 74, 1561 (2017)].  The two techniques generally gave consistent results.  One notable finding was a potential transition from classical circular shear-flow instabilities to radiation driven instabilities as the maximum wind speed of the vortex divided by the product of the buoyancy frequency and a characteristic vertical lengthscale (the Froude number) increases beyond a threshold within the parameter regime of a major hurricane.   Results from this project have expanded our knowledge of details that can be important for accurately predicting tropical cyclone development and behavior.  Such knowledge can be used to help improve operational forecast models that provide essential guidance to coastal and island communities facing the recurrent possibility of a tropical cyclone disaster.  It is worth noting that this project has also cultivated human resources by contributing to the advanced training of a postdoctoral research scientist in dynamical meteorology.  All significant scientific findings stemming from our work have been published in the peer-reviewed journal articles cited above.
