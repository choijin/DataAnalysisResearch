<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Sustainability science is shaped by two important themes: 1) environmental change can only be understood at broad spatial and temporal scales, requiring international and inter-institutional collaborations and comparative research; and 2) sustainability is based on a combination of theoretical and applied approaches that integrate both natural and social sciences to create operative models, accurate predictions and viable management plans.  Thus, modern researchers must be able to work effectively in teams and projects that span national, cultural and linguistic boundaries; and must be well-trained in social-ecological approaches based on methods and value systems that extend beyond traditional ecological science.&lt;br/&gt;The Patagonian Research Experiences in Sustainability Science (PRESS) project aims to meet these needs by providing an intensive, cross-cultural opportunity for 20 carefully prepared undergraduate and graduate student researchers over its three year term.  PRESS research will center on the study of socio-ecological drivers and consequences of global change and sustainability in southern Patagonia, a Global 200 biome that provides an unrivaled natural laboratory with stark abiotic and biotic gradients.  Participants will be paired with prominent researchers at collaborating regional institutes and universities in Patagonia.  After developing a research proposal under the guidance of home faculty and their Patagonian mentor, participants will travel to join their mentor?s lab for four months, including focused training in relevant techniques, field work and data collection, and data analysis.  Supported projects will assess four main social-ecological drivers of global change that affect southern Patagonia: a) climate change in forests and grasslands, b) land use by forestry and ranching, c) biotic interactions of invasive and native species, and d) economic development from ecological tourism and protected area use.  Scientific training will be accompanied by cultural and linguistic capacity-building, as students are immersed in a vibrant cross-cultural research environment.  Participant deliverables include presentation of findings to local scientists and land managers, local and regional outreach, presentations at the annual UGRADS student research colloquium held at Northern Arizona University, and the joint publication of research findings in peer-reviewed journals.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the social and ecological drivers and consequences of global ecological change has emerged as one of the most important and pressing sustainability research topics of the modern age.  ?Sustainability? in this context means understanding how the natural world is changing and how human populations are adapting to that change, and then developing strategies for mitigating negative outcomes for both human and natural communities.  Tackling this grand research challenge is difficult because environmental change is a global phenomenon, spanning continents and political borders; tomorrow?s researchers will need to be able to collaborate effectively across national, cultural and linguistic boundaries.  The central aim of the Patagonian Research Experience in Sustainability Science (PRESS) project is to help train this next generation of internationally-competent researchers, while at the same time producing significant advances in socio-ecological and sustainability research in one of the southern hemisphere?s most sensitive and iconic biomes.  Specifically, over the three year grant period, 20 carefully prepared student researchers will be matched with mentors at one of several collaborating regional institutes and universities in Patagonia.  Participants will work remotely with Patagonian mentors and with Northern Arizona University faculty advisors to prepare a project proposal.  Participants will then travel to Patagonia to join their host mentor?s lab for four months, during which time they will receive basic research training, refine their research projects, collect and analyze data, and write up results.  Training in sustainability science will be complemented with cultural and foreign language training, and outcomes in both areas will be evaluated.  PRESS provides high return on investment through (a) preparing a next generation of researchers skilled at multinational research; (b) producing publishable research in sustainability science from mentored projects; and (c) developing a comprehensive pedagogical model for international research training that will inform other U.S. institutions as they evolve their undergraduate and graduate programs to adapt to the rapidly globalizing modern research environment.</AbstractNarration>

PRESS research projects addressed socio-ecological drivers and consequences of global change and sustainability in southern Patagonia. Participants received one course in sustainability science and guidance on developing a research proposal prior to spending four months conducting field work, collected data and analyzes results with prominent researchers at the Austral Center for Scientific Research (<em>CADIC</em>), Argentine National Parks Administration (<em>APN</em>), the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (<em>INTA</em>) and the National Universities of Tierra del Fuego (<em>UNTDF</em>) and Southern Patagonia (<em>UNPA</em>). Projects examined at least one of four main social-ecological drivers of global change that affect southern Patagonia: a) climate change in forests and grasslands, b) land use by forestry and ranching, c) biotic interactions of invasive and native species, and d) economic development from ecological tourism and protected area use. Scientific training was accompanied by cultural and linguistic capacity-building through preparation at NAU via coursework and immersion in a vibrant cross-cultural academic environment as study abroad students the semester before conducting their onsite internships in southern Patagonia. All students presented their findings to Patagonian conservation managers, scientists, and the public prior to completing the in-country PRESS experience, and they used these projects as their NAU capstone projects for their dual STEM discipline and Spanish language majors.</p> <p>Overall, PRESS supported 23 NAU STEM students (16 undergraduate and 7 master?s students) to conduct socio-ecological research between 2014 and 2018. Research mentors from both Patagonia (25) and NAU (5) guided these experiences, establishing preliminary research connections and producing three publications to date (3 more in review or preparation), five oral or poster presentations at regional academic and conservation meetings, and two new funded research proposals inspired by this collaboration.</p> <p>Comprehensive quantitative program evaluation surveys (pre and post) and in-depth qualitative interviews indicate that student participants came out of the program with a strong desire to continue working internationally on sustainability questions and recognized that PRESS helped them gain the necessary skills to do so.&nbsp; They reported significantly improved confidence in their interdisciplinary research knowledge and skills. Students? ability to problem solve and navigate complex situations was enhanced significantly by participating in PRESS.&nbsp; Students? Spanish-speaking ability was a critical factor to their success in Patagonia, both personally and professionally and most found that their language skills were solidified during the research experience.</p> <p>Finally, the PRESS project achieved institutional sustainability by building upon NAUs innovative Interdisciplinary Global Programs (IGP) and developing a new inter-institutional agreement that supports UNTDF and NAU student and faculty exchanges.
