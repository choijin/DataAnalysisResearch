<AbstractNarration>The Mathematics REU at UConn will involve a small group of students, approximately 9 per year, in research on problems from several active areas of mathematics and mathematics education.  In pure mathematics typical projects will involve using computational tools or hands-on combinatorial arguments to investigate properties of basic examples that are expected to illuminate some larger part of the theory.  Specific projects will vary from year to year, and may include problems from algebraic geometry, stochastic processes, analysis on fractals and disordered spaces, and exotic metric geometries. The projects in mathematics education will vary depending on student interest; specific topics that are available include research on key questions about the content-knowledge needed for effective teaching and how it can be translated into effective pedagogy, and methods for evaluating the use of instructional technology in large classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the REU is to contribute to the development of human resources in mathematics and mathematics education by engaging a diverse group of undergraduates from primarily non-PhD granting institutions in research that yields publishable results, produces conference talks and posters, and encourages the students to pursue graduate studies and careers in mathematics and mathematics education. In addition to research experience the program will give students practice in writing and presenting their work, teach them how to use software for mathematics (e.g. Mathematica, Matlab) and for writing mathematics (LATEX), expose them to a broad range of mathematical topics through a weekly seminar series, and include workshops on how to apply to graduate school and the ethics of scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  During the period 2013-2017, the University of Connecticut Mathematics REU Site engaged 31 NSF funded students, more than half of whom were from groups under-represented in mathematics, in intensive summer research projects. Approximately 60% of the participants were from non PhD-granting institutions.   Students worked for 10 weeks in small groups with close supervision from faculty members and assistance from graduate students to investigate current research problems in mathematics and mathematics education.  Many topics involved both theoretical and numerical investigation and involved learning how to use computational tools that are useful to mathematicians and mathematics educators.Groups presented their progress weekly to their peers and worked throughout the program on writing up their results according to the standards of the discipline.This practice in the oral and written communication of mathematical research prepared the students for presenting their completed projects in poster or talk form at one or more regional mathematics REU conferences. Many also prepared their work for publication; overall they produced 6 published and submitted papers in refereed journals, 12 posters and 13 talks.   The REU was designed to provide participants with experience that would help them determine whether they wished to pursue further education and/or a career in a STEM area, and that would prepare them for the research component of a PhD program if they chose to pursue one.  Students attended talks that introduced a wide range of mathematical topics beyond the usual undergraduate curriculum, a presentation on ethics in science and a panel discussion on applying to graduate school in mathematics. Approximately 60% of former participants have completed or are now engaged in graduate study, several students who worked on our mathematics projects are now teaching, and a number of others have entered careers in mathematically intensive areas like finance and software development.
