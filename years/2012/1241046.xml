<AbstractNarration>Microbes represent the largest reservoir of biodiversity on Earth, drive the biogeochemical cycles that sustain life in most habitats, and cause or control diseases in humans, animals, and plants. Yet, fundamental aspects of this astonishing biodiversity remain poorly understood. For example, thousands of bacterial species inhabit a typical gram of soil or liter of seawater, each encoding a few hundred genes of unknown function. What this diversity means and how useful it is remains poorly understood. This project will employ advanced genomic techniques and mathematical modeling to study the genetic mechanisms that create diversity within aquatic habitats and to identify new, biotechnologically important genes and pathways for cleaning up environmental pollutants such as pesticides and petroleum-based hydrocarbons. The findings are expected to lead to a more predictive understanding of the role of microbial biodiversity for ecosystem function and resilience to natural as well as anthropogenic perturbations, and could have important health and economic benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New multi-disciplinary technologies to study microbes and their communities will be developed and made publicly available. These technologies will have applications across the fields of microbiology, ecology, evolutionary and systems biology, and environmental engineering. Graduate and undergraduate students, including minority students from the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez, will be trained at the interface of microbiology, computational systems biology and engineering, a pivotal, interdisciplinary area of contemporary research that is not adequately covered in traditional academic settings.</AbstractNarration>

The freshwater ecosystems include the Chattahoochee River, along with its five interconnected lakes and estuary. The data can be found in the NCBI SRA database under the bioproject PRJNA214105. Our findings show that rare genes and species frequently underlie community adaptation to perturbations such as addition of organic pollutants or crude oil spills, and that horizontal gene transfer during the adaptation period is more frequent than previously thought. We have also developed mathematical models that use time-series data to dynamically represent the ecological interactions among thousands of microbial taxa in a meta-community. These models allow one to assess the healthy state of an ecosystem and make predictions of how microbe-microbe and microbe-environment interactions will change in the future, when environmental parameters such as temperature change.
