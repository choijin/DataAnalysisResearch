<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Beatriz Roldan Cuenya of the University of Central Florida (UCF) will synthesize metal nanoparticles (NPs) with uniform sizes (1-3 nm), shapes, and structures and investigate the correlation between their geometrical shape and catalytic properties. Target material systems will include gold, platinum, and palladium NPs supported on titanium dioxide, strontium titanate, aluminum oxide, and zirconium dioxide. Reactions of environmental and economic importance such as carbon monoxide oxidation and the water-gas-shift reaction over gold and platinum NPs and nitrous oxide (NOx) reduction over palladium NPs will be investigated. Understanding the relationship between the structure and function of catalysts requires detailed information about their three-dimensional atomic configurations as well as possible chemical changes occurring under reaction conditions. To address the complexity of real-world catalysts, a synergistic approach taking advantage of a variety of experimental methods will be undertaken. These methods include in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, atomically-resolved scanning and environmental transmission electron microscopy, scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tailoring the chemical reactivity of nanomaterials at the atomic level is one of the most important challenges in catalysis research. To achieve this elusive goal, fundamental understanding of the geometric and electronic structure of these complex systems must be obtained. Numerous studies have been devoted to understanding the properties that affect the catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles such as their size, interaction with the support, and oxidation state. The role played by the nanoparticle shape on catalytic performance is, however, less understood. Complicating the analysis is the fact that the former parameters cannot be considered independently, since the NP size as well as the support will have an impact on the most stable NP shapes. In addition, the dynamic nature of the NP catalysts and their response to the environment must be taken into consideration, since the working state of a NP catalyst might not be the state in which the catalyst was prepared, but rather a structural and/or chemical isomer that adapted to the particular reaction conditions. The selected model reactions have broad applications in the fields of energy generation and environmental remediation, as for example NOx reduction in turbines and automotive catalytic processes. This project will support the research efforts of doctoral students and K-12 students at UCF, which will also be trained at the user facilities of Brookhaven National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory. Furthermore, the principal investigator will bring concepts related to the field of nanoscience closer to the general public via her involvement with the Orlando Science Center, including the organization of an annual poster exhibit entitled "Art in Science, Science in Art".</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goals of this project were the following: (1) the development of new synthetic methods resulting in size- and shape-controlled metallic nanoparticles with tunable interparticle spacings, and (2) the investigation of their catalytic properties under operando reaction conditions in order to follow environment-induced changes in the structure and surface composition of the nanoparticles.  A number of different material systems were studied within this research program, including PtNi, Pt, Au, Pd and Cu spherical, octahedral and cubic nanoparticles deposited on carbon, SiO2, TiO2 and Al2O3.  Inverse micelle encapsulation methods were used to synthesize spherical nanoparticles, and different shapes were subsequently obtained from such samples via nanoparticle-support interactions through annealing treatments in vacuum. Furthermore, solvothermal synthesis was employed to synthesize octahedral nanoparticles and solvent-driven electrodeposition to generate cubic shapes.  In order to establish structure-composition-reactivity correlations, the following experimental methods were employed: atomic force microscoy, scanning tunneling microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscpy and mass spectrometry/gas chromatography.  The chemical reactions targeted in order to achieve selectivity control for highly active catalytic systems were: CO2 electro-reduction, CO2 thermal hydrogenation, 2-propanol thermal oxidation and electrooxidation, butanol thermal oxidation. For all cases it was demonstrated the role of specific structural motifs in specific selectivity trends observed, allowing us in some cases to rationally design more selective catalysts.
