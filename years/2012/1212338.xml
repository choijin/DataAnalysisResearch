<AbstractNarration>Millions of people used social media technologies to organize themselves to produce information and artifacts of value, such as Wikipedia, GNU/Linux, and PatientsLikeMe. However, these communities have significant problems: (1) They work so well to let people maintain existing relationships and find others who are similar to them that they can promote self-segregation and opinion polarization. (2) Knowledge production has been democratized, but at the price of devaluing expert participation. (3) They open people to fresh ideas from far-off places, but few sites incorporate the rich local knowledge of home communities. This project addresses these problems by creating algorithms and user interfaces that nudge individuals and communities into more effective patterns of social connections and interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit includes: (1) Identification of principles people use to build their social networks, the range of potential contacts they consider, and the contexts in which they encounter potential contacts. (2) Empirical knowledge of the effectiveness of different social network structures for solving a range of realistic decision-making tasks. (3) Novel social recommendation algorithms that maximize network effectiveness and that recommend interaction opportunities that serve as contexts for communication and connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  This research will be performed in the context of two domains of societal interest, parenting and bicycling, enabling significant broader impacts. Providing people information that gives them confidence to bicycle more increases their personal health, decreases air pollution, and improves community cohesion. Research shows that parents with larger and more diverse social networks make better parenting decisions, and that parents also seek expert advice for specific issues. Therefore, a system that helps people form effective social networks and that provides access to expert educators offers direct benefits to parents. Better parents also tend to be more involved in their communities; thus, improved community health is a bonus effect. Finally, through the research team's connections with parent educators, the project will explicitly target parents from low-income families, who have the greatest needs for support and information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Internet allows people to connect around the world like never before, through access to a huge range of points of view and experiences. And yet, the way in which online social networks are designed, and the natural human tendency to surround ourselves with people who think like us, hinder the Internet's potential. In particular, polarization and online incivility affect how people interact online, making the sharing of opposing viewpoints difficult.     This research used mixed methods and significant systems infrastructure, including surveys, interviews, the development and deployment of a custom prototype to obtain critical mass, and the creation of a civility plugin. Considerable time was devoted to prototype building and its application to multiple platforms and projects, as it fills a technology gap in studying online social systems. These methods were used to run an IRB-approved intervention study to understand the reactions to computational (i.e., machine learning-based) adjustments to Facebook Newsfeeds: in particular, one which hid impolite comments, and also highlighted particularly thoughtful/civil comments.  The findings show very encouraging results for designing improved civility in online social networks, as well as providing new tools for doing so. In particular, the research makes the following three contributions:      A formative understanding of the implications of homophily and incivility online. Here, we studied the consequences of people having friends on social media with opinions different from their own.    A prototyping framework for evaluating large-scale social systems. We developed a framework for prototyping social interactions in contexts that require critical mass, without having to get critical mass on your own.    A technology probe methodology for evaluating social algorithms. Using the framework and the formative findings, we deployed a plugin that made Facebook more civil for participants as an algorithmic probe. We found ways to improve a politeness algorithm, and that participants who did perceive a change in civility were most influenced by seeing civil posts highlighted, rather than the fact that impolite posts were hidden.
