<AbstractNarration>The project builds on the successes of prior phases that resulted in operational research data infrastructure that crosses disciplinary boundaries and provides users with the ability to access community data and supports a circumpolar network of researchers, practitioners, and knowledge holders. Three objectives support sustaining and enhancing ELOKA: 1) Provide core data management services to researchers and organizations involved in community-based research; 2) collaboratively enhance the existing ELOKA technology platform to better support collection and sharing of community data; 3) ensure a sustained and interoperable long-term preservation system for community data. Objectives are achieved first by providing data management planning support, developing community data Websites, and hosting an inventory of community-based research projects. Second, by adding advanced administrative, mapping, and multimedia functions to existing technology to enhance ELOKA services and increase the number of projects served. Third, by securing community data over the long-term by building on interoperable, data-curation&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure developed through the Data Conservancy, an NSF DataNet project.  Making ELOKA a sustained presence in the Arctic research landscape will continue to broaden the participation of Arctic residents in research, and will provide researchers outside of the community and the general public with greater exposure to community-based research through improved access to data. Establishment of the ELOKA Advisory Committee ensures that community perspectives are an integral part of sustaining and evolving ELOKA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Community data are those resulting from the documentation of the local and Indigenous knowledge of Indigenous peoples of the Arctic and from community-based observing and monitoring projects.  Many studies and operational projects clearly demonstrate the value of community data in understanding recent environmental, social, and cultural change in the Arctic based on knowledge and observations that are not readily available through scientific methods (e.g. local observations of change from areas not monitored, or that predate mapping and satellite records).  The Exchange for Local Observations and Knowledge of the Arctic (ELOKA) is an operational service that provides data management and user support services to facilitate the collection, preservation, exchange, and use of valuable community data.  The project built on the successes of prior phases that resulted in online research data tools and that cross the boundaries of different types of science.  It provided users with the ability to access community data and supported a circumpolar network of researchers, practitioners, and knowledge holders.  The project focused on three major objectives: i) Providing core data management services to researchers and organizations involved in community-based research. This included providing data management planning support, developing community data websites, and hosting an inventory of community-based research projects; ii) working with community members and scientists to enhance the existing ELOKA tools to better support collection and sharing of community data.  For example, adding advanced administrative, mapping, and multimedia functions to existing technologies to improve ELOKA services and increase the number of projects served; iii) working to build a community of organizations and researcher to help ensure a sustained and long-term preservation system for community data that can work with other research and government systems.  This included organizing a series of meetings and workshops and building on existing data preservation software.  ELOKA further developed theory and methods for community data management and knowledge stewardship.  The challenges of recording, preserving, and sharing these unique data were addressed through research in partnership with community members, community-based researchers, scientists, informatics researchers and members of the broader ELOKA network. The project made data available beyond the community where it originated in support of developing new scientific ideas, and increasing the possibilities for science that can connect different types of knowledge.  ELOKA filled a gap in Arctic science by providing support and infrastructure to community-based research projects that are often required to make their data findable and available, but have limited resources to do this.  With the support of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the ELOKA team demonstrated knowledge, experience, and technical expertise to achieve the project goals.   Making ELOKA a sustained presence in Arctic research continued to broaden the participation of Arctic residents in research, and has provided researchers outside of the community and the general public with greater exposure to community-based research through improved access to data.  Establishment of the ELOKA meetings and workshops ensured that community perspectives are more visible by providing better communication and sharing of data, methods, and ideas. ELOKA enhanced the tools available for research, education, environmental management, and other applications by producing knowledge and providing support and technology that is open and shared across local and scientific communities in the Arctic.
