<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to recruit and retain to transfer or completion of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees academically capable students with financial need. The focus of the project is to enable scholarship students to attend full-time and to complete their STEM programs reliably in two years. The students are being supported by the STEM Emporium at the college, a program designed to increase completions in STEM majors by supplying out-of-classroom academic support. The student scholars are also supported by many established student support groups that supply experienced and focused support for student sub-populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is providing scholarship recipients full opportunities and resources to stay in a STEM major, to focus on courses and not be distracted by working and financially supporting themselves, to attend full-time, and to engage with faculty and cohort students. The scholars are benefiting from an array of support services that includes faculty mentors, dedicated counselors, academic tutoring, and services to aid students who are transferring to universities or who wish to obtain career-track internships or research opportunities. A diverse group of faculty members, who are knowledgeable about population subgroups and serve as role models, are mentoring the students. The scholarships are increasing the academic success of students, rates of completion, transfer to universities, and career readiness. In addition, the program is offering students optional research opportunities that are traditionally available only to students at four-year universities by partnering with universities that provide access to advanced laboratories, instrumentation, and personnel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project is improving the retention of academically talented, financially disadvantaged students, many of whom are from groups underrepresented in STEM professions, thus increasing the economic and racial diversity in STEM graduates and transfer students, and narrowing socioeconomic gaps. Students are learning job skills and gaining confidence for employment through enrichment activities such as faculty mentoring and optional internships. By recruiting and drawing students from local high schools and partnering with private sector companies, the project is giving at-risk students a financially rewarding pathway in STEM careers to which they otherwise might not have been exposed or motivated to pursue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Accomplishments  Overall, the scholarship program has been highly effective in helping students financially as they achieve their math and science goals. The recruitment, mentoring and academic progress report components of the program that was integral to the program’s success.    Time to Transfer to Four-Year Institution (reported by Institutional Research)  Among the 101 scholarship recipients, 58 students have enrolled at a four-year institution (as of Nov 14th, 2019) for a transfer rate of 57%.  Of the 43 students who have not yet transferred, 17 of them (17%) are still enrolled at Foothill, actively working toward their degree preparation programs. For those students who did transfer, most did so within two years of becoming S-STEM scholars.     Student satisfaction survey We wanted to understand the impact of the scholarship from the student perspective.  We also wanted to identify which retention strategies was most effective.  We received 38 responses from past scholarship recipients.  The major takeaways are:   A majority of students were able to reduce their work hours   A majority of students confirmed earning money as a barrier to reaching their academic potential   A majority of students responded positively to the structure of the program   A majority of students did not participate in an internship   A majority of students confirmed math background as a barrier to reaching their academic potential   Qualitative Measures of Success Students were encouraged to share with us any additional comments, and we were very pleased to hear about our recipients success beyond Foothill.    1.  The NSF S-STEM scholarship and the people I got to know through the program played a huge role in helping me succeed in community college and in earning the grades I needed to transfer to a four-year university. I’m grateful for having had the opportunity to be a participant in the program and thank you to everyone involved who put time and effort into giving us scholars the chance to be great.  2.  The NSF Scholarship was a major factor in determining whether I was able to transfer successfully and pass my classes at Foothill College. Having to fully support myself financially and living out of my car, it would have been impossible to have made enough money to cover the basic necessities and keep up with the material covered in three STEM classes per quarter. Of course, my hard work was also an important part for me transferring but without the NSF Scholarship, I would not have been able to get to where I am now.    Lessons Learned:   If we are to support students at the community college level, we would need to redesign the S-STEM scholarship to meet the needs of our student population.  Below are some takeaways from working on the grant in the past 6 years.  Recruiting applicants    We had difficulty recruiting students for our scholarship due to the limitations of the scholarship.  In order to apply, students are required to demonstrate financial need, apply with a 2.7 GPA, and be full-time.  We feel that although this is reasonable for a traditional student attending a 4-year institution, this is not the case with the population of students attending Foothill.  In order to recruit a larger and more diverse population, we would have to be more flexible with the requirements of the scholarship, accepting, for example, students who were not enrolled full-time and finding alternative methods to FAFSA for identifying students with financial need.  Amount awarded to students Our college is located in a high cost of living area, and many of our students are supporting themselves and their families financially.  We have had many students not meet the academic requirements because they were unable to reduce their work hours.  We feel that our award of $1400/quarter was insufficient  to relieve their financial burden.  In order to make a more meaningful impact, we believe that the program would be more effective if we were to offer fewer scholarships with larger monetary amounts.  With a larger dollar amount, we believe that students would dedicate more time to their academic goals and would reap greater rewards.  Math completion One of the application requirements was for students to have passed Math 48A, the first class in the precalculus sequence.  This requirement was based on our sense that participation in the precalculus sequence best demonstrates a student’s intention to pursue a STEM major.  We were surprised to learn through Institutional research that many of our applicants received their first scholarship disbursement 4 or more quarters after taking Math 48A.
