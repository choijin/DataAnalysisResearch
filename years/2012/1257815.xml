<AbstractNarration>The long-term objective of this research project is to identify the interactions among chemical messengers that control behaviors.  Neuropeptides regulate social behaviors in representative species from all vertebrate classes.  Species differences in behavior, however, have made development of clear mechanistic models difficult.  This project investigates the complexity of behavioral mechanisms using a combination of animal experiments and computational models.  Field and laboratory studies will be combined to address important emerging questions on neuropeptide modulation of male vertebrate behaviors. The agent-based modeling approach is especially well-suited to address this problem. Synthetic experiments with the model allow for exploration of conditions impractical or impossible in empirical tests.  The model is expected to propose novel mechanisms underlying neuropeptide control of behavior.  This project thus implements a tightly controlled experiment-model-experiment loop and develops a new paradigm for a systems biology approach towards understanding social behavior.  Neuropeptides alter a variety of vertebrate social behaviors, including parental, aggressive, and reproductive behaviors.  Conserved behaviors and chemical messengers will make the empirical results and the model broadly applicable to vertebrates.  Results will significantly advance our understanding of the effect of neuropeptides on vertebrate behavioral plasticity. This project also includes a significant training component, with involvement of an undergraduate field biology class (with a 30% minority makeup) and training of graduate students in a unique inter-disciplinary environment. The data management plan includes deposition of new software at SourceForge and archiving of digital data in the PI's institutional databases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The interactions between emale mate choice and male competition, and the extent to which these behaviors are affected by individual states versus social dynamics, is an open problem in biology.  The project aimed at investigating these questions using the specific case of gray treefrogs, Hyla versicolor, which serves as a uniquely advantageous model organism as the vocal communication system of this frog has been well studied and the peptide AVT alters social behaviors in both sexes.  To study the different tradeoffs between female choice and male aggression, the project developed a spatial agent-based model of the mate selection task, where female treefrogs enter a simulated 2D swamp environment to select a male mate based on the male's call characteristics.  Once selected, a female approach will her chosen mate and if she is able to reach him, she will mate with him.  Otherwise, if the male stopped calling (either because another female reached him first, or because of male competition in his local neighborhood), the female will select a different eligible male.  Two main mate selection strategies were considered and compared to randomly selecting males: (1) select the best out of the closest n males, and (2) select the closest male with a minimum calling quality.  Some of the main findings from extensive simulation studies can be summarized as follows: (1) strategies significantly improve the average mated male quality across a large ranges of parameters (male-female ratio, different distributions of males and females in the enviornment, different distributions of call qualities). (2) selecting males based on minmum quality thresholds is overall better than selecting the best out of a set of callers; (3) male-male competition driven by hormones which can lead to males stopping to call yielding to higher-quality males, turing callers into so-called "satellites", can still be beneficial to the overall population and lead to higher chances of low-quality males mating when they are satellites compared to when they call.   The project thus shows how agent-based models paired with extensive simulation runs systematically exploring the model parameter space can reveal important interactions between multiple spatial and temporal scales. For example, by showing how accidental matings can be beneficial, the models can reveal new directions for empirical research.  Overall, the project addressed one of the "grand challenges" in organismal biology -- the challenge of integration across disciplines and across levels of biological organization. In the process, the project developed an intuitive flexible tool for the field, trained a cadre of interdisciplinary new scientists (with course development and focus on minority students) and addressed open biological questions about animal communication.
