<AbstractNarration>This award will provide continuing support for the Wisconsin Atomic Transition Probability (WATP) program.  The project includes the completion of very precise and accurate transition probability measurements of Titanium. These measurements will include the very important weak lines with low excitation potential in Ti II. Such lines sample the majority of the titanium in the photospheres of stars. Similar measurements will subsequently be extended to cobalt, nickel, and vanadium. Emission branching fractions will be measured using available spectra from a Fourier transform spectrometer and new data from a recently developed 3 m focal length vacuum echelle spectrograph. Radiative lifetime measurements will be performed on atom/ion beams using a WATP program time-resolved laser induced fluorescence experiment.  Systematic uncertainties on these iron-group measurements will be 5% or less with high confidence. Collaborating astronomers will apply this lab data to determine highly reliable relative iron-group abundances in (old) metal-poor stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research effort will include the training of undergraduate and graduate students.  The project is expected to aid in the interpretation of future large-scale spectroscopic surveys of metal-poor stars in the outskirts of the Milky Way.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction of light and matter.  It is only through spectroscopy that humans know, or may ever learn more, about the detailed physics and chemistry of the remote Universe.  Chemical elements, other than the primordial elements hydrogen and helium, are made in stars.  The Iron-(Fe-)group elements are the most abundant "metals" or non-primordial elements, and are the final products of thermonuclear fusion reactions in the heaviest stars.  Early stars were much different than stars we see today and these stars produced a different mix of Fe-group elements.  Laboratory spectroscopy funded under NSF-AST 1211055 has made studies of Fe-group nucleo-synthesis more accurate and precise for research on early stars. The laboratory astrophysics group at the University  of Wisconsin develops and applies advanced techniques to determine atomic transition probabilities needed for quantitative spectroscopy.  Atomic transition probabilities are parameters that  quantify the strength of the interaction of an atom or ion with light of a specific color.   These advanced techniques employ lasers, synchrotron radiation, and some of the most powerful spectrometers in the world.  Recent measurements on neutral iron, neutral and ionized vanadium, neutral cobalt and other species from this project have been made available in a series of publications. Early massive stars played an important role in re-ionizing the Universe and determining the structure of the Universe.  These early stars set the stage for subsequent generations of stars like our Sun, planets like our Earth, life here, and perhaps elsewhere in the Universe.
