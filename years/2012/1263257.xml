<AbstractNarration>The University at Buffalo (UB) REU site addresses the important topic of Ecosystem Restoration from an interdisciplinary perspective. Although ERIE-REU participants are drawn primarily from engineering undergraduate programs, the interdisciplinary program includes faculty participants from eight academic departments across two campuses. While diverse in scope and methods, the ERIE research projects share a place-based focus on the ecological recovery of the lower Great Lakes and Western New York regions. During the ten-week program, formal training in research methods supports individual projects organized into three interdisciplinary themes: lake and river restoration, groundwater restoration, and sustainable engineering applications. Biweekly group meetings and field trips allow students to share ideas and methods across disciplines, including discussions related to the ethics and values of ecological restoration. In a final culminating experience, ERIE-REU students present their projects to a diverse academic and professional audience. Students are also encouraged and supported to engage in post-REU conference presentations. ERIE-REU participants are recruited from a diverse set of partner institutions, including undergraduate colleges with a high proportion of underrepresented groups and regional Native American communities.</AbstractNarration>

REU participants represented a diverse group that included approximately 55 percent women, 24 percent underrepresented groups, and 38 percent from undergraduate (non research) institutions.    All of the REU participants reported a positive experience, with the majority expressing an intention to pursue graduate study and/or professional practice in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM).  In addition to receiving individual mentoring by faculty researchers, REU participants were integrated into interdisciplinary research groups coordinated by senior doctoral students, thereby gaining a broad persepctive on the variety of pathways to a research/STEM career.  Of the students who have now graduated with a BS degree, the majority (60% of respondents) have enrolled or have plans to enroll in STEM graduate programs.  With few exceptions, all of the participants successfully completed research projects that have contributed significantly to the evolving science of ecological restoration, including the subdisciplines of biology, chemistry, chemical engineering, environmental engineering, ecology, hydrogeology, ecohydrology, and geography.   The majority (70 percent) of the REU participants also presented their work in post-REU national or regional research conferences.  Individual post-REU success stories included "best student presentation" recognition at national conferences (multiple), co-authorship of refereed journal articles (2), and receipt of the highly competitive National Science Foundation Graduate  Research Fellowship (1).  Overall, the ERIE REU program provided substantial contribitions to both the interdisciplinary science of ecological restoration and the STEM workforce.
