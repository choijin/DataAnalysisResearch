<AbstractNarration>Herbarium specimens provide a source of historical information useful to the study of global environmental change. The goal of this project is to provide data to support studies of the nature and consequences of environmental change in the New England region over the last three centuries. This project will digitally capture specimen data and images from about 1.3 million vascular plant specimens from herbaria across New England, enhancing the data with georeferencing, habitat, and phonological information. The digitization process will integrate with existing community efforts and will develop novel high-throughput digitization technologies to increase efficiency and decrease costs. All resulting data and images will be freely available on-line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data from this project will be of immediate use to scientists who study climate and land-use change, and will provide a better understanding of how global changes will impact the distribution of native and introduced plant species. This project will benefit research in taxonomy, ecology, morphology, biogeography, and evolutionary history by making available data on an entire regional flora in an electronic format. The methodologies developed will provide a model for other regions around the nation. In addition the project will utilize citizen scientists, school groups, and students providing training, research, and educational opportunities. . This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

Phenology models using herbarium specimens are only slightly improved by using finer-scale stages of reproduction.  Applications in Plant Sciences, in review.      This study addresses the question of the optimum number of phenological categories for classifying plant reproduction and plant leafing times.  The answer depends on finding the balance between the effort needed to collect the data and the increasing power of the analysis.  Our results demonstrate that simple systems of classification provide almost the same results as more detailed systems, and are probably to be preferred in citizen science projects.     While this project is now complete, we are following up this project with additional studies. The most notable study involves using herbarium specimens to confirm the observations of fruiting times of 70 bird-dispersed We expect this project to be complete in early 2019.
