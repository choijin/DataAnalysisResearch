<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to create a sustainable Network of engineering faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities to focus on the development, implementation, and expansion of an experiment-centric instructional pedagogy, based on the Mobile Studio. The project is implementing this pedagogy in 39 different courses across the 13 HBCUs participating in the network and studying the effect of the implementation on motivation and retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expanding the use of the hands-on pedagogy across the electrical engineering curriculum at 13 HBCUs. The approach is designed to give the student the ability to apply what they have learned anytime anywhere as well as to tinker and ask "what if" questions. One of the goals of this program is to test whether this approach increases student interest in STEM and increases retention of students at minority-serving institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The specific objectives of the project are to enhance the quality and size of the national STEM workforce, in particular, enhancing the engineering workforce using inexpensive, accessible personal instrumentation to develop an EE curriculum based on Experimental Centric Pedagogy to increase recruitment, retention and graduation of minority engineering students.  Broader Impact:  The broader impact of this project is to increase the number of highly qualified and prepared African American engineers, and all students to have a better understanding of technology and its role in STEM education and the policy associated with it.  Additionally, the grant will promote widespread dissemination of the portable hands-on mobile devices through proactive collaboration between educational institutions and industry partners.   Project Goals:  1. The establishment of an HBCU Engineering Network (HBCU-EngNet) that will be maintained and sustained even after the end of the grant period.  2. The implementation and expansion of the Experimental Centric Pedagogy (ECP) among all Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) with Electrical and/or Computer Engineering programs (total of 13HBCUs).  3. The implementation of yearly training workshops for faculty members of the HBCU-EngNet to share the latest technology and pedagogy required to implement ECP in their curriculum.  4. The sharing of assessments related to the implementation of ECP among the members of the HBCU-EngNet.       tatus of project after 5 years:  -  43 faculty trained in ECP and use of the Analog Discovery Board by this project. These instructors served over 1400 students who have had the opportunity to use the Analog Discovery Board. These students are approximately 83% of minority status (Black, Hispanic, and Multiracial)  -  Changes in faculty ability and use of the pedagogy and integrated use of the Analog Discovery Board has produced increases in students? pre-requisites to learning, immediate skill gains and long-term transferable outcomes; and changes in student learning/understanding of concepts.  -  This project has resulted in positive student characteristics, including an increase of understanding, confidence in their abilities, and communication skills inside and outside of class. Participants reported that "students understand quicker, they are not as afraid of the equipment, they want to know why something happens and I have more students who come to my office to ask about the real use."

The Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Experimental Centric Pedagogy (ECP) project, with the collaboration of the Mobile Hands-On STEM (MOHS) Project held a joint workshop that explored and prepared whitepapers on the broader impacts and intellectual merit of ECP within the context of the successful features of the HBCU collaboration that produced it.
