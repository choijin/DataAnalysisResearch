<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to employ graphene transparent electrical contacts atop mid-infrared semiconductor lasers to determine the fundamental physical mechanisms that critically limit high-temperature operation.  The approach is to use antimonide-based semiconductor lasers as the platform to test optical transparency, electrical conductivity, and the heat dissipation efficacy of single and few-layer graphene.  Both multi-domain and single-crystal graphene monolayers will be compared as well as bilayers and trilayers with non-Bernal and Bernal AB stacking.&lt;br/&gt;The capability graphene will provide to simultaneously optically pump and electrically bias laser devices will enable precise measurements of carrier concentrations above threshold in order to elevate the characteristic temperature of these promising 3?5 Âµm devices above 100 K.  In addition to the high optical transmission and excellent electrical properties of graphene that could lead to lower thresholds, higher output powers, and higher operating temperatures in mid-infrared emitters, graphene has demonstrated excellent potential for heat dissipation, which will be studied and related to its potential as a single-atom-thick heat dissipater in electronic devices in general.&lt;br/&gt;Thin, transparent contacts with high mobility and excellent heat dissipation may have extensive applications in optoelectronic devices, including light emitting diodes, lasers, transistors, and other devices that require good thermal management while minimizing the size of the heat dissipating layer.  Important applications of mid-infrared devices include environmental monitoring, countermeasures, and free space communications.  &lt;br/&gt;The PIs will continue to involve women, high school students, and undergraduates in the research and to reach out to K-12 students and teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Monolayer and few-layer graphene was transferred to the top of a selection of gallium antimonide (GaSb) substrates, test devices, and  interband cascade lasers (ICLs).  For the  GaSb substrates (with either n- or p-type doping), reflectivity and transmission  spectra were measured using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)  spectroscopy in order to test the extension of the validity of the  characteristic graphene absorption (1) into the infrared and (2) onto a  substrate (not freely suspended in vacuum).  Advances were made in single-crystal graphene  growth via chemical vapor  deposition as well as Bernal-stacked single crystal graphene.   Development of uniform, high quality material is desirable for  integration not only on mid-infrared semiconductor lasers but also on other  optoelectronic devices.  The growth of large, continuous areas of single-crystal  graphene enables researchers to test the theoretical predictions of this  material, specifically with respect to electrical, optical and thermal  conductivity.  Techniques were developed for the synthesis of large area, single-crystal graphene and for transfer of graphene to semiconductor materials and semiconductor devices.  Preliminary work was performed for the development of graphene contacts to GaSb-capped devices.  Such contacts are optically transparent with excellent potential for high electrical and thermal conductivity, enabling a variety of optoelectronic applications, including emitters (LEDs and lasers), transistors, and other devices that  require good thermal management while minimizing the size of the heat  dissipation components.  Mid-infrared laser applications include chemical sensing, infrared countermeasures, and free-space optical communications.  Optical pumping experiments were performed at Baylor on  interband cascade lasers with two different layer  configurations.  While these devices were designed and optimized for  electrical injection, optical pumping was successfully demonstrated for  two different pump wavelengths (1850 nm and 1940 nm) at temperatures  ranging from 78 K to 200 K. Some investigators have believed that  due to heavy doping, ICLs and other diode lasers would not successfully  demonstrate optically pumped lasing.  The spectral shifts indicate  that the energy level alignment is not optimal, but the first  demonstration of optical pumping in interband cascade lasers provides  the foundation for future work toward transparent contacts and toward  the ultimate goal of preparing samples that elucidate the physical mechanisms that limit high output power above room temperature in antimonide-based semiconductor lasers.  Another key outcome is the preparation of graphene-semiconductor  samples useful for optical characterization (transmission) and  electrical characterization.  These samples are key to journal  articles in preparation and preliminary data for future work in this  area.  Six graduate and seven undergraduate students supported by the award were engaged in the synthesis and transfer of graphene, both  multi-domain and single-crystal, as well as optical, electronic, and  thermal measurement techniques and device modeling.  One graduate student completed a Ph.D., one journal article was published, and other papers are being prepared as a result of this work.  This preliminary work resulting from this exploratory award provides a foundation for future proposals to the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.  PIs Olafsen and Tour continue to impact graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students through  research experiences and outreach.  Their impact is local and  national/international, from school visits and involving high school and  undergraduate students in their laboratories at Baylor University and Rice University to  growing graphene from Girl Scout cookies and disseminating YouTube  videos and Internet games targeted toward middle school students.   The PIs have and will continue to extensively involve women in their  research, with substantial broader impacts on women and minorities  through their various outreach programs at both universities.   Professor Olafsen has been actively involved in outreach in the School  of Engineering and Computer Science at Baylor, including the Ladies and  Legos program that encourages women in STEM fields.
