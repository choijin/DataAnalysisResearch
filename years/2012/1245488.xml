<AbstractNarration>The University of Michigan has a long history of collaborative computational resources supporting research and education.  Such resources include high-performance computaitonal clusters, data storage and archival systems, and visualization resources.  This project improves connectivity between these systems internally and between these systems and the University's collaborators in the US and around the globe.  Resources with improved connectivity include Nyx, a shared-tenancy high performance cluster; Flux, a University-wide shared compute cluster; and the UM 3D Visulation Lab, an interdisciplinary service facility used in part for visual exploration of large scientific data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's support of improved network connectivity between these assets and the broader Internet supports a broad swath of computationally-enabled scientific explorations, including the following examples.  Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences faculty at Michigan are using Flux and the UM3D lab to explore climate change.  Chemical Engineering faculty at Michgian are using Nyx and the UM3D Lab to develop "designer structures" at the molecular level.  Physics faculty at Michigan and elsewhere will be better able to explore cosmological impacts of dark matter, as well as delve into the fundamental partical physics with data from the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva.  In addition to these fundamental scientific advances, the infrastructure improvements also play a role in the training of undergraduate and graduate students across the University and beyond, through distance learning efforts, in fields&lt;br/&gt;from planetary weather through computational science as a discipline unto itself.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past five years, the University of Michigan has invested heavily in shared computational infrastructure supporting inquiry across a broad range of disciplines, from engineering and the natural sciences through the social sciences, humanities, and the arts.  However, at the time of the proposal, the connectivity to the cluster, and between the cluster and the outside world, was significantly limited, and hampered our ability to do computational science. The upgrades enabled by this grant significantly improved that situation, and has had impact across our entire research and instructional enterprise. In our shared infrastruture, each individual researcher now was the networking capability that was previsouly divided across all users of the network.  Together with a University-funded investment in a high-performance research storage service---an investment that could not have been made without these network improvements--enabled more than three dozen laboratories to perform state-of-the-art scientific inquriy.  This has led to signifcant advances in understanding type 2 diabetes, how genetic factors impact obesity, uncovered new insights in disease diagnosis and treatment that can be personalized to inviduals. These improvements have also enabled researchers to develop and deploy new capabilities to connect the astronomical community with scientific opportunities presented by wide-field surveys, petabyte-scale archives, and data-intensive astronomy methods.   We have also used this infrastructure to create completely new tools, including the Sequencing Core that provides high-quality, low-cost DNA analysis for research clients on a recharge basis. Finally, these upgrades directly contributed to the construction of ConFlux, enabling supercomputer simulations to interface with large datasets while running. This capability will close a gap in the U.S. research computing infrastructure and place U-M at the forefront of the emerging field of data-driven physics, supported in part by a $2.4M grant from NSF. The work done to set the stage for this proposal relied heavily on the networking improvements made possible by this grant.
