<AbstractNarration>Rhyolite is the most differentiated silicate magma type on Earth and makes up some of the largest explosive eruptions (100-1000's km3), including those that have occurred at Yellowstone National Park.  Understanding the origin and evolution of large-volume rhyolitic magmatic systems is of considerable interest because their formation must fundamentally reconstitute and differentiate continental crust, and they are candidates for future "supervolcano" eruptions.  The mineral phases in rhyolites often provide a rich opportunity to examine pre-eruptive temperatures, oxidation states, and melt water concentrations, as well as time scales for melt accumulation in the upper crust.   However, there is a surprising paucity of phase-equilibrium experiments on natural rhyolite melt compositions, which limits the potential to use these mineral phases to extract the maximum amount of information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to perform hydrous phase-equilibrium experiments in a cold-seal and piston-cylinder apparatus under controlled oxygen and water fugacity (fO2 and fH2O) conditions on a variety of natural rhyolite liquids over a range of temperature and pressure, which will enable calibration of the plagioclase-liquid hygrometer to rhyolite compositions.  The experiments will also be used to determine trace element partition coefficients between mineral and melt, particularly for Sr and Ba.  The partitioning behavior is critical to understanding how extremely low-Sr rhyolites form, some of which constitute some of the largest (most voluminous) explosive eruptions on Earth.   Finally, these experiments will greatly enhance the calibration of broad thermodynamic models of crystal-melt equilibrium, which when combined with geophysical models can provide a deeper understanding of how large-volume rhyolite magma bodies form and why they sometimes erupt explosively, which is a significant geohazard.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Rhyolite is the most differentiated silicate magma type on Earth and makes up some of the largest explosive eruptions (100-1000?s km3), including those at Yellowstone and Long Valley calderas.  Understanding the origin and evolution of large-volume rhyolitic magmatic systems is of considerable interest because their formation must fundamentally re-constitute and differentiate continental crust, and they are candidates for future "supervolcano" eruptions.  To better understand their origin and the cause of explosive eruptions, it is essential to develop mineral-melt tools to infer changes in the pre-eruptive water concentrations and oxidation state of these magmas.   The successful completion of this experimental project led to five key outcomes.   The first important outcome is an updated tool to calculate the pre-eruptive water content in rhyolite melts, based on plagioclase-liquid equilibrium.  This published hygrometer allows the water concentration in rhyolite magmas to be determined with less time and labor (and therefore lower costs) than traditional methods involving analyses of quartz-hosted melt inclusions.  When both techniques are applied to the same rhyolite samples, the results are fully consistent.  A second outcome is the experimental demonstration that the composition of orthopyroxene crystals in a rhyolite liquid depends strongly on the water content, and shows little variation with temperature and pressure.  Therefore the cause for Mg-rich rims on orthopyroxene is not necessarily due to mixing with a more mafic magma, which can be a trigger for eruption and thus important to accurately identify, but simply H2O degassing during magma ascent. A third key outcome is the demonstration that degassing of dissolved H2O during magma ascent does not cause an increase in the oxidation state (ferric-ferrous ratio) of magmatic melts, counter to a long-held assumption in the literature, and therefore does not play a role in the formation of various ore deposits or the long-term evolution of oxygen in the Earth?s atmosphere (although degassing of other volatile components might).  A fourth outcome is experimental demonstration that the large and sparse crystals (phenocrysts) in erupted rhyolites (e.g., obsidian) were crystallized during magma ascent over a period of days (and not 10?s of kyrs in a magma chamber in the crust).   This has implications for the time-scale between the formation of large volumes of rhyolite, the crystallization of their phenocrysts, and their eruption as super-volcanoes, all which may take place over a far shorter duration than currently assumed.  Finally, a fifth key outcome is an explanation for why voluminous (super-volcano) eruptions of hydrous, high-SiO2 rhyolite are largely found in extensional tectonic settings and not at subduction zones, and why Earth?s upper continental crust is not differentiated to its full potential (in other words, why it has a bulk composition of ~66 and not ~77 wt% SiO2).  The experimental work from this project shows that the key control on the successful eruption of hydrous rhyolite melts, including supervolcano explosive eruptions, is whether or not they were fluid saturated at the time of segregation from their source.     The broader impacts of this grant are that it partially supported the research of one postdoc, three graduate students and two undergraduates (of whom four are from under-represented groups in the geosciences).  These students learned to use various analytic instruments and apparatus including the cold-seal pressure vessel and 1-bar gas-mixing furnaces.  They learned how to apply thermodynamics to calibrate mineral-melt thermometers and hygrometers and then how to apply them to samples of erupted magma. These skills have applications within the field of material science as well as volcanology. One of the graduate students funded on this project is now a tenure-track faculty member at a public university. The project also resulted in a petrological tool (an updated plagioclase-liquid hygrometer) that is highly utilized by many Earth scientists.
