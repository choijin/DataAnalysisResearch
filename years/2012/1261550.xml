<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this REU Site are: (1) to train students from ecosystem, earth, engineering, mathematics, and computer sciences in collaborative interdisciplinary research and professional development; (2) to forestall the flight of US citizens from STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines by recruiting qualified, diverse students to engage in ecological problems requiring computer, mathematical sciences and engineering input; and (3) to conduct research to develop and apply novel techniques in computer science, engineering, and mathematics to solve natural resource management problems, allowing informatics to enable the science and the science to enable tool development. We will achieve these objectives through structured research experiences, thematic and professional development seminars, exchanges with other REU sites, immersive field experiences, and mentoring and development of collegial relationships. Students will be recruited from ecology, geosciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. We will actively recruit Native American, African American, and Hispanic students and will provide all students with high quality mentoring, graduate school fellowship opportunities, and career counseling, so they will enter the workforce equipped to make key contributions to natural resources management and policy. We intend to provide students with skills for today's science environment, where information technology and models are essential parts of ecosystem management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mentored by teams of interdisciplinary scientists, participants will work on research projects addressing five key themes: (1) agricultural sustainability ("pollinator networks"); (2) climate change effects on organisms ("bioacoustics of birds"); (3) river restoration ("fish and engineered log jams"); (4) sustainable aquatic habitats ("aquatic insects") and (5) coastal hazards and sustainability ("waves and vegetation").  Each of these research themes integrates ecological principles, field experiences, novel engineering techniques, new developments in computer science, and mathematical modeling and problem solving.  The activities will advance discovery while promoting training and learning in key policy issues including climate change, ecological change, and ecosystem restoration.  The REU Site will recruit and train underrepresented minorities, enhance infrastructure and programs at the Andrews Forest LTER and OSU Wave Lab, and disseminate management and policy implications to USFS partners.  The Site will also serve as a national model for transforming the education of undergraduates to embrace Ecosystem Informatics (EI) as both a set of tools and a mindset for approaching and solving natural resources problems in an interdisciplinary context.</AbstractNarration>

By integrating the fields of informatics with ecology and environmental science, results of this program contributes both to new knowledge about ecosystem and to the methods used to study them. For example, this program has advanced knowledge on the intensity and vulnerability of interactions between plants and pollinators in mountain meadows, as well as how juvenile salmon utilize turbulence in foraging. From a methods perspective, this project had advanced machine learning and statistical models of plant-pollinator interactions, and identified how the resolution of our observations affects our understanding of aquatic ecosystems.</p> <p>Broader impacts. The contributions of the program to society are primarily associated the training of a diverse group of students to become mature scientists in their own fields and to help them establish skills for working in interdisciplinary teams on compelling and complex environmental problems. Participants gained technical expertise, advance their practical life skills, and develop professionally through heavily-mentored research experiences and participation in field data collection, thematic and professional development seminars, and a range of research interactions. Our evaluation program highlights the program&rsquo;s contribution to a more diverse and better prepared experienced work force that is prepared to tackle today&rsquo;s grand environmental and engineering challenges.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/10/2016<br>      Modified by: Desiree&nbsp;D&nbsp;Tullos</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1261550/1261550_10254703_1470864710039_engineersandcomputerscientistsinthefield--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1261550/1261550_10254703_1470864710039_engineersandcomputerscientistsinthefield--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Interdisciplinary teams taking data collection seriously"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1261550/1261550_10254703_1470864710039_engineersandcomputerscientistsinthefield--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Interdisciplinary teams taking data collection seriously"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A student team, comprised of engineering, computer science, and ecology students investigate how turbulence affects fish bioenergetics.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Carson Smith</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Desiree&nbsp;D&nbsp;Tullos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Interdisciplinary teams taking data collection seriously</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1261550/1261550_10254703_1470863923108_Bigdatainenvironmentalfluidmechanics--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1261550/1261550_10254703_1470863923108_Bigdatainenvironmentalfluidmechanics--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Big data in ecohydraulics"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1261550/1261550_10254703_1470863923108_Bigdatainenvironmentalfluidmechanics--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Big data in ecohydraulics"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students collected over 1.6M velocity measurements to study interactions between fish and turbulence</div> <div class="imageCredit">Desiree Tullos and Cara Walter</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Desiree&nbsp;D&nbsp;Tullos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Big data in ecohydraulics</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1261550/1261550_10254703_1470864056079_computerscientistattheflumetostudyscaling--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1261550/1261550_10254703_1470864056079_computerscientistattheflumetostudyscaling--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Computer scientist at the flume"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1261550/1261550_10254703_1470864056079_computerscientistattheflumetostudyscaling--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Computer scientist at the flume"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A student in computer science collects velocity measurements in a flume to investigate scaling of vegetation in physical models of rivers.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brian Draeger</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Desiree&nbsp;D&nbsp;Tullos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Computer scientist at the flume</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1261550/1261550_10254703_1470864156451_computerscientistsinthefield--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1261550/1261550_10254703_1470864156451_computerscientistsinthefield--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Computer scientists sampling in mountain meadows"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1261550/1261550_10254703_1470864156451_computerscientistsinthefield--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Computer scientists sampling in mountain meadows"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Computer scientists contribute to teams sampling plants and pollinators in mountain meadows to understand their interactions and vulnerabilities</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kate Jones</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Desiree&nbsp;D&nbsp;Tullos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Computer scientists sampling in mountain meadows</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
