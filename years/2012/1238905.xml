<AbstractNarration>The targeted infusion project of Prairie View A&amp;M University has as its primary goal to enhance the Biology curriculum with the incorporation of bioinformatics modules into existing traditional Biology courses.  As such, this project is particularly aligned with recent advances in the fields of molecular biology, biotechnology and information technology.  The project goal will be achieved through the implementation of several objectives that include development of e-learning software and modules designed to enhance student learning and assist students in exploring and visualizing biological theories and concepts.  In order to ensure program success, a carefully developed set of faculty workshops is also planned.  These workshops, to be held during the summer breaks, will familiarize faculty with learning modules and their proper implementation in the classroom.  Ultimately, the activities proposed will not only expose students to the field of bioinformatics and its application to real world problems, but will also improve their capacities to compete for highly coveted undergraduate research opportunities at major research intensive institutions.  As such, it is expected that a significant percentage of PVAMU students will, subsequently, matriculate into STEM graduate degree programs, thereby contributing to the diversification of the US STEM enterprise.</AbstractNarration>
