<AbstractNarration>The proposed work is an investigation of mercury (Hg) in river systems that have experienced large anthropogenic inputs of this toxic substance (e.g., by upstream mining). This interdisciplinary project will identify critical locations in river systems where the risk of Hg input to food webs increases and elucidate the processes by which this occurs. The study will focus on the longitudinal (downstream) transport and biogeochemical processing of sediment-adsorbed Hg derived from hydraulic gold mining in the Sierra Nevada and mercury mining in the Coast Ranges within and through the Yuba-Feather-Sacramento River system of Northern California, USA. It will document the primary sources (Coast Range v. Sierra Nevada) of Hg contamination to lowland ecosystems in the Sacramento Valley and Bay-Delta and the relative contribution and risks of each. We will: 1) mathematically model flood inundation in river corridors to identify areas of high potential of oxidation/reduction; 2) identify preferential zones of sedimentation through numerical modeling of event-based washload transport; 3) identify distinct contamination sources to lowlands by conducting Hg stable isotopic analysis of sediment; and 4) investigate Hg speciation in conjunction with changes in Hg species isotopic signatures, associated with redox conditions and sediment source. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In river basins beset by Hg contamination from atmospheric deposition or anthropogenic inputs from mining, there is great uncertainty about the interplay among sediment transport, deposition, and remobilization and the evolution of Hg reactivity in response to inundation regimes and ambient chemistry. These factors have important implications for bioavailability of sediment-adsorbed Hg to food webs, as it travels to sensitive downstream ecosystems where methylation potential is high. This research will address this problem and provide new understanding into the physical and biogeochemical processes that threaten sensitive lowland ecosystems. The importance of sediment deposits originating from legacy mines, especially in the Bay-Delta watershed, has recently increased due to realizations that they may contain high levels of Hg that may be available to food webs. These factors are being investigated by various government agencies and nonprofit groups responsible for river basin management. The research team has developed close contacts and relations with personnel from interested parties in the US with whom findings will be shared.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project was designed to investigate the links between river flow, sediment erosion/deposition, and mercury delivered to several streams in Northern California during the 19th Century Gold Rush period. Specifically, we were trying to ascertain whether and where mercury, an ecological neurotoxin introduced to California's Sierra Nevada foothills and parts of the Coast Ranges in high concentrations during the active mining period, is entering food webs. The process of hydraulic mining left behind a signficant topographic and chemical legacy that continues to affect lowland ecosystems of the Central Valley. Notably, aquatic food webs are contaminated by mercury at all relevant trophic levels and we have identified the sediments left over from mining as the likely source. This project used a range of methods to investigate the topographic and contamination legacy of 19th Century mining. We analyzed long-term changes in riverbed elevation and mercury (Hg) concentrations stored in sediments along the main channels and discovered that these sediments are eroded during large flood events that occur about once a decade, delivering large Hg masses to the lowlands. We used Hg isotopes to investigate the processes by which Hg is transformed from its inert state attached to sediment to an organic contaminant that is readily taken up into aquatic species and incorporated into tissues. We found contrasting patterns of this Hg biogeochemistry in riverine environments, compared with lowland wetlands, suggesting a more complex set of processes are in play along river systems. Next, we investigated how the flooding regime along major rivers in this region affect the potential for Hg to be converted from inorganic to organic species. This occurs when oxygen becomes rapidly depleted by prolonged inundation of sediments and corresponding activity by aerobic bacteria. Once this condition arises, it promotes the activity of resident anerobic bacteria that are identified as the the dominant microbes performing this role in Hg biogeochemical transformation. We found that this analysis enabled mapping of 'hot spots' and 'hot moments' of potential for mercury to increase in toxicity. Finally, we are working to quantify the total amount of Hg stored within the major anthropogenic sediment deposits of the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Central Valley, which are a legacy of the mining period. This involved deep coring of sediments and analysis Hg concentrations at multiple depths and we are currently working to build 3-D inventories of Hg storage.&nbsp;</p> <p>Overall, this research trained 2 PhD students, 2 Masters students, and one undergraduate, but also involved several additional students in various phases of the research. The publications from the project have been well cited in the scientific literature and there is deep interest in our work from governmental bodies and nonprofit groups.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/20/2017<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;Singer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1226741/1226741_10214579_1484842116962_DSC05833--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1226741/1226741_10214579_1484842116962_DSC05833--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sampling aquatic insects"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1226741/1226741_10214579_1484842116962_DSC05833--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sampling aquatic insects"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This illustrates the use of kick nets for sampling aquatic insects in the Yuba River for determination of Hg isotopes and corresponding inference about mercury cycling.</div> <div class="imageCredit">P.
