<AbstractNarration>Boise State University will host the 25th Annual Pacific Northwest Numerical Analysis Seminar October 26-27, 2012.  The goal of the meeting is to bring together interdisciplinary researchers from universities, government research labs, and industry from the Pacific Northwest to share expertise in both pure and applied aspects of numerical analysis and computational mathematics. The traditional format of a day-long Saturday session for invited talks will be modified to include a Friday evening poster session for students and postdoctoral fellows to present their work.  This will create a vertically integrated meeting bringing together individuals from undergraduates to distinguished researchers.  The inclusion of participants from national labs and industry will foster new potential research and employment opportunities for a broadened presence of students and postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boise State University, which for many years served as an undergraduate teaching institution, has recently been making key investments in faculty, staff, and infrastructure to transition into a research-oriented institution. The Pacific Northwest Numerical Analysis Seminar will be the first conference ever held at Boise State University in this area of mathematics, and will help strengthen the recently developed foundation in computational mathematics that is needed to educate a technological workforce in this underrepresented region of the US.  There will be speakers whose work: (1) interfaces with the biological and mathematical sciences; (2) involves energy sustainability; (3) focuses on the challenges of ?big-data?; and (4) concerns the development of cyberinfrastructure.  Speakers will include senior and junior faculty, women researchers/educators, and graduate students.  In addition to standard communication channels, the seminar will be promoted through the Boise State University student chapters of the Society of Women Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) consortium to broaden participation from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  During the Fall of 2012, Boise State University hosted the 25th Annual Pacific Northwest Numerical Analysis Seminar.   This was the first time that this annual event was held in Idaho.  Boise State University (BSU), which up until recently has been primarily an undergraduate research institution, is now positioning itself to join the ranks of research universities, and was eager to host this event.  In particular, the mathematics department used this opportunity to showcase its growing expertise in computational and applied mathematics and to support other activities on campus that align with their research in this direction.    The meeting was an enormous success.  We had over 50 registered participants, with most of the major universities in the Northwest represented, as well as several participants from industry.      We covered travel expenses for all but one of our eight speakers (he was ineligible for support from NSF), and seven students, each of whom were required to present a poster during the seminar poster session.  With the support of Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences, we were able to cover the travel expenses for our Canadian speaker, and with the support of the Boise State Department of Mathematics, we were able to cover the evening dinner hosted at a local restaurant in downtown Boise.      Program  The program for the day-long seminar consisted of eight speakers, six of which are from universities, one from a national lab and one from industry.  One of the speakers was a graduate student.  The talks covered a wide range of topics from the fields of compressed sensing, ice-sheet modeling, regularization and inverse problems, wave propagation, interface and phase change problems, DNA modeling and research in supercomputing.  The details of the program, including abstracts and slides,  can be found on the seminar website at  https://sites.google.com/a/boisestate.edu/pnwnas2012/home  Broader Impact  We were pleased to have a good mix of university faculty, national lab researchers and industry.   This gave students a unique opportunity to see research interests from a broad range of work environments and also brought the researchers themselves into contact with one another.   Kristi Maschoff, from Cray Research Inc. (Seattle, WA) spoke about student internship possibilities at Cray.  While such an opportunity might be most appropriate for students who have taken graduate level coursework,  her talk gave all students an idea as to how a background in computational science and numerical analysis can be directly relevant to a career in the supercomputer industry.  Faculty members I spoke with also appreciated learning of opportunities for students at Cray.  Ray Berry, from Idaho National Laboratory (INL) joined us and  talked about his work in multiphase flows.   We have had several students at BSU who have participated in internships at INL, and by meeting Dr. Berry, we have one more contact with whom we can potentially collaborate and set up internships with.  We also had  increased participation from Oregon univesities.  One of these universities, Portland State is transitioning into a research university and have offered to host the event in the Fall of 2014.  And finally, for the first time in the history of this event, we had a speaker from Alaska.  Ed Beuler from University of Alaska, Fairbanks, spoke to us about ice sheet modeling.  Promotion  We announced and promoted the seminar using a Google Groups e-mail list for advertising the annual PNWNAS events, the GEMRES (www.gemres.org) e-mail list for making the seminar more widely known in Idaho, and the NA-NET (www.netlib.org) mail server to promote the seminar to the international numerical analysis community.   We also publicized the event on a daily campus BSU UPDATE email, as well as the STEM station newsletter, and encouraged previous participants to promote the event through similar channels on their campuses.  We will relied on w...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
