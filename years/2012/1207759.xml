<AbstractNarration>This project develops new methods for non-parametric prediction, filtering, and structure discovery, primarily for spatio-temporal data but also in a range of other settings with high-dimensional observations, such as networks.  There are two novel aspects to the investigation's approach.  First, rather than trying to predict spatio-temporal data globally, or according to a fixed pattern, it exploits the dynamics of the system to develop a novel form of local prediction which still captures long-scale structure.  Second, while conventional non-parametric smoothing is based on the usual geometry of the space of predictor variables, this is supplemented smoothing together input points which have similar predictive consequences, in effect discovering a new geometry.  This approach, which draws on earlier work on information theory in nonlinear dynamics, allows for accurate forecasting of the evolution of large spatio-temporal systems in a computationally efficient manner.  It also allows for the automatic discovery of complex higher-level structures in such data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific data increasingly comes as complex measurements spread over space and time.  Scientists need ways to forecast how such systems will evolve, and to automatically separate important (but perhaps subtle) patterns from inconsequential "background" of the system, since the structures are often crucial to understanding the dynamics.  This project tackles both of these challenging statistical problems together.  It combines idea from information theory and nonlinear physics with modern tools of flexible statistical modeling to discover the intrinsic dynamics of the system from the data itself, and uses these structures for both prediction and filtering.  Areas of potential application include neuroscience, fluid dynamics, and ecology, where it would help forecast the behavior of complex systems, and help to find the organized structures which are keys to controlling that behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A big part of the explosive growth of data in our time is that it is increasingly cheap and easy to acquire, store and process data about quantities varying over space and time --- spatio-temporal data.  Statistics, as the branch of applied mathematics which deals with drawing inferences from data, needs tools for handling spatio-temporal data.  Traditionally, statisticians have tried to relate such data to carefully-crafted scientific models, but, as this sort of data grows in range and volume, it increasingly comes from domains where we just don't have such models.  To help cope with this situation, this project developed new methods for predicting and filtering large spatio-temporal processes.  These methods specifically aimed to make few assumptions about the process generating the data, but rather to learn the underlying structure, and use that structure both for prediction and for filtering (identifying significant features of the data which weren't known beforehand).  This involved drawing together ideas from nonlinear dynamics with techniques from high-dimensional statistics and machine learning.  On the the purely intellectual side, the project succeeded: we developed such methods; established mathematically that as the are given more and more data, they converge on the optimal predictors of the underlying process; implemented the methods in software; and showed experimentally that they give state-of-the-art performance.  The new algorithms proved their ability to work with data from physics, chemistry, video images, and even brain imaging in neuroscience.  In terms of broader impact, the software was released as a pair of free and open-source software packages in the R language (LICORS and LSC).  All of the papers produced are available, free to the public, via arxiv.org, and we wrote more extensively about our work for general audiences elsewhere online.
