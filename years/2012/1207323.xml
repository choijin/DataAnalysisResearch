<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project is a collaborative effort between Advanced Composite Materials LLC (ACM) and the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The main goal of this project is to develop a fabrication method - material combination necessary to make high temperature resistant conductive coatings that could be used for a variety of electronic applications. While the industrial partner is focused on using silicon carbide (SiC)-based materials as microwave oven cooking inserts, the methodology being developed in this project will be useful for all types of glass composites. The final composite properties will depend on the properties of the additives used, which could make them useful for many industrial applications in fields such as electronics, communications, military and defense, industrial heating, and other novel household heating and cooking appliances. In addition to supporting several graduate and undergraduate researchers, the project includes support of high school teachers and/or faculty members from non-research or minority-serving institutions during the summer months, with the purpose of increasing their understanding in this exciting area of research.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The main aim of this project is to fabricate conductive glass composites with different filler content and varying thicknesses with optimal properties. One of the goals is to determine the ideal thickness and the lowest filler content possible that will permit the fabrication of transparent conductive glassy coatings that could be deposited onto a variety of substrate types.  The wide availability of many different filler materials in nanosized form, combined with recent developments in the fast sintering of ceramic materials, and a more detailed understanding of how to control percolation, makes this a propitious time to carry out this project.  Bulk consolidation methods that are being used include hot-pressing, pressureless sintering and electric field assisted sintering. Thin film formation methods being used include spin coating and screen printing. The thin and thick glass composite specimens are being characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and X-ray microtomography. The dc and ac resistivity as well as the broadband dielectric, optical and magnetic properties are being measured. Modeling of the processing-structure-property relationships as a function of thickness, glass type, filler type and consolidation method is expected to reveal a better understanding of how to control the electromagnetic properties of these types of materials.  Two doctoral students and several masters and/or undergraduate research students are working on this project; this training contributes to the future workforce in this cutting-edge field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The project entitled ?Fabrication and Characterization of Controlled Microstructure Glass Composites for Electromagnetic Applications? was a collaboration between Prof. Rosario A. Gerhardt of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Dr. Thomas E. Quantrille of Advanced Composite Materials LLC.   One of the first aims of this project was to create glass composites containing different functional nanoparticles including silicon carbide whiskers.  We made many different sets of glass composites utilizing two different densification methods: hot pressing and electric field assisted sintering.  Our results showed that in addition to the chemical composition of the materials used, the method used to fabricate the composites has a strong bearing on what the final properties of the composites will be.  This is because the processing method used affects the composites final microstructure.  It is possible to get fully dense samples, partially porous samples or crystallized samples.  Images 1-3 display examples of each of these types of microstructures.      In this project, we also compared the densification of alumina and glass ceramic composites containing silicon carbide whiskers manufactured by ACM LLC.  It was found that for the crystalline composite made with alumina, densification was more efficient when using electric field assisted sintering than for the composites containing glass.  The results on the glass composites were surprising as using SPS required much higher temperatures than hot pressing, which is contrary to expectations.  Nevertheless, by increasing the temperature a few degrees, it is still possible to obtain dense glass composites.  The electromagnetic properties of the composites were also impacted by the composite?s microstructural details. Image 4 demonstrates that using different sizes of silicon carbide, when made using the same identical method, can also affect the electrical resistivity of the composites substantially.  One can observe 5 orders of magnitude change in the resistivity as a function of SiC content.  In addition to fabricating the specimens and characterizing them, we also generated numerical simulations to predict the properties of the composites. Image 5 displays the finite element model for the conductive paths with the resultant voltage drop changes when the paths are connected or disconnected.  In Image 6 Part (a), we demonstrate that filler interactions become stronger (red) when the distance between the particles gets smaller.  In part (b) one can see the effect on many different particles and how the interaction changes depending on the distance between the particles.  Broader Impacts  In addition to making a large number of composite samples, the project was able to establish that the formation of ordered grain-like composites can result in very reproducible properties.  The models generated give information about the effect of size and shape of the precursor materials and the effect of the experimental conditions used during processing.  These results are not only important for the materials used to conduct this study but can be extended to a wide range of applications such as how to control the properties of electrode materials for fuel cells, batteries and optoelectronic applications for example.  At the same time, we also learned how to enhance charge storage by adding conducting components without creating conducting paths in the composites.  Our results are useful to materials scientists, to condensed matter physicists and to applications engineers and is therefore far ranging.  Additionally, many of our images are intrinsically very beautiful and could even be used to generate patterns for their aesthetic value.  In terms of development of human resources, this project employed a total of 30 participants (14 women and 16 men).  Out of these 6 were Hispanic or Latino and 1 African American and 2 were partially disabled.  In all, 4 PhD dissertations have been completed and 2 MS degrees have/will be awarded.  The team also supported 19 undergraduates whose participation included undergraduate research and/or lab/office/computer assistance.  Additionally, the team hosted 1 high school teacher over three summers that included mentoring of 10 high school students.  This was possible with additional funding from federal work study, undergraduates taking research for credit and support from industry and other research grants.
