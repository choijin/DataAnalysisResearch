<AbstractNarration>The objective of this EAGER project is to explore a preliminary design of a Scalable and Efficient Resource Discovery system (SERD) that can be utilized in large scale distributed systems. In particular, the PI is investigating the incorporation of the following three key innovations into SERD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) A scalable middleware for resource discovery:&lt;br/&gt;Current resource discovery systems use flat peer-to-peer (P2P) structures that lead to either high overhead in structure maintenance or low efficiency in resource discovery. They also lack proximity-awareness and multi-resource range querying capabilities. By contrast, SERD clusters proximity-close nodes that have the same resource and connects the clusters using a backbone hierarchical P2P structure, permitting efficient range querying of proximity-close resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Scalable and efficient resource discovery: &lt;br/&gt;Using the SERD middleware in (1), the PI will develop efficient resource information marshaling and searching algorithms. These algorithms can achieve proximity awareness and can provide range querying capabilities that enables the nodes to find physically close resources within specified ranges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Balanced resource discovery:&lt;br/&gt;Current resource discovery systems lack a load balance algorithm to balance the resource discovery load among the different nodes. By contrast, SERD incorporates a load balancing algorithm in order to balance the resource discovery load among the different nodes.</AbstractNarration>
