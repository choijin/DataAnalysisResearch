<AbstractNarration>Parasites are among the strongest negative factors in the health and performance of both plants and animals.  Plant and animal hosts have in turn evolved robust immune systems that are organized into distinct branches that respond to different types of parasites.  However, evidence suggests that when attack by one type of parasite activates one branch of the immune system, other branches can be de-activated.  This could mean that co-infection by more than one type of parasite could partly defeat an immune response and have more serious combined effects than expected from just adding the effects of separate attacks by each parasite.  The project will test this using a native plant species and its natural, pathogenic bacteria and herbivores in an alpine ecosystem in the Rocky Mountains.  The researchers will conduct field and laboratory experiments to show if prior infection with leaf-dwelling bacteria renders the plants more susceptible to attack by leaf-chewing herbivores, and vice versa.  Use of molecular techniques will further show if this is accompanied by de-activation of the branches of the immune system of the plant that are respectively responsible for resistance to bacteria and herbivores.  This project will help fill an important gap in our understanding of the importance of co-infection in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will train undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and a high school teacher in ecology, molecular biology, and microbiology.  The award will also further the career of a young investigator by providing his first major federal funding.  The study species are relatives of major agricultural pathogens, pests, and crop plants, so results should help understand how to reduce agricultural losses.  The research should also have applications to medicine, because co-infection is also a health problem in humans.  For example, prior infection of people with intestinal worms can lead to increased susceptibility to microbial infections.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Plants and their natural enemies have been engaged in an ancient arms race. Our research studied the interactions between leaf-dwelling bacteria that enter leaves through their stomata or wounds. These bacteria, many of which are in the genus Pseudomonas, can actually move in clouds and snow. The ski industry has used the ice-nucleating properties of these bacteria to make snow because the bacteria produce a protein that allows ice to form at lower than normal temperatures. This property was discovered by plant pathologists investigating frost damage on plants at temperatures that were too warm to normally cause frost. Previous research suggested that when plants were infected first with Pseudomonas bacteria, they became susceptible to attack by chewing herbivores, like caterpillars. This work had only been done in the lab but has important general ramifications. For example, if a farmer's fields are infected with a bacterium, can one predict if the plants will be suscpetible to attack by chewing insects? Moreover, can we sort out the molecular basis of this interesting pattern? We set out to test this a relatively pristine enviornment, high in the Rocky Mountains, at the Rocky Mountain Biologica Laboraotry. There, we focused on one plant, a native mustard that lives near snow-melt streams. We found that this plant harbored a predictable community of bacteria, including Pseudomonas bacteria. We cultured these, idetified them using modern genetic techniques, and then re-infected plants with these to determine how they affected performance of herbivorous insects in the field. We found that in some conditions, one set of Pseudomonas strains increased resistance to herbivores, while another set increased suscpetibility. These differences were driven by genetic differences encoded in the bacterial genomes. Pseudomonas fluorescens was known to be a root mutualist of plants, but we discovered that in the leaves, it often reduces attack rates by herbivirous insects. This was previously unknown and my have broad implications for our understanding of why the world is so green, despite all of the herbivores around. We also trained graduate students, undergraduate students, high school students, a high school teacher, and two community college teachers through this award. Courses to the public were also offered at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory and a video on this research was created by an undergraduate student on the dispersal abilities of Pseudomonas. Finally, this award faciliated the career progress of an Assistant Professor who was a first-generation college student.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/01/2016<br>      Modified by: Noah&nbsp;K&nbsp;Whiteman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
