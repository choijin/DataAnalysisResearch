<AbstractNarration>Cognitive wireless systems are a collection of wireless network entities that are able to adapt intelligently to the environment through observation, exploration and learning. This project designs methods for cognitive radio systems to compete for inhomogeneous spectrum resources and to establish, without explicit coordination, a spectrum etiquette. Each system's resource utilization strategy must be decided with only imperfect information of other systems' actions, and the resulting adaptations must discourage any one system from manipulating the agreed spectrum etiquette. The framework of dynamic games with imperfect private monitoring is adopted to design coexistence mechanisms for cognitive radio systems sharing inhomogeneous resources and to analyze the stability, robustness, complexity, and convergence of these mechanisms. This work directly impacts the development and standardization of frequency agile wireless systems that can more efficiently use the available spectrum to support increasing demand for ubiquitous wireless connectivity at high data rates. The project is a collaborative effort between researchers in the US (at Virginia Tech and the University of Houston) and Finland (at the University of Oulu). This work will extend the state of the art in cognitive system adaptations by incorporating the ability to: efficiently adapt under imperfect information; fairly share inhomogeneous resources; and discourage manipulation of resource use by selfish adversaries. Results will be disseminated in high impact journals and conferences; the designed coexistence mechanisms will also be presented to industry and regulators in the US and Europe.</AbstractNarration>

One of the outcomes of this project is the design of a channel selection strategy to be adopted by each cognitive radio that achieves a symmetric Nash equilibrium.  The second area of focus was the design of intelligent adaptation systems for cognitive radios under imperfect information.  In an environment where multiple cognitive radio systems coexist, any adaptation by one may trigger adaptations by all others. For efficient co-existence, each autonomous cognitive radio system is required to infer the actions of other systems based on noisy feedback (imperfect signals).

Our research contributes in that direction by doing away with the common (but unrealistic) assumption of perfect observation of past incumbent activity and past channel conditions, to devise solutions under the much more likely situation where cognitive radio only have a partial, imperfect view of the environment in which they operate.  Other, broader impacts of the project have included substantial international collaboration with researchers in Finland; the graduate student funded by the grant had the opportunity to spend two weeks working in the laboratory of our collaborators at the University of Oulu.
