<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award from the National Science Foundation Office of International Science and Engineering (NSF OISE) supports a new International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program organized and managed by the American Chemical Society (ACS) for the summers of 2014-2016. This IRES takes a non-traditional approach by connecting U.S. students with undergraduate research experiences throughout Germany while reciprocally, at no cost to the U.S. funding agencies, German students will be placed into summer U.S. Chemistry and Materials Science sites. For 2014-2016, through a partnership with the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) students will conduct summer research on important topics at leading German universities and institutes, all offering substantial research projects with a high potential for resulting publications. Eight U.S. students?from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds and from institutions with limited access to research?are recruited nationally to participate in this ten-week IRES program. Conversely, approximately eight international students from across Germany are placed throughout existing NSF sponsored Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs in the U.S., nurturing the global networks of these domestic programs. Participants in both directions are matched with research mentors and projects that meet their individual interests. All IRES participants present their research at the Spring ACS National Meeting; prepare an official abstract; create and present a research poster; consider ethical issues of research; gain respect for scientific professionalism, other cultures, and collaboration; and communicate scientific findings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Strict curricular requirements prevent many U.S. students majoring in the sciences from studying abroad. While sharpening their laboratory research skills, this intensive, summer International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program provides U.S. undergraduates with the opportunity to develop talents that will allow them to work effectively across cultures, boost their careers, and establish relationships that may lead to future scientific collaborations. In particular, summer research allows students to gain international experience without disrupting their studies; increases national competiveness, innovation, and knowledge base; and assists in solving challenges of a global scope (e.g., energy, health, food/water). This American Chemical Society (ACS) IRES program funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) yearly connects eight U.S. chemistry and materials science students?recruited national from diverse backgrounds and institutions?with research experiences at recognized producers of scientific knowledge throughout Germany by means of a partnership with the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). While fostering intellectual growth and maturity, the IRES experience is intended to catalyze students? desire to enroll in advanced degree programs; deliver a substantial research experience; produce excellent scientific publications; instill a respect for other cultures and science professionalism; and provide an appreciation for the global scientific enterprise. Reciprocally, as part of this program and at no cost to U.S. institutions or funders, approximately eight German students are matched to and placed at domestic NSF sponsored summer institutes to nurture international dimensions and establish additional networks at these host universities. This unique many-to-many model where students from all U.S. institutions can go to all German institutions, and students from across Germany can go to dozens of U.S. partner institutions, significantly disperses the beneficial impact of these international exchanges beyond what is achievable with a traditional study abroad program.</AbstractNarration>
