<AbstractNarration>Dr. Julie Vano has been awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to develop new approaches to understand future climate impacts on local water resources in the Pacific Northwest.  A warmer climate threatens to alter where, when, and how much water is available for ecosystems and human communities.  Yet water resource managers, who constantly work to find balance between a diversity of stakeholder needs, are unsure how to incorporate climate change into their planning processes.  This research addresses this challenge through developing two new approaches to scenario planning that can be more effectively used by water resource managers and decision-makers. These approaches use global climate model output, hydrological models, and impact assessment tools to construct scenarios of future hydroclimate. The first begins with climate scenarios and hydrologic sensitivities to understand central tendencies and ranges of runoff changes - sensitivities identified through modeled experiments of how changes in temperature and precipitation translate to changes in streamflow magnitude. The second explores runoff extremes by using the same modeling framework, but works in the reverse direction: first, resource managers identify a metric of concern, e.g. flow above 75 Kcfs at a certain gauge, then hydrologic factors that lead to the metric are diagnosed, and finally connections to climate drivers are quantified.  Floods in the Columbia River will be the test case for this impacts-driven approach.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be carried out at Oregon State University, where it will leverage established networks between researchers and stakeholders. The project aims to: (1) improve understanding of and the connections between atmospheric conditions, hydrologic processes, land surface properties, and local hydrologic impacts, (2) develop new approaches to quantify local change through using concepts of hydrologic landscape sensitivities to changes in central tendencies (incremental changes) and extreme events, and (3) build lasting partnerships between science and management that ensures decision-maker participation in the research process, so as to create appropriate tools to better evaluate the sustainability of future water planning options.  Throughout this work, there will be a continued effort to insure results are relevant to the larger management community through stakeholder meetings, the experiences of which will be used to create a short-course on stakeholder interactions for students at Oregon State University and the larger science community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Problem addressed: Climate change threatens to alter where, when, and how much water is available for ecosystems and human communities.  While the evidence of this threat is overwhelming, it is not usually clear how best to prepare for these future changes.  Global climate models report climate changes that are too broad (~150 km scale) to be applicable for local water management decisions (~10 km scale).  To overcome the global-to-local scale difference, much effort has been put into downscaling climate variables and linking models together. While these "full-simulation" approaches have many benefits, models are imperfect representations of reality, and thus each step of the modeling cascade requires decisions on how best to span space and time, which can skew results and make it difficult to include consideration of climate impacts in decision making.  Intellectual Merit:  This award supported the development of new approaches for understanding climate change impacts that use the same information as in earlier studies (e.g., global climate model output, hydrological models, and impact assessment tools), but transform how we think about and construct scenarios of future hydroclimate. The first uses seasonal hydrologic sensitivities (how streamflow responds to simple temperature and precipitation perturbations) to construct future hydrographs.  In the Columbia River basin, this new approach compares well with "full-simulation" techniques when evaluating long-term (30-year average) changes in seasonality as shown in the paper published in the journal Water Resources Research (Vano et al., WRR, 2015).  These same hydrologic sensitivity concepts can also be used to assist in global climate model selection as we demonstrate in the paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters (Vano et al., GRL, 2015), a selection tool often desired by resource managers.  The second approach, uses the same models, but reverses the direction of information flow: first, water resource managers identify a metric of concern, e.g., flow above X cfs at a certain gauge, then through model iterations, hydrologic factors that lead to the metric are diagnosed, and finally connections to climate drivers are quantified. In other words, instead of starting with the global climate information, the approach first investigates local water system sensitivities. From a hydrologic perspective, this capitalizes on using past weather events to better quantify conditions (e.g. extent, duration, and intensity of precipitation, snow pack, soil moisture) that cause extreme hydrologic events. This can then be used to help identify how the character of simulated future events, as they continue to evolve, differs from those of the past.  Broader Impacts: Importantly, these new approaches force climate change impact assessments to first consider the particulars of the local system, the impact of interest, and the decision makers at the start of the study and throughout (instead of involving resource managers after most analysis is complete).  This early engagement can better align the research with the people who will use it.  Additionally, the education component of this award was designed to use these experiences to help inform other scientists on how to engage decision makers/water resource managers.  This was done through: (1) developing a teaching module on stakeholder engagement, first demonstrated at the Northwest Climate Science CenterÆs Climate Boot Camp, and (2) convening a day-long session and evening event on finding ways to create more effective decision maker-scientist interactions.  This session took place at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting.  These education efforts also serve to build a community of practice towards better connecting science and application that will likely continue to grow in future years.
