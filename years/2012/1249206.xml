<AbstractNarration>The Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (OK-LSAMP), through a sub-contract with the University of Oklahoma (OU), proposes to support twelve (12) LSAMP students who have completed baccalaureate degrees to pursue and complete PhD programs in a STEM field. This proposal accords with NSF's goal to increase the number of LSAMP students successfully completing terminal degrees in STEM fields. It gives particular attention to the recruitment and support of Native American, Hispanic, African American, and rural populations from the region including women and first generation college students in addition to a wide range of traditional under-represented groups. The long term goal of this program is to increase the number of under-represented students who complete doctoral degrees in STEM fields at OU. Collaboration between the Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program and other programs at OU will not only benefit the BD Fellows but also the faculty engaged in research targeted toward promoting diversity in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BD program will support students academically and professionally, ensuring they build the connections and skills needed to excel and to ensure financial support for students in all years of their doctoral programs. Program activities in support of these objectives include, but are not limited to: (1) mentoring and networking programs across STEM departments; (2) links to other NSF-funded programs; (3) student development workshops and counseling; and (4) enhanced recruitment strategies, newsletters, and community outreach. By addressing the underrepresentation of minorities and women at the graduate level in STEM fields, Oklahoma expects to increase recruitment and retention of these students into faculty, business, and other STEM career areas.</AbstractNarration>
