<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project will pursue experiments to measure thermal conductivities and related properties of small-molecule organic semiconductors, important for many anticipated applications including thin film transistors and thermoelectric power generators.  Whereas several rules correlating electronic properties and crystal structures have been developed over recent decades, the same is not true about understanding thermal transport; in addition, traditional techniques for measuring thermal conductivity often don't work well for many organic crystals, for which crystals are small and thermal conductivities low and anisotropic.  The PI and his students will use a number of static and dynamic techniques, some developed in this project, to measure thermal conductivities of bulk crystals and thin films, relevant for most devices.  The aims are to both gain understanding of what limits and controls heat conduction and to screen materials for possible applications.  In addition to Ph.D. students, who will gain extensive experience in different experimental techniques, the project will employ undergraduate education majors, who will gain valuable experience in doing scientific research which they can share with their future pupils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project will pursue experiments to measure thermal (heat) conductivities and related properties of small-molecule organic semiconductors.  These materials are being explored and developed for a number of applications, including as thin-film transistors, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices.  For transistor and solar cell applications, it is important that the materials have sufficiently high thermal conductivities so that heat generated in their operation can be efficiently carried away.  For thermoelectric applications, on the other hand, one desires a low thermal conductivity so that one can easily establish a temperature drop across the sample.  The PI and his students will use a number of techniques, some developed in this project, to measure the thermal conductivities of both bulk crystals and thin films, relevant for many applications, of select materials.  In addition to Ph.D. students, who will gain extensive experience in different experimental techniques, the project will employ undergraduate education majors, who will gain valuable experience in doing scientific research which they can share with their future pupils.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we developed techniques for the measurement of the thermal conductivity of small samples of organic semiconducting materials being developed for electronic and thermoelectric applications.  Knowledge of the thermal conductivity is important for such functions; high thermal conductivity is desired for electronics and low thermal conductivity for thermoelectrics.  Measurements included the through-plane ("transverse") thermal conductivities of thin (less than 0.0001 mm) films on substrates and both in-plane ("longitudinal") and transverse thermal conductivities of free-standing thin (0.01-0.5 mm) samples.  For the first two, we built apparatuses using techniques that had previously been reported.  For transverse measurements of free-standing samples, we developed a new, frequency-dependent, photothermal technique.  The techniques were use to characterize both polymeric materials (e.g. based on a well-known organic conductor, "PEDOT:PSS" with samples provided by collaborators at Linkoping Univerisity in Sweden) and crystalline materials based on small molecules of functionalized acenes, prepared at the University of Kentucky.  In general, the thermal conductivities were low, consistent with expectations for organic materials and also for the desired applkcaiton of the polymere samples as thermoelectric power sources for infrared detectors.  However, the longitudinal "needle-axis" thermal conductivities of crystalline "TIPS-pentacene" (a model organic semiconducting material) and related materials were relatively high (~1.6 W/m-K), which is presumably related to the durability in application in thin film transistors.  The new photothermal technique is essentially a frequency-dependent analogue of commercially available, "time-dependent" light-flash analysis (LFA) techniques, but our techniques can be used for much smaller area and thinner samples than LFA techniques and requires much lower power (and less expensive) light sources.  Considerable effort was used in extending the work from opaque materials, on which LFA techniques work best, to semi-transparent materials (including TIPS-pentacene).  Continuing work is concentrating on studying the general utility and limitations of the technique, and we are discussing these with developers of commercial scientific equipment.  Two Ph.D. and one M.S. student have completed their degrees working on this research and are now employed in R&amp;D companies in the U.S.  Another Ph.D. student who has worked extensively on the photothermal technique is expected to complete her degree in 2019.  Two undergraduate elementary education major students also worked with us during a summer to get experience in a science research lab.
