<AbstractNarration>This project is motivated by the lack of theoretical understanding of distributed control strategies to jointly optimize cognitive radio network functionalities at multiple layers of the networking protocol stack. When physical layer parameters are considered, the resulting optimization problem is often nonconvex, and therefore cannot be solved efficiently in general even through centralized algorithms.  The objective of this project is then to look at the cross-layer design of cognitive radio multi-hop networks from a different and novel perspective. The problem of jointly optimizing the sensing parameters, multiple-access scheme, routing, and rate control is formulated as a bi-level equilibrium problem, which can be solved efficiently and in a distributed way. Successful completion of this research will provide the community with a family of novel distributed algorithms that naturally implement vertical and horizontal decompositions across the network. This would represent a major departure from well-understood decomposition algorithms for network utility maximization problems that are known to suffer from slow convergence speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the development of novel algorithms and tools that will lay the foundation for the next generation of cognitive networking technology. The impact of the proposed technology to today's society can be as broad and as strong as the potential applications of ad hoc networks; for example, search-and-rescue operations, on-demand communications infrastructure deployment, and intelligent transportation highways and vehicles.  The proposed research is integrated with an educational plan designed to train the next-generation of networking professionals, as well as promote cross-fertilization of academic research with industry needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The main outcomes of this research project are transformative advances to radio access and networking, rendering wireless systems smarter in recognizing available bandwidth in their radio frequency ambiance and optimize the transmission parameters accordingly in order to maximize the overall  throughput. Fundamental challenges were addressed with regards to cognitive radio (CR) network modeling, monitoring and optimization with significant impact to both theory and  algorithms.  New models for the joint optimization of sensing and communications parameters have been proposed. The holistic approach developed for network monitoring and optimization offers modular and scalable statistical representations driven by past (and driving future) measurements and system design specifications.  Intellectual merit: The theoretical results of this project have paved the way for  spectrum sensing and optimization  tasks to ad-hoc networks of mobile wireless devices.The theoretical and algorithmic problems considered are challenging, because they require a combination of knowledge and skills in wireless communications, signal processing, optimization, game theory, and  machine learning. Working synergistically, the co-PIs and their students have contributed significant advances in a number of areas, including model-based distributed spectrum sensing (e.g., using dictionary learning); distributed optimization algorithms for nonconvex resource allocation problems; new game-theoretical based models for the joint distributed optimization of the sensing and communication parameters; adaptive low-complexity high-performance multicast beamforming; low-complexity Successive Convex Approximation methods for the optimization of interfering multiuser systems and their performance analysis. In addition to future standards in wireless technology, the intellectual merits of the project span applications as diverse as mobile ad hoc, smart grid,  and geo-monitoring  networks. Furthermore, tangible advances that resulted in the analytical tools involved will permeate benefits to a number of research fields, including networking, signal processing,  image compression, machine learning and data mining for social networks, data centers, and the emerging smart grid communication protocols.
