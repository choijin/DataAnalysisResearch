<AbstractNarration>This Exploratory Project  is developing two prototype innovative instructional modules for grades 9-12 modules, and testing them extensively for useability and impact.  These modules will emphasize the role of mathematics and computer science in planning for sustainability. The primary hypotheses is that short (roughly one week) interdisciplinary modules can positively impact students' in the following ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- attitudes toward mathematics and computer science by immersion in sustainability topics of personal relevance;&lt;br/&gt;- facility with cross-cutting skills in mathematical and computational methods; &lt;br/&gt;- awareness of interdisciplinary issues in sustainability;&lt;br/&gt;- empowerment to engage in sustainability discourse and exercise responsible citizenship; &lt;br/&gt;- learning of the STEM practices and modes of inquiry necessary to become the next generation of interdisciplinary problem solvers;&lt;br/&gt;- awareness of STEM educational opportunities and career paths related to sustainable living. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project is conducted by Rutgers Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, the Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications (COMAP), Colorado State University (CSU), the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and at multiple schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics for the initial two modules will be chosen by a high level Advisory Board from the following: Passive Solar Building Design, Weather Generators, Hydrologic Cycles, Invasive Species and Percolation, and Uncertainties with Projections in Climate Models.   Each module will contain a description of career opportunities and related jobs, and highlight a person in one such job. Module writer teams of 2-3 writers consisting of at least one content expert and one pedagogical expert and/or experienced teacher will write the two modules in the first year; they will be tested with high school students in a summer prototyping workshop held at The Groton School in the summer between the two years of the project; revised during that summer;  field tested in diverse high schools during the fall of the second year; revised again during the spring; and prepared for publication at the end of the two years.</AbstractNarration>

The Mathematical and Computational Methods for Planning a Sustainable Future (PS-Future) project was an exploratory project to develop two sample modules and related materials to examine the efficacy of this general goal.  The major activities of the PS-Future project were to: 1) produce two proof-of-concept modules with supplementary material on related jobs; 2) do preliminary tests of these modules with local high school students at a Prototyping Workshop held at the Groton School in July 2013; 3) field test in high school classrooms during the 2013-14 school year; and 4) make the modules freely available for classroom use.  The "Passive Solar" module engages students in designing and locating a passive solar home. By orienting homes to face south and using overhangs of the proper length, passive solar designs let sunshine enter windows during cold months but keep it out during hot months. Students learn about the seasonal movement of the sun and the effects of latitude and topography, and they use right triangle trigonometry to decide how big to make south-facing windows and how long to make overhangs. They learn about thermal mass and examine how different building materials can be used to moderate temperature variability. As they design their home, students discuss energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emission.  The "Weather Generators" module introduces students to "weather generators" for simulating temperature, precipitation, and other weather-related measurements in locations without measurement stations. The module exposes students to the uncertainties of long-range climate forecasting and illustrates the usefulness of realistic synthetic data about future weather in planning activities. The module begins with the statement that global temperatures are rising and asks the question, "What does this mean for precipitation?" This question drives discussion of the relationship between increasing temperatures and the water cycle and leads to simulations that illustrate the "statistical persistence" exhibited by weather day-to-day. Putting these concepts together, the students see that climate change may lengthen drought or rainy periods, and they consider the impact on farmers or animals in an area.  The modules are self-contained text and problem materials that can be used in high school courses of all types, but especially in mathematics and environmental science courses. The interdisciplinary nature of the modules makes them amenable to individual or team teaching. They provide instruction for approximately 5 class meetings of 40 minutes each.
