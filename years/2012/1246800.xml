<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this program is to develop scalable nanomanufacturing technologies for the production of high-energy density electrochemical capacitors, consisting of nanostructured electrodes with controllable charged defect density and redox polymers. This aspect of nanoscale engineering is transformative in that the constituent electrodes have a unique combination of both double-layer and redox capacitance, with very large area leading to higher energy density and low electrical resistance for enhanced power density.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit is defined through the scope of the work, which aims to integrate from the bottom up, all the necessary processes for a carbon based high energy storage density device. This includes nanostructure synthesis through a roll-to-roll process, plasma processing for electrical charge introduction, in-line metrology to provide real-time monitoring of the structural properties, for the ultimate purpose of deploying fully functional capacitors. Fundamental insights into electrochemical mechanisms and material interactions will be obtained and applied to the development of proof-of-concept devices and prototype systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impacts are the development of high-energy density carbon nanomaterials compatible with large-scale device fabrication technologies, and extending the reach of nanotechnology to budding scientists and the wider community. The potential applications for high-energy electrochemical capacitors range from small-scale portable electronics (requiring high power density and large cycle life) to large-format energy management. In addition to promoting graduate and undergraduate education and training on nanotechnology and process integration, outreach activities will promote novel energy technologies.</AbstractNarration>

In recent times, fuel cells, photovoltaic devices/solar cells and various other renewable energy sources have received much attention, and are all promising candidates for clean energy production. However, today?s batteries and capacitors, which are the main components for energy storage, cannot meet the world?s demand for combined power and energy densities. e.g., in applications that require a rapid change in energy such as power drills, cranes, elevators and hybrid electric vehicles. One of the main drawbacks of a battery is that it cannot provide its stored energy quickly; in other words it lacks power. So, supercapacitors have come into vogue as they are capable of delivering their energy very quickly.

This project proved transformational from the point of view of energy storage as it developed (a) scalable methods for manufacturing electrodes comprised of high-surface area, free-standing carbon nanomaterial electrodes,  (b) processes to tailor such electrode properties via defect-engineering or through incorporating electroactive conducting polymers into nanocarbon for hybrid electrodes, and (c) fundamental understanding and insights into optimal device geometry and electrochemical mechanisms in hybrid electrochemical devices, e.g., overcoming the inherent quantum capacitance associated with nanocarbon electrodes.
