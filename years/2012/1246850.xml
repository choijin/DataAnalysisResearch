<AbstractNarration>The devastating March 11, 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and its tsunami caused more than 15,000 fatalities and severe damage in NE Japan. The densest geodetic and seismic networks in Japan made this earthquake the best-recorded event ever. Seafloor geodetic stations recorded over 10s of m horizontal displacements during the earthquake. High-resolution seismic bathymetry data indicate that the rupture reached the trench. Model inversion studies indicate a slip distribution of up to ~50 m over a remarkable compact area of 400 km along strike and 200 km wide. Coseismic and postseismic crustal deformation recorded at unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution and precision allow the researchers to further their understanding of the rheological structure of the Earth and the subduction zone processes. In particular, the high quality geodetic data provide a unique opportunity to constrain the three-dimensional (3D) rheology of the upper mantle and lower crust and the evolution of transient slip on the megathrust. The scope of the project will be broad enough such that results will be applicable to other subduction margins (Sumatra, Chile, Alaska and Cascadia) where deformation is currently at various stages of the subduction earthquake cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the postseismic deformation of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. In previous investigations, it has been a challenge to separate the contributions of afterslip on the megathrust from viscoelastic relaxation of the earthquake-induced stresses in the upper mantle. Effects of the complex 3D rheology of convergent margins on subduction zone earthquake deformation have yet to be better understood. In the proposed research, we seek to understand: (a) What is the distribution and evolution of the afterslip on the megathrust following a giant earthquake? (b) How does the 3D rheology of the Earth control the postseismic crustal deformation? (c) What are the rheological properties of the oceanic and continental upper mantle? In this work the researchers will benefit from access to the wealth of Global Positioning System (GPS) data recorded by the Japan national network as well as regional stations across East Asia. They will also constrain afterslip using repeating earthquakes. A 3D finite element code will incorporate complex subduction slab geometry and advanced mantle rheology in the Earth.</AbstractNarration>
