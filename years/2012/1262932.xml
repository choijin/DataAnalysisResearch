<AbstractNarration>Since 2003, the PIs have been administering an REU site in the Svalbard archipelago for motivated geoscience undergraduate students, directly involving them in important climate change research and exposing them to the challenges and rewards of conducting high latitude research. Funds are provided to continue the Svalbard REU program for another year, based on the success of the program. Student research focuses on the climatic and surficial processes that operate in rapidly changing glacial, lacustrine, and fjord systems that may, in turn, archive the signature of anthropogenic changes in the high Arctic. Students define their research questions and design specific testable hypotheses throughout the program, complete their research projects at their home institutions during the following academic year and present their results at a professional conference. Most alumni of the program have gone into graduate programs better prepared for fundamental research.</AbstractNarration>

Undergraduate students gained experience in field and laboratory techniques and developed independent and collaborative projects during a 4 week field program in Svalbard, Norwegian arctic.  The senior personnel in our project have vast research experience in the arctic marine environment and are dedicated teachers.
