<AbstractNarration>The project is designed to provide scholarships plus academic support services and career placement support to students in mathematics and computer science at the university who are both academically talented and financially needy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The University is committed to offering a high-quality, affordable undergraduate education comparable to that of the most prestigious liberal arts colleges in the nation and currently awards the largest number of undergraduate mathematics degrees in the state. The overarching goal of this project is to improve the recruitment, retention, and career placement of mathematics and computer science students. This is being achieved through academic support services and activities such as personal tutoring, guest speakers, field trips, and discussion panels, and by utilizing strong ties with regional industry partners to provide career placement opportunities. Six faculty members are coordinating and overseeing all activities relating to the program. Of the 51 scholarships per year, 15 are targeted toward incoming freshmen and 22 toward upperclassmen with 14 available as incentive scholarships for potential majors taking mathematics or computer science courses. Emphasis is placed on increasing the number of women who major in computer science and mathematics and on improving retention for first-generation college students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This program is attracting more students to mathematics and computer science by recruiting more first-year students and by encouraging other students to consider mathematics or computer science as a first or second major. It is keeping these same students committed to the discipline, increasing the number of students who graduate with degrees in mathematics or computer science, and easing the transition of these students to graduate programs or to industry. In particular, graduation rates for women in computer science and first-generation college students in both disciplines are being improved. Results are being disseminated through relevant conference presentations and journal article submissions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Preparing and Advancing Scholars in Mathematics and Computer Science  Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science  Truman State University  Kirksville, MO     Background  In 2013, the Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science at Truman State University received a grant from the National Science Foundation.  The focus of the grant was on students who had declared a major in either mathematics or computer science.  The purpose of the grant was to provide specific types of support to those students, with the goal of increasing retention to those majors.  A secondary goal was to help the university recruit new and transfer students who intended to major in the two project areas.      Project Summary  Early in the planning phase of our project, and prior to securing funding, the investigators theorized that they could increase retention to the major by addressing three specific issues.  1. When a student's financial situation required them to work during the academic year, they may come to view the academic demands of a mathematics or computer science major as burdensome, and in response to this burden switch to another major.  2. Students might enjoy studying mathematics or computer science and find the experience personally enriching, but become confused or concerned about post-graduation career prospects.  3.Students could encounter academic difficulties in some major courses, and in response to a lack of success, be tempted to switch to a less academically or intellectually demanding course of study.  The investigators proposed a project that would work to address each of these issues.  1. The project would provide financially needy students with monetary support.  2. Through the use of site visits and on-campus speakers, the project would illustrate to students the wide array of employment and graduate school opportunities available to those holding a bachelors degree in mathematics or computer science.  3. If needed, the project would provide academic support in the form of free individualized tutoring in any major course where the student felt he or she needed help.  Over the course of the grant, we recruited 148 students who fit our target academic profile, who had demonstrated financial need, and who agreed to participate in the program under the requirements that we set out.     Outcome  As part of the our institution's support for the project, the School of Science and Mathematics at Truman State paid for the retention of an independent group to perform statistical analysis on the data we gathered as part of the grant operations. At the conclusion of our project, this group performed an analysis comparing the retention rates of project participants with students who were majoring in the two focus areas but not participating in the project.  The overall retention rate to the two majors of all students participating in the program over its four years was 83%, compared with a retention rate of 67% for students not participating.  This difference in retention rates was calculated to be significant with a confidence level of 90%.     Of the three prongs of our project, the majority of students told us that the most useful benefit of participating in the project, and the one that most significantly influenced their desire and ability to complete their degree, was the tuition scholarship.  A minority of students mentioned that the tutoring services provided to project participants was influential in their decision to remain in their chosen major through graduation.
