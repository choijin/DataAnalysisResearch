<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education to study several problems in two general areas of theoretical condensed matter physics.  The first area of research concerns topological phases of electronic and atomic systems: the PI will study the properties and instabilities of partially filled bands with nontrivial topology and how topological states could be created at surfaces and interfaces, for example in the unconventional two-dimensional gas at the surface of a 3D topological insulator. The PI will investigate connections between topological or geometric field theories of topological states and plausible experiments. The second area of research is on how a combination of numerical matrix-product-state methods and analytic theory can lead to insights into some challenging problems in strong-correlation physics in low dimensions.  The two goals for this section of the project are to understand one-dimensional models of many-body localization in interacting disordered systems, and to develop predictive methods for some open two-dimensional classical or quantum statistical physics problems.  This section builds upon previous work on understanding how quantum information theory concepts such as entanglement can aid the numerical simulation of correlated materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this proposal is significant, and the largest expenditure is for graduate student support.  This will contribute to the development of a scientifically sophisticated workforce.  The PI will carry out new course development and undergraduate student research supervision within the university, in addition to his ordinary teaching load and lectures at advanced schools elsewhere.  For outreach beyond the academic community, the PI will expand his lecturing and writing about recent developments and historical highlights of condensed matter physics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education to study new kinds of electronic materials.  Recent years have seen the creation of several new kinds of electronic materials.  One example is the discovery of electrical insulators with atomically thin metallic surfaces that are extremely robust to the most common types of impurities and disorder.  These new insulators are called topological insulators as the connection between their bulk insulating behavior and surface metallic behavior is described by the branch of mathematics known as topology, which studies properties invariant under continuous changes.  More familiar insulators usually have no surface metallic layer, and if they do, it is much less stable to disorder.  Another interesting property of the robust surface metallic layer in topological insulators is that the electrons moving in the layer are effectively massless, in that their energy is linearly proportional to their momentum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrons in solids exhibit a remarkable variety of collective phenomena including magnetism and superconductivity. Superconductivity is a state of electrons with the signature that resistance to the flow of electric current vanishes at low temperatures.  These collective behaviors result from the interactions between electrons.  One goal of this project is to understand how topological insulators and related materials, which are currently understood at the level of individual electrons, could lead to new collective phenomena when the interactions between electrons are included.  The PI also seeks to understand how new electronic states could be created using interfaces between different materials.  Methods used range from advanced techniques originally developed for particle physics to computational simulations, where ideas drawn from the theory of quantum information have had a major impact on our ability to simulate systems in low dimensions.  Quantum information generalizes the classical information theory which describes the operation of modern computers and data systems, using ideas specific to quantum systems. One important idea is entanglement, which is a kind of subtle correlation in which the best possible description of a large system does not imply a complete description of its parts.  Work on topological order influences many other areas of condensed matter physics and some areas of technology; it contributes to the intellectual foundation for future devices.  Several education and outreach efforts will be supported in order to convey to a broad audience the importance and excitement of theoretical materials research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this proposal is significant, and the largest expenditure is for graduate student support.  This will contribute to the development of a scientifically sophisticated workforce.  The PI will carry out new course development and undergraduate student research supervision within the university, in addition to his ordinary teaching load and lectures at advanced schools elsewhere.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported research on materials whose behavior is controlled by subtle quantum-mechanical effects.  One central direction was the behavior of electronic materials away from equilibrium, for example when they are perturbed by a strong laser field.  This allows new states of matter to be created with potentially useful properties.  Another central direction was to take the tools and concepts developed in the study of "topological insulators" (materials that are electrically insulating in bulk but have atomically thin conducting surfaces, no matter how the material is cut) and use these to understand novel phenomena in metals.  The primary use of funding was to support graduate students in conducting this research, which has the secondary benefit of contributing to the development of a highly educated US workforce.   A class of powerful numerical techniques for quantum states is based on "entanglement", a measure of how quantum-mechanical a system's correlations are.  The PI used such methods to analyze the first class of topological states to be discovered, the quantum Hall states, which are unusual liquids of electrons moving in a plane in a strong magnetic field.  The term topological refers to properties that are unchanged under smooth changes of a system, including smooth changes of geometry.  States with this kind of robustness have been quite an active area in recent years, and the PI used new numerical methods to answer some old questions about the metallic edge states that exist at the boundaries of quantum Hall states as a consequence of their topological nature. These numerical methods can be applied to dynamical properties such as the question of when a system evolves toward thermal equilibrium, like most systems we observe in the laboratory or in daily life, versus being arrested in a non-thermal state, for example because of disorder.  Methodological improvements include a new approach to treat long-ranged interactions with this class of methods.   In addition to conducting research on existing topological materials, the PI and collaborators discussed how topological states could arise in large molecules made from carbon (generalized "buckyballs" or "fullerenes"), which is plausible since single-layer carbon or graphene was proposed a decade ago as a possible host material for topological states.  Graphene, whose discovery was recognized by the 2010 Nobel Prize, is a two-dimensional material with a remarkable electronic structure: its electrons have an effective mass of zero.  There are two ways to generalize this idea of a zero-mass semimetal to three spatial dimensions, Dirac and Weyl semimetals, and after many years of searching they were recently found in experiment.  They can be understood using some of the same topological methods as topological insulators, and the PI worked on computing optical and superconducting properties of such materials, which have considerable potential for applications in the future.  Perturbations of graphene by an intense laser pulse were studied and shown to have the potential to lead to new behavior measurable in their magnetization or in experiments where an electron is tunneled into the graphene.   Students whose Ph.D. thesis work was greatly advanced by NSF support include Gil Young Cho (now postdoc at Illinois) and Daniel Varjas (graduating this year).  One undergraduate was supervised in a paid summer project and another visiting undergraduate from Cambridge (UK) was hosted for an extended visit.  The PI gave lectures at various schools worldwide for advanced graduate students, including a lecture series in Les Houches, France that is expected to become a chapter in an edited volume published by Oxford University Press.
