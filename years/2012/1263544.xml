<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1265187, 1262982, 1263431, 1263544&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Rafe R Mazzeo, Stanford University &lt;br/&gt;PI:  Michael Holst, University of California - San Diego &lt;br/&gt;PI:  Jim Isenberg, University of Oregon &lt;br/&gt;PI:  David Maxell, University of Alaska&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to understand the extent to which one can parametrize and construct initial data sets for the Einstein  evolution equations. We plan to capitalize on the recent progress using the conformal method to obtain new existence results in the  nonconstant mean curvature (non-CMC) setting, to understand the limits of these methods, and then to develop alternate techniques toward these same goals, including degree theory, a priori estiimates, and gluing methods. The Lichnerowicz equation, central  to the conformal method, is a semilinear elliptic equation. Due to  the mixed sign of its nonlinear exponents, it is of a type not yet fully understood. The full Lichnerowicz-Choquet-Bruhat-York set of equations is a more difficult coupled system which incorporates  features presenting new analytic subtleties. The ultimate aim is to  provide a complete parametrization of initial data sets, particularly  in the non-CMC setting, not only on compact backgrounds but also  for manifolds with asymptotically Euclidean, hyperbolic or cylindrical ends, all of which are highly relevant for physical applications.  In exploring new methods, we plan to use new and advanced analytical tools, as well as increasingly accurate and flexible numerical simulation techniques. Technical advances made in the course of  this project should have a substantial application to many other  equations of this general type which play important roles in other  parts of pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Einstein's gravitational field theory is a remarkably accurate mathematical model of gravitational physics, which does an excellent job  of predicting and modeling gravitational phenomena at both the  astrophysical and cosmological scales. It is consistent with every  known gravitational observation and experiment. From the point of  view of underlying mathematics, Einstein's theory involves two very  distinct types of equations. The study of dynamics of gravitational  fields involves the analysis of the Einstein equations as a nonlinear  system of time-dependent evolution partial differential equations  (PDE), while the study of initial data sets representing gravitational states involves Riemannian geometry and the study of the Einstein  constraint equations as a nonlinear system of time-independent  PDE.The last decade has witnessed remarkable progress in under- standing both equations. This project focuses on developing a  more complete understanding of the constraint equations. The study of the Einstein equations presents a very important point of contact  between mathematics and physics, one which has motivated many  advances in differential geometry and PDE on the one side, and  which also has provided a compelling and accurate model of the  physical world, both on the astrophysical and on the cosmological  scales. This project has the potential for settling significant open  questions in this area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ General relativity is a deeply mathematical theory describing the physics of gravity. An instant in time in this theory is described by an initial data set, and the Einstein constraint equations impose restrictions on initial data sets. This project concerns a technique, the conformal method, that is a candidate for precisely describing all possible solutions of the constraint equations, and therefore all configurations of instants in time.  The conformal method dates back to the 1940's and was expanded in the 1970's by James York and collaborators to become the main workhorse for constructing initial data sets.  Its earliest applications were in the context of describing a small but important subset of the solutions of the constraint equations, the constant mean curvature (CMC) solutions.  In this setting the conformal method has has numerous successes. York's insights allowed the method to be expanded to the  non-CMC setting as well, though its efficacy there was not well understood when the award began.  The project's primary goal was to fill in our understanding of the conformal method in the non-CMC case.  The research outcomes of this project can be grouped in three broad categories:  We developed an understanding of basic failings of the conformal method for non-CMC initial data sets. We explored alternatives to the conformal method that have the CMC version as a special case. We developed new applications where the CMC conformal method remains interesting and effective.   For decades it was hoped that the conformal method would be as effective in the non-CMC setting as it is for CMC initial data sets.  At the project's commencement, however, there was a single result, due to a project PI, that showed that in a special case the non-CMC method exhibits flaws.  The result used 'non-smooth' conformal seed data, however, and it was conceivable that the breakdowns were only a consequence of the non-smoothness.  One of the first project results gave examples of smooth initial data sets that exhibited an extreme form of breakdown: conformal seed data that either generated no solutions or that generated an infinite family of solutions of the constraint equations; seed data should generate a single solution.  The results again concerned a very special case of seed data (which generate so-called Kasner spacetimes), but consequently were able to describe the breakdowns in rich detail.  During the project's time frame other authors (notably T-C Nguyen), found additional special cases where the non-CMC conformal method breaks down.  This hinted that shortcomings are commonplace in the far-from-CMC setting.  Our project gave further evidence to this perspective via numerical methods.  Using bifurcation analysis software we were able to explore the parameter space more broadly than we are currently able to do with theory alone.  We found evidence of pervasive breakdowns of the conformal method in a number of far-from CMC examples.  With increasing evidence that the non-CMC conformal method has significant drawbacks, we were motivated to look at alternatives. There was already an option known to the literature, the conformal thin-sandwich method, developed by York and collaborators in the late 90s and early 00s.  We showed, however, that the standard conformal method and the conformal thin-sandwich method are actually two perspectives on the same parameterization of initial data sets.  So all the failings of the conformal method apply equally to the conformal thin-sandwich method.  This work received a journal award for being a 'highlight of the year'.  Guided by insights from the Kasner examples, we developed a new technique, the drift method, for describing initial data sets.  It contains the CMC conformal method as a special case and corrects the deficiencies of the conformal method seen in the Kasner setting.  In follow up work we showed that the drift method enjoys a technical improvement over the standard conformal method when the conformal seed data possess a rare type of symmetry known as a conformal Killing field.  These symmetries pose an obstacle for the non-CMC conformal method, but not for the drift method.    Despite some promising features, the drift method's equations are more challenging to work with than those of the standard conformal method. Moreover, the drift method comes in several variations, and the importance of these variations remains unclear. It remains to be seen the extent to which it is effective in the non-CMC setting.  Regarding the CMC theory of the conformal method, we developed a principled technique for including matter fields and we established a pure mathematics result related to initial data sets of isolated gravitational systems. Ongoing work will apply CMC methods to construct spacetimes having a so-called conformal infinity.  In addition to regular meetings with project collaborators, the award funded a workshop at the PI's home institution that brought together an international group of researchers who study questions about initial data in general relativity more broadly.
