<AbstractNarration>This project will combine observations of ionospheric ions throughout the magnetosphere-ionosphere system with the  Generalized Polar Wind (GPW) model of ionospheric outflows and a magnetohydrodynamic code for simulating the magnetosphere.  The GPW is a macroscopic Particle-In-Cell (mac-PIC) code. It will be coupled to the Block Adaptive Tree Solar wind Roe-type Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) MHD model using a system called the Space Weather Modeling Framework. The codes will be used to perform a set of simulations,  representing a combination of terrestrial season, level of solar flux, and level of magnetospheric activity. The results from the coupled models will be compared to uncoupled results to illuminate the role of the ionospheric plasma in magnetospheric dynamics.  To validate and refine the simulation results, a climatological observation set of outflowing plasma both in the ionosphere and within the magnetosphere will be constructed from historical data sets. The climatological model will be binned by season, magnetic activity, and location. Event simulations will be performed and compared with the climatological data to investigate transient dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance our understanding of the role of the Earth's ionospheric environment in filling its magnetospheric space environment with plasma. The data-model comparisons, both on a climatological and event-study level, will advance the accuracy of ionospheric outflow models and Geospace General Circulation Models. The coupling of an ionospheric outflow model to an MHD model of the magnetosphere will add a fundamentally important element to our ability to forecast the dynamics of the magnetosphere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to investigate how ionospheric outflow affects space weather.  Ionospheric outflow is loss of the very top level of the Earth?s atmosphere to space.  Space Weather refers to the interaction between the Sun?s particles and magnetic field with the Earth?s magnetic field, resulting in the aurora, radiation belts, and other phenomena.  This project aimed to learn more about outflow and space weather through the coupling of different computer models, including the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) with the Generalized Polar Wind (GPW) model.  We compared our merged models? prediction with observations made by various spacecraft and investigated how outflow changed the code results.  We also compared our results to predictions from a similar but less sophisticated model (PWOM).     We found important patterns in our data-model comparisons  1)   Compared to observations, GPW tends to over predict oxygen outflow.  2)   Compared to observations, PWOM tends to under predict oxygen outflow.  3)   GPW tends to predict the total outflow (oxygen plus hydrogen) very well (see Figure 1).  4)   The increased oxygen outflow from GPW changes our results drastically, often increasing the accuracy of our models.     We also found important consequences on the magnetotail (the "tail" formed by the stretching of the Earth?s magnetic field on the night side) in our model results when the GPW was included:  1)   The tail was far more stretched when GPW outflow was included.  2)   The magnetotail stores energy delivered by the Sun.  The tail held far more energy when the GPW was included.  3)   The magnetotail also released far more energy (called "substorms", indicated by wrapped up magnetic field lines) when GPW was included (see Figure 2).  4)   Outflow of oxygen tends to "wag" the tail: it is tilted up and down more strongly than without outflow (see Figure 3).  5)   The results in the tail were far more realistic when GPW was included.     We have learned that outflow is a critical piece to space weather dynamics- far more important that we hypothesized at the beginning of the project.  This has important implications for predicting space weather, which is a major national security priority.  It also has implications for space weather at other planets, such as Jupiter, which is being explored by satellite missions right now.
