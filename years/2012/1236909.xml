<AbstractNarration>CBET-1236909&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research addresses the need to understand workplace exposures to engineered nanoparticles&lt;br/&gt;in two ways: (i) by investigating fundamental mechanisms by which engineered nanoparticles&lt;br/&gt;may become airborne; and (ii) by developing aerosol instruments suitable for routine workplace and&lt;br/&gt;personal monitoring of nanoparticles in the 1-500 nm size range with the ability to follow transient&lt;br/&gt;that may be responsible for most exposure from well-designed nanoparticle synthesis systems.&lt;br/&gt;Controlled laboratory experiments will also be conducted to develop a fundamental understanding&lt;br/&gt;of mechanisms for nanoparticle release to the air, beginning with studies of the aerodynamic&lt;br/&gt;entrainment from nanoparticle-coated surfaces. The long-standing need for suitable instruments&lt;br/&gt;for monitoring workplace exposures will be addressed by creating a small, simple, and low cost&lt;br/&gt;nanoparticle opposed migration aerosol detector (NOMAD) that will enable exposure assessment&lt;br/&gt;with sufficient resolution to estimate lung deposition patterns. The NOMAD performance will be&lt;br/&gt;compared with conventional approaches to exposure monitoring in nanotechnology laboratories, and&lt;br/&gt;provide personal exposure data that is not presently possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The proposed research will survey sources of airborne nanoparticles using&lt;br/&gt;size resolved instruments with better time response, and broader coverage of the potential size&lt;br/&gt;range than employed in previous studies, thereby enabling detection of transient release events, and&lt;br/&gt;facilitating identification of nanoparticle sources. Subsequent controlled laboratory experiments will&lt;br/&gt;quantify the forces required to entrain nanoparticles from different kinds of surface deposits, and the&lt;br/&gt;extent of agglomeration the airborne nanoparticles that result, thereby laying the groundwork for&lt;br/&gt;a fundamental understanding of potential exposure mechanisms. The new instruments will enable&lt;br/&gt;health effects studies that are clearly needed to understand the risks of nanotechnology, but are&lt;br/&gt;not presently possible due to the cost and complexity of present instruments. With these tools,&lt;br/&gt;continuous exposure data will become a valuable tool in both health effect research and in worker&lt;br/&gt;protection. They will further enable studies of exposures to nanoparticles in the use of consumer&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology products, and from conventional pollution sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The proposed research will provide new insights into incidental processes&lt;br/&gt;that contribute to the release of engineered nanoparticles into workplace air, and the risks associated&lt;br/&gt;with such releases. The new airborne nanoparticle detectors will enable researchers and industry to&lt;br/&gt;monitor nanoparticle exposures with rigor that is not now possible. Moreover, these new detectors&lt;br/&gt;should become the enabling technology for health effects studies that are clearly needed, but not&lt;br/&gt;presently possible.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates will have the opportunity to become involved in the project through Caltech?s&lt;br/&gt;Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF). In addition, the Flagan laboratory will recruit&lt;br/&gt;participants from the Minority Undergraduate Research Fellowship (MURF) program as it has in&lt;br/&gt;4 of the last 6 years. We will work with Caltech?s outreach program to invite local area students to&lt;br/&gt;lectures and visits to our laboratory, as well as talk to the students in their schools. Students from&lt;br/&gt;local high schools, particularly those near freeways, will be recruited to undertake science projects&lt;br/&gt;involving measurements of nanoparticles in their home or school environments.&lt;br/&gt;As he has done for 10 years, the PI will continue to co-mentor a First Robotics team at Ramona&lt;br/&gt;Convent Secondary School, a girls high school in Alhambra, CA that has 60% minority enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;This has proven to be a most effective mechanism in stimulating interest in pursuing STEM studies&lt;br/&gt;in college by showing the students that engineering is fun.</AbstractNarration>

A new technique for the measurement of airborne nanoparticles was transformed from a theoretical concept into a practical instrument that is capable of measuring particles as small as 1 nm in diameter.  Designed using computational simulations, this radial opposed migration ion and aerosol classifier (ROMIAC) performed as predicted in detailed calibration studies.  Its suitability for ambient nanoparticle measurements has been demonstrated in measurements of nanoparticles in the plume downwind from a major cattle feedlot, and, for larger particles, in comparison with commercially available particle sizing instruments, i.e., the scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS).
