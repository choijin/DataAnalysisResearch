<AbstractNarration>This research is a component of a broad community experiment named SOAS (Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study) designed to further investigate the photo-oxidation of the emissions (biogenic volatile organic compounds; BVOCs) of plants in the context of the atmospheric environment of the South East United States.  The overall project will investigate the photochemistry of the dominant biogenic alkenes and their oxidation products, during a collaborative field experiment planned for summer, 2013 in Alabama. This site was chosen as a region where substantial BVOCs from vegetation mix and interact with anthropogenic (pollution) compounds, synergistically resulting in the production of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Many questions remain regarding SOA, and how anthropogenic and biogenic compounds interact in its formation in rural atmospheres. For example, a major focus is to determine whether anthropogenic emissions enhance or inhibit biogenic SOA formation, as well as the extent to which either pathway takes place.  A range of advanced mass spectrometric and flow reactor techniques developed by these researchers are powerful tools with which to address such questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOA may compromise a major fraction of submicron sized aerosols, and thus may play important but poorly understood roles in climate forcing, atmospheric visibility, acid deposition, as well as in human health effects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the Southern Oxidant &amp; Aerosol Study (SOAS) project was to investigate the precursors and sources of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the Southeast US, at the forested site of Centreville, AL, in summer 2013. The area has been recognized as an ideal spot for studying anthropogenic / biogenic interactions because of the substantial concentrations of biogenic volatile organic compounds, BVOC (mainly isoprene) and varying anthropogenic influence.  Our specific goal within the SOAS 2013 project was the deployment of a nitrate ion-based chemical ionization source coupled to a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (NO3-ToF-CIMS) to measure oxidized organic molecules in the gas phase. This technique has been shown to be a unique and selective means of obtaining molecular-level information about oxidized gaseous organic species with low volatility, which have a recognized role in new particle formation processes. However, the NO3-ToF-CIMS as never ben deployed in isoprene-rich environments.      The SOAS 2013 study represented a first opportunity to do so.  In addition, an high resolution Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometer (IMS-ToF) was deployed during the campaign as part of the same NSF proposal. The key capability of the IMS-ToF is to separate isomers of the same gaseous molecule, therefore allowing to explore the molecular structure of a given compound. Up until 2013, the IMS-ToF was only used in the laboratory. Therefroe, SOAS 2013 represented a key first field deployment for this particular instrument. During SOAS 2013, the IMS-ToF also used a nitrate ion-based chemical ionization source.  After the SOAS campaign, we worked intensely to analyzie and interpret the data collected during the SOAS field campaign for both NO3-ToF-CIMS and IMS-ToF.  We also participated in  laboratory experiments that focused on using the NO3-ToF-CIMS to measure gaseous low volatility organic compounds (LVOC) generated from the oxidation of isoprene and extremely low volatility organic compounds (ELVOC) generated from the oxidation of a-pinene. Most of the laboratory experiments were conducted under high NOx conditions to focus on the formation of gaseous organonitrates (ON).  Some if the data have been already published in various scientific journals, and have presented at scientific meetings. More  publications describing additional results are expected by the end of 2016.       Last Modified: 06/27/2016       Submitted by: Douglas R Worsnop]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
