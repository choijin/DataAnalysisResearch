<AbstractNarration>The memory system continues to be a major performance and power&lt;br/&gt;bottleneck in nearly all computing systems. And, it is becoming&lt;br/&gt;increasingly more so with major application, architecture, and&lt;br/&gt;technology trends. Embedded applications that acquire and&lt;br/&gt;process real-time data, Internet and cloud applications that have to&lt;br/&gt;analyze large databases, and the exa-scale era HPC applications that&lt;br/&gt;need to crunch voluminous data sets are just a few examples of&lt;br/&gt;increasingly data-intensive applications that require high memory&lt;br/&gt;capacity, performance, and energy efficiency. Thus, the well-known &lt;br/&gt;memory wall problem has become even more difficult to surmount and&lt;br/&gt;needs a fundamental rethinking of the memory hierarchy design for future&lt;br/&gt;computing platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to fundamentally and holistically&lt;br/&gt;rethink the design of the entire memory hierarchy taking into consideration&lt;br/&gt;the emerging device/memory technologies and to exploit the design trade-offs&lt;br/&gt;at different layers of the system stack -- from devices to micro-architecture,&lt;br/&gt;compilers and runtime systems. The solution will cover innovations in&lt;br/&gt;architecting and optimizing the entire memory path consisting of the caches,&lt;br/&gt;on-chip networks, memory controller and main memory. The objective&lt;br/&gt;is to enable 100X improvement in memory capacity over the next&lt;br/&gt;decade, while providing 5X improvement in performance and&lt;br/&gt;10X improvement in energy efficiency. The proposed research has the potential to transform the design of&lt;br/&gt;next-generation memory systems for the multi-core era, which is expected&lt;br/&gt;to be a ubiquitous part of the entire IT sector.&lt;br/&gt;The cross-cutting nature of this research can foster new research directions&lt;br/&gt;in several areas, spanning technology/energy-aware design, computer architecture,&lt;br/&gt;compilers, and system/application software.  With the memory system forming&lt;br/&gt;the backbone of nearly every envisioned future application domain, the&lt;br/&gt;broader impact of this research can accelerate the design and deployment&lt;br/&gt;of future applications. This project will enable transfer of research&lt;br/&gt;results to industry, enhance undergraduate and graduate student training&lt;br/&gt;including under-represented students, and contribute to the development of new&lt;br/&gt;research and teaching tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Memory system continues to be a major performance and power bottleneck in nearly all computing systems. It is becoming increasingly more so with the multicore era and emerging applications, specifically big data applications. Thus, the well-known memory wall problem has become even more difficult to surmount and needs a fundamental rethinking of the memory hierarchy design for future computing platforms. The goal of this proposal was to fundamentally and holistically rethink the design of the entire memory hierarchy taking into consideration the emerging device/memory technologies and to exploit the design trade-offs at different layers of the system stack -- from devices to micro-architecture, compilers and runtime systems. In this context, this collaborative research between Penn State and CMU has investigated the entire memory system design space for homogeneous and heterogenous multicore systems.  Major research findings: Our research covering emerging memory technologies such as STTRAM, PCM, and ReRAM, along with 3D IC design technology have shown that it is possible to achieve significant improvement in performance and energy efficiency of future generation multicore architectures.  Our research findings in improving the state-of-the-art DRAM and memory controller (MC) performance through various hardware and software techniques are shown to outperform the existing techniques and are thus likely to impact the research in this area. The integration of non-volatile memory technologies close to the processor data path in fine-grain makes it possible to design a new class of self-powered processors.  We have extended the memory system research to General Purpose Graphic Processing Units (GPGPUs) and the ubiquitous handheld platforms. The results in these two topics have appeared in most major outlets and have drawn significant attention form the community.  Broader impacts: We expect that the outcome of this research should have a much broader impact on our society because homogeneous and heterogeneous multicore systems are being increasingly used in a broad range of application domains spanning from high performance computing to handheld/mobile platforms. Addressing the memory wall problem for such architectures, from both hardware and software perspectives, is a growing concern that our research has tried to address. Since Big Data analysis has become a growing concern in many application domains, our research results can be directly used to address the volume, bandwidth and cost constraints for processing such applications.
