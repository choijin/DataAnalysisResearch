<AbstractNarration>The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS) will have its first&lt;br/&gt;conference of Academic Year 2013-2014 at Rutgers University in either&lt;br/&gt;September or October 2013.&lt;br/&gt;MAMLS was formed in the fall of 1982 under the aegis of Lee Stanley and&lt;br/&gt;has supported 2-4 regional meetings per year of 1-2 days' duration&lt;br/&gt;since then.  These meetings are held at various locations and cover a broad&lt;br/&gt;spectrum of mathematical logic, with particular emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;complexity theory, theoretical computer science, fragments of&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic, pure and applied model theory, proof theory,&lt;br/&gt;recursion theory/computability theory, set theory, subsystems of&lt;br/&gt;analysis in accordance with the program of H. Friedman and S. Simpson,&lt;br/&gt;and topos theory. NSF support is provided for some of the expenses&lt;br/&gt;of the speakers and attendees, in particular of the graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and those without access to their own funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Via the meetings sponsored, the MAMLS grant maintains the&lt;br/&gt;vitality of the field of mathematical logic. Special emphasis is&lt;br/&gt;placed on enhancing the participation of younger researchers and&lt;br/&gt;members of traditionally underrepresented groups, especially&lt;br/&gt;women. This is done by providing an intellectual forum in which&lt;br/&gt;all interested persons are invited to contribute and in which&lt;br/&gt;there are lectures on current topics of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information about MAMLS may be found by visiting http://mamls.org</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS) was a regional  seminar in mathematical logic that had been existence since the fall  of 1982.  For the years covered by the current grant (2013 -2017), MAMLS  conferences were held at Carnegie Mellon University, Cornell University, the  CUNY Graduate Center, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Miami  University of Ohio, Rutgers University, Virginia Commonwealth University,  Wellesley College, and Wesleyan University.  The purpose of MAMLS was  to promote and disseminate current research in mathematical logic by  making known to both faculty and students the latest results in the field.  In  particular, by exposing graduate students to current work in logic, the  development of future researchers in the field was effectuated.  The number of  people in attendance at MAMLS meetings varied, usually in the range of  between fifteen and fifty people.  The composition of a MAMLS audience  included graduate students, junior faculty (including postdocs), and senior  faculty, with the occasional smattering of undergraduates. Typically, students  comprised at least 10% of a MAMLS audience, with many conferences attracting  an even greater level of student participation.  The number of women at a typical  MAMLS meeting was also at least 10% of those in attendance.  Unfortunately,  however, participation by members of other underrepresented groups in  mathematics was scant.          Last Modified: 01/17/2018       Submitted by: Arthur W Apter]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
