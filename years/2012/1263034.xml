<AbstractNarration>This award supports the establishment of a summer REU Site in astronomical research and instrumentation at Texas A&amp;M University. The REU program will be offered annually to eight qualified applicants, who will work closely with mentors on projects related to basic research as well as the development, testing, and integration of state-of-the art astronomical instrumentation. The Site will leverage Texas A&amp;M's institutional memberships with large scale observational collaborations, such as the Giant Magellan Telescope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment Survey, and the Dark Energy Survey. The overall aim is to train young scientists and engineers in the fields of modern observational astronomy and instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU students will use data obtained with modern instrumentation developed at Texas A&amp;M and will have the opportunity to participate in the design of future instrumentation projects, providing them with hands-on experience applicable to multiple career paths in academia or industry. The Site will make a special effort to recruit women and minority students, as well as to reach out to students at smaller schools in Texas and across the country who may not yet have had access to cutting-edge astronomical instrumentation facilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Texas A&amp;M's Department of Physics and Astronomy hosts an REU Site: Astronomical Research and Instrumentation at Texas A&amp;M University.  Since its inception in Summer 2014, the REU program has hosted 31 exceptional undergraduate students from universities across the country.   Intellectual merit: Each incoming student is paired with a faculty advisor to work on an independent research or instrumentation project over the ten week summer program.  Each faculty member and most of the postdocs in the astronomy group have mentored an REU student; some have done so all three years.  The first four years of the program have been quite successful, with many of the students coninuing on to graduate school in competitive programs. Highlights of the REU program include daily meetings to discuss astronomy arXiv postings, a weekly seminar series, organized tours of campus facilities, and a week-long observing trip to McDonald Observatory in which observational students acquire data to be used in their research while instrumentation students to test their instrumentation developed for McDonald telescopes and make observations.  The summer begins with an introduction to astronomical data processing by Texas A&amp;M graduate students who have prepared their educational program at the Professional Development Program (PDP) at UC Santa Cruz.  Each summer concludes with a campus-wide poster session at which the REU students present their work.  Many of the students have presented talks and posters at AAS conferences (Mondrik et al. 2015; Nielsen et al. 2017; Riley et al. 2017; Smith et al. 2017; Witt &amp; Maier et al. 2017) and in refereed journals (Mondrik, Long, &amp; Marshall 2015; K. Stringer?s work appears in Oelkers et al. 2016; Nagasawa et al. 2017 features analysis conducted by C. Pellegrino; Riley et al. in prep).  Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of an REU program are obvious: the program has provided meaningful research experiences in astronomy to undergraduate students working directly with faculty members at Texas A&amp;M.  Marshall?s program seeks specifically to provide this experience to students who may not have had access to such an experience previously, targeting students from underrepresented backgrounds and from non-research oriented universities.  Marshall?s careful recruiting and admission techniques, aided by the active assessment of the program provided by Dr. Luis Ponjuan, a professor in the Department of Higher Education Administration, have been quite successful and the program has provided impactful educational opportunities to many deserving students.
