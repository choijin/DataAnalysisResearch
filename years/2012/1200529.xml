<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the formation of mechanically robust coatings at metal surfaces, arising from the combined action of mechanical and chemical forces.  While the methods employed in the project can be applied to a variety of metals, the focus will be on cobalt-based alloys that are of direct relevance to biomedical devices.  The scientific questions to be addressed by this work revolve around the nature of mixed metal/organic layers that form at the metal surface, strongly affecting its properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will result in a greater understanding of alloy materials that are widely used in biomedical implants, including knee and hip replacements.  The nature of the mixed metal/organic layer formed at the surface of these materials has been shown to be responsible for many of their favorable properties, but may also play a role in an observed increase in the number of painful and costly device failures.  This project will provide the necessary scientific background to develop implants that behave in a more consistent manner.  In addition, the collaborative nature of the project brings together physical science undergraduate and graduate students at Northwestern University with medical students at Rush University Medical Center.  The project is designed so that several medical students will participate in the project and develop an understanding of scientific issues underlying the use of implant materials that they may be using in future clinical practice.  Conversely, engineering undergraduate and graduate students at Northwestern will be informed of the performance requirements and constraints that are relevant to the design and use of medical implant materials.</AbstractNarration>
