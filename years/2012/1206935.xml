<AbstractNarration>Technical:  This project is on nanopattern formation enabled by photo-induced processes at the surface of polarity patterned ferroelectric materials. The nanoscale surface properties of the ferroelectric materials are characterized using photo electron emission microscopy (PEEM) and scanned probe approaches. The research project combines chemical, photo-enhanced and thermal approaches to prepare polarity patterned ferroelectric surfaces with controlled screening. In situ surface processing and deposition of thin oxide films can provide uniformly terminated surfaces with enhanced electric fields which reflect the nanopatterns of the ferroelectric domains. Surface states, defects and the polarization bound charge lead to band bending effects which contribute to the photo-induced deposition process. A second approach for photo-induced nanopattern formation combines vanadium dioxide deposited on ferroelectric surfaces to drive an insulator-metal transition which follows the nanopatterned domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical:  The project addresses the science that underpins approaches for nanopattern formation which could impact electronics or sensor technologies.  The interdisciplinary research environment will enable the graduate and undergraduate students involved with this research to gain the expertise to consider a career in electronics or sensor technology development. The project also provides integrated projects that pair graduate student researchers with candidates of the ASU Professional Science Masters in Nanoscience. The K-12 education outreach is through the ASU Science is Fun program and a new demonstration on ferroelectric materials will become part of program for presentation to Phoenix area K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project which was led by Robert Nemanich and Anna Zaniewski, focused on how ultra-thin (1-4 nm) oxide layers on ferroelectric and polar crystalline substrates and 2D-graphene substrates could enable and influence light induced deposition of metallic nanostructures and also light induced degradation of the surface. The deposition of ultra-thin dielectric layers was achieved by remote plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD), a technique that involves exposing a surface to alternating pulses of organo-metallic precursor molecules and excited oxygen species generated in a remote plasma. The process required detailed understanding of the surface chemical adsorption and reactions, which was enabled with a unique facility that integrated PEALD and surface chemical analysis with x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS).   The oxide/polar-material heterostructures were designed for specific photo-induced deposition processes.  Visible and ultra violet light incident on these heterostructures would excite electrons into the conduction band of the polar or ferroelectric material.  The electric fields associated with the polarization could drive the photo-excited electrons to drift towards or away from the surface depending on the polarization direction.  Moreover, for a surface with a pattern of opposite polarization domains such as polarization patterned lithium niobate (PPLN), the photo-induced deposition process led to a pattern of nanoparticle deposition on the surface that was associated with the ferroelectric polar domain pattern.  The research established that thin ZnO dielectric layers (1-2 nm) enhanced the photo-induced deposition of silver nanoparticles while thicker layers led to a reduction of the deposition and a pattern that had no relation to the polarization of the substrates. These affects were attributed to screening of the polarization in two ways: 1) the thin ZnO screened the polarization field to produce a less dense ion bilayer (Stern layer) in the water, and 2) for thicker layers electrons in the ZnO screened the transport of photo-excited electrons from the PPLN towards the surface. The research was extended to a number of dielectric/PPLN heterostructures, and it was found the bandgap influence electron transport to the surface and the screening of the polarization.  The photo-induced deposition process itself showed variations in the pattern depending on the molecular species dissolved in the water.  For AgNO3 in water which readily forms Ag+ ions, nanoparticles were observed on the positive domains and the domain boundaries as would be expected from the electric fields.  However, the reduction of AuCl4 requires multiple interactions with the surface to produce a free Au+ ion that will deposit on the surface.  Consequently, the deposition rate of Au was slower than Ag, and the pattern of Au nanoparticles did not show a strong correlation with the substrate polarization pattern.  Research plans called for understanding how dielectric layers on graphene on lithium niobate would influence the surface photochemistry. First we considered how graphene would modify the surface chemistry of lithium niobate. The results established that gold nanoparticles would deposit on graphene on lithium niobate without above bandgap illumination. The next step was to establish an approach to deposit monolayer thickness Al2O3 or SiO2 films on graphene minimizing plasma induced damage. The results established a novel sample configuration that minimized damage from UV light and ions in the plasma while still enabling deposition with excited neutrals and free radicals.  A separate study explored the laser induced changes of doped nanocrystalline diamond films.  Doped diamond films are being studied for photochemistry, and this study was focused on using laser illumination to change the surface properties and to engineer the surface morphology with nanometer precision.  While photo-induced metal nanoparticle deposition is dependent on electron transfer to the surface, photocatalytic processes such as water purification and solar water cracking involve photo-anodes that supply holes to the water. While ZnO and other semiconductors have been considered for photo anodes, the OH and ZnO reduction reactions occur at similar photochemical potentials, and photo-induced degradation is a significant competing process. In collaboration with Professors Candace Chan and Peter Crozier, heterostructures of Al2O3 and SiO2 on ZnO were prepared and studied. The results established the microscopic degradation mechanisms for both heterostructures.  A notable outreach activity was initiated at ASU when Dr. Zaniewski joined the physics department. Based on her research at UC-Berkeley, Dr. Zaniewsky launched the ASU Sundial Project in 2013, which implements via student leadership programming, to support student retention and success in physics and related fields. Sundial builds a social and intellectual community, provides mentoring, and access to authentic scientific experiences, including experiences with the NSL laboratory. The NSL lab was a featured part of the Sundial summer program with lab tours, a presentation on NSL research, and an informal lunch.  During the spring research-focused part of the program, two Sundial freshmen spent 10 hours shadowing NSL researchers.
