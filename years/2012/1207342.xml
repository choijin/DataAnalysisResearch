<AbstractNarration>This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program (EPM) and Ceramics Program (CER) in the Division of Materials Research (DMR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This GOALI project explores the fundamental materials science problems of integrating a single-crystalline, single-domain ferroelectric material (with polarization out of plane) onto silicon. A ferroelectric layer in series with a dielectric is predicted to produce negative capacitance, which will lower the sub-threshold slope of a field effect transistor and significantly lower the power dissipated in a transistor. This research project develops the materials and the fundamental understanding necessary to make the predictions a reality. Molecular beam epitaxy is used to grow strontium titanate epitaxially on single-crystal silicon as a buffer layer for the nucleation and growth of single-crystal ferroelectric films, such as barium titanate. The research explores routes to integrate these single- crystal layers on silicon, approaches to achieving out-of-plane polarization in the ferroelectric layer for thicknesses up to 50 nanometers, approaches to achieving a single-domain ferroelectric state, and integration of these layers into transistor devices to harness the negative capacitance state of the heterolayers and realize sub-threshold slopes less than 60 millivolts per decade. The experimental growth studies are guided by ab-initio theory, and materials properties are characterized using in-situ and ex-situ methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: Scaling of the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is at the heart of Moore's law; it is driven by the desire to produce ever faster field effect transistors. However, the faster the transistor is the more heat it generates in the switching process. New device concepts are required to enable significantly lower power dissipation and to realize the full speed potential for the smaller devices. This research project explores one of the new device concepts of using a ferroelectric/dielectric composite film in place of the dielectric that is currently used in field effect transistors - a concept that is yet to be realized because of the challenges in growing the layers with the proper crystal structure and orientation on the silicon surface that forms the transistor. The research combines an interdisciplinary team and explores growth and properties of barium titanate layers (the ferroelectric) on strontium titanate (the dielectric) on a silicon wafer. The research partners university researchers with a technology leader in advanced device design to broaden the student experience as they are exposed to problem definition that keeps the end goal of developing a viable technology front and center. The outreach activities are aimed at attracting high-school female students to physical sciences and engineering; in collaboration with the physics instructors in local high schools, the students spend summers in research groups at the University of Texas at Austin and participate in real science in a supportive environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The semiconductor industry is responsible for much of the worldÆs extraordinary economic expansion over the past fifty years.  Continuing the pace of growth and innovation will require discovery of new materials and electronic devices that operate ever faster and consume significantly less power.  This research project worked on the discovery of crystalline oxides and the processes to combine these different oxide films into a single layer that enables the innovative devices to operate as predicted.  The research involved a team of students predicting the properties of oxides and how they might form, and then using these predictions to guide the experiments into oxide film growth.  The program partnered university researchers with a technology leader in semiconductors, IBM, to broaden the student experience.     Most microelectronics devices are grown on wafers of crystalline silicon that have a very specific arrangement of silicon atoms.  Future microelectronics devices are likely to be grown on germanium and the requirements for silicon hold true for germanium.  For metal oxides integrated with silicon to function properly for the innovative device the oxide atoms must be organized into a single crystal layer that exactly matches with the atoms of the silicon on which the oxide is grown.  The atoms in silicon form covalent bonds that share electrons between adjacent silicon atoms.  While the atoms in an oxide form ionic bonds based on the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged metal ions and the negatively charged oxygen ions.  Therefore, special steps are needed to transition from covalent silicon atoms to ionic metal oxide ions while also keeping all the atoms precisely where they need to be.  A few metal oxides are known to perform this transition, such as the perovskite metal oxide strontium titanate (SrTiO3) that consists of layers of positively charged strontium ions bonded to oxygen ions and positively charged titanium ions bonded to oxygen ions.  The positive and negative charges have to balance in the crystal and alternating layers of SrO and TiO2 form.  Once the transition layer is grown on silicon additional layers of different metal oxides can be grown on the transition layer.  The perovskite oxides can display the many properties needed for the low power devices.  If the all the strontium atoms are replaced with barium atoms, the film has a fixed charge that can be pointed toward or away from the surface.  If some of the strontium atoms are replaced by lanthanum or if some of the titanium atoms are replaced by cobalt, the crystalline oxide film becomes conductive.  Because all of these oxides are similar in size different layers can be stacked on top of the other and produce a low power device.     The studies explored two ways to grow single crystal metal oxide films.  For each growth method, atomic-scale control of thickness and composition is critical since the oxide films grown on silicon need to around 10 to 50 nm thick.  As a reference, the average width of a human hair is around 100,000 nm.  The first growth method evaporated pure metal sources in a very controlled manner to regulate the precise delivery of the metal atoms needed for crystal growth.  This approach is known as molecular beam epitaxy and it allowed the discovery of films that can be grown and their properties.  The studies also explored the growth of metal oxide films using metalorganic molecules that react with the crystal surface.  This alternative, chemical approach is known as atomic layer deposition affords a more scalable process for translating the fundamental results into a manufacturable process.  Chemical routes to the growth of single crystal barium titanate, lanthanum-doped strontium titanate, and cobalt-doped strontium titantate were discovered on silicon and germanium, as were routes to the growth of stacked layers of oxides, all with the same crystalline structure discovered.  The research revealed how the e...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
