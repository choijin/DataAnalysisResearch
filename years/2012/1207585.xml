<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is a continuation of the current NSF award supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program and involves design, synthesis, and study of liquid crystalline materials that are uniquely suited to address fundamental questions and applied problems in the field of liquid crystals.  The proposed materials are liquid crystals containing boron clusters, a class of compounds that display unusual steric and electronic properties.  Because these materials have a potential to meet technological needs in modern society, the project has two related goals: i) the development of new nematic materials for applications in flat panel displays and ii) new smectic liquid crystalline electrolytes for rechargeable Li+ ion batteries. The project involves the molecular design of new materials aided by quantum-mechanical calculations, inorganic/organic synthetic methods, structure-property relationship studies, electrooptical characterization and ion mobility investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multidisciplinary program supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program is directed towards the development of new advanced molecular materials for addressing fundamental questions in the field of liquid crystals and for applications in flat panel displays and rechargeable batteries.  The design involves unique organic-inorganic hybrid molecules, which will be synthesized and investigated using a broad array of modern research tools.  The proposed work will affect a number of areas of science and engineering, and is expected to impact display and energy storage technologies. It will provide excellent opportunities for involved personnel (undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral workers) to obtain broad training in modern materials chemistry through research and also domestic and international collaborations, which include LCD industry. The aesthetic appeal of liquid crystals and their significance in modern technologies make them an attractive topic for outreach programs and public presentations, which will be continued during the current funding period.</AbstractNarration>

Consequently, the liquid crystalline state represents a unique combination of properties typical for liquids (e.g. fluidity) with long-range ordering characteristic for solid crystals.

Thus, using an external electric field, molecules possessing a dipole moment can be realigned, causing a change in optical properties. This phenomenon is at the heart of the multi-billion dollar liquid crystal display industry, and is investigated in our group further by using specifically designed compounds.<strong> </strong>The investigated materials are nematic and smectic liquid crystals and their design takes advantage of the unique steric and electronic properties of boron clusters such as [<em>closo</em>-B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>10</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, [<em>closo</em>-1-CB<sub>9</sub>H<sub>10</sub>]<sup>-</sup>, [<em>closo</em>-1-CB<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>]<sup>-</sup> and carboranes (Figure 1).</p> <p>Research conducted in the context of this NSF-supported project has led to three important discoveries in the area of boron cluster chemistry, which impacted our project and also contributed to the areas of inorganic and materials chemistry.
