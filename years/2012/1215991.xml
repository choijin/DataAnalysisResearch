<AbstractNarration>May 3, 2012 commemorates the third anniversary of the environmental flood disaster in Eagle, Alaska, and Eagle Village, Alaska. This RAPID project aims to systematically examine social factors that may affect post-disaster resilience and recovery and seeks to identify characteristics that optimize the adaptive capacities of persons facing disaster that may be mitigated or exacerbated by class, race, and gender effects. The PI presents the argument that vulnerability to environmental change is affected by numerous social factors - age, race, ethnicity, socio and economic class, number of children, occupation, etc and that each of these factors are affected by gender.  Thus without a full understanding of how women and men experience and view their vulnerabilities the ability to promote resilience is limited.  This research is proposed under the RAPID funding mechanism because time is passing and peoples' memories about the flood are fading and changing, thus time is of the essence.</AbstractNarration>

In summer of 2012 the PI collected data from 36 in-depth, personal, face-to-face, semi-structured interviews conducted in a remote Alaska area that had experienced a devastating flood.  Although the community was vigilantly watching for some flooding, virtually no one was preparing for a disaster of this scale. The absence of disaster preparedness at nearly every level in the community resulted in far more emotional trauma, property loss, and challenges than the community would have experienced had it considered the amount of flooding possible.
