<AbstractNarration>This project is creating a suite of learning modules that highlight how mathematics plays a role in understanding issues in sustainability and helping to solve associated problems arising in that area. The modules are designed for use in a stand-alone mode or in concert with one another to form a unit of study stretching across multiple class periods. The units engage students in discovery based learning, including active data collection, and they exploit technology such as the use of Web-based mapping tools on mobile devices. Pilot testing is taking place at a variety of institutions with faculty first attending workshops where they collaboratively create materials. Through the use of established assessment tools the project is adding to the knowledge base of research in STEM undergraduate education by determining factors that address the effectiveness of the modules in improving student knowledge and skills and in changing attitudes about the usefulness of mathematics. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its use of sustainability - a theme that spans the sciences and the social sciences, and affects all individuals in their personal lives and as public citizens, as the motivating context to engage student learning. The project promises broad impact through its involvement of dozens of faculty members at a diverse set of institutions for creating, testing, and subsequent implementation of the modules.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Undergraduate Sustainability Experiences in Mathematics (USE Math) project aims to create high impact learning materials that highlight how mathematics plays a role in sustainability, a grand theme that spans the sciences and the social sciences and is useful to all individuals in their personal lives and as public citizens.  Over the course of the project, four workshops &ndash; three aligned with the Mathematical Association of America?s (MAA) Professional Enhancement Program (PREP) -- provided an opportunity for college and high school mathematics faculty to learn about, develop, and build sustainability-focused, technology-enabled, single class-period projects, each offering students authentic experiences within the context of sustainability in applying various topics encountered in introductory mathematics and quantitative reasoning courses.   The activities that USE Math community members have developed and are developing, are all based on authentic applications of mathematics and emphasize the connections between real-world problems in sustainability and mathematics.  Classroom projects developed as a result of the USE Math workshops include:  Carbon Foodprint This three-part algebra activity focuses on food-related carbon dioxide emissions. Part 1 of the activity sets the context by examining how dietary choices impact carbon emissions. Part 2 explores the impact of population growth and per capita carbon emissions on emissions at the national level. Part 3 examines how freezing national carbon emissions at the 2015 level impacts per capita consumption when the population continues to grow.   Who      Goes There? In this      activity students use data to rank species on the food chain and compute      energy flow ratios. Then students use their calculations to estimate fish      populations in the Chincoteague Bay. Finally, students discuss the impact      of the ecosystem and humans on this system. An extension activity presents      the Simpson's diversity index and gives students the opportunity to discuss      the biodiversity of the system represented by the data.   Choosing      Appliances In this      project, students compare various options for purchasing new home      appliances. In particular, students compare the energy usage of more      efficient and less efficient home appliances, and calculate the      "payback period" in cases for which the purchase price for the      energy efficient model is higher, but the energy savings over time make it      less expensive in the long run.   Should      I Unplug? A wide variety      of electronic devices and small appliances are a regular part of students'      lives. Many of these products remain plugged in while not in use in      students' dorms or apartments. In this project, students measure plug      loads of several products using a wattage meter, then compute the monetary      costs associated with various unnecessary plug loads.
