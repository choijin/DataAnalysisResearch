<AbstractNarration>Probabilistic graphical models are central to automated reasoning.  The past decade has seen significant progress on two basic reasoning tasks: combinatorial optimization (maximization or minimization) and marginalization (summation) tasks.  Maximization queries are often used to generate predictions from a given model, such as image denoising or finding stereo correspondence.  Summation queries are common in model learning, for computing and optimizing the data likelihood during fitting.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key point is that for these tasks the model is treated homogeneously; all variables are either maximized (or minimized) or summed over.  However, many important reasoning and inference tasks require a mixture of these where some variables are maximized (or minimized), while others are summed over.  Such mixed problems occur in optimal estimation, decision making in single- and multi-agent systems, and worst-case or antagonistic problems that arise in robust estimation and games.  Far less progress has been made on these more difficult query types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award are to develop a new framework for exact and approximate methods for such advanced computational reasoning problems.  The project includes both theoretical and practical algorithm pieces, and studies their use in estimation and learning from data.   The project extends the abilities of intelligent systems to reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty.  It applies and tests these methods on a variety of application domains, including sensor networks and computer vision.  The project supports graduate, undergraduate, and high-school student research, and it contributes to open and online course development.  The project increases impact and algorithm adoption by deploying open-source tools, developing open standards and benchmark problems in these domains, and it encourages additional progress through open comparisons and competitions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed novel theory and efficient algorithms for approximating inference queries in probabilistic graphical models.  Graphical models are a central paradigm for representing and solving complex and large-scale problems across a broad array of application domains in science and engineering, including physics, computational biology, computer vision, data mining, and social network analysis.  The graphical model framework allows users to capture how local interactions between parts of the model (in time or space for example) combine to give rise to complex interdependencies in the overall system.  However, the computational cost of exact reasoning about such models can grow exponentially with the model size, making efficient approximations critical in practice.  The project studied how to extend existing methods for basic inference queries, such as combinatorial optimization or weighted counting tasks, and apply them to the more difficult reasoning tasks that arise in optimal estimation problems ("marginal MAP" queries) and decision making ("maximum expected utility" queries).  These query types are extremely important, but little-studied due to their inherent difficulty.  We extended the framework of variational approximations to encompass these types of queries, and developed variants of the belief propagation, dual decomposition, and mini-bucket algorithms (as well as a number of extensions) for these problems.  We also investigated how our bounds can be used within other frameworks, such as to guide heuristic search, or to provide confidence interval guarantees in Monte Carlo estimation.  During our evaluations, we created a large collection of benchmark problems and made these problems and our implementations open access to encourage future testing and comparison.
