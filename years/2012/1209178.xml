<AbstractNarration>The element iron plays a key role in the cellular chemistry of nearly all life forms. Surprisingly, while iron is the fourth most abundant element on Earth, it often limits growth and reproduction of organisms because it is insoluble in water. Parasites face a special challenge in acquiring iron because hosts actively sequester it.  To obtain iron, therefore, parasites must take it from host tissues by overcoming an array of host defenses.  Changes in host iron levels alter the dynamics of this struggle; for example, there is a tendency for elevated host iron concentration to cause increased parasite virulence across a variety of infectious diseases, including human diseases.  To understand iron?s role in the dynamics of an emerging amphibian disease, chytridiomycosis, the proposed study will test experimentally the biological effects of host iron bioaccumulation on the likelihood of acquiring and spreading an infectious disease. The project is a novel analysis of a potentially broad mechanism influencing the spread of disease in populations of diverse organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this research could explain the recent emergence of a suite of wildlife diseases, if iron is, as suggested, increasing in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems globally. Throughout the study non-scientists will participate in research and the process of discovery. Researchers will engage elementary school students and adults through innovative, university-sponsored outreach programs such as: "Ask a Biologist", a question and answer resource for K-12 students and teachers; "Graduate Partners in Science Education", an after school science program for 7th and 8th graders; and "SHADES", a mentoring program for underrepresented minorities seeking a degree in science, technology, engineering, or math). These activities will engage the public in scientific inquiry and enrich public education, fostering an appreciation of science and conservation.</AbstractNarration>
