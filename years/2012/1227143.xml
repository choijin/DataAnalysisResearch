<AbstractNarration>Centre ValBio is the only modern field station in all of Madagascar. Increasing research capacity and training through upgrades to technology and research equipment will in turn dramatically increase the amount and types of research, the number of researchers, and improve the efficiency, quality, and integration of research projects. The micro CT scanner alone will enable a path breaking method of looking at morphology of small vertebrates in three dimensions and enhancing capabilities to exchange data via high speed internet and directly connect to the international community through audiovisual updates will also increase the scientific impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This acquisition of modern laboratory equipment and GIS capabilities will greatly add to Centre ValBio's ability to increase the quantity and quality of research conducted at the center and allows sharing the biodiversity, ecological, and mapping data with other scientists which broadens both scope and influence. The long term monitoring possible will have a substantial impact on our understanding of changes in Madagascar's tropical rainforest ecosystem over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centre ValBio engages people from a variety of backgrounds and experience including international researchers, professors and students. The equipment improvements will allow more researchers to work on more varied topics pertaining to biology and conservation, such as training programs being able to incorporate laboratory processing to their field protocols so that students can get a complete training of the application and integration of research projects. Bridging field and laboratory based research in the same location will be attractive for both students and researchers from a diversity of subdisciplines thus increasing and integrating research will ultimately produce higher quality projects. For example, undergraduates participating in Stony Brook University's Study Abroad in Madagascar program will be able to conduct research in the field, understand the process of going from raw field data, to laboratory data, to analysis, to publication, and be inspired to undertake and accomplish scientific research. Malagasy graduate students are also integral participants in Centre ValBio research and training and 27 years of capacity building has inspired many Malagasy to follow biodiversity careers, and these facility improvements will increase the number of Malagasy involved in modern research and assure their contribution to the international scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information about Centre ValBio Field Station please visit: http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/centre-valbio/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Centre ValBio (CVB),  located adjacent to the Ranamafana National Park in southeast Madagascar, is one of the only tropical field facilities in this biodiversity rich country.  Since 1986, this station has been an important location for tropical ecology.  It was at this time that monitoring of lemur demography, climate and tree phenology began, well as many short-term studies of this ecosystem.  Since its inception, over 1000 scientific papers have been published from research at the CVB, some in high impact journals.  CVB works closely with the University of Antananarivo and the Universityof Fianarantsoa, and 12 other international universities.  This building expanded the scientific capabilities, providing housing for the wet season and training/outreach year round, as well as providing modern research laboratories.  With funds received by this grant, we purchased computers and Georgraphic Informations System (GIS)  for researchers and students.  Other laboratory equipment purchased included microscopes with cameras, freezers, drying ovens and a micro CT-scanner.  The FSML funds allowed us to accomplish five specific outcomes .  First, we equipped  the computer laboratories and the molecular genetics/infectious disease laboratories of Namanabe Hall on the Centre ValBio research campus adjacent to Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. These are the only research laboratories in Madagascar situated adjacent to a rainforest, and thus easily accessible to researchers needing sophisticated laboratory and analytical resources at field sites. Second,  we provided training and capacity development for Malagasy students and researchers through participation in field and laboratory research, and collaboration with scientists from developing countries. Third, we provided GIS capabilities for mapping the local region and training the Malagasy people in map making.  We purchsed and installed the micro CT-scanner, the only one in Madagascar, to make 3-D computer representations of bones and soft tissue of small mammals, frogs and reptiles.  Finally, we provided modern laboratory equipment to U.S. and international researchers to conduct high level research in Madagascar.  Through the synergy of these five goals, we supported and inspired innovative research that was never before possible in Madagascar.  Some CVB accomplishments are highlighted below:  Throughout the tenure of the grant, 154 students from twelve  different study abroad programs used the laboratory equipment extensively for their independent research projects including studies of mouse lemurs, insects, frogs, tadpoles, rodent &amp; frog parasites, plant ecology, bats and tenrecs. Each study abroad group included  Malagasy students.      Mark KrasnowÆs Stanford University Microcebus Project group cultured fibroblasts from ear punches taken from mouse lemurs in the Centre ValBio laboratory. They were able to maintain and grow samples until large enough to be frozen and transported to the U.S. for further work.  They also experimented with a procedure to immortalize a mouse lemur cell line for the first time.  Dr. Krasnow  taught a minicourse in mouse lemur biology, incorporating use of the laboratory equipment to demonstrate sampling techniques for the genomic project for Malagasy undergraduate students.  During the June to August 2015 field season, graduate students conducted a cortical bone and trabecular bone study using the SkyScan MicroCT scanner for two species; archaeolemur and paleoproithecus.  In 2014, Molly Bletz and colleagues discovered the presence of chytrid in park frog species using the CVB molecular laboratory facilities.  We will focus our efforts on further detection of this parasite and on conservation of affected amphibian species.  Other researchers using the new laboratory equipment were the infectious disease team led by Thomas Gillespie and Sarah Zohdy of Emory University; Deanna Bublitz investigating pathogenic enterobacteria in humans, livestock an...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
