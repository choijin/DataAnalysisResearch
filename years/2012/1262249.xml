<AbstractNarration>The competitiveness of a country is to a large extent determined by the technology used in production by its companies. For example, recent concerns regarding the competitiveness of the United States can surely be traced to the technology used by American companies and to the fact that the technological advances of foreign competitors may have reduced, or even eliminated, the technological advantage American companies had a few decades ago. Even in advanced countries like the U.S., technology is mainly determined by the adoption decisions of companies. Understanding the drivers of technology adoption is therefore essential for designing and implementing policies that foster economic growth. Unfortunately, we still know relatively little about the technology adoption processes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will shed light on the drivers of technology as well as on how various dimensions of technology contribute to productivity growth. The research is divided in two parts. The first will deepen our understanding of the consequences of technology adoption by studying the role that technology adoption has played in the evolution of the cross-country distribution of per-capita income over the last 200 years. The second part of the project studies the determinants of technology adoption, focusing on on three types of factors pinpointed by the existing theoretical literature: financial market development, geographic distance to adoption leaders and political institutions. One significant drawback of the existing literature is that the relevance of these factors for technology is based almost entirely on anecdotal evidence. In contrast, this project will explore the generic importance of these factors by exploiting a comprehensive dataset, the CHAT dataset, that covers the diffusion of more than 100 technologies in over 150 countries during the last 200 years. Taken together, these two complementary lines of research will increase significantly our knowledge about the connection between technology and growth as well as about the fundamental determinants of technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: By developing new empirical approaches to use the CHAT dataset to study technology diffusion, this project will encourage researchers to consider additional factors that influence technology diffusion and use CHAT to evaluate them.  Additionally, better understanding of the drivers of technology adoption will provide guidance in the formulation of adequate policies directed to enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of the U.S. economy. Last, but not least, the project will introduce both graduate and undergraduate student assistants to state of the art techniques and datasets that shall shape their training as economists.</AbstractNarration>

To this end, I use the CHAT dataset that covers the diffusion of a large number of technologies in 150 countries over the last 200 years. With such a dataset, we first explore whether there have been generic changes in the patterns of technology adoption over time and whether these changes differ between rich and poor countries. We do that by focusing on two dimensions of diffusion: the years it takes for technologies to arrive to countries (i.e., adoption lags) and the level of eventual diffusion within the country once they have arrived (i.e., the intensity of use).

We focus on the role of financial markets and find that greater depth in financial markets leads to faster technology diffusion for more capital-intensive technologies, but only in periods closer to the invention of the technology. In fact, we find no differential effect of financial depth on the diffusion of capital-intensive technologies in the late stages of diffusion or in late adopters. Our results are consistent with a view that local financial markets play a critical role in facilitating the process of experimentation that is required for the initial commercialization and diffusion of technologies.<br /><br />This limited role of access to capital in explaining the diffusion of technologies may suggest that there are other critical inputs in the adoption process for which there are no well-functioning markets. One such input is technological knowledge. To explore this hypothesis more in-depth and to further understand the effectiveness of interventions to mitigate this market failure, we make a deep dive into a specific institution that has been closing the (technological) knowledge gap of German companies for the last 70 years. Its name is the Fraunhofer Society (FhG). FhG is the largest public applied research organization in Germany. We analyse whether project interaction with Fraunhofer affects the performance and strategic orientation of firms. To that end, we have had access for the first time in history to the research contracts that FhG has signed over the last 20 years with companies that seek their assistance to solve technological problems. Endowed with this information, we are able to assemble a unique dataset that merges the confidential Fraunhofer-internal project management system and the German contribution to the Community Innovation Survey (CIS), which contains panel information on firm performance. Using instrumental variables that exploit the scale heteroscedasticity of the independent variable (Lewbel, 2012), we identify the causal effects of Fraunhofer interactions on firm performance and strategies. We find a strong, positive effect of project interaction on growth in turnover and productivity. In particular, we find that a one percent increase in the size of the contracts with FhG leads to an increase in growth rate of sales by 1.3 percentage points, and to an increase in the growth rate of productivity by 0.8 percentage points in the short-run. We also provide evidence of considerable long-run effects accumulating to 18% growth in sales and 12% growth in productivity over the course of 15 years. More detailed analyses reveal, amongst others, that the performance effects become stronger the more often firms interact with Fraunhofer and that interactions aiming at generation of technology have a stronger effect than interactions aiming merely at the implementation of existing technologies.
