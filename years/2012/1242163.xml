<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this NUE in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Unifying Nanotechnology Education at CUNY Community Colleges", at CUNY City College, under the direction of Dr. Ilona Kretzschmar, is to unify nanotechnology education at 2-year Community Colleges (CC) in the City University of New York (CUNY) system and to create a pipeline of better prepared students from these CCs to Senior Colleges such as the City College of New York (CCNY).  This goal will be achieved using a successfully tested process for implementation of Nanomaterials curricula developed over the past two years in collaboration between Hostos and Bronx Community College faculty and CCNY faculty for the implementation of Nanotechnology Education at Borough of Manhattan (BMCC), LaGuardia (LGCC), Kingsborough (KBCC), and Queensborough (QBCC) Community Colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the direct educational impact on CC curriculum and students, this project also creates a pipeline for a diverse group of research-trained students from the CCs to Senior Colleges and provides support to enhance retention. The student populations are 74 (BMCC), 53 (LGCC), 48 (KCC), and 51% (QBCC) from Hispanic or African American ethnic groups. Thus, the transfer of CC students to Senior Colleges in the CUNY system via the Introduction to Nanomaterials Course will increase the overall diversity in STEM disciplines at CUNY. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed unification of Nanotechnology education at the CUNY community colleges provides an unprecedented opportunity to create a critical cluster of nanotechnology expertise at the community colleges, which has the potential to affect the entire CUNY system.</AbstractNarration>

The effort built on the successes of two previously-funded NUE programs: one at CCNY and the other one a collaboration between Bronx and Hostos Community College.  Outcomes:  Student Impact  The project has provided a learning experience to 868 undergraduate students. More than 20% of the students were students from underrepresented minority groups and 47% were female students. Students involved in the nanonuggets at BMCC, nanoscience research at KCC, and nanoscience course component at LGCC, and the complete nanoscience course at QCC learned about nanomaterials and nanotechnology, they developed an interest in continuing their nanotechnology education at CUNY senior colleges, improved their technical writing and reading skills, and agreed that Nanotechnology is the technology of the future.  Course, Course Component, and Nanonugget Development  The project has been able to introduce nanotechnology and nanoscience components in three of the four CUNY community colleges; (i) QCC has two full-fledged nanomaterials courses (CH 116 Introduction to Nanomaterials Lecture and CH 117 Introduction to Nanomaterials Laboratory) that are offered every other year depending on student enrollment, (ii) BMCC regularly includes Nanotechnology Nuggets in its chemistry, physics and engineering courses, and (iii) LCC regularly offers a General Chemistry with Nanoscience section. Curricular materials were developed such as lecture notes, experimental descriptions, homeworks, exams, and assessment tools.  Implementation Process  Overall, we found that the implementation of the nanoscience courses and the nanotechnology components met with great enthusiasm of students, faculty, and the administration at three of the four community colleges, BMCC, LGCC, and QCC. Our implementation plan provided us with flexibility regarding the type of nanoscience and technology component each of the colleges chose to implement; (i) complete nanoscience course, (ii) nanonugget, (iii) nanoscience research and (iv) nanoscience course component. We found that a complete nanoscience course implementation, while the most challenging from an administrative point of view, worked best in providing an in-depth nanotechnology education to interested students, whereas the nanonuggets were more suited to raise interest in nanoscience and -technology. Nanoscience research by itself was not found to be effective in introducing nanoscience and -technology to the curriculum. The nanoscience course component provided an interesting alternative to a course, as it lowered administrative barriers while at the same time providing enough time for the introduction of students to nanotechnology using a hands-on laboratory experience.
