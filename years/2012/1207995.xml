<AbstractNarration>he asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a model of interacting particles on a lattice.  ASEP is one of the simplest, nontrivial stochastic models in which to study transport phenomena as it models processes far from equilibrium.  As such the model has attracted much attention from both mathematicians and physicists.  This award will support (1) the exploration of the underlying integrable structure of ASEP using spectral methods, (2) the generalization of ASEP to multi-species where there are now second-class, third-class, etc. particles, and (3) ASEP on the half-line.  The integrable structure referred to commonly goes under the name ``Bethe Ansatz''; and in (3) this project will support the analysis of the new structures required in restricting to a half-line.  (Here the familiar sum over permutations in Bethe Ansatz is replaced by a sum over signed permutations.) A closely related model is the quantum spin model called the Heisenberg-Ising model.  This project will support the analysis of the domain wall problem in the Heisenberg-Ising chain.  A long-term goal of this project is the study of limit laws and their universality in these various models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gaussian distribution (the familiar bell-shaped curve) is important because of its universality; that is, it applies to a wide variety of seemingly unrelated problems.  The underlying common theme for all these problems is the fact that the objects under study have some degree of ``independence'';  or stated in more physical terms, are non-interacting (or weakly interacting).  These types of problems are well-understood both physically and mathematically.  Current research involves processes which are strongly interacting; and as such, there is no satisfactory general theory as there exists for the non-interacting cases.  In the search for new universal laws, the ideas, methods and results of random matrix theory, interacting particle systems and their associated limit theorems; in particular, the Tracy-Widom (TW) distributions, have found an ever widening impact in science and engineering.  Since their initial discovery in random matrix theory, the TW distributions have been shown to describe the properties of a number of random systems including the fluctuations of a large class of growing interfaces and directed polymer systems.  These same TW distributions are now regularly used in multivariate statistical analysis where they have become a standard statistical tool for inferring population structure from genetic data.  Their use in engineering involving signal analysis and wireless communications is just beginning.  This project extends the scope of these theoretical investigations; and as such, will make available to a wider audience the resulting mathematical results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on three areas of mathematical physics: (1) the  interacting particle system called the "asymmetric simple exclusion  process" (ASEP for short).  This is a one-dimensional Markov process of  infinitely many random walkers interacting by an exclusion rule; (2) the  ground state energy of a bosonic (and fermionic) delta-function gas  (sometimes called the Lieb-Liniger model in the bosonic case and the  Gaudin-Yang model in the fermionic case); (3) properties of the magnetic  susceptibility of the two-dimensional Ising model (a classic model of  ferromagnetism).  In earlier work of the PI and Harold Widom, an  exact formula was derived for the distribution function for any particle  (a one-point distribution function) starting with either step initial  condition (all particles initially on the integer half-line) or  step-Bernoulli initial condition (a certain random initial condition).  These exact distribution functions were the starting point for the exact  derivation of the distribution of the height function for the KPZ  equation (work by Amir-Corwin-Quastel and independently  Sasamoto-Spohn).  The KPZ equation describes the fluctuations of a  stochastic growing interface.  In subsequent experiments by Takeuchi and  Sano, these distribution functions were experimentally confirmed.  This  project focused on extensions of the earlier work to half-line  geometries, multiple species ASEP, and most significantly to contiguous  blocks of particles in ASEP with step initial condition.  The latter  work is a special n-point function and involved new combinatoric  identities that point to future progress in the analysis of n-point  functions. The graduate student Kyle Johnson extended this work to  blocks with step-Bernoulli initial condition.  The ground state  energy asymptotic expansions (small couping) were extended with the  bosonic case correcting some earlier errors and the fermionic expansion  put on a rigorous level.  Since its introduction in 1963, the bosonic  delta-function model has only gained in importance due to the fact that  "recent experimental and theoretical work has shown that there are  conditions in which a trapped, low-density Bose gas behaves like the  one-dimensional delta-function Bose gas" model of Lieb and Liniger  Since  the work of Onsager and Yang, the free energy and spontaneous  magnetization have been known exactly. The next most important  thermodynamic quantity is the magnetic susceptibility.  To date there is  no exact closed formula for this susceptibility.  It is conjectured  that the susceptibility  in the high-temperature phase is separated from  the low-temperature phase in the complex temperature plane by a natural  boundary.  This conjecture, still open, is based upon the formal  analysis by Nickel. The PI and Widom proved a similar conjecture for the  diagonal susceptibility (a simpler but similar quantity) of the Ising  model.  This work was generalized to extend to a broad class of Toeplitz  determinants.       Last Modified: 12/02/2019       Submitted by: Craig A Tracy]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
