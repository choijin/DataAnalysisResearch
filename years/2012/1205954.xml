<AbstractNarration>This project is supporting a workshop to explore issues relating to sustainability and institutionalization of projects funded under the STEM Talent Expansion Program (STEP). In particular, the workshop is bringing together Principal Investigators of both new and established STEP projects with representatives from regional Workforce Development organizations from around the country. The seeds of this effort lie in the experiences of the STEP project leadership at the University of Central Florida who have successfully engaged with staff at Workforce Central Florida (WCF), which is that region's authority for workforce planning, programs, and the regional labor market. The primary expected outcome of this workshop is the creation of a set of new partnerships between STEP grantees and Workforce Development organizations from the different projects' respective regions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of the STEPWork meetings was to positively impact the institutionalization and sustainability efforts of successful STEP and other NSF grants. Emphasis was placed on sustainability efforts involving partnerships of NSF grantees and Workforce organizations from their region. UCF was the recipient of a STEP 1A grant (2006-2012), named the EXCEL program at UCF (#0525429) which established a strong partnership with the&nbsp;Workforce&nbsp;Board in UCF's region, CareerSource Central Florida. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>To achieve STEPWork&rsquo;s goal a number of objectives were identified. Junior and senior NSF DUE awardees were paired with their regional Workforce Board representatives to participate and learn from the STEPWork activities and NSF personnel who demonstrated successful models of sustainability efforts involving Workforce Boards. The end goal was to create local partnerships for joint proposal development to be considered by the Workforce Boards in their region which would help sustain the NSF projects beyond the life of the grant period.</p> <p>Since the inception of the project, 27 NSF funded institutions (Middle Tennessee State, Univ. of Central Oklahoma, California State San Marcos, Univ. of South Florida, Cleveland State Univ., Concordia College, Concordia Univ.

Sacramento, Lamar Univ., UW-Platteville Foundation, Inc., Grand Valley State Univ., Montgomery College) and 24 Workforce Boards (Middlesex County Workforce Investment Board, Larimer County Workforce Center, Workforce Development Council of Seattle-King County, Florida Management Solutions - CSNCFL, Sacramento Works, Workforce Solutions Southeast Texas, Workforce Solutions of Central Texas, San Diego Workforce Partnership, Greater Fargo Moorhead Economic Development Corporation, Montgomery County Workforce Investment Board, Southwest Ohio Region Workforce Investment Board, Ohio Means Jobs| Cleveland - Cuyahoga County, Hawaii State Workforce Development Council, CareerSource Tampa Bay/CareerSource Pinellas, CareerSource Palm Beach County, CareerSource North Central Florida, CareerSource Central Florida,&nbsp;CareerSource Flagler Volusia,&nbsp;CareerSource Northeast Florida, CareerSource Brevard, CareerSource Tampa Bay, Capital Area Michigan Works, Coastal Workforce Investment Board, Central Oklahoma Workforce Investment Board) participated in the project, some were represented at multiple meetings.</p> <p>Participants provided feedback at six months, one year and annually thereafter on the partnership progression and any artifacts produced. Examples include: The University of Central Oklahoma (UCO) submitted an IUSE for workforce development through undergraduate internship and research. UCO was successful in establishing a network of more than 30 local and state agencies, businesses, firms and other institutions as STEM workforce partners. Other institutions reported making deeper connections with workforce board representatives as a result of the meeting and were pursuing internship opportunities or scholarship programs funded through the Workforce Investment Act. University of Wisconsin &ndash; Platteville was successful in getting a local workforce board member to agree to serve on the STEP External Advisory Board as well as having new STEM majors added to the degrees eligible for workforce funding in their area. Concordia College had students participate in the job shadow program with the Greater Fargo Moorhead Economic Development Council. San Jacinto College District and University of Houston Clear Lake submitted a proposal to DOE for a grant to extend their current work on underwater robotic development and were awarded two grants with Aerospace Academy at NASA. The Space Alliance Technology Outreach Program funded a project where SJCD made enough to pay for engineering equipment for two campuses. Follow up will continue with the 2014 to 2016 cohorts to determine long term results.</p> <p>UCF continued to broaden its partnership with CareerSource Central Florida (CSCF). In 2014-2016 UCF worked to assist CSCF in having nine new bachelor degree programs added to the list of STEM degrees eligible for workforce funding in the Central Florida area. As a result, eleven undergraduate seniors with significant financial need were approved for up to $7,000 in scholarships to complete their degree programs. All graduated. Additionally, 60 seniors were supported in a paid (up to $6,000) 24 week internship experience with over 20 local businesses.
