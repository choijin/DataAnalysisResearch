<AbstractNarration>How do effects of high levels of incarceration of parents on their children vary across the U.S.?  Research has not systematically examined variation in these effects with a comprehensive and representative national sample that allows analysis of variation across U.S states. This research will be the first to examine variation in effects of maternal and paternal incarceration using a research design that can jointly examine state and school level policies on children.  The research will be based on data gathered since 1995 on adolescents who are now adults in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [Add Health].  The research will apply a life course theory to examine potentially modifiable pathways from childhood to adolescence and early to middle adulthood, focusing on such well measured developmental factors as high school grades, delinquency, justice system contacts, depressed feelings, and substance use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching thesis is that variable effects of parental imprisonment are experienced by youth transitioning into and through adulthood in American society.  The approach is intergenerational in linking imprisoned parents to children; inter-institutional in connecting state punishment policies with local schools; and intersectional in differentiating outcomes along racial/ethnic and gender lines of inequality. The research is concerned with explaining early adult outcomes of inequality, including earnings, employment, financial strain, and perceived relative socio-economic position.  The sample is a historically unique cohort of parents and children born during the peak growth years (the 1980s) of mass incarceration and surveyed four times during the expansion of American imprisonment.  The project includes the following objectives: (1) develop measures of state punishment to be appended to the Add Health data; (2) test state punishment effects; (3) test school punishment policies and related school effects; and (4) test parental imprisonment effects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In a context of a major growth in incarceration in the United States since the 1970s, our project focuses on the long-term effects of parental incarceration on the next generation.  We have extensively tested the effects of parental incarceration on young adult children using a nationally representative data set of those with and without an incarcerated parent (The National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health or Add Health).  We have analyzed the effects of both maternal and paternal imprisonment and have found associations between parental incarceration and young adult educational attainment, social exclusion, self-reported health, depression and substance use.  We have further developed a multi-level framework for better understanding parental incarceration effects in the USA by considering micro- and macro-level influences on these child outcomes.  We have developed a data base that operationalizes punitive (i.e., exclusionary) and supportive (i.e., inclusionary) policy contexts that is being appended to respondent information in Add Health to further test our multi-level framework of parental incarceration effects on children.  We have communicated the results of this research project in academic journal articles, presentations and other related venues.  The results of our published papers include the following findings: 1) Schools with higher concentrations of incarcerated fathers and mothers decrease the educational attainment of youth, including those who do not themselves have an incarcerated parent;  2) Parental incarceration is associated with young adult economic and food insecurity as evidence by research using advanced data analysis techniques; 3) Maternal incarceration is positively associated with depressive symptoms and paternal incarceration is a risk factor for substance use, consistent with an intergenerational stress hypothesis where incarceration among both mothers and fathers is influential; and 4)  School levels of parental incarceration and individual level parental incarceration detrimentally affects young adult income and earnings levels.
