<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 1264886&lt;br/&gt;PI: Garimella  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This workshop proposal will bring together experts in power plant cooling to address a critical issue, that of using clean water in condensers and cooling towers in power plants. The awareness of limited clean water supply has raised focus on this issue since a significant fraction of the water is used in power generation industry. This is part of the Energy-Water nexus issue that has been brought to the forefront recently. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The workshop will include a review of the state of the art in current technology, operating conditions and requirements, related emerging technologies being developed for other industries, and the advances needed in these areas. Leading experts from industry and academia will present these reviews. This will be followed by breakout sessions in selected topics to discuss and identify high impact directions. It is anticipated that a roadmap for future work in cooling technology will come from this workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A motivation for pursuing research in this area is "the increased concern regarding the availability of water and the impact of the cooling water consumption and withdrawal on the environment." The current cooling technology uses  condensers that utilize either once-through cooling (where water extracted from a large body such as the sea or lake is used), or cooling towers, or air-cooling to condense the steam discharge from the turbine. The workshop will help identify technologies and challenges towards reducing water consumption in energy generation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  In the U.S. Power generation industry, steam-electric plants account for approximately 40% of the nationÆs total freshwater withdrawals and approximately 3% of the nationÆs total freshwater consumption. Power plants rely on condensers that use once-through cooling, recirculating wet-cooling towers, or air-cooling to condense the steam discharge from the turbine. The rate of water use in power-stations with recirculating wet cooling systems, currently estimated to be 42% of the U.S. steam power plants, may not be sustainable at some locations across the country. Further, thermal discharges from once-through cooling, used in 43% U.S. steam power plants, face increasing regulatory challenges. Therefore, developing cost effective options for reducing water use for power plant cooling has emerged as a widespread national need.  Air cooled steam condensers (installed in only 1% of U.S. steam plants) are a water-efficient option but can have up to 10% power production penalty on hot days, and up to five times higher capital costs compared to current cooling tower and water cooled surface condenser systems. Innovations in air-cooled condensers and in hybrid wet-dry cooling technologies are needed to reduce these penalties and capital costs.  Program Outcomes  Intellectual Merit: This workshop brought together experts from academia and industry to define a research roadmap to advance power plant cooling with a focus on reducing water-use, and to build a foundation for a joint NSF-EPRI research program to reduce power plant water consumption. The workshop included a review of the state of the art in current technology, operating conditions and requirements, relating emerging technologies being developed for other industries, NSF and EPRI program overview, and the advances needed in these areas. This was followed by breakout sessions in selected topics to discuss the research issues and to identify high impact directions.  Broader Impacts:  A total of approximately 100 people attended various sessions of the workshop throughout the day, facilitating engaging discussions between the audience, the speakers and the organizers.  Several significant critical needs for research were identified, to help formulate a roadmap for this NSF-electric power industry collaboration.  The program overview and the detailed presentations made by the individual speakers were disseminated widely and have guided power plant industry, US DOE and NSF research programs in this area.
