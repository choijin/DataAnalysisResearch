<AbstractNarration>Natural chemical defenses occur in all plants and can be toxic to animals that eat plants (herbivores). Interestingly, some herbivores are able to eat and then use these naturally-occurring chemicals to protect themselves from predators and parasites.  Because bees consume large amounts of nectar and pollen that contain these chemicals, they may be able use them as a form of self-medication.  This work will test that idea.  The research has three main objectives: (1) Pollen and nectar will be collected from wild plant species and tested for potentially protective chemicals. This will reveal the extent to which bees are naturally exposed to such chemicals. (2) Laboratory experiments will determine which chemicals may affect disease in bees. (3) Laboratory and field experiments will test the role of the same chemicals on disease transmission between flowers and bees. Taken together, this research represents a novel approach and will provide insight into how plant defensive chemicals can impact wild animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work also addresses the contemporary societal issue of bee health and disease. Many bee populations are in steep decline, which poses a large threat to society because bees provide pollination services that are essential for plant conservation and crop production -- services that are worth billions of dollars annually in the United States.  While the combination of many factors is responsible for the crash of bee populations, diseases are one of the major culprits.  Understanding whether bees can use particular compounds in nectar and pollen to self-medicate has great potential for discovery of new mechanisms to manage bee diseases and combat pollinator decline.  Finally, by training students in bee ecology, this project will help produce a new generation of scientists with the skills needed to pursue solutions to bee decline and other ecological threats.</AbstractNarration>

Animal pollination is necessary for the production of 35% of the global food supply, and pollinators are essential for the production of at least 90 major crops in the United States.

This suggests that bees are regularly exposed to many chemical defenses with unknown consequences for their health. There was little overlap in the chemistry of pollen and nectar. Pollen typically had 20- to 200 times more concentrated defenses than nectar, and 60% more different compounds. Although our preliminary data found consistent effects of several nectar chemical defenses in reducing a pathogen in bumble bees, follow up experiments produced inconsistent results, suggesting that the effect of nectar chemicals on pathogens may depend on the pathogen strain or bee colony. In the course of this work, we also compared the effect of three different pollens on the same pathogen, and found that sunflower pollen dramatically and consistently reduced this pathogen. Furthermore, bumble bees from farms with more sunflower had lower pathogen infection. Sunflower pollen did not reduce performance of bumble bees, but was detrimental to honey bee survival, even though it also reduced infection by a honey bee pathogen. This suggests that sunflowers may provide options for pollinator plantings and colony supplements for chemical-free methods of reducing pathogens in bumble bees; we will evaluate this further in future work. Finally, we found that the extent of disease transmission varied four-fold depending on what plant species bumble bees were foraging on, although very few floral traits actually predicted which plant species transmitted a lot or little pathogen.
