<AbstractNarration>Over the last half century, the Internet has moved from a medium for resource sharing to one centered on the access and distribution of content. This research effort leverages insights from social science research to characterize shared interest in content distributing services and explore the implications of these findings on the design of existing and future services. Its agenda is predicated on the observation that a thorough understanding of shared interest in content - what content people want to share, when, and where - is key to the design, implementation and management of content distribution services, dictating these services' architectures and dynamic organizations, determining performance experienced by users and the impact they have on the underlying network. The effort leverages the view of users in a popular content distribution system to explore these and other aspects of content distribution and serve as a testbed for gaining social scientific insights in the evolution and dynamics of shared interest and content distribution networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Research findings from this effort will be made available as publications, datasets and software. When applicable, the software will be integrated into existing systems such as BitTorrent, building on our previous successes. The impact of the proposed work will naturally extend beyond existing services and networks to inform the design of future content distribution services and new content-centric Internet architectures through close interaction with the Internet Engineering Task Force and collaborating research labs. In addition to the promising research questions and practical benefits, the project will have a direct impact on education in communication, network and distributed systems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the last half century, the Internet has moved from a medium for resource sharing (e.g. card readers, printers or supercomputers) to one centered on the access and distribution of content. Digital content has been doubling every two years in the last few years and is expected to reach 40 trillion Gigabytes by 2020. This growth in available content has fueled the success and popularity of new services, from peer-to-peer (e.g. P2PNext, BitTorrent, BBC iPlayer) to content distribution networks (e.g. Akamai, Limelight) and more recent personalized streaming services (e.g., Periscope). According to a recent report, content distribution accounts for as much as 80% of the aggregate Internet traffic in North America. This effort leveraged insights from social science research to characterize shared interest in Internet-scale content distributing services and explore the implications of these findings on the design of existing and future services.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The work initially leveraged the view of users in one of the most popular content distribution systems, the P2P BitTorrent system, to experimentally characterize shared interest in content and investigate its implication on the performance, efficiency and impact content distribution services have on the underlying networks. Leveraging this perspective and new methodological approaches from the social sciences, we made advances &ndash; among other fronts --- on the analysis and modeling of user behaviors and activity patterns in fully decentralized content distribution systems, showing the extent to which users are specialized, with well-defined profiles, and the high correlation between the abundance of certain user profiles in a country with socioeconomic factors. We were also able to quantify the true impact of file-sharing laws on user behavior, identifying behavioral trends otherwise difficult to identify. Relying on the centrality of content and content distribution, we carried out the first global-scale study of cell networks, their organization, use and growing criticality in many regions. Our findings are guiding efforts from content distribution services to improve the quality of experience of mobile clients through better client localization and request redirection.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On the methodological front, we developed relational event models, which are a form of dynamic social network analysis, for analyzing knowledge sharing networks in multi-team systems. Our work helped us understand how teams manage information internally and externally, and what the implications are for system performance. We also developed methodological extensions to the framework, with applications to organizational and information system science. We introduced a structured influence process framework to explain how social networks and human social motives (i.e., the process of social influence wherein one person&rsquo;s attitudes and behaviors affect another&rsquo;s) are used collectively to enact social influence within a community. We applied this to understand the impact of broader context in broadband network usage and the importance of service reliability for broadband users yielding some interesting findings, including the relationship between user demand on the network, retail price of available broadband services and the performance of the service to which the user subscribes. Our study offers several insights on the interplay between user demand and broadband market features that are of value to the research community, network operators and policy makers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project was also the training ground for several undergraduate, graduate students and research staff who have developed expertise in network measurement, experimentation, network topology and analysis and routing protocols, and had the opportunity of experimenting with the transfer of ideas, data and methodologies across fields.
