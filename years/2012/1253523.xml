<AbstractNarration>The development of six curricular projects that integrate mathematics based on the Common Core Mathematics Standards with science concepts from the Next Generation Science Standards combined with an engineering design pedagogy is the focus of this DRK-12 CAREER project from the University of Virginia. Research on the learning sciences with a focus on a knowledge integration perspective of helping students build and retain connections among normative and relevant ideas and existing knowledge structures the development of the WiseEngineering learning environment, an online learning management system that scaffolds engineering design projects. WiseEngineering provides support for students and teachers to conduct engineering design projects in middle and high school settings. Dynamic virtualizations that enable learners to observe and experiment with phenomena are combined with knowledge integration patterns to structure a technology rich learning environments for students. The research focuses on the ways in which metacognition, namely self-knowledge and self-regulation interact with learning in these technology-enhanced environments.Embedded assessments and student pre and post-testing of key science and mathematics constructs provide evidence of the development of student understanding.A rubric that examines knowledge integration is used to examine the extent wo which students understand how multiple concepts interact in a given context. A mixed-methods research design will examines how students and teachers in middle school mathematics and science courses develop understanding of the underlying principles in STEM. The PI of this award has integrated research and education in this proposal by connecting her research on engineering design and technology-enabled learning environments with the preservice secondary education methods course that she teachs. In addition, she has folded the research into the instructional technology graduate courses of which she is the instructor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineering design is a key area of the Next Generation Science Standards that requires additional curricular materials development and research on how students integrate concepts across mathematics and science to engage in these engineering practices. The technology-rich learning environment, WISEngineering, provides the context to examine how student engineering design principles evolve over time. The opportunitiy for students to provide critiques of each others' work provides the context in which to examine crucial metacognitive principles.  Classroom observations and teacher interviews provides the opportunity to examine how the technology-rich engineering design learning environment integrates STEM knowledge for teachers as well as students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project developed, implemented, and researched student learning with WISEngineering. WISEngineering units are technology-enhanced engineering projects (~90-200 minutes of instructional time) to augment student learning in middle and high school mathematics and science classrooms. WISEngineering curricular units feature computer-based interactive simulations, collaboration tools, and engineering tools such as digital design journals and portfolios of students? physical prototypes. In total, the project created, implemented, and refined twelve student WISEngineering projects across physical, life, earth, and environmental science, as well as geometry and integrated mathematics classrooms. All units were developed in close collaboration with participating teachers, and were implemented in classrooms and refined based on student learning outcomes and teacher feedback. Across all of the years of the project, students made significant progress from pretests to posttests on targeted concepts across mathematics and science contexts, representing an increase in the number and connections of normative ideas. Analysis of students' log data revealed that students spent the large proportion of time developing knowledge and creating prototypes of designs, crucial to integrating engineering projects in mathematics and science classrooms. Further analysis of data revealed that students needed support to monitor and reflect upon science ideas, especially when testing, evaluating, and revising designs. The project also developed the Teacher Responding Tool (TRT) that used natural language processing technologies to provide teachers<em> </em>with guidance recommendations<em> </em>pre-selected for a given student response. The TRT directly resulted from feedback and observations in WISEngineering classrooms, as teachers needed support to notice and respond to mathematical and scientific ideas present or not present in explanations. Instead of teachers being somewhat sidelined with automated guidance given only to the student, the TRT helped teachers notice and give targeted feedback to students in design projects.
