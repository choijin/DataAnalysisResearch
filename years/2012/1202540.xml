<AbstractNarration>A promising route to fusion power for electricity production is the tokamak - a toroidal (or bagel-shaped) magnetic confinement device that confines hot plasma composed of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons.  Non-neutral plasma, on the other hand, which is composed of relatively cold particles all of one type (either positively or negatively charged), is typically trapped in a straight device that uses a combination of electric and magnetic fields.  Such non-neutral systems are used to store antimatter and also serve as candidates for quantum computing elements and next generation precision time standards, among other uses.  The project at Lawrence University, a four-year liberal arts college, might be characterized as lying "between a clock and a hot place," as it uses a toroidal magnetic field (like the tokamak) to confine and study a pure electron (i.e., non-neutral) plasma.  The apparatus, which was designed and constructed with prior NSF/DOE support, is uniquely positioned to explore untested fundamental aspects of the physics of charged particle collections in a curved and non-uniform magnetic field that closes on itself.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide research experiences (as well as scientific authorship and presentation opportunities) for undergraduate students. Undergraduate research experiences in this small college environment tend to provide more comprehensive research skills training than comparable experiences at larger institutions, thereby contributing in significant ways to developing the future workforce in technical fields. Thanks to Lawrence's success in attracting women physics majors (27% of the physics graduates in the last 5 years) and increasing minority enrollment in the university (145% increase since 2000), the research will positively impact the engagement of underrepresented groups in the physics PhD pipeline. The apparatus will also be used to recruit promising high school students to the Lawrence University physics program and expose the campus and local communities to the subject of plasma physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Pure electron plasmas and other "non-neutral plasmas" are artificial systems that are not found in nature, but that provide important "wind tunnel" tests of theory in plasma and neutral fluid physics. An electron plasma is composed entirely of light, identical, negatively charged particles.  Holding such a collection in a stable equilibrium state seems challenging given that they all repel each other.  The situation is similar in some respects to trying to maintain a marble?s position on the back of an overturned spoon.  In fact, there is a mathematical theorem proving this is impossible to do with static electric fields.  However, when a uniform magnetic field is used, a cylindrical column of electron plasma can be confined almost indefinitely.   Intellectual merit of the project: Our project takes the challenge bit further and wraps the magnetic field into a torus (bagel-shape).  In this situation, individual electron orbits would exit the trap in about 100 microseconds.  We have shown that, in agreement with theoretical predictions, a collection of electrons (an electron plasma) in a toroidal magnetic field, by virtue of its own self-electric field (and the associated plasma flow it produces), is a dynamically stable equilibrium.  Prior support from NSF and DoE funded the construction of the Lawrence Non-neutral Torus II (shown in the figures) and the present project has pursued the physics behavior of this system, including the excitation of novel toroidal versions of plasma waves seen in cylindrical traps.  Broader impact of the project: The project has also funded research opportunities for undergraduate students.  Such opportunities are critical for introducing physics students to the research enterprise, to getting them excited about pursuing a research career, and for preparing them to enter top graduate programs.  During the period of this grant, eight students have done summer research and/or senior research projects associates with the project.  Most of those who have graduated, have gone on to graduate school at places like UC Santa Barbara, University of Rochester, Ludwig Maximilian University (Munich), and Montana State University.
