<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to use the Event Horizon telescope, a network of millimeter-wave antennas distributed throughout the world, to image the environs of SgrA*, the site of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.  The awardees will conduct a broad program of scientific research that includes analyzing (sub)mm VLBI observations, simulating theoretical models on Schwarzschild Radius  scales, and developing new software tools for VLBI analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach via high-school teacher hands-on experience and mentoring of pre-college students from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientists now believe that a supermassive black hole exists in the center of most galaxies.  The closest one, in the center of our own Milky Way, is Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), with an estimated mass of just over 4 million times that of the Sun.   This grant focused on laying the groundwork to take images of Sgr A* and the supermassive black hole in the nearby giant elliptical galaxy M87 in order to test Einstein's general relativity in the place where it is most likely to break down, immediately around a black hole.  This is extremely challenging due to the small scales involved: one Schwarzschild radius at the distance of Sgr A* is approximately the same angular size as a dime on the surface of the moon.  This award has led to significant increases in knowledge about the environment immediately around the event horizon of supermassive black holes.  We have laid the groundwork for future scientific breakthroughs via both theoretical work and next-generation instrumentation.  Young scientists trained in conjunction with this award have had great success in the next step of their career or education.  We have also disseminated results to the general public through a large range of different media.  We observed black holes in the centers of nearby galaxies, including our own Milky Way, at very high angular resolution in order to study black hole accretion and outflow in a strongly relativistic environment.  Using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a very long baseline interferometric array at a wavelength of approximately 1 millimeter, we discovered that the accretion flow around the Galactic Center black hole (Sgr A*) contains magnetic fields that exhibit a large degree of order.  This emission contains persistent asymmetric structure likely associated with an accretion flow seen at high inclination.  EHT observations of M87 allowed us to measure the size of the region emitting very-high-energy gamma rays.  We also explored how pending improvements to the EHT will enable imaging of Sgr A* and M87, allowing us to see and measure the black hole shadow predicted by Einstein's relativity.  Reconstructed images of simulated M87 data indicate that the EHT will soon have the sensitivity to detect a black hole shadow.  In the case of Sgr A*, two potential complicating factors are scattering due to the large number of free electrons along the line of sight and intrinsic variability on timescales of minutes.  We explored mitigation strategies and discovered that future EHT observations over multiple nights will be able to produce an averaged image that suppresses these effects.  The EHT capable of providing the data for these images is only a few years away.  In preparation for this era, we deployed new, wider-bandwidth instrumentation to EHT telescopes, including for the first time the Large Millimeter Telescope, a joint US-Mexican facility that is the world's largest single-dish telescope at millimeter wavelengths.  This new instrumentation---comprised of new downconverters, digital backends, and ultrafast recording systems---is undergoing commissioning thanks to observations taken during the March 2015 EHT observing run.  It is vital to train the next generation of scientists, and education was a significant part of this award.  We mentored a postdoctoral scholar, a visiting graduate student, three undergraduates, and a pre-college student from Puerto Rico, involving each of them in key aspects of research appropriate to their level.  Communicating with the general public is also an important part of science.  The principal investigator of this award explained the motivation behind the project and our results through a variety of media channels, including a television segment, a radio interview, a feature story in the New York Times, an article in Scientific American, and an "Ask Me Anything" feature on a popular internet site.  We also provide input for the Dark Star Diaries blog at Scientific American.       Last Modified: 10/26/2015...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
