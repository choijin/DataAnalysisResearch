<AbstractNarration>Williams College proposes to organize a workshop that focuses on developing and disseminating new tools and curricula for undergraduate courses in distributed systems and computer networks that leverage the resources available in publicly-accessible testbeds. Given the ubiquity of distributed systems, it is imperative that undergraduate computing education properly address their design and implementation. A key challenge today in teaching distributed systems at the college-level is providing students access to computing and networking resources distributed across the country and world. Educators have an opportunity to fill this gap using a variety of publicly-accessible testbed and cloud platforms now emerging in academia and industry. The 20-30 workshop attendees will come from a variety of institutions, including research universities, liberal arts colleges, and industry. The goal of the workshop is to identify a set of teaching materials that may be used at a broad cross-section of colleges and universities to provide undergraduates with the necessary background and motivation to become involved in systems research. The workshop will result in a report that details the participants' findings, as well as a website that aggregates the relevant educational material.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ I. Abstract  Distributed applications have become a core component of the Internet's infrastructure.  However, many undergraduate curricula do not offer courses that focus on the design and implementation of distributed systems. As a result, undergraduates are not as prepared as they should be for graduate study or careers in industry. Historically, the problem has often been caused by a lack of resources, since many schools do not have the computing infrastructure needed to experiment with distributed systems. However, with the growing availability and accessibility of academic and industrial distributed computing platforms, this is no longer true. Even colleges with limited on-campus computing facilities now have the ability to experiment with large-scale systems using state-of-the-art networking technologies. This workshop focused on developing and disseminating new tools and curricula for undergraduate courses in distributed systems and computer networks that leverage the resources available in publicly-accessible testbeds. The 31 attendees came from a variety of backgrounds, including top-tier research universities, liberal arts colleges, and industry.     II. Summary of Events  The workshop was held in conjunction with the fourteenth GENI Engineering Conference (GEC) in Boston, MA on July 8, 2012. Registration and accommodations for participants was handled jointly with the GEC. The workshop consisted primarily of presentations from researchers and educators, followed by a question and answer/discussion session. There is a workshop website that displays specific information about the workshop program, as well as slides from each speaker. It is available at http://www.cs.williams.edu/~jeannie/nsf-workshop.  There were three sessions at the workshop.  The main focus of the first session was to highlight some of the platforms available for hosting assignments. The platforms discussed included Seattle, ProtoGENI/Emulab, Amazon EC2, and ORCA.  The main focus of the second session was to summarize the experiences of educators at small colleges working primarily with undergraduate students. The speakers presented an overview of their courses on either Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, or Distributed Operating Systems, including sample projects, student performance, assigned textbooks and/or research papers, programming languages used, etc.  The main focus of the third session was to summarize the experiences of educators at larger universities. The key difference between the speakers in this session versus the previous session was that the projects were designed for (very) advanced undergraduates or graduate students.    III. Outcomes  Several common themes arose throughout the course of the day, both in the speakersÆ presentations and in followup discussions. They included:  Combine well-defined labs with open-ended projects.  Emphasize reading and writing scientific papers.  Emphasize breadth over depth.   Promote "learning by doing."  Expose students to wide-area debugging challenges. Expose students to low level development details in addition to high level design concepts of distributed systems. Help students learn to analyze system performance.      IV. Next Steps  In addition to the aforementioned outcomes, conversations and discussions at the workshop revealed the following important future directions for the community:  The need for the attendees to continue to work together to build a stronger community. Several conversations indicated that there was interest in gathering educators with more experience with courses in computer networks in addition to distributed systems. This will likely be held in October 2013. Continue to promote and advertise successful projects and course materials at major conferences and workshops, including SIGCOMM, OSDI, SOSP, NSDI, and SIGCSE.  Develop a website/wiki that could serve as a central portal for aggregating course materials and modules.      V. Summary   Overall, the worksh...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
