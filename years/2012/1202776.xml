<AbstractNarration>Title: The optics of avian cone oil droplets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The brilliantly colored oil droplets within the cone photoreceptors of birds have fascinated biologists since the dawn of microscopy, yet a conclusive understanding of their function has remained elusive. Located between the inner and outer segments, oil droplets are perfectly situated to filter and focus the light onto the photoreceptive visual pigment. Thus avian cone oil droplets may function as sophisticated photonic devices: (1) enhancing behavioral color discrimination by acting as long-pass spectral filters to modify the spectrum of light reaching the outer segment and (2) as focusing elements with a self-assembled liquid crystalline order optimized for light transmission within each different cone type. To test these hypotheses, the project will span the intersection of biology and physics combining molecular genetic manipulations of oil droplet pigmentation (via RNA interference) with behavioral tests of color vision, and advanced optical measurements (digital holographic microscopy) of the oil droplet molecular structure and light transmission. This project has broad implications because colorful cone oil droplets are an evolutionarily ancient adaptation to bright terrestrial environments shared by a diversity of animals. Understanding of the optical and behavioral function cone oil droplets has the potential to reveal previously unknown visual capabilities and adaptive mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training goals are to develop an understanding in, and technical competency with, molecular biological and optical physics approaches that will allow the fellow to build a research program at the intersection of biology, chemistry, and physics. Additionally, the fellow will receiving training in the communication of science to various audiences through written materials and formal and informal presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Default">Color vision plays an essential role in the lives of birds, from finding food to selecting mates, and the color discrimination abilities of birds far exceed our own human vision. However, how birds achieve their exceptional color vision abilities is not well understood, but is likely a product of the complex morphology of their eyes and photoreceptors. The cone photoreceptors of the avian retina contain brilliantly colored oil droplets pigmented with specific types of carotenoids that serve as matched spectral filters within the receptors. The goal of my fellowship research was to understand how this system of filters is produced and determine its functional role in avian vision. To do this I integrated techniques from biochemistry, molecular genetics, physiological modeling, and optical physics elucidate the enzymatic basis of carotenoid metabolism, the optics of the avian photoreceptor, and the color discrimination abilities of birds. I discovered that, among bird species, the carotenoid composition of the cone oil droplets varies to match and sensitivity of the visual pigments in the retina in a way that optimizes their abilities to discriminate color. I have identified the enzymes mediate carotenoid composition in the retina and my studies suggest that two distinct mechanisms of spectral tuning, carotenoid-based spectral filtering and visual pigment tuning, have co-evolved to optimize color vision in birds. With my collaborators, we have discovered that the cone oil droplets can act as micro-lenses that concentrate light into the photosensitive outer segments of the photoreceptors. However, this effect is only observed for droplets that lack pigmentation suggesting that birds are adapted for enhanced sensitivity to ultraviolet light. Taken together, my studies reveal the precision and complexity of the avian visual system which has been shaped by selection pressures for exquisite color discrimination in a complex world. NSF fellowship support has allowed me to pursue a broadly integrative research program, establish a network of collaborators at government and academic institutions within the United States and abroad, and receive training in a wide variety of approaches from molecular biology to optical physics. NSF fellowship support has also allowed me to pass along my training and serve as a research mentor to undergraduate students.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/29/2015<br>      Modified by: Matthew&nbsp;B&nbsp;Toomey</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1202776/1202776_10184456_1427651601434_Image23--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1202776/1202776_10184456_1427651601434_Image23--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Avian retina"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1202776/1202776_10184456_1427651601434_Image23--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Avian retina"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A micrograph of a flat mounted bird retina showing the brilliantly colored  oil droplets contained within the cone photoreceptors.</div> <div class="imageCredit">M.
