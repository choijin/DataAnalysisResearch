<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: The ocean serves an immense reservoir of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and other elements required for all life. The active and diverse microbial populations that inhabit the oceans are responsible for mediating nutrient transformations that maintain the chemistry of seawater. A recent study identified a ubiquitous group of marine bacteria from the Arctic96BD-19 gamma-proteobacterial sulfur oxidizer (GSO) lineage that is closely related to known sulfur oxidizing species that fix inorganic carbon and oxidize sulfide in low-oxygen waters. The potential for GSOs to use reduced forms of sulfur in oxygenated waters suggests that they are a keystone species that link the marine carbon and sulfur cycles. The only known isolates from the Arctic96BD-19 lineage of GSOs are now in culture, allowing fundamental questions about their roles in carbon and sulfur cycling to be investigated.  Preliminary data suggest that they use energy from the oxidation of sulfur to assimilate carbon. This project seek to address the overarching hypothesis that sulfur transformations provide the Arctic96BD- 19 lineage of GSOs with energy for organic and inorganic carbon cycling throughout the water column. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three specific hypotheses will be tested.&lt;br/&gt;1. Arctic96BD-19 cells assimilate either organic carbon or fixes inorganic carbon, depending on environmental conditions.&lt;br/&gt;2. Arctic96BD-19 cells oxidize thiosulfate via formation of a tetrathionate intermediate, or using the branched thiosulfate oxidation pathway.&lt;br/&gt;3. Arctic96BD-19 cells are ubiquitous sulfur oxidizers that assimilate organic and inorganic carbon through the Pacific Northwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A combination of laboratory growth studies of the investigator's pure cultures and comparative genomic analyses will be used. The genomic data will be used to determine whether the Arctic96BD-19 cultures possess the genetic potential to oxidize reduced sulfur to sulfate (based on possession of known core and ancillary sulfur oxidation genes), which potential oxidation pathways are used, and whether they can fix inorganic carbon. These data will help guide the physiology studies by determining the most likely forms of inorganic and organic compounds that can be utilized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Marine bacteria are critical players in global nutrient cycles, but many of their individual and community functions in the ecosystem are not well understood. Future oceanographers will need to use cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent methods to identify metabolic process that shape microbial communities and impact biogeochemical cycles. A female graduate student and two undergraduate students will be trained to use molecular and physiological data to address hypotheses. Additionally, this project will increase national exposure of ocean sciences through digital films that introduce students (particularly ages 15 to 20) to unique and exciting aspects of oceanographic research. A cross-college collaboration between the UW College of the Environment and the College of Arts and Sciences will train Master of Communication in Digital Media students to produce short films that encourage interest in oceanography among young people. Student education, scientific advancement, and public awareness are all important components of this project.</AbstractNarration>
