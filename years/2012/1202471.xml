<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to transform the observed 2-3 orders-of-magnitude enhancement of two-photon absorption (2PA) in direct bandgap semiconductors using extremely non-degenerate (END) frequencies into photonics device technologies.  In the proposed research, radically new device ideas for optical detection and switching will be explored that are made possible by this new discovery. This research is transformative in that the enhanced 2PA results in improved performance, and the types of devices made possible are new and unique. END 2PA greatly decreases the required irradiances needed for such devices.  The combination of huge enhancements in 2PA and nonlinear refraction opens up a new realm of possibilities for photonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         The intellectual merit is that using END nonlinearities for photonic device applications allows a large reduction in the irradiances needed for nonlinear optical devices. This opens up a new realm of 2PA-based devices as well as great potential for improvement on existing 2-photon based devices.  This research will help determine the ultimate limits for these types of nonlinear photonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The broader impacts are, besides funding the training of two Ph.D. students who will benefit from the rigorous graduate curriculum in Optics and Photonics at CREOL, that the large increase in nonlinear response enabled by END configurations has the potential to impact several fields beyond nonlinear optics, including detection and imaging, telecommunications and semiconductor lasers.  The PIs also aim to increase the number of students from under-represented groups making use of the many connections and programs offered by our university.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research program has focused on the applications of the strongly enhanced two-photon absorption (2PA) that occurs when the frequencies of the two photons are very different (ratio of photon energies ~10).  We refer to this regime of enhancement as Extremely Nondegenerate (END) 2PA.  Two photon absorption of a laser beam occurs in a semiconductor when the photon energy is less than the absorption edge (bandgap) but greater than half of the bandgap so that the sum of the photon energies is enough that the semiconductor can absorb both at once; however, it only has a significant occurrence when the input intensity is sufficient.  When generalizing to two photon absorption using two beams of different colors (photon energies), we require that the sum of the energies of the two photons is enough for the semiconductor to simultaneously absorb both photons (one has a low energy, e.g. infrared, and the other has a high energy, e.g. ultraviolet dependent on the gap).  When the infrared beam, IR, is much weaker than the ultraviolet, UV, the probability that the IR beam will be absorbed in a 2PA process will increase if the stream of UV photons is stronger, i.e. more intense. This process of using very different colors for the two beams is more efficient (100x-1,000x) than using two photons with the same color.   One of the first inventions we made using this strong enhancement was an IR detector using a wide bandgap semiconductor, i.e. one that doesn?t start absorbing until the UV.  We essentially flood the detector with near UV photons that don?t get absorbed by themselves, but whenever one of the IR photons comes along, it can pair up with an UV photon and they both get absorbed, thus creating a photodetector current.  This actually works better for detecting ultrashort optical pulses than standard IR detectors which must be cooled.  In addition, since we know when our near UV pulses are created and hit the semiconductor, we can also use this to tell how far the infrared photons have traveled, and thus we can use this for ranging or so-called LIDAR imaging to make 3-D images of objects at a distance. Figures 1 and 2 show an image of the surface of a US dime at ~1 m distance and of a semiconductor column buried in a device respectively.  In addition to this enhanced 2PA, associated with any absorption is refraction. Thus, there is a nonlinear refraction associated with the 2PA that makes a flat surface semiconductor act as a lens at high intensity inputs.  We have measured this effect in multiple semiconductors and it agrees with the theory we developed. Both the 2PA and the nonlinear refraction can be used to make all-optical switches which we have also worked on during this research.   We have also developed a theory for the 2PA in engineered semiconductor structures called multiple quantum wells (MQWs) and predict an additional 10x enhancement beyond the 2 to 3 orders of magnitude already observed for END 2PA.  Lastly, we performed a preliminary experiment where we excited the semiconductors as is done to produce normal semiconductor lasers and observed two-photon gain as opposed to 2PA, i.e. the photon number increases after the semiconductor as opposed to decreases.  Thus the semiconductor simultaneously emits 2 photons of very different frequencies. This presents the future possibility of making a two-photon laser.  Multiple graduate students have contributed to this research and learned about the exciting possibilities of this END 2PA and possibly gain.  Specifically, two students partially supported by this project have obtained their PhDs where a significant portion of their dissertations was on END 2PA photonics. These students have also been involved with the publication of multiple journal articles as well as giving many talks at international conferences.     Figures 1 and 2 show an image of the surface of a US dime at ~1 m distance and of a semiconductor column buried in a device respectively.
