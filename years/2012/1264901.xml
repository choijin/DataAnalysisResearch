<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project involves an interview study designed to better measure innovativeness in engineering students.  The project explores multiple factors that contribute to innovation in engineering and more specifically to student innovativeness. The study seeks to determine which factors are innate (linked to cognitive style) and which can be changed or enhanced in a well designed degree program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises from the currently recognized importance of innovation in engineering on the prosperity of the United States.  The project involves multiple stakeholders from different sections of the economy, and plans effective outreach strategies to disseminate results to these stakeholders.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Defining and Measuring Engineering Innovativeness   The use of science and engineering skills to address the social and economic challenges of modern society is an essential strategy for the future prosperity of the United States as a nation of innovators and of innovations. Many of the studies on innovators, however, are not specific to a specialized field such as engineering. Through over 50 in-depth interviews with engineering innovators, a focus group of 13 engineering educators and entrepreneurs, and a consensus-seeking process with 150 expert engineering innovators, this research project explored engineers? views of innovation and the attributes, preferences and skills of engineering innovators. After identifying the key characteristics of engineering innovators, the research team developed an instrument for measuring engineering innovativeness.   This research advances the critical understanding of innovativeness among engineers in industry, entrepreneurial ventures, and academia. We further identified those engineering innovator characteristics most important in each phase (creation, development and implementation) of the innovation process.  Identifying the characteristics of engineering innovativeness has implications for the hiring, training and professional development of engineers, for engineering team formation and engineering team management, for the education of student engineers, and for programs, policies and interventions aimed at supporting innovative behavior by engineers.
