<AbstractNarration>This project proposes to make significant improvements to WeBWorK's NPL, and build a community of faculty around the country to maintain and curate the future role of the NPL (National Public Library), which is a collection of over 25,000 homework problems that are distributed with WeBWorK.  WeBWorK, a web-based homework system used by over 300 schools, is an open-source system, developed and maintained by mathematicians. It is supported by the Mathematics Association of America (MAA).  Additional outcomes of the project are improving the organization of NPL problems and developing software tools to facilitate easy access to the NPL.   Upon completion, mathematics instructors will be able to search the library more easily for problems of the type they want.  Both the NPL and the accompanying software promote the improvement of teaching and enhance the infrastructure for education in mathematics.  Moreover, the project fosters mathematics faculty development by making a new tool accessible for effective mathematics teaching.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was to update the WeBWorK Open Problem Library (OPL).  WeBWorK is an open source web-based homework system that is used by hundreds of colleges and universities, and tens of thousands of students, across the United States.  Problems in the WeBWorK system can take various forms, including multiple choice and true/false, and can also interpret numerical answers and functions.  The WeBWorK system randomly generates similar versions of a given problem for each student, and provides immediate feedback on the correctness of student answers.   The OPL consists of problems written by teachers, primarily mathematics, but also statistics and engineering.  Each WeBWorK problem is a small computer program, written in a combination of LaTeX and Perl.  The program specifies the questions asked, the portions to be randomized, and the answer.  Prior to the start of this project, the organization of the OPL was haphazard, with incorrectly classified problems and considerable duplication.  There was only an informal administrative structure in place to curate the OPL.  The central activity of this project was to support a series of workshops (seven in all) involving faculty who use WeBWorK.   These workshops lasted 3-4 days each, and involved between 10 and 20 participants apiece.  The budget was stretched by holding the workshops are the University of Virginia and Arizona State University (the PI's home institutions) where there was access to workshop facilities at no cost.    During each workshop, participants completely revised the taxonomy (organization structure) of the OPL and processed over 41,000 problems.  The problem processing required special expertise and was labor intensive.  For each problem, it included updating the search indexing information, correcting problem code as needed, classifying problems based on difficulty level, and identifying other similar problems to include in cohorts to make searching more efficient for users.  Participants also worked collectively to completely revise the problem taxonomy structure, to appoint an OPL Editorial Board to curate the OPL in the future, and to develop policies for problem authors to submit problems to the OPL.    The project was fully successful.  The original proposal stated that the project would consist of four workshops and process 25,000 problems.  As noted above, there were seven workshops and over 41,000 problems processed.  New software was developed and merged into WeBWorK to improve OPL usability, and there is now an administrative structure in place to insure that the OPL continues to improve.
