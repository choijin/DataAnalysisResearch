<AbstractNarration>The project is a follow-on to the discovery that there are very young UHP rocks exposed on islands near the eastern tip of Papua New Guinea (PNG).  A major objective is to use detailed study of this area to better understand how UHP rocks get to the surface from great depth.  Because the rocks are in a tectonically active region, it can be argued that there is a good chance of improving models for UHP exhumation because this example is still in its tectonic context.  There is evidence that the process is ongoing.  Related to this objective is the study of the overall tectonic evolution of this area, which is needed in order to help understand how the UHP rocks got where they are and from whence they came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this framework, this project involves a range of studies that can contribute to piecing together the UHP exhumation history and the tectonic evolution.  One large study involves passive seismic data acquisition to image the crust and mantle beneath the area where partially exhumed HP/UHP rocks may occur at depth;  a large fraction of the studies involve petrology, geology, mineral physics and geochemistry.  In addition, GPS work and geodynamic modeling are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was part of a multi-disciplinary study involving five different universities on the topic of how incipient continental rifting is expressed by basin formation, magmatism, and the exposure of lower crustal rocks.  In Papua New Guinea, the Woodlark oceanic spreading ridge is propagating into continental crust that makes up the land areas and intervening marine basins of the Papuan Peninsula and D'Entrecasteaux Islands.  This remote tropical area is one of five in the world where an active rift system is propagating into continenal crust and therefore provides a valuable modern analog for understanding how much larger and more mature ocean basins like the Altantic began to form.  Another interesting aspect of the area that was the object of our study and other researchers in our multi-disciplinary group was the history of lower crustal metamorphic rocks exposed in large metamorphic domes that reach topographic elevations up to 2 km above sea level within the area of incipient continental rifting.  The study of my group specifically focussed on the history of the offshore marine basins within the incipient rift zone and surrounding the metamorphic domes as well as some localized areas of uplifted marine Neogene rocks and uplifted late Quaternary coral reefs.  Our study of the offshore basins involved a systematic study of all offshore seismic reflection data tied to a few offshore wells and correlated wih onland outcrops.  These data allowed us to interpret the distribution, thickness and mechanism for the formation of both the onland and offshore basins.  These observations are critical for the geologic understanding of the area as these younger sedimentary rocks were deposited during the incipient rifting process and therefore their ages, thickness variations and facies constrain the rifting process itself.  Our main results include the following: 1) there are two zones of basins in the incipient rift area that are distinct and formed by different tectonic processes; 2) a northern basin, the Trobriand trough, formed as an Oligocene to recent forearc basin that preceded and was coeval with the incipient rifting that began to affect the area in Late Miocene time; a southern basin, the Goodenough basin, formed as late Miocene to recent hanging wall block adjadent to the Owen Stanley oblique-slip fault zone bounding its southern edge; 3) the zone of metamorphic core complexes bounds the southern edge of the Trobriand trough and the northern edge of the Goodenough basin; from the offshore data, we see no evidence for low-angle normal faults controlling the locations or uplift of the metamorphic domes as proposed by previous workers; instead these domes appear to have formed as diapiric intrusions of lower crustal material into upper crustal rocks; 4) the belt of metamorphic domes is colinear with a late Quaternary volcanic chain; uplift of subduction related melts may have contributed to the inferred diapiric rise of the metamorphic domes; 5) the Owen-Stanley fault zone is now the most active western extension of Woodlark spreading system in continental crust of eastern Papua New Guinea; we can verify its activity by a combination of the offshore study of seismic profiles and study of dated corals uplifted on the footwall of the fault zone; and 6) early rifting in the late Miocene is spatially related to the triggering of the late Miocene exposure and erosion of the metamorphic domes; how this process occurred at depth remains a puzzle but is being addressed by other members of our multi-discipinary group.
