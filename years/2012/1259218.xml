<AbstractNarration>Mapping and sampling of a portion of the mid-Atlantic spreading center, where a unique geochemical signature was determined for a 1980's 'popping rock' sample, will take advantage of recent recognition that tectonic deformation may play a role in focusing volatile fluxing from the mantle. Geophysical mapping, targeted sampling by ROV, and a complete suite of post-cruise geochemical analyses aim to determine whether the early quantification of mantle volatiles was representative for the region and/or whether such signatures cluster only near faults, thus implying localized fluxing. Such finding could uproot long-standing inferences about background mantle volatile contents. Students will be introduced to marine research and a postdoc will delve into a new aspect of spreading center processes. Collaboration with IPGP France will train these young scientists in integrated, international, interdisciplinary geoscience.</AbstractNarration>

This is important because it implies that the popping rocks were produced by gas accumulation and therefore may not be directly used to infer (solid) mantle gas concentrations. This research provided important research opportunities for a number of early career scientists, and was the focus of two Master's degrees (Boise State University, University of Idaho), two Ph.D. theses (MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography, Institut de Physique du Globe) and two Postdoctoral Research projects (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution).   The seagoing research, particularly the combined use of a human occupied vehicle with an autonomous underwater vehicle, provided unique research and career growth opportunities for all the participants.
